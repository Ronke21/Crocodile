<text> (; ; &quot;Lazio Sport Club&quot;) is an Italian professional sports club based in Rome, most known for its football activity. The society, founded in 1900, plays in the Serie A and have spent most of their history in the top tier of Italian football. Lazio have been Italian champions twice (1974, 2000), and have won the Coppa Italia seven times, the Supercoppa Italiana three times, and both the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and UEFA Super Cup on one occasion.

The club had their first major success in 1958, winning the domestic cup. In 1974, they won their first Serie A title. The 1990s were the most successful period in Lazio&#x27;s history, with the team reaching the UEFA Cup final in 1998, winning the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1999, and clinching the Serie A title in 2000. Due to a severe economic crisis in 2002 that forced president Sergio Cragnotti out of the club along with several star players being sold, Lazio&#x27;s success in the league declined. In spite of the lower funds, the club has won four Coppa Italia titles since then; in 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2019. Current president Claudio Lotito took charge of the club in 2004, filling the vacuum that had existed following Cragnotti&#x27;s departure.

Lazio&#x27;s traditional kit colours are sky blue shirts and white shorts with white socks; the colours are reminiscent of Rome&#x27;s ancient Hellenic legacy. Sky blue socks have also been interchangeably used as home colours. Their home is the 70,634 capacity Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which they share with Roma. Lazio have a long-standing rivalry with Roma, with whom they have contested the &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot; (in English &quot;Derby of the capital city&quot; or Rome derby) since 1929.

Despite initially not having any parent–subsidiary relation with the male and female professional team (that was incorporated as S.S. Lazio S.p.A.), the founding of allowed for the club that participates in over 40 different sports disciplines in total.

==History==
&quot;Società Podistica Lazio&quot; was founded on 9 January 1900 in the Prati district of Rome. Until 1910, the club played at an amateur level until it officially joined the league competition in 1912 as soon as the Italian Football Federation began organising championships in the center and south of Italy, and reached the final of the national championship playoff three times, but never won, losing in 1913 to Pro Vercelli, in 1914 to Casale and in 1923 to Genoa 1893. In 1927, Lazio was the only major Roman club which resisted the Fascist regime&#x27;s attempts to merge all the city&#x27;s teams into what would become Roma the same year. The club played in the first organised Serie A in 1929 and, led by legendary Italian striker Silvio Piola, achieved a second-place finish in 1937 – its highest pre-war result.

The 1950s produced a mix of mid and upper table results, with a Coppa Italia win in 1958. Lazio was relegated for the first time in 1961 to Serie B, but returned in the top flight two years later. After a number of mid-table placements, another relegation followed in 1970–71. Back to Serie A in 1972–73, Lazio immediately emerged as surprise challengers for the &quot;Scudetto&quot; to Milan and Juventus in 1972–73, only losing out on the final day of the season, with a team comprising captain Giuseppe Wilson, as well as midfielders Luciano Re Cecconi and Mario Frustalupi, striker Giorgio Chinaglia, and head coach Tommaso Maestrelli. Lazio improved such successes the following season, ensuring its first title in 1973–74. However, tragic deaths of Re Cecconi and &quot;Scudetto&quot; trainer Maestrelli, as well as the departure of Chinaglia, would be a triple blow for Lazio. The emergence of Bruno Giordano during this period provided some as he finished League top scorer in 1979, when Lazio finished eighth.

Lazio were forcibly relegated to Serie B in 1980, due to a remarkable scandal concerning illegal bets on their own matches, along with Milan. They remained in Italy&#x27;s second division for three seasons, in what would mark the darkest period in Lazio&#x27;s history. They would return in 1983 and manage a last-day escape from relegation the following season. The 1984–85 season would prove harrowing, with a pitiful 15 points and bottom place finish.

In 1986, Lazio was hit with a nine-point deduction (a true back in the day of the two-point win) for a betting scandal involving player Claudio Vinazzani. An epic struggle against relegation followed the same season in Serie B, with the club led by trainer Eugenio Fascetti only avoiding relegation to the Serie C after play-off wins over Taranto and Campobasso. This would prove a turning point in the club&#x27;s history, with Lazio returning to Serie A in 1988 and, under the careful financial management of Gianmarco Calleri, the consolidation of the club&#x27;s position as a solid top-flight club.

The arrival of Sergio Cragnotti in 1992 changed the club&#x27;s history, due to his long-term investments in new players to make the team a &quot;Scudetto&quot; competitor. A notable early transfer during his tenure was the capture of English midfielder Paul Gascoigne from Tottenham Hotspur for £5.5 million. Gascoigne&#x27;s transfer to Lazio is credited with the increase of interest in Serie A in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. Cragnotti repeatedly broke transfer records in pursuit of players who were considered major stars – Juan Sebastián Verón for £18 million, Christian Vieri for £19 million and breaking the world transfer record, albeit only for a matter of weeks, to sign Hernán Crespo from Parma for £35 million.

Lazio were Serie A runners-up in 1995, third in 1996 and fourth in 1997, then losing the championship just by one point to Milan on the last championship&#x27;s match in 1999 before, with the likes of Siniša Mihajlović, Alessandro Nesta, Marcelo Salas and Pavel Nedvěd in the side, winning its second &quot;Scudetto&quot; in 2000, as well as the Coppa Italia double with Sven-Göran Eriksson (1997–2001) as manager.

Lazio had two more Coppa Italia triumphs in 1998 and 2004, as well as the last UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1999. They also reached the UEFA Cup final, but lost 0–3 against Internazionale. In addition, Lazio won the Supercoppa Italiana twice and defeated Manchester United in 1999 to win the UEFA Super Cup. In 2000, Lazio became also the first Italian football club to be quoted on the Italian Piazza Affari stock market.

With money running out, Lazio&#x27;s results slowly worsened in the years. In 2002, a financial scandal involving Cragnotti and his food products multinational Cirio forced him to leave the club, and Lazio was controlled until 2004 by caretaker financial managers and a bank pool. This forced the club to sell their star players and even fan favourite captain Alessandro Nesta. In 2004, entrepreneur Claudio Lotito acquired the majority of the club. In 2006, the club qualified to the 2006–07 UEFA Cup under coach Delio Rossi. The club, however, was excluded from European competitions due to their involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal.

In the 2006–07 season, despite a later-reduced points deduction, Lazio achieved a third-place finish, thus gaining qualification to the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, where they defeated Dinamo București to reach the group phase, and ended fourth place in the group composed of Real Madrid, Werder Bremen and Olympiacos. Things in the league did not go much better, with the team spending most of the season in the bottom half of the table, sparking the protests of the fans, and eventually ending the Serie A season in 12th place. In the 2008–09 season, Lazio won their fifth Coppa Italia, beating Sampdoria in the final.

Lazio started the 2009–10 season playing the Supercoppa Italiana against Inter in Beijing and winning the match 2–1, with goals from Matuzalém and Tommaso Rocchi. Lazio won the 2012–13 Coppa Italia 1–0 over rivals Roma, with the lone goal coming from Senad Lulić. Lazio won the 2018–19 Coppa Italia 2–0 over Atalanta, winning their seventh title overall.

==Colours, badge and nicknames==
Lazio&#x27;s colours of white and sky blue were inspired by the national emblem of Greece, due to the fact that Lazio is a mixed sports club this was chosen in recognition of the fact that the Ancient Olympic Games and along with it the sporting tradition in Europe is linked to Greece.

Originally, Lazio wore a shirt which was divided into white and sky blue quarters, with black shorts and socks. After a while of wearing a plain white shirt very early on, Lazio reverted to the colours which they wear today. Some seasons Lazio have used a sky blue and white shirt with stripes, but usually it is sky blue with a white trim, with the white shorts and socks. The club&#x27;s colours have led to their Italian nickname of &quot;Biancocelesti&quot;.

Lazio&#x27;s traditional club badge and symbol is the eagle, which was chosen by founding member Luigi Bigiarelli. A symbol of the Roman legions and emperor, it was chosen to represent power and victory; it also identifies the club with its origin city. Lazio&#x27;s use of the symbol has led to two of their nicknames; &quot;le Aquile&quot; (&quot;the Eagles&quot;) and &quot;gli Aquilotti&quot; (&quot;the Young Eagles&quot;). The current club badge features a golden eagle above a white shield with a blue border; inside the shield is the club&#x27;s name and a smaller tripartite shield with the colours of the club.

==Stadium==
Stadio Olimpico, located on the Foro Italico, is the major stadium of Rome. It is the home of the Italy national football team as well as of both local teams Lazio and Roma. It was opened in 1937 and after its latest renovation in 2008, the stadium has a capacity of 70,634 seats. It was the site of the 1960 Summer Olympics, but has also served as the location of the 1987 World Athletics Championships, the 1980 European Championship final, the 1990 World Cup and the Champions League Final in 1996 and 2009.

Also on the Foro Italico lies the Stadio dei Marmi, or &quot;marble stadium&quot;, which was built in 1932 and designed by Enrico Del Debbio. It has tiers topped by 60 white marble statues that were gifts from Italian cities in commemoration of 60 athletes.

During the 1989–90 season, Lazio and Roma played their games at the Stadio Flaminio of Rome, located in the district Flaminio, because of the renovation works carried out at the Stadio Olimpico.
In June 2018, Lazio President Claudio Lotito stated that &quot;Lazio should be granted the same favour and treatment as Roma – the ability to also build a new stadium. He also added that &quot;Lazio&#x27;s stadium will be built before Roma&#x27;s stadium.&quot;

In June 2019, Lazio President Claudio Lotito was set to present the designs of a potential future stadium for Lazio, named the Stadio delle Aquile. However, this did not occur for reasons unknown.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Lazio is the sixth-most supported football club in Italy and the second in Rome, with around 2% of Italian football fans supporting the club (according to &quot;La Repubblica&#x27;s&quot; research of August 2008). Historically, the largest section of Lazio supporters in the city of Rome has come from the far northern section, creating an arch-like shape across Rome with affluent areas such as Parioli, Prati, Flaminio, Cassia and Monte Mario.

Founded in 1987, &quot;Irriducibili Lazio&quot; were the club&#x27;s biggest ultras group for over 30 years. They typically create traditional Italian ultra displays during the &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot; (Rome Derby), the match between Lazio and their main rivals, Roma. It is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world, such as where Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli was killed at one of the derby games during the 1979–80 season after being hit in the eye by an emergency rocket thrown by a Roma fan. A minority of Lazio&#x27;s ultras used to use swastikas and fascist symbols on their banners, and they have displayed racist behaviour in several occasions during the derbies. Most notably, at a derby of the season 1998–99, laziali unfurled a 50-metre banner around the Curva Nord that read, &quot;Auschwitz is your town, the ovens are your houses&quot;. Black players of Roma have often been receivers of racist and offensive behaviour. After 33 years, the Irriducibili disbanded on 27 February 2020, citing &quot;too much blood, too many banning orders, too many arrests.&quot; Lazio&#x27;s ultras now go by the name &quot;Ultras Lazio&quot;. Lazio also have a strong rivalry with Napoli and Livorno, as well as with Pescara and Atalanta. The club also maintains strong competitive rivalries with Fiorentina, Juventus and Milan.

Conversely, the ultras have friendly relationships with Internazionale, Triestina and Hellas Verona. Internationally, Lazio&#x27;s fans maintain a long-standing strong friendship with the supporters of the Bulgarian club Levski Sofia and as such, Lazio were invited to participate in the centenary football match honouring the birthday of the Bulgarian club.

==Statistics and records==

Ștefan Radu holds Lazio&#x27;s official appearance record, having played 416 appearances. The record for total appearances by a goalkeeper is held by Luca Marchegiani, with 339 appearances, while the record for most league appearances is held by Aldo Puccinelli with 339.

The all-time leading goalscorer for Lazio is Ciro Immobile, with 206 goals scored, followed by Silvio Piola with 159 goals. Piola, who played also with Pro Vercelli, Torino, Juventus and Novara, is also the highest goalscorer in Serie A history, with 274 goals. Immobile is also the all-time top goalscorer in European competitions, with 26 goals.

Officially, Lazio&#x27;s highest home attendance is approximately 80,000 for a Serie A match against Foggia on 12 May 1974, the match that awarded to Lazio their first &quot;Scudetto&quot;. This is also the record for the Stadio Olimpico, including matches held by Roma and the Italy national football team.

==Società Sportiva Lazio as a company==
In 1998, during Sergio Cragnotti&#x27;s period in charge as the chairman, Società Sportiva Lazio S.p.A. became a listed company: Lazio were the first Italian club to do so. However, Cragnotti resigned as chairman in 2001, after a &quot;huge hole in the budget&quot; of the club.

Claudio Lotito, the current chairman of Lazio, purchased the club from Cragnotti in 2004, but owned just 26.969% of shares as the largest shareholders at that time. It was followed by banking group Capitalia (and its subsidiaries Mediocredito Centrale, Banca di Roma and Banco di Sicilia) as the second largest shareholders for 17.717%. Capitalia also hold 49% stake of Italpetroli (via Capitalia&#x27;s subsidiary Banca di Roma), the parent company of city rival Roma (via Italpetroli&#x27;s subsidiary &quot;Roma 2000&quot;). Lotito later purchased the minority stake from Capitalia.

, Claudio Lotito owns just over two-thirds of the shares of Lazio. Lazio is one of only three Italian clubs listed on the Borsa Italiana, the others being Juventus and Roma. In the past, Lazio was the only one with a single primary share holder (Lotito). However, following several capital increases by Roma and Juventus, they also are significantly owned by a shareholder. According to The Football Money League, published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2004–05 season, Lazio was the 20th highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €83 million; the 2005 ranking of the club was 15th. However, in 2016 ranking (the rank used data in 2014–15 season), Lazio was not in the top 20.

Lazio was one of the few clubs that self-sustain from the financial support of a shareholder, and also consistently make an aggregate profit after every season. Unlike Internazionale, Roma and Milan, who were sanctioned by UEFA due to breaches of Financial Fair Play, Lazio passed the regulations held by the administrative body with the high achievements. Lotito also received a prize that joint awarded by Associazione Italiana Allenatori Calcio and DGS Sport&amp;Cultura, due to Lazio&#x27;s financial health.

In 2017, the club renewed their sponsorship deal with shirt manufacturer Macron. It was worth €16 million a season, plus variables of about €9 million stemming from league and European competition finishes.

In February 2022, Lazio announced that they had parted ways with Macron after 10 years. Mizuno would become the team&#x27;s new sportswear and technical gear provider, with the Biancocelesti receiving €20 million over the next five years as a result of their new agreement with the Japanese company.

In March 2022, Lazio released their financial reports from June to December 2021 which showed a decrease in revenue (from €106.66 to €71.56 million) but an increase in profit (from -€0.12 million to €4.6 million) compared to the previous six months.

<doc id="28990" wikidata="Q1269112" url="?curid=28990" title="Ninian">
<text>Ninian is a Christian saint, first mentioned in the 8th century as being an early missionary among the Pictish peoples of what is now Scotland. For this reason he is known as the Apostle to the Southern Picts, and there are numerous dedications to him in those parts of Scotland with a Pictish heritage, throughout the Scottish Lowlands, and in parts of Northern England with a Northumbrian heritage. He is also known as Ringan in Scotland, and as Trynnian in Northern England.

Ninian&#x27;s major shrine was at Whithorn in Galloway, where he is associated with the Candida Casa (Latin for &#x27;White House&#x27;). Nothing is known about his teachings, and there is no unchallenged authority for information about his life.

Ninian&#x27;s identity is uncertain, and historians have identified the name &quot;Ninian&quot; with other historical figures. A popular hypothesis proposed by Thomas Owen Clancy, a researcher and professor of Celtic studies, posits that Ninian can be identified with three other historical figures: Saint Finnian of Moville, Saint Finnian of Clonard, and Saint Finbarr of Cork. Linguistic variations across the territories associated with each saint have provided evidence that the Ninian preserved in literary tradition originated from this individual. This article discusses the particulars and origins of what has come to be known as the &quot;traditional&quot; stories of Saint Ninian.

==Background==
The Southern Picts, for whom Ninian is held to be the apostle, were the Picts south of the mountains known as the Mounth, which cross Scotland north of the Firths of Clyde and Forth. That they had once been Christian is known from a 5th-century mention of them by Saint Patrick in his &quot;Letter to Coroticus&quot;, where he refers to them as &#x27;apostate Picts&#x27;. Patrick could not have been referring to the Northern Picts who were converted by Saint Columba in the 6th century because they were not yet Christian, and thus could not be called &#x27;apostate&#x27;. Northumbria had established a bishopric among the Southern Picts at Abercorn in 681, under Bishop Trumwine. This effort was abandoned shortly after the Picts defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685.

Christianity had flourished in Galloway in the 6th century. By the time of Bede&#x27;s account in 731, the Northumbrians had enjoyed an unbroken relationship with Galloway for a century or longer, beginning with the Northumbrian predecessor state of Bernicia. The full nature of the relationship is uncertain. Also at this time, Northumbria was establishing bishoprics in its sphere of influence, to be subordinate to the Northumbrian Archbishop of York. One such bishopric was established at Whithorn in 731, and Bede&#x27;s account serves to support the legitimacy of the new Northumbrian bishopric. The Bernician name &quot;hwit ærn&quot; is Old English for the Latin &quot;candida casa&quot;, or &#x27;white house&#x27; in modern English, and it has survived as the modern name of Whithorn.

There is as yet no unchallenged connection of the historical record to the person who was Bede&#x27;s Ninian. However, the unlikelihood that the reputable historian Bede invented Ninian without some basis in the historical record, combined with an increased knowledge of Ireland&#x27;s early saints and Whithorn&#x27;s early Christian connections, has led to serious scholarly efforts to find Bede&#x27;s basis. James Henthorn Todd, in his 1855 publication of the &quot;Leabhar Imuinn&quot; (The Book of Hymns of the Ancient Church of Ireland), suggested that it was Finnian of Moville, and that view has gained traction among modern scholars.

==Traditional story==
The earliest mention of Ninian of Whithorn is in a short passage of &quot;The Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; by the Northumbrian monk Bede in . The 8th-century poem &quot;Miracula Nyniae Episcopi&quot; records some of the miracles attributed to him. A &quot;Life of Saint Ninian&quot; (&quot;Vita Sancti Niniani&quot;) was written around 1160 by Ailred of Rievaulx, and in 1639 James Ussher discusses Ninian in his &quot;Brittanicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates&quot;. These are the sources of information about Ninian of Whithorn, and all provide seemingly innocuous personal details about his life. However, there is no unchallenged historical evidence to support any of their stories, and all sources had political and religious agendas that were served by their accounts of Saint Ninian (discussed below).

Tradition holds that Ninian was a Briton who had studied in Rome, that he established an episcopal see at the &quot;Candida Casa&quot; in Whithorn, that he named the see for Saint Martin of Tours, that he converted the southern Picts to Christianity, and that he is buried at Whithorn. Variations of the story add that he had actually met St Martin, that his father was a Christian king, and that he was buried in a stone sarcophagus near the altar of his church. Further variations assert that he left for Ireland, and died there in 432. Dates for his birth are derived from the traditional mention of St Martin, who died in 397.

===Bede ()===
Bede says that Ninian (whose name he only renders in the ablative case &quot;Nynia&quot;) was a Briton who had been instructed in Rome; that he made his church of stone, which was unusual among the Britons; that his episcopal see was named after Saint Martin of Tours; that he preached to and converted the southern Picts; that his base was called &quot;Ad Candidam Casam&quot;, which was in the province of the Bernicians; and that he was buried there, along with many other saints.

===Aelred ()===
Leaving aside the stories regarding miracles, in the &quot;Vita Sancti Niniani&quot; Aelred includes the following incidental information regarding Saint Ninian: that his father was a Christian king; that he was consecrated a bishop in Rome and that he met Saint Martin in Tours; that Saint Martin sent masons with him on his homeward journey, at his request; that these masons built a church of stone, situated on the shore, and that on learning of Saint Martin&#x27;s death, Ninian dedicated the church to him; that a certain rich and powerful &quot;King Tuduvallus&quot; was converted by him; that he died after having converted the Picts and returned home, being buried in a stone sarcophagus near the altar of his church; and that he had once travelled with his brother, named &quot;Plebia&quot;.

Aelred said that in addition to finding information about Ninian in Bede, he took much additional information for his &quot;Life of S. Ninian&quot; from a source written in a &quot;barbarous language&quot;; there is no further information about this text. Aelred wrote his &quot;Life of S. Ninian&quot; sometime after spending ten years at the Scottish court and thus had close connections both to the Scottish royal family and to Fergus of Galloway (who would resurrect the Bishopric of Galloway), all of whom would have been pleased to have a manuscript with such a glowing description of a Galwegian and Scottish saint. His work is what Thomas Heffernan refers to as a &quot;sacred biography&quot;, probably intended for a politically ambitious audience.

===Ussher (1639)===
James Ussher wrote that Ninian left Candida Casa for &quot;Cluayn-coner&quot; in Ireland, and eventually died in Ireland; that his mother was a Spanish princess; that his father wished to regain him after having assented to his training for an ecclesiastical state; that a bell comes from heaven to call together his disciples; that a wooden church was raised by him, with beams delivered by stags; and that a harper with no experience at architecture was the builder of the church. He adds that a smith and his son, named respectively &quot;Terna&quot; and &quot;Wyn&quot;, witnessed a miracle by Ninian and that the saint was granted lands to be called &quot;Wytterna&quot;.

In addition, Skene attributes the &quot;traditional&quot; date of Ninian&#x27;s death (16 September 432) ultimately to Ussher&#x27;s &quot;Life of Ninian&quot;, noting that the date is &quot;without authority&quot;.

Ussher&#x27;s contribution is often disparaged, as he both invented fictitious histories and misquoted legitimate manuscripts to suit his own purposes. Still, he had access to legitimate manuscripts, and he has contributed to some versions of the traditional stories.

===Other sources===
Others who wrote of Saint Ninian used the accounts of Bede, Aelred, or Ussher, or used derivatives of them in combination with information from various manuscripts. This includes John Capgrave (1393–1464), John of Tinmouth (), John Colgan (died ), and many others, up to the present day.

The anonymously written 8th-century hagiographic &quot;Miracula Nynie Episcopi&quot; (&quot;Miracles of Bishop Ninian&quot;) is discounted as a non-historical account, and copies are not widely extant.
==Dedications to St Ninian==
Dedications to Saint Ninian are expressions of respect for the good works that are attributed to him, and the authenticity of the stories about him are not relevant to that point. Almost all of the dedications have their origins in the medieval era, after Aelred wrote his account.

The dedications are found throughout the lands of the ancient Picts of Scotland, throughout Scotland south of the Firths of Clyde and Forth, in Orkney and Shetland, and in parts of northern England. 

Dedications on the Isle of Man date from the time of medieval Scottish dominance, and are not natively inspired.

There are dedications to Ninian in East Donegal and Belfast; and a spot formerly on the shore of Belfast Lough was traditionally known as St Ninian&#x27;s Point, where the missionary reputedly landed after a voyage from Scotland. These connections reflect a strong Ulster-Scots heritage in both areas of Ulster.

There are also dedications elsewhere in the world where there is a Scottish heritage, such as Nova Scotia. St Ninian&#x27;s Cathedral is located in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

There is a noticeable lack of dedications in the Scottish Highlands and Isles, save for Kilninian and the Holy Spring of St Ninian of the Orthodox Mull Monastery on the Isle of Mull.

In the modern era, the first cathedral built in Scotland after the Protestant Reformation, St Ninian&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, was dedicated to the saint in 1850. St Ninian and Triduana&#x27;s Church, Edinburgh is a Roman Catholic church constructed in 1932 that is dedicated to Ninian. St Martin and St Ninian is a Catholic church in Whithorn, constructed in 1959–60 in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galloway. The architect was Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel (1887–1959).

In Scotland the date 16 September is celebrated as St Ninian&#x27;s Feast Day. Ninian is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 16 September.

<text>The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML; ISO 8879:1986) is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents. ISO 8879 Annex A.1 states that generalized markup is &quot;based on two postulates&quot;:
* Declarative: Markup should describe a document&#x27;s structure and other attributes rather than specify the processing that needs to be performed, because it is less likely to conflict with future developments.
* Rigorous: In order to allow markup to take advantage of the techniques available for processing, markup should rigorously define objects like programs and databases.

DocBook SGML and LinuxDoc are examples which used SGML tools.

== Standard versions ==
SGML is an ISO standard: &quot;ISO 8879:1986 Information processing – Text and office systems – Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)&quot;, of which there are three versions:

* Original &quot;SGML&quot;, which was accepted in October 1986, followed by a minor Technical Corrigendum.
* &quot;SGML (ENR)&quot;, in 1996, resulted from a Technical Corrigendum to add &quot;extended naming rules&quot; allowing arbitrary-language and -script markup.
* &quot;SGML (ENR+WWW or WebSGML)&quot;, in 1998, resulted from a Technical Corrigendum to better support XML and WWW requirements.

SGML is part of a trio of enabling ISO standards for electronic documents developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages) :

* SGML (ISO 8879) – Generalized markup language
** SGML was reworked in 1998 into XML, a successful profile of SGML. Full SGML is rarely found or used in new projects.
* DSSSL (ISO/IEC 10179) – Document processing and styling language based on Scheme.
** DSSSL was reworked into W3C XSLT and XSL-FO which use an XML syntax. Nowadays, DSSSL is rarely used in new projects apart from Linux documentation.
* HyTime – Generalized hypertext and scheduling.
** HyTime was partially reworked into W3C XLink. HyTime is rarely used in new projects.

SGML is supported by various technical reports, in particular

* ISO/IEC TR 9573 – Information processing – SGML support facilities – Techniques for using SGML
** Part 13: Public entity sets for mathematics and science
*** In 2007, the W3C MathML working group agreed to assume the maintenance of these entity sets.
== History ==
SGML descended from IBM&#x27;s Generalized Markup Language (GML), which Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher, and Raymond Lorie developed in the 1960s. Goldfarb, editor of the international standard, coined the &quot;GML&quot; term using their surname initials. Goldfarb also wrote the definitive work on SGML syntax in &quot;The SGML Handbook&quot;. The syntax of SGML is closer to the COCOA format. As a document markup language, SGML was originally designed to enable the sharing of machine-readable large-project documents in government, law, and industry. Many such documents must remain readable for several decades—a long time in the information technology field. SGML also was extensively applied by the military, and the aerospace, technical reference, and industrial publishing industries. The advent of the XML profile has made SGML suitable for widespread application for small-scale, general-purpose use.

== Document validity ==
SGML (ENR+WWW) defines two kinds of validity. According to the revised Terms and Definitions of ISO 8879 (from the public draft):
A conforming SGML document must be either a type-valid SGML document, a tag-valid SGML document, or both. Note: A user may wish to enforce additional constraints on a document, such as whether a document instance is integrally-stored or free of entity references.
A type-valid SGML document is defined by the standard as
An SGML document in which, for each document instance, there is an associated document type declaration (DTD) to whose DTD that instance conforms.
A tag-valid SGML document is defined by the standard as
An SGML document, all of whose document instances are fully tagged. There need not be a document type declaration associated with any of the instances. Note: If there is a document type declaration, the instance can be parsed with or without reference to it.
=== Terminology ===
&quot;Tag-validity&quot; was introduced in SGML (ENR+WWW) to support XML which allows documents with no DOCTYPE declaration but which can be parsed without a grammar, or documents which have a DOCTYPE declaration that makes no XML Infoset contributions to the document. The standard calls this &quot;fully tagged&quot;. &quot;Integrally stored&quot; reflects the XML requirement that elements end in the same entity in which they started. &quot;Reference-free&quot; reflects the HTML requirement that entity references are for special characters and do not contain markup. SGML validity commentary, especially commentary that was made before 1997 or that is unaware of SGML (ENR+WWW), covers &quot;type-validity&quot; only.

The SGML emphasis on validity supports the requirement for generalized markup that &quot;markup should be rigorous.&quot; (ISO 8879 A.1)

== Syntax ==
An SGML document may have three parts:
# the SGML Declaration,
# the Prologue, containing a DOCTYPE declaration with the various &quot;markup declarations&quot; that together make a Document Type Definition (DTD), and
# the instance itself, containing one top-most element and its contents.

An SGML document may be composed from many entities (discrete pieces of text). In SGML, the entities and element types used in the document may be specified with a DTD, the different character sets, features, delimiter sets, and keywords are specified in the SGML Declaration to create the &quot;concrete syntax&quot; of the document.

Although full SGML allows implicit markup and some other kinds of tags, the XML specification (s4.3.1) states:

For introductory information on a basic, modern SGML syntax, see XML. The following material concentrates on features not in XML and is not a comprehensive summary of SGML syntax.

=== Optional features ===
SGML generalizes and supports a wide range of markup languages as found in the mid 1980s. These ranged from terse Wiki-like syntaxes to RTF-like bracketed languages to HTML-like matching-tag languages. SGML did this by a relatively simple default &quot;reference concrete syntax&quot; augmented with a large number of optional features that could be enabled in the SGML Declaration. Not every SGML parser can necessarily process every SGML document. Because each processor&#x27;s &quot;System Declaration&quot; can be compared to the document&#x27;s &quot;SGML Declaration&quot; it is always possible to know whether a document is supported by a particular processor.

Many SGML features relate to markup minimization. Other features relate to concurrent (parallel) markup (CONCUR), to linking processing attributes (LINK), and to embedding SGML documents within SGML documents (SUBDOC).

The notion of customizable features was not appropriate for Web use, so one goal of XML was to minimize optional features. However, XML&#x27;s well-formedness rules cannot support Wiki-like languages, leaving them unstandardized and difficult to integrate with non-text information systems.

=== Concrete and abstract syntaxes ===
The usual (default) SGML &quot;concrete syntax&quot; resembles this example, which is the default HTML concrete syntax:
&lt;QUOTE TYPE=&quot;example&quot;&gt;
 typically something like &lt;ITALICS&gt;this&lt;/ITALICS&gt;
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;
SGML provides an &quot;abstract syntax&quot; that can be implemented in many different types of &quot;concrete syntax&quot;. Although the markup norm is using angle brackets as start- and end-tag delimiters in an SGML document (per the standard-defined &quot;reference concrete syntax&quot;), it is possible to use other characters—provided a suitable concrete syntax is defined in the document&#x27;s SGML declaration. For example, an SGML interpreter might be programmed to parse GML, wherein the tags are delimited with a left colon and a right full stop, and an codice_1 prefix denotes an end tag: codice_2. According to the reference syntax, letter case (upper- or lower-case) is not distinguished in tag names, so the three tags codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 are equivalent. (A concrete syntax might change this rule via the NAMECASE NAMING declarations.)

=== Markup minimization ===
SGML has features for reducing the number of characters required to mark up a document, which must be enabled in the SGML Declaration. SGML processors need not support every available feature, thus allowing applications to tolerate many types of inadvertent markup omissions; however, SGML systems usually are intolerant of invalid structures. XML is intolerant of syntax omissions, and does not require a DTD for checking well-formedness.

==== OMITTAG ====
Both start tags and end tags may be omitted from a document instance, provided:
# the OMITTAG feature is enabled in the SGML Declaration,
# the DTD indicates that the tags are permitted to be omitted,
# (for start tags) the element has no associated required (codice_6) attributes, and
# the tag can be unambiguously inferred by context.

For example, if OMITTAG YES is specified in the SGML Declaration (enabling the OMITTAG feature), and the DTD includes the following declarations:

&lt;!ELEMENT chapter - - (title, section+)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT title o o (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT section - - (title, subsection+)&gt;

which omits two tags and two tags, would represent valid markup.

Omitting tags is optional – the same excerpt could be tagged like this:
&lt;chapter&gt;&lt;title&gt;Introduction to SGML&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;title&gt;The SGML Declaration&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;subsection&gt;


and would still represent valid markup.
Note: The OMITTAG feature is unrelated to the tagging of elements whose declared content is codice_7 as defined in the DTD:

&lt;!ELEMENT image - o EMPTY&gt;
Elements defined like this have no end tag, and specifying one in the document instance would result in invalid markup. This is syntactically different from XML empty elements in this regard.

==== SHORTREF ====
Tags can be replaced with delimiter strings, for a terser markup, via the SHORTREF feature. This markup style is now associated with wiki markup, e.g. wherein two equals-signs (==), at the start of a line, are the &quot;heading start-tag&quot;, and two equals signs (==) after that are the &quot;heading end-tag&quot;.

==== SHORTTAG ====
SGML markup languages whose concrete syntax enables the SHORTTAG VALUE feature, do not require attribute values containing only alphanumeric characters to be enclosed within quotation marks—either double codice_8 (LIT) or single codice_9 (LITA)—so that the previous markup example could be written:
&lt;QUOTE TYPE=example&gt;
 typically something like &lt;ITALICS&gt;this&lt;/&gt;
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;
One feature of SGML markup languages is the &quot;presumptuous empty tagging&quot;, such that the empty end tag codice_10 in codice_11 &quot;inherits&quot; its value from the nearest previous full start tag, which, in this example, is codice_12 (in other words, it closes the most recently opened item). The expression is thus equivalent to codice_13.

==== NET ====
Another feature is the &quot;NET&quot; (Null End Tag) construction: codice_14, which is structurally equivalent to codice_13.

==== Other features ====
Additionally, the SHORTTAG NETENABL IMMEDNET feature allows shortening tags surrounding an empty text value, but forbids shortening full tags:
&lt;QUOTE&gt;&lt;/QUOTE&gt;
can be written as

 &lt;QUOTE// 

wherein the first slash ( / ) stands for the NET-enabling &quot;start-tag close&quot; (NESTC), and the second slash stands for the NET. NOTE: XML defines NESTC with a /, and NET with an &gt; (angled bracket)—hence the corresponding construct in XML appears as &lt;QUOTE/&gt;.

The third feature is &#x27;text on the same line&#x27;, allowing a markup item to be ended with a line-end; especially useful for headings and such, requiring using either SHORTREF or DATATAG minimization. For example, if the DTD includes the following declarations:
&lt;!ELEMENT lines (line*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT line O - (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY line-tagc &quot;&lt;/line&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!SHORTREF one-line &quot;&amp;#RE;&amp;#RS;&quot; line-tagc&gt;
&lt;!USEMAP one-line line&gt;
(and &quot;&amp;#RE;&amp;#RS;&quot; is a short-reference delimiter in the concrete syntax), then:
&lt;lines&gt;
first line
second line
&lt;/lines&gt;
is equivalent to:
&lt;lines&gt;
&lt;line&gt;first line&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;line&gt;second line&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/lines&gt;
== Formal characterization ==
SGML has many features that defied convenient description with the popular formal automata theory and the contemporary parser technology of the 1980s and the 1990s. The standard warns in Annex H:

A report on an early implementation of a parser for basic SGML, the Amsterdam SGML Parser, notes and specifies various differences.

There appears to be no definitive classification of full SGML against a known class of formal grammar. Plausible classes may include tree-adjoining grammars and adaptive grammars.

XML is described as being generally parsable like a two-level grammar for non-validated XML and a Conway-style pipeline of coroutines (lexer, parser, validator) for valid XML. The SGML productions in the ISO standard are reported to be LL(3) or LL(4). XML-class subsets are reported to be expressible using a W-grammar. According to one paper, probably considered at an &quot;information set&quot; or parse tree level rather than a character or delimiter level:

The SGML standard does not define SGML with formal data structures, such as parse trees; however, an SGML document is constructed of a rooted directed acyclic graph (RDAG) of physical storage units known as &quot;entities&quot;, which is parsed into a RDAG of structural units known as &quot;elements&quot;. The physical graph is loosely characterized as an &quot;entity tree&quot;, but entities might appear multiple times. Moreover, the structure graph is also loosely characterized as an &quot;element tree&quot;, but the ID/IDREF markup allows arbitrary arcs.

The results of parsing can also be understood as a data tree in different notations; where the document is the root node, and entities in other notations (text, graphics) are child nodes. SGML provides apparatus for linking to and annotating external non-SGML entities.

The SGML standard describes it in terms of &quot;maps&quot; and &quot;recognition modes&quot; (s9.6.1). Each entity, and each element, can have an associated &quot;notation&quot; or &quot;declared content type&quot;, which determines the kinds of references and tags which will be recognized in that entity and element. Also, each element can have an associated &quot;delimiter map&quot; (and &quot;short reference map&quot;), which determines which characters are treated as delimiters in context. The SGML standard characterizes parsing as a state machine switching between recognition modes. During parsing, there is a stack of maps that configure the scanner, while the tokenizer relates to the recognition modes.

Parsing involves traversing the dynamically-retrieved entity graph, finding/implying tags and the element structure, and validating those tags against the grammar. An unusual aspect of SGML is that the grammar (DTD) is used both passively — to &quot;recognize&quot; lexical structures, and actively — to &quot;generate&quot; missing structures and tags that the DTD has declared optional. End- and start- tags can be omitted, because they can be inferred. Loosely, a series of tags can be omitted only if there is a single, possible path in the grammar to imply them. It was this active use of grammars that made concrete SGML parsing difficult to formally characterize.

SGML uses the term &quot;validation&quot; for both recognition and generation. XML does not use the grammar (DTD) to change delimiter maps or to inform the parse modes, and does not allow tag omission; consequently, XML validation of elements is not active in the sense that SGML validation is active. SGML &quot;without&quot; a DTD (e.g. simple XML), is a grammar or a language; SGML &quot;with&quot; a DTD is a metalanguage. SGML with an SGML declaration is, perhaps, a meta-metalanguage, since it is a metalanguage whose declaration mechanism &quot;is&quot; a metalanguage.

SGML has an abstract syntax implemented by many possible concrete syntaxes; however, this is not the same usage as in an abstract syntax tree and as in a concrete syntax tree. In the SGML usage, a concrete syntax is a set of specific delimiters, while the abstract syntax is the set of names for the delimiters. The XML Infoset corresponds more to the programming language notion of abstract syntax introduced by John McCarthy.

== Derivatives ==
=== XML ===
The W3C XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a profile (subset) of SGML designed to ease the implementation of the parser compared to a full SGML parser, primarily for use on the World Wide Web. In addition to disabling many SGML options present in the reference syntax (such as omitting tags and nested subdocuments) XML adds a number of additional restrictions on the kinds of SGML syntax. For example, despite enabling SGML shortened tag forms, XML does not allow unclosed start or end tags. It also relied on many of the additions made by the WebSGML Annex. XML currently is more widely used than full SGML. XML has lightweight internationalization based on Unicode. Applications of XML include XHTML, XQuery, XSLT, XForms, XPointer, JSP, SVG, RSS, Atom, XML-RPC, RDF/XML, and SOAP.

=== HTML ===

While HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) was developed partially independently and in parallel with SGML, its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, intended it to be an application of SGML. The design of HTML was therefore inspired by SGML tagging, but, since no clear expansion and parsing guidelines were established, most actual HTML documents are not valid SGML documents. Later, HTML was reformulated (version 2.0) to be more of an SGML application; however, the HTML markup language has many legacy- and exception-handling features that differ from SGML&#x27;s requirements. HTML 4 is an SGML application that fully conforms to ISO 8879 – SGML.

The charter for the 2006 revival of the World Wide Web Consortium HTML Working Group says, &quot;the Group will not assume that an SGML parser is used for &#x27;classic HTML. Although HTML syntax closely resembles SGML syntax with the default &quot;reference concrete syntax&quot;, HTML5 abandons any attempt to define HTML as an SGML application, explicitly defining its own parsing rules, which more closely match existing implementations and documents. It does, however, define an alternative XHTML serialization, which conforms to XML and therefore to SGML as well.

=== OED ===

The second edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) is entirely marked up with an SGML-based markup language using the LEXX text editor.

The third edition is marked up as XML.

=== Others ===
Other document markup languages are partly related to SGML and XML, but—because they cannot be parsed or validated or otherwise processed using standard SGML and XML tools—they are not considered either SGML or XML languages; the Z Format markup language for typesetting and documentation is an example.

Several modern programming languages support tags as primitive token types, or now support Unicode and regular expression pattern-matching. An example is the Scala programming language.

== Applications ==
Document markup languages defined using SGML are called &quot;applications&quot; by the standard; many pre-XML SGML applications were proprietary property of the organizations which developed them, and thus unavailable in the World Wide Web. The following list is of pre-XML SGML applications.

*Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is an academic consortium that designs, maintains, and develops technical standards for digital-format textual representation applications.
*DocBook is a markup language originally created as an SGML application, designed for authoring technical documentation; DocBook currently is an XML application.
*CALS (Continuous Acquisition and Life-cycle Support) is a US Department of Defense (DoD) initiative for electronically capturing military documents and for linking related data and information.
*HyTime defines a set of hypertext-oriented element types that allow SGML document authors to build hypertext and multimedia presentations.
*EDGAR (Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system effects automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions, by companies and others, who are legally required to file data and information forms with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
*LinuxDoc. Documentation for Linux packages has used the LinuxDoc SGML DTD and Docbook XML DTD.
*AAP DTD is a document type definition for scientific documents, defined by the Association of American Publishers.
*ISO 12083, a successor to AAP DTD, is an international SGML standard for document interchange between authors and publishers.
*SGMLguid was an early SGML document type definition created, developed and used at CERN.

== Open-source implementations ==
Significant open-source implementations of SGML have included:
* ASP-SGML
* ARC-SGML, by Standard Generalized Markup Language Users&#x27;, 1991, C language
* SGMLS, by James Clark, 1993, C language
* Project YAO, by Yuan-ze Institute of Technology, Taiwan, with Charles Goldfarb, 1994.

<text>Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. The biologist Orator F. Cook coined the term in 1906 for cladogenesis, the splitting of lineages, as opposed to anagenesis, phyletic evolution within lineages. Charles Darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. He also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism, but found it problematic.

There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. Whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to speciation is the subject of much ongoing discussion.

Rapid sympatric speciation can take place through polyploidy, such as by doubling of chromosome number; the result is progeny which are immediately reproductively isolated from the parent population. New species can also be created through hybridization, followed by reproductive isolation, if the hybrid is favoured by natural selection.

== Historical background ==
In addressing the origin of species, there are two key issues:

# the evolutionary mechanisms of speciation
# how the separateness and individuality of species is maintained

Since Charles Darwin&#x27;s time, efforts to understand the nature of species have primarily focused on the first aspect, and it is now widely agreed that the critical factor behind the origin of new species is reproductive isolation.

=== Darwin&#x27;s dilemma: why do species exist? ===

In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), Darwin interpreted biological evolution in terms of natural selection, but was perplexed by the clustering of organisms into species. Chapter 6 of Darwin&#x27;s book is entitled &quot;Difficulties of the Theory&quot;. In discussing these &quot;difficulties&quot; he noted

This dilemma can be described as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.

Another dilemma, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin pointed out that by the theory of natural selection &quot;innumerable transitional forms must have existed&quot;, and wondered &quot;why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth&quot;. That clearly defined species actually do exist in nature in both space and time implies that some fundamental feature of natural selection operates to generate and maintain species.

=== Effect of sexual reproduction on species formation ===
It has been argued that the resolution of Darwin&#x27;s first dilemma lies in the fact that out-crossing sexual reproduction has an intrinsic cost of rarity. The cost of rarity arises as follows. If, on a resource gradient, a large number of separate species evolve, each exquisitely adapted to a very narrow band on that gradient, each species will, of necessity, consist of very few members. Finding a mate under these circumstances may present difficulties when many of the individuals in the neighborhood belong to other species. Under these circumstances, if any species&#x27; population size happens, by chance, to increase (at the expense of one or other of its neighboring species, if the environment is saturated), this will immediately make it easier for its members to find sexual partners. The members of the neighboring species, whose population sizes have decreased, experience greater difficulty in finding mates, and therefore form pairs less frequently than the larger species. This has a snowball effect, with large species growing at the expense of the smaller, rarer species, eventually driving them to extinction. Eventually, only a few species remain, each distinctly different from the other. Rarity not only imposes the risk of failure to find a mate, but it may also incur indirect costs, such as the resources expended or risks taken to seek out a partner at low population densities.

Rarity brings with it other costs. Rare and unusual features are very seldom advantageous. In most instances, they indicate a (non-silent) mutation, which is almost certain to be deleterious. It therefore behooves sexual creatures to avoid mates sporting rare or unusual features (koinophilia). Sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral phenotypic features, thus canalizing the entire external appearance, as illustrated in the accompanying image of the African pygmy kingfisher, &quot;Ispidina picta&quot;. This uniformity of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation of field guides on birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and many other taxa, in which a species can be described with a single illustration (or two, in the case of sexual dimorphism). Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species (and is illustrated in the photograph of the African pygmy kingfisher), its members will avoid mating with members of other populations that look different from themselves. Thus, the avoidance of mates displaying rare and unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads to reproductive isolation, one of the hallmarks of speciation.

In the contrasting case of organisms that reproduce asexually, there is no cost of rarity; consequently, there are only benefits to fine-scale adaptation. Thus, asexual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation in form (often in many different directions) that Darwin expected evolution to produce, making their classification into &quot;species&quot; (more correctly, morphospecies) very difficult.

== Modes ==
All forms of natural speciation have taken place over the course of evolution; however, debate persists as to the relative importance of each mechanism in driving biodiversity.

One example of natural speciation is the diversity of the three-spined stickleback, a marine fish that, after the last glacial period, has undergone speciation into new freshwater colonies in isolated lakes and streams. Over an estimated 10,000 generations, the sticklebacks show structural differences that are greater than those seen between different genera of fish including variations in fins, changes in the number or size of their bony plates, variable jaw structure, and color differences.

=== Allopatric ===
During allopatric (from the ancient Greek &quot;allos&quot;, &quot;other&quot; + &quot;patrā&quot;, &quot;fatherland&quot;) speciation, a population splits into two geographically isolated populations (for example, by habitat fragmentation due to geographical change such as mountain formation). The isolated populations then undergo genotypic or phenotypic divergence as: (a) they become subjected to dissimilar selective pressures; (b) different mutations arise in the two populations. When the populations come back into contact, they have evolved such that they are reproductively isolated and are no longer capable of exchanging genes. Island genetics is the term associated with the tendency of small, isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits. Examples include insular dwarfism and the radical changes among certain famous island chains, for example on Komodo. The Galápagos Islands are particularly famous for their influence on Charles Darwin. During his five weeks there he heard that Galápagos tortoises could be identified by island, and noticed that finches differed from one island to another, but it was only nine months later that he speculated that such facts could show that species were changeable. When he returned to England, his speculation on evolution deepened after experts informed him that these were separate species, not just varieties, and famously that other differing Galápagos birds were all species of finches. Though the finches were less important for Darwin, more recent research has shown the birds now known as Darwin&#x27;s finches to be a classic case of adaptive evolutionary radiation.

=== Peripatric ===
In peripatric speciation, a subform of allopatric speciation, new species are formed in isolated, smaller peripheral populations that are prevented from exchanging genes with the main population. It is related to the concept of a founder effect, since small populations often undergo bottlenecks. Genetic drift is often proposed to play a significant role in peripatric speciation.

Case studies include Mayr&#x27;s investigation of bird fauna; the Australian bird &quot;Petroica multicolor&quot;; and reproductive isolation in populations of &quot;Drosophila&quot; subject to population bottlenecking.

=== Parapatric ===
In parapatric speciation, there is only partial separation of the zones of two diverging populations afforded by geography; individuals of each species may come in contact or cross habitats from time to time, but reduced fitness of the heterozygote leads to selection for behaviours or mechanisms that prevent their interbreeding. Parapatric speciation is modelled on continuous variation within a &quot;single&quot;, connected habitat acting as a source of natural selection rather than the effects of isolation of habitats produced in peripatric and allopatric speciation.

Parapatric speciation may be associated with differential landscape-dependent selection. Even if there is a gene flow between two populations, strong differential selection may impede assimilation and different species may eventually develop. Habitat differences may be more important in the development of reproductive isolation than the isolation time. Caucasian rock lizards &quot;Darevskia rudis&quot;, &quot;D. valentini&quot; and &quot;D. portschinskii&quot; all hybridize with each other in their hybrid zone; however, hybridization is stronger between &quot;D. portschinskii&quot; and &quot;D. rudis&quot;, which separated earlier but live in similar habitats than between &quot;D. valentini&quot; and two other species, which separated later but live in climatically different habitats.

Ecologists refer to parapatric and peripatric speciation in terms of ecological niches. A niche must be available in order for a new species to be successful. Ring species such as &quot;Larus&quot; gulls have been claimed to illustrate speciation in progress, though the situation may be more complex. The grass &quot;Anthoxanthum odoratum&quot; may be starting parapatric speciation in areas of mine contamination.

=== Sympatric ===

Sympatric speciation is the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location.

Often-cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects that become dependent on different host plants in the same area.

The best known example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of East Africa inhabiting the Rift Valley lakes, particularly Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika. There are over 800 described species, and according to estimates, there could be well over 1,600 species in the region. Their evolution is cited as an example of both natural and sexual selection. A 2008 study suggests that sympatric speciation has occurred in Tennessee cave salamanders. Sympatric speciation driven by ecological factors may also account for the extraordinary diversity of crustaceans living in the depths of Siberia&#x27;s Lake Baikal.

Budding speciation has been proposed as a particular form of sympatric speciation, whereby small groups of individuals become progressively more isolated from the ancestral stock by breeding preferentially with one another. This type of speciation would be driven by the conjunction of various advantages of inbreeding such as the expression of advantageous recessive phenotypes, reducing the recombination load, and reducing the cost of sex.

The hawthorn fly (&quot;Rhagoletis pomonella&quot;), also known as the apple maggot fly, appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation. Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits. A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after apples, a non-native species, were introduced. This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorns. The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples. Some evidence, such as that six out of thirteen allozyme loci are different, that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding (researchers have documented a 4–6% hybridization rate) suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring.

==Methods of selection==

=== Reinforcement===


Reinforcement, also called the Wallace effect, is the process by which natural selection increases reproductive isolation. It may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact. If their reproductive isolation was complete, then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species. If their reproductive isolation is incomplete, then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids, which may or may not be fertile. If the hybrids are infertile, or fertile but less fit than their ancestors, then there will be further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred, as in horses and donkeys.

One reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments, the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both, therefore would not fit either ecological niche as well as either parent (ecological speciation). The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor assortative mating, which would control hybridization. This is sometimes called the Wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in speciation. Conversely, if the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors, then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact.

Another important theoretical mechanism is the arise of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities, addressed in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model. Genes from allopatric populations will have different evolutionary backgrounds and are never tested together until hybridization at secondary contact, when negative epistatic interactions will be exposed. In other words, new alleles will emerge in a population and only pass through selection if they work well together with other genes in the same population, but it may not be compatible with genes in an allopatric population, be those other newly derived alleles or retained ancestral alleles. This is only revealed through new hybridization. Such incompatibilities cause lower fitness in hybrids regardless of the ecological environment, and are thus intrinsic, although they can originate from the adaptation to different environments. The accumulation of such incompatibilities increases faster and faster with time, creating a &quot;snowball&quot; effect. There is a large amount of evidence supporting this theory, primarily from laboratory populations such as &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;Mus&quot;, and some genes involved in incompatibilities have been identified.

Reinforcement favoring reproductive isolation is required for both parapatric and sympatric speciation. Without reinforcement, the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species, called their &quot;hybrid zone&quot;, will not develop into a boundary between the different species. Hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed. Hybrid offspring are common in these regions, which are usually created by diverged species coming into secondary contact. Without reinforcement, the two species would have uncontrollable inbreeding. Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described below.

=== Ecological ===
Ecological selection is &quot;the interaction of individuals with their environment during resource acquisition&quot;. Natural selection is inherently involved in the process of speciation, whereby, &quot;under ecological speciation, populations in different environments, or populations exploiting different resources, experience contrasting natural selection pressures on the traits that directly or indirectly bring about the evolution of reproductive isolation&quot;. Evidence for the role ecology plays in the process of speciation exists. Studies of stickleback populations support ecologically-linked speciation arising as a by-product, alongside numerous studies of parallel speciation, where isolation evolves between independent populations of species adapting to contrasting environments than between independent populations adapting to similar environments. Ecological speciation occurs with much of the evidence, &quot;...accumulated from top-down studies of adaptation and reproductive isolation&quot;.

=== Sexual selection ===

Sexual selection can drive speciation in a clade, independently of natural selection. However the term &quot;speciation&quot;, in this context, tends to be used in two different, but not mutually exclusive senses. The first and most commonly used sense refers to the &quot;birth&quot; of new species. That is, the splitting of an existing species into two separate species, or the budding off of a new species from a parent species, both driven by a biological &quot;fashion fad&quot; (a preference for a feature, or features, in one or both sexes, that do not necessarily have any adaptive qualities). In the second sense, &quot;speciation&quot; refers to the wide-spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined species, rather than forming a continuum of phenotypes both in time and space – which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural selection. This was indeed recognized by Darwin as problematic, and included in his &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), under the heading &quot;Difficulties with the Theory&quot;. There are several suggestions as to how mate choice might play a significant role in resolving Darwin&#x27;s dilemma. If speciation takes place in the absence of natural selection, it might be referred to as nonecological speciation.

== Artificial speciation ==


New species have been created by animal husbandry, but the dates and methods of the initiation of such species are not clear. Often, the domestic counterpart can still interbreed and produce fertile offspring with its wild ancestor. This is the case with domestic cattle, which can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox, gaur, and yak; and with domestic sheep that can interbreed with the mouflon.

The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s. William R. Rice and George W. Salt bred &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; fruit flies using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas. The history of such attempts is described by Rice and Elen E. Hostert (1993).
Diane Dodd used a laboratory experiment to show how reproductive isolation can develop in &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; fruit flies after several generations by placing them in different media, starch- and maltose-based media.

Dodd&#x27;s experiment has been replicated many times, including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods. Such rapid evolution of reproductive isolation may sometimes be a relic of infection by &quot;Wolbachia&quot; bacteria.

An alternative explanation is that these observations are consistent with sexually-reproducing animals being inherently reluctant to mate with individuals whose appearance or behavior is different from the norm. The risk that such deviations are due to heritable maladaptations is high. Thus, if an animal, unable to predict natural selection&#x27;s future direction, is conditioned to produce the fittest offspring possible, it will avoid mates with unusual habits or features. Sexual creatures then inevitably group themselves into reproductively isolated species.

== Genetics ==

Few speciation genes have been found. They usually involve the reinforcement process of late stages of speciation. In 2008, a speciation gene causing reproductive isolation was reported. It causes hybrid sterility between related subspecies. The order of speciation of three groups from a common ancestor may be unclear or unknown; a collection of three such species is referred to as a &quot;trichotomy&quot;.

=== Speciation via polyploidy ===

Polyploidy is a mechanism that has caused many rapid speciation events in sympatry because offspring of, for example, tetraploid x diploid matings often result in triploid sterile progeny. However, among plants, not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parents, and gene flow may still occur, such as through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce tetraploids, or matings between meiotically unreduced gametes from diploids and gametes from tetraploids (see also hybrid speciation).

It has been suggested that many of the existing plant and most animal species have undergone an event of polyploidization in their evolutionary history. Reproduction of successful polyploid species is sometimes asexual, by parthenogenesis or apomixis, as for unknown reasons many asexual organisms are polyploid. Rare instances of polyploid mammals are known, but most often result in prenatal death. 

=== Hybrid speciation ===
Hybridization between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if reproductive isolation is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid speciation is considered an extremely rare event. The Mariana mallard is thought to have arisen from hybrid speciation.

Hybridization is an important means of speciation in plants, since polyploidy (having more than two copies of each chromosome) is tolerated in plants more readily than in animals. Polyploidy is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction, with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during meiosis. Polyploids also have more genetic diversity, which allows them to avoid inbreeding depression in small populations.

Hybridization without change in chromosome number is called homoploid hybrid speciation. It is considered very rare but has been shown in &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies and sunflowers. Polyploid speciation, which involves changes in chromosome number, is a more common phenomenon, especially in plant species. 

=== Gene transposition ===
Theodosius Dobzhansky, who studied fruit flies in the early days of genetic research in 1930s, speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one location to another might cause a species to split into two different species. He mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate themselves in a genome. Those mobile sections can cause sterility in inter-species hybrids, which can act as a speciation pressure. In theory, his idea was sound, but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature. Eventually a competing theory involving the gradual accumulation of mutations was shown to occur in nature so often that geneticists largely dismissed the moving gene hypothesis. However, 2006 research shows that jumping of a gene from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species. This validates the reproductive isolation mechanism, a key component of speciation.

== Rates ==
There is debate as to the rate at which speciation events occur over geologic time. While some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant and gradual over time (known as &quot;Phyletic gradualism&quot; – see diagram), some palaeontologists such as Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time, and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief intervals, a view known as &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot;. (See diagram, and Darwin&#x27;s dilemma.) 

=== Punctuated evolution ===
Evolution can be extremely rapid, as shown in the creation of domesticated animals and plants in a very short geological space of time, spanning only a few tens of thousands of years. Maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;), for instance, was created in Mexico in only a few thousand years, starting about 7,000 to 12,000 years ago. This raises the question of why the long term rate of evolution is far slower than is theoretically possible.

Evolution is imposed on species or groups. It is not planned or striven for in some Lamarckist way. The mutations on which the process depends are random events, and, except for the &quot;silent mutations&quot; which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier, are thus usually disadvantageous, and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishingly small. Therefore, while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment by accumulating a wide range of genetic variation, this is to the detriment of the &quot;individuals&quot; who have to carry these mutations until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation. Thus, the &quot;capability&quot; to evolve would require group selection, a concept discredited by (for example) George C. Williams, John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins as selectively disadvantageous to the individual.

The resolution to Darwin&#x27;s second dilemma might thus come about as follows:

If sexual individuals are disadvantaged by passing mutations on to their offspring, they will avoid mutant mates with strange or unusual characteristics. Mutations that affect the external appearance of their carriers will then rarely be passed on to the next and subsequent generations. They would therefore seldom be tested by natural selection. Evolution is, therefore, effectively halted or slowed down considerably. The only mutations that can accumulate in a population, on this punctuated equilibrium view, are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearers (i.e., they are &quot;silent&quot; or &quot;neutral mutations&quot;, which can be, and are, used to trace the relatedness and age of populations and species.)

This argument implies that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided, as a result of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small, isolated communities. These occur most commonly on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, or caves, or during the aftermath of a mass extinction. Under these circumstances, not only is the choice of mates severely restricted but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population&#x27;s genetic composition. Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated population such as this survives its genetic upheavals, and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come into being. In geological terms, this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will thereafter result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.

In apparent confirmation of this punctuated equilibrium view of evolution, the fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, hundreds of thousands or millions of years later, without any change in external appearance. Graphically, these fossil species are represented by lines parallel with the time axis, whose lengths depict how long each of them existed. The fact that the lines remain parallel with the time axis illustrates the unchanging appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph. During each species&#x27; existence new species appear at random intervals, each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance. The exact relatedness of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine. This is illustrated in the diagram depicting the distribution of hominin species through time since the hominins separated from the line that led to the evolution of their closest living primate relatives, the chimpanzees.

For similar evolutionary time lines see, for instance, the paleontological list of African dinosaurs, Asian dinosaurs, the Lampriformes and Amiiformes.

<text>Structured Query Language (SQL) ( &quot;S-Q-L&quot;; &quot;sequel&quot;) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify &quot;how&quot; to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes procedural elements.

SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd&#x27;s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot;. Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.
==History==
SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Edgar F. Codd in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM&#x27;s original quasirelational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.

Chamberlin and Boyce&#x27;s first attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment), but it was difficult to use due to subscript/superscript notation. After moving to the San Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on a sequel to SQUARE. The original name SEQUEL, which is widely regarded as a pun on QUEL, the query language of Ingres, was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels) because &quot;SEQUEL&quot; was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company. The label SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Language.

After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype, including System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.

In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software introduced one of the first commercially available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.

By 1986, ANSI and ISO standard groups officially adopted the standard &quot;Database Language SQL&quot; language definition. New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2016 and most recently, 2023.

==Interoperability and standardization==

===Overview===
SQL implementations are incompatible between vendors and do not necessarily completely follow standards. In particular, date and time syntax, string concatenation, codice_1s, and comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor to vendor. PostgreSQL and Mimer SQL strive for standards compliance, though PostgreSQL does not adhere to the standard in all cases. For example, the folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard, which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case. Thus, according to the standard, codice_2 should be equivalent to codice_3, not codice_4.

Popular implementations of SQL commonly omit support for basic features of Standard SQL, such as the codice_5 or codice_6 data types. The most obvious such examples, and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary SQL DBMSs, are Oracle (whose codice_5 behaves as codice_8, and lacks a codice_6 type) and MS SQL Server (before the 2008 version). As a result, SQL code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications.

===Reasons for incompatibility===
Several reasons for the lack of portability between database systems include:

* The complexity and size of the SQL standard means that most implementers do not support the entire standard.
* The SQL standard does not specify the database behavior in some important areas (e.g., indices, file storage), leaving implementations to decide how to behave.
* The SQL standard defers some decisions to individual implementations, such as how to name a results column that was not named explicitly.
* The SQL standard precisely specifies the syntax that a conforming database system must implement. However, the standard&#x27;s specification of the semantics of language constructs is less well-defined, leading to ambiguity.
* Many database vendors have large existing customer bases; where the newer version of the SQL standard conflicts with the prior behavior of the vendor&#x27;s database, the vendor may be unwilling to break backward compatibility.
* Little commercial incentive exists for vendors to make changing database suppliers easier (see vendor lock-in).
* Users evaluating database software tend to place other factors such as performance higher in their priorities than standards conformance.

===Standardization history===
SQL was adopted as a standard by the ANSI in 1986 as SQL-86 and the ISO in 1987. It is maintained by &quot;ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 32, Data management and interchange&quot;.

Until 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) data-management standards program certified SQL DBMS compliance with the SQL standard. Vendors now self-certify the compliance of their products.

The original standard declared that the official pronunciation for &quot;SQL&quot; was an initialism: (&quot;ess cue el&quot;). Regardless, many English-speaking database professionals (including Donald Chamberlin himself) use the acronym-like pronunciation of (&quot;sequel&quot;), mirroring the language&#x27;s prerelease development name, &quot;SEQUEL&quot;.&lt;br&gt; The SQL standard has gone through a number of revisions:

===Current standard===
The standard is commonly denoted by the pattern: &quot;ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title&quot;, or, as a shortcut, &quot;ISO/IEC 9075&quot;. Interested parties may purchase the standards documents from ISO,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 9075&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; IEC, or ANSI. Some old drafts are freely available.

&quot;ISO/IEC 9075&quot; is complemented by &quot;ISO/IEC 13249: SQL Multimedia and Application Packages&quot; and some &quot;Technical reports&quot;.

==Syntax==

 &amp; \{ \mathtt{UPDATE\ \overbrace{\mathtt{countries}}^\mathtt{table}} \} \\ 
 \textstyle\mathtt{SET~clause:} &amp; \{ {\mathtt{SET\ \overbrace{\mathtt{population}}^\mathtt{column} =~} \overbrace{\mathtt_\mathtt{literal}}}^\mathtt{expression}} \} \\ 
 \textstyle\mathtt{WHERE~clause:} &amp; \{ {\mathtt{WHERE\ \underbrace{\overbrace{\mathtt{name}}^\mathtt{column} \mathtt{=} \overbrace^\mathtt{literal}}}^\mathtt{expression}}_\mathtt{predicate}}\}{\texttt{;}}}
\end{array}
\right \}{\textstyle\texttt{statement}}}_{\textstyle\mathtt{SQL~query}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
* &quot;Clauses&quot;, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)
* &quot;Expressions&quot;, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data
* &quot;Predicates&quot;, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.
* &quot;Queries&quot;, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of &quot;SQL&quot;.
* &quot;Statements&quot;, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
** SQL statements also include the semicolon (&quot;;&quot;) statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.
* &quot;Insignificant whitespace&quot; is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.

==Procedural extensions==
SQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query data contained in a relational database. SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, not an imperative programming language like C or BASIC. However, extensions to Standard SQL add procedural programming language functionality, such as control-of-flow constructs.

In addition to the standard SQL/PSM extensions and proprietary SQL extensions, procedural and object-oriented programmability is available on many SQL platforms via DBMS integration with other languages. The SQL standard defines SQL/JRT extensions (SQL Routines and Types for the Java Programming Language) to support Java code in SQL databases. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 uses the SQLCLR (SQL Server Common Language Runtime) to host managed .NET assemblies in the database, while prior versions of SQL Server were restricted to unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written in C. PostgreSQL lets users write functions in a wide variety of languages—including Perl, Python, Tcl, JavaScript (PL/V8) and C.

==Alternatives==
A distinction should be made between alternatives to SQL as a language, and alternatives to the relational model itself. Below are proposed relational alternatives to the SQL language. See navigational database and NoSQL for alternatives to the relational model.

* .QL: object-oriented Datalog
* 4D Query Language (4D QL)
* Datalog: critics suggest that Datalog has two advantages over SQL: it has cleaner semantics, which facilitates program understanding and maintenance, and it is more expressive, in particular for recursive queries.
* HTSQL: URL based query method
* IBM Business System 12 (IBM BS12): one of the first fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982
* ISBL
* jOOQ: SQL implemented in Java as an internal domain-specific language

==Distributed SQL processing==
Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM from 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network-connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.

An interactive user or program can issue SQL statements to a local RDB and receive tables of data and status indicators in reply from remote RDBs. SQL statements can also be compiled and stored in remote RDBs as packages and then invoked by package name. This is important for the efficient operation of application programs that issue complex, high-frequency queries. It is especially important when the tables to be accessed are located in remote systems.

The messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the Distributed Data Management Architecture. Distributed SQL processing ala DRDA is distinctive from contemporary distributed SQL databases.

==Criticisms==
===Design===
SQL deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation, the relational model and its tuple calculus. In that model, a table is a set of tuples, while in SQL, tables and query results are lists of rows; the same row may occur multiple times, and the order of rows can be employed in queries (e.g., in the LIMIT clause).
Critics argue that SQL should be replaced with a language that returns strictly to the original foundation: for example, see &quot;The Third Manifesto&quot; by Hugh Darwen and C.J. Date (2006, ).

===Orthogonality and completeness===
Early specifications did not support major features, such as primary keys. Result sets could not be named, and subqueries had not been defined. These were added in 1992.

The lack of sum types has been described as a roadblock to full use of SQL&#x27;s user-defined types. JSON support, for example, needed to be added by a new standard in 2016.

===Null===
The concept of Null is the subject of some debate. The Null marker indicates the absence of a value, and is distinct from a value of 0 for an integer column or an empty string for a text column. The concept of Nulls enforces the 3-valued-logic in SQL, which is a concrete implementation of the general 3-valued logic.

===Duplicates===
Another popular criticism is that it allows duplicate rows, making integration with languages such as Python, whose data types might make accurately representing the data difficult, in terms of parsing and by the absence of modularity. This is usually avoided by declaring a primary key, or a unique constraint, with one or more columns that uniquely identify a row in the table.

===Impedance mismatch===
In a sense similar to object–relational impedance mismatch, a mismatch occurs between the declarative SQL language and the procedural languages in which SQL is typically embedded.

==SQL data types==
The SQL standard defines three kinds of data types (chapter 4.1.1 of SQL/Foundation):
* predefined data types
* constructed types
* user-defined types.

&quot;Constructed types&quot; are one of ARRAY, MULTISET, REF(erence), or ROW. &quot;User-defined types&quot; are comparable to classes in object-oriented language with their own constructors, observers, mutators, methods, inheritance, overloading, overwriting, interfaces, and so on. &quot;Predefined data types&quot; are intrinsically supported by the implementation.

===Predefined data types===
* Character types
** Character (CHAR)
** Character varying (VARCHAR)
** Character large object (CLOB)
* National character types
** National character (NCHAR)
** National character varying (NCHAR VARYING)
** National character large object (NCLOB)
* Binary types
** Binary (BINARY)
** Binary varying (VARBINARY)
** Binary large object (BLOB)
* Numeric types
** Exact numeric types (NUMERIC, DECIMAL, SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT)
** Approximate numeric types (FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION)
** Decimal floating-point type (DECFLOAT)
* Datetime types (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP)
* Interval type (INTERVAL)
* Boolean
* XML (see SQL/XML)
* JSON

<text>The Strait of Hormuz ( &quot;Tangeh-ye Hormoz&quot; , &quot;Maḍīq Hurmuz&quot;) is a strait between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It provides the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is one of the world&#x27;s most strategically important choke points. On the north coast lies Iran, and on the south coast lies the Musandam peninsula, shared by the United Arab Emirates and the Musandam Governorate, an exclave of Oman. The strait is about long, with a width varying from about to .

A third of the world&#x27;s liquefied natural gas and almost 25% of total global oil consumption passes through the strait, making it a highly important strategic location for international trade. It has been so for centuries; its vast hinterlands were rich in luxury trade goods with no easy access to lucrative trading ports. Babur&#x27;s memoirs recount how almonds had to be carried from the distant Ferghana region to Hormuz to reach markets.

==Etymology==

The strait of Hormuz may have been named after Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur II of Persia, who ruled between 309 and 379 AD.

The opening to the Persian Gulf was described, but not given a name, in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, a 1st-century mariner&#x27;s guide:
In the 10th17th centuries AD, the Kingdom of Ormus, which seems to have given the strait its name, was located here. Scholars, historians and linguists derive the name &quot;Ormuz&quot; from the local Persian word &quot;Hur-mogh&quot; meaning date palm. In the local dialects of Hurmoz and Minab this strait is still called Hurmogh and has the aforementioned meaning. The resemblance of this word to the name of the Zoroastrian god &quot;Hormoz&quot; (a variant of &quot;Ahura Mazda&quot;) has resulted in the popular belief that these words are related.

Jodocus Hondius labels the Strait &quot;Basora fretum&quot; (&quot;Strait of Basra&quot;) on his 1606 map of the Ottoman Empire.

==Navigation==
To reduce the risk of collision, ships moving through the Strait follow a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS): inbound ships use one lane, outbound ships another, each lane being two miles wide. The lanes are separated by a two-mile-wide &quot;median&quot;.

To traverse the Strait, ships pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman under the transit passage provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Although not all countries have ratified the convention, most countries, including the U.S., accept these customary navigation rules as codified in the convention.

In April 1959 Iran altered the legal status of the strait by expanding its territorial sea to and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman also expanded its territorial sea to by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely &quot;closed&quot; by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither Iran or Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different from customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating &quot;that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein&quot;, including &quot;the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation&quot;. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran&#x27;s territorial waters. The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.

Oman has a radar site Link Quality Indicator (LQI) to monitor the TSS in the Strait of Hormuz. This site is on a small island on the peak of Musandam Governorate.

==Oil trade flow==

A 2007 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies also stated that 17 million barrels passed out of the Persian Gulf daily, but that oil flows through the Strait accounted for roughly 40% of all world-traded oil.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2011, an average of 14 tankers per day passed out of the Persian Gulf through the Strait carrying of crude oil. This was said to represent 35% of the world&#x27;s seaborne oil shipments and 20% of oil traded worldwide. The report stated that more than 85% of these crude oil exports went to Asian markets, with Japan, India, South Korea and China the largest destinations. In 2018 alone, 21 million barrels a day were passing through the strait - this means $1.17 billion worth of oil a day, at September 2019 prices.

==Events==

===Tanker War===
The Tanker War phase of the Iran–Iraq War started when Iraq attacked the oil terminal and oil tankers at Iran&#x27;s Kharg Island in early 1984. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s aim in attacking Iranian shipping was, among other things, to provoke the Iranians to retaliate with extreme measures, such as closing the Strait of Hormuz to all maritime traffic, thereby bringing American intervention. Iran limited the retaliatory attacks to Iraqi shipping, leaving the strait open.

=== Operation Praying Mantis ===
Operation Praying Mantis was an attack on 18 April 1988 by the United States Armed Forces within Iranian territorial waters in retaliation for the Iranian naval mining of international waters in the Persian Gulf during the Iran–Iraq War and the subsequent damage to an American warship. The U.S. Navy attacked with several groups of surface warships, plus aircraft from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and her cruiser escort, USS &quot;Truxtun&quot;. The attack began with coordinated strikes by two surface groups.

===Downing of Iran Air 655===
On 3 July 1988, 290 people were killed when an Iran Air Airbus A300 was shot down over the strait by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CG-49) when it was wrongly identified as a jet fighter.

===Collision between USS &quot;Newport News&quot; and tanker &quot;Mogamigawa&quot;===
On 8 January 2007, the nuclear submarine USS &quot;Newport News&quot;, traveling submerged, struck , a 300,000-ton Japanese-flagged very large crude tanker, south of the strait. There were no injuries, and no oil leaked from the tanker.

===Tensions in 2008===

====2008 U.S.–Iranian naval dispute====
A series of naval stand-offs between Iranian speedboats and U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz occurred in December 2007 and January 2008. U.S. officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels, but Iranian officials denied the allegations. On 14 January 2008, U.S. Navy officials appeared to contradict the Pentagon version of the 16 January event, in which the Pentagon had reported that U.S. vessels had almost fired on approaching Iranian boats. The Navy&#x27;s regional commander, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, said the Iranians had &quot;neither anti-ship missiles nor torpedoes&quot; and he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t characterize the posture of the US 5th Fleet as afraid of these small boats&quot;.

====Iranian defence policy====
On 29 June 2008, the commander of Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard, Mohammad Ali Jafari, said that if either Israel or the United States attacked Iran, it would seal off the Strait of Hormuz to wreak havoc in the oil markets. This followed more ambiguous threats from Iran&#x27;s oil minister and other government officials that an attack on Iran would result in turmoil in the world&#x27;s oil supply.

Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, commander of the U.S. 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain across the Persian Gulf from Iran, warned that such Iranian action would be considered an act of war, and the U.S. would not allow Iran to hold hostage nearly a third of the world&#x27;s oil supply.

On 8 July 2008, Ali Shirazi, a mid-level clerical aide to Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted by the student news agency ISNA as telling the Revolutionary Guards, &quot;The Zionist regime is pressuring White House officials to attack Iran. If they commit such a stupidity, Tel Aviv and U.S. shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran&#x27;s first targets and they will be burned.&quot;

====Naval activity in 2008====
In the last week of July 2008, in the Operation Brimstone, dozens of U.S. and foreign naval ships came to undergo joint exercises for possible military activity in the shallow waters off the coast of Iran.

As of 11 August 2008, more than 40 U.S. and allied ships reportedly were en route to the Strait of Hormuz. One U.S. carrier battle group from Japan would complement the two which are already in the Persian Gulf, for a total of five battle groups, not including the submarines.

===Collision between USS &quot;Hartford&quot; and USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;===

On 20 March 2009, United States Navy collided with the in the strait. The collision, which slightly injured 15 sailors aboard &quot;Hartford&quot;, ruptured a fuel tank aboard &quot;New Orleans&quot;, spilling of marine diesel fuel.

===U.S.–Iran tensions in 2011–2012===
On 27 December 2011, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi threatened to cut off oil supply from the Strait of Hormuz should economic sanctions limit, or cut off, Iranian oil exports. A U.S. Fifth Fleet spokeswoman said in response that the Fleet was &quot;always ready to counter malevolent actions&quot;, whilst Admiral Habibollah Sayyari of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy claimed that cutting off oil shipments would be &quot;easy&quot;. Despite an initial 2% rise in oil prices, oil markets ultimately did not react significantly to the Iranian threat, with oil analyst Thorbjoern Bak Jensen of Global Risk Management concluding that &quot;they cannot stop the flow for a longer period due to the amount of U.S. hardware in the area&quot;.
On 3 January 2012, Iran threatened to take action if the U.S. Navy moves an aircraft carrier back into the Persian Gulf. Iranian Army chief Ataollah Salehi said the United States had moved an aircraft carrier out of the Persian Gulf because of Iran&#x27;s naval exercises, and Iran would take action if the ship returned. &quot;Iran will not repeat its warning...the enemy&#x27;s carrier has been moved to the Gulf of Oman because of our drill. I recommend and emphasize to the American carrier not to return to the Persian Gulf&quot;, he said.

The U.S. Navy spokesman Commander Bill Speaks quickly responded that deployment of U.S. military assets would continue as has been the custom stating: &quot;The U.S. Navy operates under international maritime conventions to maintain a constant state of high vigilance in order to ensure the continued, safe flow of maritime traffic in waterways critical to global commerce.&quot;

While earlier statements from Iran had little effect on global oil markets, coupled with the new sanctions, these comments from Iran drove crude futures higher, up over 4%. Pressure on prices reflected a combination of uncertainty driven further by China&#x27;s recent response – reducing oil January 2012 purchases from Iran by 50% compared to those made in 2011.

The U.S. led sanctions may be &quot;beginning to bite&quot; as Iranian currency has recently lost some 12% of its value. Further pressure on Iranian currency was added by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé who was quoted as calling for more &quot;strict sanctions&quot; and urged EU countries to follow the US in freezing Iranian central bank assets and imposing an embargo on oil exports.

The British government sent the Type 45 destroyer to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Daring&quot;, the lead ship of her class is one of the &quot;most advanced warships&quot; in the world, and undertook its first mission in the Persian Gulf. The British Government emphasized that this move has been long-planned, as &quot;Daring&quot; replaced another Armilla patrol frigate.
On 9 January 2012, Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi denied that Iran had ever claimed that it would close the Strait of Hormuz, saying that &quot;the Islamic Republic of Iran is the most important provider of security in the strait... if one threatens the security of the Persian Gulf, then all are threatened.&quot;

The Iranian Foreign Ministry confirmed on 16 January 2012 that it has received a letter from the United States concerning the Strait of Hormuz, &quot;via three different channels.&quot; Authorities were considering whether to reply, although the contents of the letter were not divulged. The United States had previously announced its intention to warn Iran that closing the Strait of Hormuz is a &quot;red line&quot; that would provoke an American response. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this past weekend that the United States would &quot;take action and re-open the strait&quot;, which could be accomplished only by military means, including minesweepers, warship escorts and potentially airstrikes. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta told troops in Texas that the United States would not tolerate Iran&#x27;s closing of the strait. Nevertheless, Iran continued to discuss the impact of shutting the Strait on world oil markets, saying that any disruption of supply would cause a shock to markets that &quot;no country&quot; could manage.

By 23 January, a flotilla had been established by countries opposing Iran&#x27;s threats to close the Hormuz Strait. These ships operated in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea off the coast of Iran. The flotilla included three American aircraft carriers (the , the and ) and three destroyers (, , ), seven British warships, including the destroyer and a number of Type 23 frigates (, , and ), and a French warship, the frigate &quot;La Motte-Picquet&quot; .

On 24 January, tensions rose further after the European Union imposed sanctions on Iranian oil. A senior member of Iran&#x27;s parliament said that the Islamic Republic would close the entry point to the Persian Gulf if new sanctions block its oil exports. &quot;If any disruption happens regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of Hormuz will definitely be closed,&quot; Mohammad Kossari, deputy head of parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs and national security committee, told the semi-official Fars News Agency.

===2015 seizure of MV &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot;===

On 28 April 2015, IRGCN patrol boats contacted the Marshall Islands-flagged container ship &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot;, which was westbound through the strait, and directed the ship to proceed further into Iranian territorial waters, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department. When the ship&#x27;s master declined, one of the Iranian craft fired shots across the bridge of &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot;. The captain complied and proceeded into Iranian waters near Larak Island. The US Navy sent aircraft and a destroyer, USS &quot;Farragut&quot;, to monitor the situation.

Maersk says it has agreed to pay an Iranian company $163,000 after an Iranian court ruling over a dispute about 10 container boxes transported to Dubai in 2005. An appeal court raised the fine to $3.6 million.

===2018 threats of strait closure===
In July 2018, Iran again made threats to close the strait. Citing looming American sanctions after the U.S. withdrew from the JCPOA deal earlier in the year. Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards reported they were ready to carry out the action if required.

In August 2018, Iran test-fired a ballistic missile for the first time in 2018. According to the officials, the anti-ship Fateh-110 Mod 3 flew over 100 miles on a flight path over the Strait of Hormuz to a test range in the Iranian desert. &quot;It was shore-to-shore&quot;, said one U.S. official describing the launch, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

===2019 threats of strait closure===
On 22 April 2019, the U.S. ended the oil waivers, which allowed some of Iran&#x27;s customers to import Iranian oil, without risking financial penalties as part of the U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Again, this had implication playing out in the Strait of Hormuz, as Iranian threats of Strait closure was put forward in April 2019.

Aljazeera quoted Major-General Mohammad Baqeri of the Iranian Armed Forces, stating &quot;We are not after closing the Strait of Hormuz but if the hostility of the enemies increases, we will be able to do so&quot;. Baqeri is also quoted for stating &quot;If our oil does not pass, the oil of others shall not pass the Strait of Hormuz either&quot;.

=== 2019 U.S.–Iran tensions and attacks on oil tankers ===
Iran has persistently attacked various vessels and seized ships amidst political issues since 2019. On the morning of 13 June 2019, the oil tankers &quot;Front Altair&quot; and &quot;Kokuka Courageous&quot; were both rocked by explosions shortly before dawn, the crew of the latter reported seeing a flying object strike the ship; the crew were rescued by the destroyer while the crew of the &quot;Front Altair&quot; were rescued by Iranian ships. That afternoon, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo issued a statement accusing Iran of the attacks. Iran subsequently denied the accusations, calling the incident a false-flag attack.

In July 2019, a Stena Bulk Tanker, &quot;Stena Impero&quot;, sailing under a British flag, was boarded and captured by Iranian forces. The spokesman for Iran&#x27;s Guardian Council, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, was quoted as describing the seizure as a &quot;reciprocal action&quot;. This was presumed to be in reference to the seizure of an Iranian tanker, &quot;Grace 1&quot;, bound for Syria in Gibraltar a few days prior.

In 2020, France deployed about 600 troops at sea and in the air under the CTF474 to protect maritime trade, regional business, and to ease local tensions. Since the first week of April 2020, the operation combines the Dutch frigate Ruyter, the French frigate Forbin, and one French airplane ATLANTIC2 (ATL2).

===2020 Iranian military activity===
In May 2020, Iran launched missiles at one of their own ships in a friendly fire accident, killing 19 sailors.

===2021 Iranian ship seizure===
On 4 January 2021, the Tasnim News Agency reported that a South Korea-flagged oil vessel headed from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates was seized for allegedly causing pollution violations. The ship was said to be carrying roughly 7,000 tons of ethanol. South Korea refused to comment on the accusation of causing oil pollution in the Strait of Hormuz. The ship, &quot;Hankuk Chemi&quot;, was headed to the UAE port Fujairah after loading oil from Jubail, Saudi Arabia on 2 January 2021, as per ship-tracking data gathered by Bloomberg.

===2021 IRIS &quot;Kharg&quot; sinking===
On 2 June 2021, the IRIS &quot;Kharg&quot;, a modified Ol-class replenishment oiler of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, sank in the Strait of Hormuz after catching fire. It was the IRIN&#x27;s largest vessel.

===2024 Seizure of &quot;MSC Aries&quot;===
On 13 April 2024, the Iranian IRGC Navy seized &quot;MSC Aries&quot;, a Portuguese-flagged container ship sailing through the Gulf of Oman off the UAE coast, of the Emirati port city of Fujairah, then steered the container ship through the strait, with 25 personnel on board, claiming that it had violated maritime laws. &quot;MSC Aries&quot; is leased by MSC from Gortal Shipping, which is an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime. The 25 crew aboard includes 17 Indian nationals, Filipinos, Pakistanis, a Russian, and an Estonian.

==Ability of Iran to hinder shipping==

Millennium Challenge 2002 was a major war game exercise conducted by the United States armed forces in 2002. According to a 2012 article in The Christian Science Monitor, it simulated an attempt by Iran to close the strait. The assumptions and results were controversial. In the article, Iran&#x27;s strategy beats the materially superior US armed forces.

A 2008 article in &quot;International Security&quot; contended that Iran could seal off or impede traffic in the Strait for a month, and an attempt by the U.S. to reopen it would be likely to escalate the conflict. In a later issue, however, the journal published a response which questioned some key assumptions and suggested a much shorter timeline for re-opening.

In December 2011, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy began a ten-day exercise in international waters along the strait. The Iranian Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari stated that the strait would not be closed during the exercise; Iranian forces could easily accomplish that but such a decision must be made at a political level.

Captain John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, was quoted in a December 2011 Reuters article: &quot;Efforts to increase tension in that part of the world are unhelpful and counter-productive. For our part, we are comfortable that we have in the region sufficient capabilities to honor our commitments to our friends and partners, as well as the international community.&quot; In the same article, Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution, said, &quot;The expectation is that the U.S. military could address any Iranian threat relatively quickly.&quot;

General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in January 2012 that Iran &quot;has invested in capabilities that could, in fact, for a period of time block the Strait of Hormuz.&quot; He also stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve invested in capabilities to ensure that if that happens, we can defeat that.&quot;

A May 2012 article by Nilufer Oral, a Turkish researcher of maritime law, concludes that both the UNCLOS and the 1958 Convention on the High Seas would be violated if Iran followed through on its threat to block passage of vessels such as oil tankers, and that the act of passage is not related in law to the imposition of economic sanctions. The article further asserts that a coastal state may prevent &quot;transit or non-suspendable innocent passage&quot; only if: 1) there is threatened or actual use of force, occurring during passage, against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of a state bordering the strait; or 2) the vessel in any other way violates the principles of international law as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.

As of 2013, the treaty had been ratified by 63 states, including most NATO-bloc and Soviet-bloc nations but with the notable exceptions of most of the OPEC and Arab League nations like Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, as well as China, North Korea, and South Korea.

==Alternative shipping routes==

In June 2012, Saudi Arabia reopened the Iraq Pipeline through Saudi Arabia (IPSA), which was confiscated from Iraq in 2001 and travels from Iraq across Saudi Arabia to a Red Sea port. It will have a capacity of 1.65 million barrels per day.

In July 2012, the UAE began using the new Habshan–Fujairah oil pipeline from the Habshan fields in Abu Dhabi to the Fujairah oil terminal on the Gulf of Oman, effectively bypassing the Strait of Hormuz. It has a maximum capacity of around 2 million barrels per day, over three-quarters of the UAE&#x27;s 2012 production rate. The UAE is also increasing Fujairah&#x27;s storage and off-loading capacities. The UAE is building the world&#x27;s largest crude oil storage facility in Fujairah with a capacity of holding 14 million barrels to enhance Fujairah&#x27;s growth as a global oil and trading hub. The Habshan – Fujairah route secures the UAE&#x27;s energy security and has the advantage of being a ground oil pipeline transportation which is considered the cheapest form of oil transportation and also reduces insurance costs as oil tankers would no longer enter the Persian Gulf.

In a July 2012 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article, Gal Luft compared Iran and the Strait of Hormuz to the Ottoman Empire and the Dardanelles, a choke point for shipments of Russian grain a century ago. He indicated that tensions involving the Strait of Hormuz are leading those currently dependent on shipments from the Persian Gulf to find alternative shipping capabilities. He stated that Saudi Arabia was considering building new pipelines to Oman and Yemen, and that Iraq might revive the disused Iraq–Syria pipeline to ship crude to the Mediterranean. Luft stated that reducing Hormuz traffic &quot;presents the West with a new opportunity to augment its current Iran containment strategy.&quot;

<text>A space telescope (also known as space observatory) is a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. Suggested by Lyman Spitzer in 1946, the first operational telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, OAO-2 launched in 1968, and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971. Space telescopes avoid several problems caused by the atmosphere, including the absorption or scattering of certain wavelengths of light, obstruction by clouds, and distortions due to atmospheric refraction such as twinkling. Space telescopes can also observe dim objects during the daytime, and they avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. They are divided into two types: Satellites which map the entire sky (astronomical survey), and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond. Space telescopes are distinct from Earth imaging satellites, which point toward Earth for satellite imaging, applied for weather analysis, espionage, and other types of information gathering.

== History ==

In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer, &quot;father of Hubble&quot; proposed to put a telescope in space. Spitzer&#x27;s proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hindered by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. After lobbying in the 1960s and 70s for such a system to be built, Spitzer&#x27;s vision ultimately materialized into the Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched on April 24, 1990, by the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; (STS-31). This was launched due to many efforts by Nancy Grace Roman, &quot;mother of Hubble&quot;, who was the first Chief of Astronomy and first female executive at NASA. She was a program scientist that worked to convince NASA, Congress, and others that Hubble was &quot;very well worth doing&quot;.

The first operational space telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, OAO-2 launched in 1968, and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971.

== Advantages ==

Performing astronomy from ground-based observatories on Earth is limited by the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation (scintillation or twinkling) due to the atmosphere. A telescope orbiting Earth outside the atmosphere is subject neither to twinkling nor to light pollution from artificial light sources on Earth. As a result, the angular resolution of space telescopes is often much higher than a ground-based telescope with a similar aperture. Many larger terrestrial telescopes, however, reduce atmospheric effects with adaptive optics.

Space-based astronomy is more important for frequency ranges that are outside the optical window and the radio window, the only two wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not severely attenuated by the atmosphere. For example, X-ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from Earth, and has reached its current importance in astronomy only due to orbiting X-ray telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton observatory. Infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked.

== Disadvantages ==
Space telescopes are much more expensive to build than ground-based telescopes. Due to their location, space telescopes are also extremely difficult to maintain. The Hubble Space Telescope was serviced by the Space Shuttle, but most space telescopes cannot be serviced at all.

== Future of space observatories ==
Satellites have been launched and operated by NASA, ISRO, ESA, CNSA, JAXA and the Soviet space program (later succeeded by Roscosmos of Russia). As of 2022, many space observatories have already completed their missions, while others continue operating on extended time. However, the future availability of space telescopes and observatories depends on timely and sufficient funding. While future space observatories are planned by NASA, JAXA and the CNSA, scientists fear that there would be gaps in coverage that would not be covered immediately by future projects and this would affect research in fundamental science.

On 16 January 2023, NASA announced preliminary considerations of several future space telescope programs, including the Great Observatory Technology Maturation Program, Habitable Worlds Observatory, and New Great Observatories.

<text>David (; ; ) was a Welsh Christian prelate who served as Bishop of Mynyw during the 6th century. He is the patron saint of Wales. 

David was a native of Wales, and tradition has preserved a relatively large amount of detail about his life. His birth date, however, is uncertain: suggestions range from 462 to 512. He is traditionally believed to be the son of Non and the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda, king of Ceredigion. The Welsh annals placed his death 569 years after the birth of Christ, but Phillimore&#x27;s dating revised this to 601.

==Hagiography==
Many of the traditional tales about David are found in the &quot;Buchedd Dewi&quot; (&quot;Life of David&quot;), a hagiography written by Rhygyfarch in the late 11th century. Rhygyfarch claimed it was based on documents found in the cathedral archives. Modern historians are sceptical of some of its claims: one of Rhygyfarch&#x27;s aims was to establish some independence for the Welsh church, which had refused the Roman rite until the 8th century and now sought a metropolitan status equal to that of Canterbury (this may apply to the supposed pilgrimage to Jerusalem where he is said to have been anointed as an archbishop by the patriarch).

The tradition that he was born at Henfynyw (Vetus-Menevia) in Ceredigion is not improbable. He became renowned as a teacher and preacher, founding monastic settlements and churches in Wales, Dumnonia, and Brittany. St David&#x27;s Cathedral stands on the site of the monastery he founded in the Glyn Rhosyn valley of Pembrokeshire. Around 550, he attended the Synod of Brefi, where his eloquence in opposing Pelagianism caused his fellow monks to elect him primate of the region. As such he presided over the synod of Caerleon (the &quot;Synod of Victory&quot;) around 569.

His best-known miracle is said to have taken place when he was preaching in the middle of a large crowd at the Synod of Brefi: the village of Llanddewi Brefi stands on the spot where the ground on which he stood is reputed to have risen up to form a small hill. A white dove, which became his emblem, was seen settling on his shoulder. John Davies notes that one can scarcely &quot;conceive of any miracle more superfluous&quot; in that part of Wales than the creation of a new hill. David is said to have denounced Pelagianism during this incident and he was declared archbishop by popular acclaim according to Rhygyfarch, bringing about the retirement of Dubricius. St David&#x27;s metropolitan status as an archbishopric was later supported by Bernard, Bishop of St David&#x27;s, Geoffrey of Monmouth, and Gerald of Wales.

The Monastic Rule of David prescribed that monks had to pull the plough themselves without draught animals, and must drink only water and eat only bread with salt and herbs. The monks spent their evenings in prayer, reading and writing. No personal possessions were allowed: even to say &quot;my book&quot; was considered an offence. He lived a simple life and practised asceticism, teaching his followers to refrain from eating meat and drinking beer. His symbol, also the symbol of Wales, is the leek (this inspires a reference in Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry V, Act V scene 1):
Fluellen: &quot;If your Majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which your Majesty knows, to this hour is an honourable badge of the service, and I do believe, your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy&#x27;s day&quot;. King Henry: &quot;I wear it for a memorable honour; for I am Welsh, you know, good countryman&quot;.

===Connections to Glastonbury===
Rhigyfarch counted Glastonbury Abbey among the churches David founded. Around forty years later William of Malmesbury, believing the Abbey older, said that David visited Glastonbury only to rededicate the Abbey and to donate a travelling altar including a great sapphire. He had had a vision of Jesus who said that &quot;the church had been dedicated long ago by Himself in honour of His Mother, and it was not seemly that it should be re-dedicated by human hands&quot;. So David instead commissioned an extension to be built to the abbey, east of the Old Church. (The dimensions of this extension given by William were verified archaeologically in 1921.) One manuscript indicates that a sapphire altar was among the items Henry VIII of England confiscated from the abbey during the Dissolution of the Monasteries a thousand years later.

==Death==

Though the exact date of his death is not certain, tradition holds that it was on 1 March, which is the date now marked as Saint David&#x27;s Day. The two most common years given for his death are 601 and 589. The monastery is said to have been &quot;filled with angels as Christ received his soul&quot;. His last words to his followers were in a sermon on the previous Sunday. The Welsh Life of St David gives these as, &quot;Arglwyddi, brodyr, a chwiorydd, Byddwch lawen a chadwch eich ffyd a&#x27;ch credd, a gwnewch y petheu bychain a glywsoch ac y welsoch gennyf i. A mwynhau a gerdaf y fford yd aeth an tadeu idi&quot;, which translates as, &quot;Lords, brothers and sisters, Be joyful, and keep your faith and your creed, and do the little things that you have seen me do and heard about. And as for me, I will walk the path that our fathers have trod before us.&quot; &quot;Do ye the little things in life&quot; (&quot;&quot;Gwnewch y pethau bychain mewn bywyd&quot;) is today a very well known phrase in Welsh. The same passage states that he died on a Tuesday, from which attempts have been made to calculate the year of his death.

David was buried at St David&#x27;s Cathedral at St Davids, Pembrokeshire, where his shrine was a popular place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages. During the 10th and 11th centuries the Cathedral was regularly raided by Vikings, who removed the shrine from the church and stripped off the precious metal adornments. In 1275 a new shrine was constructed, the ruined base of which remains to this day (see photo), which was originally surmounted by an ornamental wooden canopy with murals of David, Patrick and Denis. The relics of David and Justinian of Ramsey Island were kept in a portable casket on the stone base of the shrine. It was at this shrine that Edward I came to pray in 1284. During the reformation Bishop Barlow (1536–48), a staunch Protestant, stripped the shrine of its jewels and confiscated the relics of David and Justinian.

==Veneration==
David was officially recognised at the Holy See by Pope Callixtus II in 1120, thanks to the work of Bernard, Bishop of St David&#x27;s. Music for his Liturgy of the Hours has been edited by O. T. Edwards in &quot;Matins, Lauds and Vespers for St David&#x27;s Day: the Medieval Office of the Welsh Patron Saint in National Library of Wales MS 20541 E&quot; (Cambridge, 1990). David was also canonized by the Eastern Orthodox Church at an unknown date.

Over 50 churches in South Wales were dedicated to him in pre-Reformation days.

In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, David is listed under 1 March with the Latin name &quot;Dávus&quot;. He is recognised as bishop of Menevia in Wales who governed his monastery following the example of the Eastern Fathers. Through his leadership, many monks went forth to evangelise Wales, Ireland, Cornwall and Armorica (Brittany and surrounding provinces).

The restored Shrine of Saint David was unveiled and rededicated by the Right Reverend Wyn Evans, Bishop of St David&#x27;s, at a Choral Eucharist on Saint David&#x27;s Day, 2012.

A broadside ballad published around 1630 claimed that the Welsh wore a leek in their hats to commemorate a battle fought on St David&#x27;s Day. So as to recognise friend from foe, the Welsh had pulled up leeks from a garden and put them in their hats, before going on to win the battle.

Saint David is usually represented standing on a hill with a dove on his shoulder.

David is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival and on the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar on 1 March.

==Reputation==

David&#x27;s popularity in Wales is shown by the &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; of around 930, a popular poem which prophesied that in the future, when all might seem lost, the &quot;Cymry&quot; (Welsh people) would unite behind the standard of David to defeat the English; &quot;A lluman glân Dewi a ddyrchafant&quot;&quot; (&quot;And they will raise the pure banner of Dewi&quot;).

David is said to have played a role in spreading Christianity on the continent, inspiring numerous place names in Brittany including Saint-Divy, Saint-Yvi and Landivy.

David&#x27;s life and teachings have inspired a choral work by Welsh composer Karl Jenkins, &quot;Dewi Sant&quot;. It is a seven-movement work best known for the classical crossover series Adiemus, which intersperses movements reflecting the themes of David&#x27;s last sermon with those drawing from three Psalms. An oratorio by another Welsh composer Arwel Hughes, also entitled &quot;Dewi Sant&quot;, was composed in 1950.

Saint David is also thought to be associated with corpse candles, lights that would warn of the imminent death of a member of the community. The story goes that David prayed for his people to have some warning of their death, so that they could prepare themselves. In a vision, David&#x27;s wish was granted and told that from then on, people who lived in the land of Dewi Sant (Saint David) &quot;would be forewarned by the dim light of mysterious tapers when and where the death might be expected&quot;. The colour and size of the tapers indicated whether the person to die would be a woman, man, or child.

<doc id="29010" wikidata="Q48438" url="?curid=29010" title="Saint George">
<text>Saint George (; died 23 April 303), also George of [[Lydda]], was an early Christian martyr who is venerated as a saint in Christianity. According to tradition, he was a soldier in the Roman army. Of Cappadocian Greek origin, he became a member of the Praetorian Guard for Roman emperor Diocletian, but was sentenced to death for refusing to recant his Christian faith. He became one of the most venerated saints, heroes, and megalomartyrs in Christianity, and he has been especially venerated as a military saint since the Crusades. He is respected by Christians, Druze, as well as some Muslims as a martyr of monotheistic faith.

In hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. His feast day, Saint George&#x27;s Day, is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. Historically, the countries of England, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Ukraine, Malta, Ethiopia, the regions of Catalonia and Aragon, and the city of Moscow have claimed George as their patron saint, as have several other regions, cities, universities, professions, and organizations. The Church of Saint George in Lod (Lydda), Israel, has a sarcophagus traditionally believed to contain St. George&#x27;s remains.

==History==

Very little is known about George&#x27;s life. It is thought that he was a Roman military officer of Cappadocian Greek descent, who was martyred under Roman emperor Diocletian in one of the pre-Constantinian persecutions of the 3rd or early 4th century. Beyond this, early sources give conflicting information.

Edward Gibbon argued that George, or at least the legend from which the above is distilled, is based on George of Cappadocia, a notorious 4th-century Arian bishop who was Athanasius of Alexandria&#x27;s most bitter rival, and that it was he who in time became George of England. This identification is seen as highly improbable. Bishop George was slain by Gentile Greeks for exacting onerous taxes, especially inheritance taxes. J. B. Bury, who edited the 1906 edition of Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall&quot;, wrote &quot;this theory of Gibbon&#x27;s has nothing to be said for it&quot;. He adds that &quot;the connection of St. George with a dragon-slaying legend does not relegate him to the region of the myth&quot;. Saint George in all likelihood was martyred before the year 290.
==Legend==

=== Christian legends ===
There is little information on the early life of George. Herbert Thurston in &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states that, based upon an ancient cultus, narratives of the early pilgrims, and the early dedications of churches to George, going back to the fourth century, &quot;there seems, therefore, no ground for doubting the historical existence of St. George&quot;, although no faith can be placed in either the details of his history or his alleged exploits.

The Diocletianic Persecution of 303, associated with military saints because the persecution was aimed at Christians among the professional soldiers of the Roman army, is of undisputed historicity. According to Donald Attwater,


The saint&#x27;s veneration dates to the 5th century with some certainty, and possibly even to the 4th, while the collection of his miracles gradually began during the medieval times. The story of the defeat of the dragon is not part of Saint George&#x27;s earliest hagiographies, and seems to have been a later addition.

The earliest text which preserves fragments of George&#x27;s narrative is in a Greek hagiography which is identified by Hippolyte Delehaye of the scholarly Bollandists to be a palimpsest of the 5th century. An earlier work by Eusebius, &quot;Church history&quot;, written in the 4th century, contributed to the legend but did not name George or provide significant detail. The work of the Bollandists Daniel Papebroch, Jean Bolland, and Godfrey Henschen in the 17th century was one of the first pieces of scholarly research to establish the saint&#x27;s historicity, via their publications in &quot;Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca&quot;. Pope Gelasius I stated in 494 that George was among those saints &quot;whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose actions are known only to God&quot;.

The most complete version, based upon the fifth-century Greek text but in a later form, survives in a translation into Syriac from about 600. From text fragments preserved in the British Library, a translation into English was published in 1925.
In the Greek tradition, George was born to noble Christian parents, in Cappadocia. After his father died, his mother, who was originally from Lydda, in Syria Palaestina (a part of the Byzantine Empire), returned with George to her hometown. He went on to become a soldier for the Roman army; but, because of his Christian faith, he was arrested and tortured, &quot;at or near Lydda, also called Diospolis&quot;; on the following day, he was paraded and then beheaded, and his body was buried in Lydda. According to other sources, after his mother&#x27;s death, George travelled to the eastern imperial capital, Nicomedia, where he was persecuted by one &quot;Dadianus&quot;. In later versions of the Greek legend, this name is rationalised to Diocletian, and George&#x27;s martyrdom is placed in the Diocletian persecution of AD 303. The setting in Nicomedia is also secondary, and inconsistent with the earliest cults of the saint being located in Diospolis.

George was executed by decapitation on 23 April 303. A witness of his suffering convinced Empress Alexandra of Rome to become a Christian as well, so she joined George in martyrdom. His body was buried in Lydda, where Christians soon came to honour him as a martyr.

The Latin &quot;Passio Sancti Georgii&quot; (6th century) follows the general course of the Greek legend, but Diocletian here becomes &quot;Dacian, Emperor of the Persians&quot;. His martyrdom was greatly extended to more than twenty separate tortures over the course of seven years. Over the course of his martyrdom, 40,900 pagans were converted to Christianity, including the Empress Alexandra. When George finally died, the wicked Dacian was carried away in a whirlwind of fire. In later Latin versions, the persecutor is the Roman emperor Decius, or a Roman judge named Dacian serving under Diocletian.

===St. George and the Dragon===
The earliest known record of the legend of Saint George and the Dragon occurs in the 11th century, in a Georgian source, reaching Catholic Europe in the 12th century. In the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, by 13th-century Archbishop of Genoa Jacobus de Voragine, George&#x27;s death was at the hands of Dacian, and about the year 287.

The tradition tells that a fierce dragon was causing panic at the city of Silene, Libya, at the time George arrived there. To prevent the dragon from devastating people from the city, they gave two sheep each day to the dragon, but when the sheep were not enough they were forced to sacrifice humans, elected by the city&#x27;s own people. Eventually, the king&#x27;s daughter was chosen to be sacrificed, and no one was willing to take her place. George saved the girl by slaying the dragon with a lance. The king was so grateful that he offered him treasures as a reward for saving his daughter&#x27;s life, but George refused it and insisted he give them to the poor. The people of the city were so amazed at what they had witnessed that they all became Christians and were baptized.
Saint George&#x27;s encounter with a dragon, as narrated in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, would go on to become very influential, as it remains the most familiar version in English owing to William Caxton&#x27;s 15th-century translation.

In the medieval romances, the lance with which George slew the dragon was called Ascalon, after the Levantine city of Ashkelon, today in Israel. The name &quot;Ascalon&quot; was used by Winston Churchill for his personal aircraft during World War II, according to records at Bletchley Park. Iconography of the horseman with spear overcoming evil was widespread throughout the Christian period.

===Muslim legends===
George (, &quot;Jirjis&quot; or &quot;Girgus&quot;) is included in some Muslim texts as a prophetic figure. The Islamic sources state that he lived among a group of believers who were in direct contact with the last apostles of Jesus. He is described as a rich merchant who opposed erection of Apollo&#x27;s statue by Mosul&#x27;s king Dadan. After confronting the king, George was tortured many times to no effect, was imprisoned and was aided by the angels. Eventually, he exposed that the idols were possessed by Satan, but was martyred when the city was destroyed by God in a rain of fire.

Muslim scholars had tried to find a historical connection of the saint due to his popularity. According to Muslim legend, he was martyred under the rule of Diocletian and was killed three times but resurrected every time. The legend is more developed in the Persian version of al-Tabari wherein he resurrects the dead, makes trees sprout and pillars bear flowers. After one of his deaths, the world is covered by darkness which is lifted only when he is resurrected. He is able to convert the queen but she is put to death. He then prays to God to allow him to die, which is granted.

Al-Thaʿlabi states that George was from Palestine and lived in the times of some disciples of Jesus. He was killed many times by the king of Mosul, and resurrected each time. When the king tried to starve him, he touched a piece of dry wood brought by a woman and turned it green, with varieties of fruits and vegetables growing from it. After his fourth death, the city was burnt along with him. Ibn al-Athir&#x27;s account of one of his deaths is parallel to the crucifixion of Jesus, stating, &quot;When he died, God sent stormy winds and thunder and lightning and dark clouds, so that darkness fell between heaven and earth, and people were in great wonderment.&quot; The account adds that the darkness was lifted after his resurrection.

==Veneration==
===History===

A titular church built in Lydda during the reign of Constantine the Great (reigned 306–337) was consecrated to &quot;a man of the highest distinction&quot;, according to the church history of Eusebius; the name of the &quot;titulus&quot; &quot;patron&quot; was not indicated. The Church of Saint George and Mosque of Al-Khadr located in the city is believed to have housed his remains.

The veneration of George spread from Syria Palaestina through Lebanon to the rest of the Byzantine Empire – though the martyr is not mentioned in the Syriac &quot;Breviarium&quot; – and the region east of the Black Sea. By the 5th century, the veneration of George had reached the Christian Western Roman Empire, as well: in 494, George was canonized as a saint by Pope Gelasius I, among those &quot;which are known better to God than to human beings.&quot;

The early cult of the saint was localized in Diospolis (Lydda), in modern day Israel. The first description of Lydda as a pilgrimage site where George&#x27;s relics were venerated is &quot;De Situ Terrae Sanctae&quot; by the archdeacon Theodosius, written between 518 and 530. By the end of the 6th century, the center of his veneration appears to have shifted to Cappadocia. The &quot;Life&quot; of Saint Theodore of Sykeon, written in the 7th century, mentions the veneration of the relics of the saint in Cappadocia.

By the time of the early Muslim conquests of the mostly Christian and Zoroastrian Middle East, a basilica in Lydda dedicated to George existed. A new church was erected in 1872 and is still standing, where the feast of the translation of the relics of Saint George to that location is celebrated on 3 November each year. In England, he was mentioned among the martyrs by the 8th-century monk Bede. The &quot;Georgslied&quot; is an adaptation of his legend in Old High German, composed in the late 9th century. The earliest dedication to the saint in England is a church at Fordington, Dorset, that is mentioned in the will of Alfred the Great. George did not rise to the position of &quot;patron saint&quot; of England, however, until the 14th century, and he was still obscured by Edward the Confessor, the traditional patron saint of England, until in 1552 during the reign of Edward VI all saints&#x27; banners other than George&#x27;s were abolished in the English Reformation.
Belief in an apparition of George heartened the Franks at the Battle of Antioch in 1098, and a similar appearance occurred the following year at Jerusalem. The chivalric military Order of Sant Jordi d&#x27;Alfama was established by king Peter the Catholic from the Crown of Aragon in 1201, Republic of Genoa, Kingdom of Hungary (1326), and by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. Edward III of England put his Order of the Garter under the banner of George, probably in 1348. The chronicler Jean Froissart observed the English invoking George as a battle cry on several occasions during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In his rise as a national saint, George was aided by the very fact that the saint had no legendary connection with England, and no specifically localised shrine, as that of Thomas Becket at Canterbury: &quot;Consequently, numerous shrines were established during the late fifteenth century,&quot; Muriel C. McClendon has written, &quot;and his did not become closely identified with a particular occupation or with the cure of a specific malady.&quot;
In the wake of the Crusades, George became a model of chivalry in works of literature, including medieval romances. In the 13th century, Jacobus de Voragine, Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the &quot;Legenda Sanctorum&quot;, (&quot;Readings of the Saints&quot;) also known as &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; (the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a best seller.

The establishment of George as a popular saint and protective giant in the West, that had captured the medieval imagination, was codified by the official elevation of his feast to a &quot;festum duplex&quot; at a church council in 1415, on the date that had become associated with his martyrdom, 23 April. There was wide latitude from community to community in celebration of the day across late medieval and early modern England, and no uniform &quot;national&quot; celebration elsewhere, a token of the popular and vernacular nature of George&#x27;s &quot;cultus&quot; and its local horizons, supported by a local guild or confraternity under George&#x27;s protection, or the dedication of a local church. When the English Reformation severely curtailed the saints&#x27; days in the calendar, Saint George&#x27;s Day was among the holidays that continued to be observed.

In April 2019, the parish church of São Jorge, in São Jorge, Madeira Island, Portugal, solemnly received the relics of George, patron saint of the parish. During the celebrations the 504th anniversary of its foundation, the relics were brought by the new Bishop of Funchal, D. Nuno Brás.

===Veneration in the Levant===
George is renowned throughout the Middle East, as both saint and prophet. His veneration by Christians and Muslims lies in his composite personality combining several biblical, Quranic and other ancient mythical heroes. Saint George is the patron saint of Lebanese Christians, Palestinian Christians and Syrian Christians.

William Dalrymple, who reviewed the literature in 1999, tells us that J. E. Hanauer in his 1907 book &quot;Folklore of the Holy Land: Muslim, Christian and Jewish&quot; &quot;mentioned a shrine in the village of Beit Jala, beside Bethlehem, which at the time was frequented by Christians who regarded it as the birthplace of George and some Jews who regarded it as the burial place of the Prophet Elias. According to Hanauer, in his day the monastery was &quot;a sort of madhouse. Deranged persons of all the three faiths are taken thither and chained in the court of the chapel, where they are kept for forty days on bread and water, the Eastern Orthodox priest at the head of the establishment now and then reading the Gospel over them, or administering a whipping as the case demands.&quot; In the 1920s, according to Tawfiq Canaan&#x27;s &quot;Mohammedan Saints and Sanctuaries in Palestine&quot;, nothing seemed to have changed, and all three communities were still visiting the shrine and praying together.&quot;

Dalrymple himself visited the place in 1995. &quot;I asked around in the Christian Quarter in Jerusalem, and discovered that the place was very much alive. With all the greatest shrines in the Christian world to choose from, it seemed that when the local Arab Christians had a problem – an illness, or something more complicated – they preferred to seek the intercession of George in his grubby little shrine at Beit Jala rather than praying at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.&quot; He asked the priest at the shrine &quot;Do you get many Muslims coming here?&quot; The priest replied, &quot;We get hundreds! Almost as many as the Christian pilgrims. Often, when I come in here, I find Muslims all over the floor, in the aisles, up and down.&quot;

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; quotes G. A. Smith in his &quot;Historic Geography of the Holy Land&quot;, p. 164, saying: &quot;The Mahommedans who usually identify St. George with the prophet Elijah, at Lydda confound his legend with one about Christ himself. Their name for Antichrist is Dajjal, and they have a tradition that Jesus will slay Antichrist by the gate of Lydda. The notion sprang from an ancient bas-relief of George and the Dragon on the Lydda church. But Dajjal may be derived, by a very common confusion between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, from Dagon, whose name two neighbouring villages bear to this day, while one of the gates of Lydda used to be called the Gate of Dagon.&quot;

Due to the Christian influence on the Druze faith, two Christian saints have become among the Druze&#x27;s most venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druze and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druzes appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and Saint Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.

===Veneration in the Muslim world===
George is described as a prophetic figure in Islamic sources. George is venerated by some Christians and Muslims because of his composite personality combining several biblical, Quranic and other ancient mythical heroes. In some sources he is identified with Elijah or Mar Elis, George or Mar Jirjus and in others as al-Khidr. The last epithet meaning the &quot;green prophet&quot;, is common to Christian, Muslim, and Druze folk piety. Samuel Curtiss who visited an artificial cave dedicated to him where he is identified with Elijah, reports that childless Muslim women used to visit the shrine to pray for children. Per tradition, he was brought to his place of martyrdom in chains, thus priests of Church of St. George chain the sick especially the mentally ill to a chain for overnight or longer for healing. This is sought after by both Muslims and Christians.

According to Elizabeth Anne Finn&#x27;s &quot;Home in the Holy land&quot; (1866):

The mosque of Nabi Jurjis, which was restored by Timur in the 14th century, was located in Mosul and supposedly contained the tomb of George. It was however destroyed in July 2014 by the occupying Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, who also destroyed the Mosque of the Prophet Sheeth (Seth) and the Mosque of the Prophet Younis (Jonah). The militants claimed that such mosques have become places for apostasy instead of prayer.

George or &quot;Hazrat&quot; Jurjays was the patron saint of Mosul. Along with Theodosius, he was revered by both Christian and Muslim communities of Jazira and Anatolia. The wall paintings of Kırk Dam Altı Kilise at Belisırma dedicated to him are dated between 1282 and 1304. These paintings depict him as a mounted knight appearing between donors including a Georgian lady called Thamar and her husband, the Emir and Consul Basil, while the Seljuk Sultan Mesud II and Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II are also named in the inscriptions.

A shrine attributed to prophet George can be found in Diyarbakır, Turkey. Evliya Çelebi states in his &quot;Seyahatname&quot; that he visited the tombs of prophet Jonah and prophet George in the city.

The reverence for Saint George, who is often identified with Al-Khidr, is deeply integrated into various aspects of Druze culture and religious practices. He is seen as a guardian of the Druze community and a symbol of their enduring faith and resilience. Additionally, Saint George is regarded as a protector and healer in Druze tradition. The story of Saint George slaying the dragon is interpreted allegorically, representing the triumph of good over evil and the protection of the faithful from harm.

===Feast days===
In the General Roman Calendar, the feast of George is on 23 April. In the Tridentine calendar of 1568, it was given the rank of &quot;Semidouble&quot;. In Pope Pius XII&#x27;s 1955 calendar this rank was reduced to &quot;Simple&quot;, and in Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 calendar to a &quot;Commemoration&quot;. Since Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1969 revision, it appears as an &quot;optional memorial&quot;. In some countries such as England, the rank is higher – it is a Solemnity (Roman Catholic) or Feast (Church of England): if it falls between Palm Sunday and the Second Sunday of Easter inclusive, it is transferred to the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.

George is very much honoured by the Eastern Orthodox Church, wherein he is referred to as a &quot;Great Martyr&quot;, and in Oriental Orthodoxy overall. His major feast day is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before Easter, it is celebrated on Easter Monday, instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the consecration of a cathedral dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of Constantine the Great (305–37). When the church was consecrated, the relics of George were transferred there. The other feast is on 26 November for a church dedicated to him in Kyiv, .

In Bulgaria, George&#x27;s day () is celebrated on 6 May, when it is customary to slaughter and roast a lamb. George&#x27;s day is also a public holiday.

In Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbian Orthodox Church refers to George as &quot;Sveti Djordje&quot; (&quot;Свети Ђорђе&quot;) or &quot;Sveti Georgije&quot; (&quot;Свети Георгије&quot;). George&#x27;s day (&quot;Đurđevdan&quot;) is celebrated on 6 May, and is a common &quot;slava&quot; (patron saint day) among ethnic Serbs.

In Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria refers to George () as the &quot;Prince of Martyrs&quot; and celebrates his martyrdom on the 23rd of Paremhat of the Coptic calendar, equivalent to 1 May. The Copts also celebrate the consecration of the first church dedicated to him on the seventh of the month of Hatour of the Coptic calendar usually equivalent to 17 November.

In India, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, one of the oriental catholic churches (Eastern Catholic Churches), and Malankara Orthodox Church venerate George. The main pilgrim centres of the saint in India are at Aruvithura and Puthuppally in Kottayam District, Edathua in Alappuzha district, and Edappally in Ernakulam district of the southern state of Kerala. The saint is commemorated each year from 27 April to 14 May at Edathua. On 27 April after the flag hoisting ceremony by the parish priest, the statue of the saint is taken from one of the altars and placed at the extension of the church to be venerated by devotees till 14 May. The main feast day is 7 May, when the statue of the saint along with other saints is taken in procession around the church. Intercession to George of Edathua is believed to be efficacious in repelling snakes and in curing mental ailments. The sacred relics of George were brought to Antioch from Mardin in 900 and were taken to Kerala, India, from Antioch in 1912 by Mar Dionysius of Vattasseril and kept in the Orthodox seminary at Kundara, Kerala. H.H. Mathews II Catholicos had given the relics to St. George churches at Puthupally, Kottayam District, and Chandanappally, Pathanamthitta district.

George is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival on 23 April.

==Patronages==

George is a highly celebrated saint in both the Western and Eastern Christian churches, and many Patronages of Saint George exist throughout the world.

George is the patron saint of England. His cross forms the national flag of England, which overlaps with Scotland&#x27;s St Andrew&#x27;s flag Blue White Saltire Cross to establish the United Kingdom of Great Britain Union Flag, which is contained in other national flags containing the Union Flag, such as those of Australia and New Zealand. By the 14th century, the saint had been declared both the patron saint and the protector of the royal family.

The country of Georgia, where devotions to the saint date back to the fourth century, is not technically named after the saint, but is a well-attested back-formation of the English name. However, many towns and cities around the world are. George is one of the patron saints of Georgia. Exactly 365 Orthodox churches in Georgia are named after George according to the number of days in a year. According to legend, George was cut into 365 pieces after he fell in battle and every single piece was spread throughout the entire country.

George is the patron saint of Ethiopia. He is also the patron saint of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; George slaying the dragon is one of the most frequently used subjects of icons in the church.

George is also one of the patron saints of the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo. In a battle between the Maltese and the Moors, George was alleged to have been seen with Saint Paul and Saint Agata, protecting the Maltese. George is the protector of the island of Gozo and the patron of Gozo&#x27;s largest city, Victoria. The St. George&#x27;s Basilica in Victoria is dedicated to him.

Devotions to George in Portugal date back to the 12th century. Nuno Álvares Pereira attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the battle of Aljubarrota in 1385 to George. During the reign of John I of Portugal (1357–1433), George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint&#x27;s image on the horse be carried in the &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; procession. The flag of George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. &quot;Portugal and Saint George&quot; became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the Portuguese Army, with simply &quot;Saint George&quot; being the battle cry of the Portuguese Navy.

Devotions to Saint George in Brazil was influenced by the Portuguese colonisation. George is the unofficial patron saint of the city of Rio de Janeiro (title officially attributed to Saint Sebastian) and of the city of São Jorge dos Ilhéus (Saint George of Ilhéus). Additionally, George is the patron saint of Scouts and of the Cavalry of the Brazilian Army. In May 2019, he was made official as the patron saint of the State of Rio de Janeiro, next to Saint Sebastian. George is also revered in several Afro-Brazilian religions, such as Umbanda, where it is syncretized in the form of the orisha Ogun. However, the connection of George with the Moon is purely Brazilian, with a strong influence of African culture, and in no way related to the European saint. Tradition says that the spots at the Moon&#x27;s surface represent the miraculous saint, his horse and his sword slaying the dragon and ready to defend those who seek his help.

George, is also the patron saint of the region of Aragon, in Spain, where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as &quot;Aragon Day&quot;, &quot;or &#x27;Día de Aragón&quot;&#x27; in Spanish. He became the patron saint of the former Kingdom of Aragon and Crown of Aragon when King Pedro I of Aragon won the Battle of Alcoraz in 1096. Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the conquest of the city of Huesca which had been under the Muslim control of the Taifa of Zaragoza. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro&#x27;s own father, King Sancho Ramirez. With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that George descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle. Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energised than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the moors rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca fell and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of St. George was adopted as the personal coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour. After the fall of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, otherwise known as El Cid, with a coalition army from Aragon in the long conquest of the Kingdom of Valencia.

Tales of King Pedro&#x27;s success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands. By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of St. George as a simple, unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.

The Cross of St. George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon&#x27;s provinces.

The association of St. George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages. Indeed, even the author Miguel de Cervantes, in his book on the adventures of Don Quixote, also mentions the jousting events that took place at the festival of St. George in Zaragoza in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.

In Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of St. George go back to their shared history as territories under the Crown of Aragon, thereby sharing the same legend.

One of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the St. George&#x27;s Cross (&quot;Creu de Sant Jordi&quot;). The Sant Jordi Awards have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.

Saint George (&quot;Sant Jordi&quot; in Catalan) is also the patron saint of Catalonia. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the flag of Barcelona, the Catalan capital. A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places George&#x27;s life story as having occurred in the town of Montblanc, near Tarragona.

In 1469, the Order of St. George (Habsburg-Lorraine) was founded in Rome by Emperor Friedrich III of Habsburg in the presence of Pope Paul II in honour of Saint George. The order was continued and promoted by his son, Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg. The later history of the order was eventful, in particular the order was dissolved by Nazi Germany. Only after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe was the order reactivated as a European association in association with Saint George by the Habsburg family.

==Arms and flag==

It became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide attributed arms to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to George of the red cross on a white field in Western art – &quot;Saint George&#x27;s Cross&quot; – probably first arose in Genoa, which had adopted this image for their flag and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A &quot;vexillum beati Georgii&quot; is mentioned in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of George and the dragon. An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genovese flag with the red cross was used alongside this &quot;George&#x27;s flag&quot;, from at least 1218, and was known as the &quot;insignia cruxata comunis Janue&quot; (&quot;cross ensign of the commune of Genoa&quot;). The flag showing the saint himself was the city&#x27;s principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.

In 1348, Edward III of England chose George as the patron saint of his Order of the Garter, and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his Royal Standard.

The term &quot;Saint George&#x27;s cross&quot; was at first associated with any plain Greek cross touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white). Thomas Fuller in 1647 spoke of &quot;the plain or St George&#x27;s cross&quot; as &quot;the mother of all the others&quot; (that is, the other heraldic crosses).

==Iconography==
George is most commonly depicted in early icons, mosaics, and frescos wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a Roman soldier. Particularly after the Fall of Constantinople and George&#x27;s association with the crusades, he is often portrayed mounted upon a white horse. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint&#x27;s death) depicts an armoured George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.

Eastern Orthodox iconography also permits George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.
In the south Lebanese village of Mieh Mieh, the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire) the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).

George may also be portrayed with Saint Demetrius, another early soldier saint. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels Michael and Gabriel. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as George rides a white horse and Demetrius a red horse (the red pigment may appear black if it has bituminized). George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing Maximian.

<doc id="29021" wikidata="Q312226" url="?curid=29021" title="Secular humanism">
<text>Secular humanism is a philosophy, belief system, or life stance that embraces human reason, logic, secular ethics, and philosophical naturalism, while specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, and superstition as the basis of morality and decision-making.

Secular humanism posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or belief in a deity. It does not, however, assume that humans are either inherently good or evil, nor does it present humans as being superior to nature. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through science and philosophy. Many secular humanists derive their moral codes from a philosophy of utilitarianism, ethical naturalism, or evolutionary ethics, and some advocate a science of morality.

Humanists International, founded by Julian Huxley and Jaap van Praag, is the world union of more than one hundred humanist, rationalist, irreligious, atheist, Bright, secular, Ethical Culture, and freethought organizations in more than 40 countries. The &quot;Happy Human&quot; is recognized as the official symbol of humanism internationally, used by secular humanist organizations in every part of the world. 

The term itself is not uncontested. &quot;Secular humanism&quot; is not a universally used phrase, and is most prevalent in the United States. Most member organisations of Humanists International, for example, use simply the term &quot;humanism&quot; to refer to this concept, with some commentators remarking that &quot;&#x27;hyphenated humanism&#x27; easily becomes more about the adjective than its referent&quot;.

==Terminology==
The meaning of the phrase &quot;secular humanism&quot; has evolved over time. The phrase has been used since at least the 1930s by Anglican priests, and in 1943, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, was reported as warning that the &quot;Christian tradition... was in danger of being undermined by a &#x27;Secular Humanism&#x27; which hoped to retain Christian values without Christian faith.&quot; During the 1960s and 1970s the term was embraced by some humanists who considered themselves anti-religious, as well as those who, although not critical of religion in its various guises, preferred a non-religious approach. The release in 1980 of &quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot; by the newly formed Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH, later the Council for Secular Humanism, which with CSICOP in 1991 jointly formed the Center for Inquiry and in 2015 both ceased separate operations, becoming CFI programs) gave secular humanism an organisational identity within the United States; but no overall organisation involved currently uses a name featuring &quot;secular humanism&quot;.

However, many adherents of the approach reject the use of the word &quot;secular&quot; as obfuscating and confusing, and consider that the term &quot;secular humanism&quot; has been &quot;demonized by the religious right... All too often secular humanism is reduced to a sterile outlook consisting of little more than secularism slightly broadened by academic ethics. This kind of &#x27;hyphenated humanism&#x27; easily becomes more about the adjective than its referent&quot;. Adherents of this view, including Humanists International and the American Humanist Association, consider that the unmodified but capitalized word Humanism should be used. The endorsement by the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) of the capitalization of the word &quot;Humanism&quot;, and the dropping of any adjective such as &quot;secular&quot;, is quite recent. The American Humanist Association began to adopt this view in 1973, and the IHEU formally endorsed the position in 1989. In 2002 the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the Amsterdam Declaration, which represents the official defining statement of World Humanism for Humanists. This declaration makes exclusive use of capitalized &quot;Humanist&quot; and &quot;Humanism&quot;, which is consistent with IHEU&#x27;s general practice and recommendations for promoting a unified Humanist identity. To further promote Humanist identity, these words are also free of any adjectives, as recommended by prominent members of IHEU. Such usage is not universal among IHEU member organizations, though most of them do observe these conventions.

==History==
Historical use of the term humanism (reflected in some current academic usage), is related to the writings of pre-Socratic philosophers. These writings were lost to European societies until Renaissance scholars rediscovered them through Muslim sources and translated them from Arabic into European languages. Thus the term humanist can mean a humanities scholar, as well as refer to The Enlightenment/ Renaissance intellectuals, and those who have agreement with the pre-Socratics, as distinct from secular humanists.

===Secularism===
In 1851 George Holyoake coined the term &quot;secularism&quot; to describe &quot;a form of opinion which concerns itself only with questions, the issues of which can be tested by the experience of this life&quot;.

The modern secular movement coalesced around Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh and their intellectual circle. The first secular society, the Leicester Secular Society, dates from 1851. Similar regional societies came together to form the National Secular Society in 1866.

===Positivism and the Church of Humanity===
Holyoake&#x27;s secularism was strongly influenced by Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism and of modern sociology. Comte believed human history would progress in a &quot;law of three stages&quot; from a theological phase, to the &quot;metaphysical&quot;, toward a fully rational &quot;positivist&quot; society. In later life, Comte had attempted to introduce a &quot;religion of humanity&quot; in light of growing anti-religious sentiment and social malaise in revolutionary France. This religion would necessarily fulfil the functional, cohesive role that supernatural religion once served.

Although Comte&#x27;s religious movement was unsuccessful in France, the positivist philosophy of science itself played a major role in the proliferation of secular organizations in the 19th century in England. Richard Congreve visited Paris shortly after the French Revolution of 1848 where he met Auguste Comte and was heavily influenced by his positivist system. He founded the London Positivist Society in 1867, which attracted Frederic Harrison, Edward Spencer Beesly, Vernon Lushington, and James Cotter Morison amongst others.

In 1878, the Society established the Church of Humanity under Congreve&#x27;s direction. There they introduced sacraments of the Religion of Humanity and published a co-operative translation of Comte&#x27;s Positive Polity. When Congreve repudiated their Paris co-religionists in 1878, Beesly, Harrison, Bridges, and others formed their own positivist society, with Beesly as president, and opened a rival centre, Newton Hall, in a courtyard off Fleet Street.

The New York City version of the church was established by English immigrant Henry Edger. The American version of the &quot;Church of Humanity&quot; was largely modeled on the English church. Like the English version, it was not atheistic and had sermons and sacramental rites. At times the services included readings from conventional religious works like the Book of Isaiah. It was not as significant as the church in England, but did include several educated people.

===Ethical movement===
Another important precursor was the ethical movement of the 19th century. The South Place Ethical Society was founded in 1793 as the South Place Chapel on Finsbury Square, on the edge of the City of London, and in the early nineteenth century was known as &quot;a radical gathering-place&quot;. At that point it was a Unitarian chapel, and that movement, like Quakers, supported female equality. Under the leadership of Reverend William Johnson Fox, it lent its pulpit to activists such as Anna Wheeler, one of the first women to campaign for feminism at public meetings in England, who spoke in 1829 on &quot;rights of women&quot;. In later decades, the chapel changed its name to the South Place Ethical Society, now the Conway Hall Ethical Society. Today Conway Hall explicitly identifies itself as a humanist organisation, albeit one primarily focused on concerts, events, and the maintenance of its humanist library and archives. It bills itself as &quot;The landmark of London&#x27;s independent intellectual, political and cultural life.&quot;

In America, the ethical movement was propounded by Felix Adler, who established the New York Society for Ethical Culture in 1877. By 1886, similar societies had sprouted up in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis.

These societies all adopted the same statement of principles:
*The belief that morality is independent of theology;
*The affirmation that new moral problems have arisen in modern industrial society which have not been adequately dealt with by the world&#x27;s religions;
*The duty to engage in philanthropy in the advancement of morality;
*The belief that self-reform should go in lock step with social reform;
*The establishment of republican rather than monarchical governance of Ethical societies;
*The agreement that educating the young is the most important aim.

In effect, the movement responded to the religious crisis of the time by replacing theology with unadulterated morality. It aimed to &quot;disentangle moral ideas from religious doctrines, metaphysical systems, and ethical theories, and to make them an independent force in personal life and social relations.&quot; Adler was also particularly critical of the religious emphasis on creed, believing it to be the source of sectarian bigotry. He therefore attempted to provide a universal fellowship devoid of ritual and ceremony, for those who would otherwise be divided by creeds. Although the organisation was overwhelmingly made up of (and entirely led by) atheists, and were many of the same people as in the secular movement, Ethical organisations at that time publicly avoided debate about religious beliefs, publicly advocating neither atheism nor theism, agnosticism nor deism, instead stressing &quot;deed without creed&quot; and a &quot;purely human basis&quot; for morality.

The first ethical society along these lines in Britain was founded in 1886. By 1896 the four London societies formed the Union of Ethical Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. The Union of Ethical Societies would later incorporate as the Ethical Union, a registered charity, in 1928. Under the leadership of Harold Blackham, it renamed itself the British Humanist Association in 1967. It became the Humanists UK in 2017.

===Secular humanism===
In the 1930s, &quot;humanism&quot; was generally used in a religious sense by the Ethical movement in the United States, and not much favoured among the non-religious in Britain. Yet &quot;it was from the Ethical movement that the non-religious philosophical sense of &quot;Humanism&quot; gradually emerged in Britain, and it was from the convergence of the Ethical and Rationalist movements that this sense of &quot;Humanism&quot; eventually prevailed throughout the Freethought movement&quot;.

As an organised movement in its own right, humanism emerged from vibrant non-religious movements of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the Owenites, Ethical Culture, the freethinkers, secularists, and positivists, as well as a few non-religious radical Unitarian congregations. The first Humanist Manifesto announced the humanist movement by that name to the public in 1933, following work at the University of Chicago across the 1920s. The American Humanist Association was incorporated as an Illinois non-profit organization in 1943. The International Humanist and Ethical Union was founded in 1952, when a gathering of world Humanists met under the leadership of Sir Julian Huxley. The British Humanist Association took that name in 1967, but had developed from the Union of Ethical Societies which had been founded by Stanton Coit in 1896.

==Manifestos and declarations==
Humanists have put together various Humanist Manifestos, in attempts to unify the Humanist identity.

The original signers of the first Humanist Manifesto of 1933, declared themselves to be religious humanists. Because, in their view, traditional religions were failing to meet the needs of their day, the signers of 1933 declared it a necessity to establish a religion that was a dynamic force to meet the needs of the day. However, this &quot;religion&quot; did not profess a belief in any god. Since then two additional Manifestos were written to replace the first. In the Preface of Humanist Manifesto II, in 1973, the authors Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson assert that faith and knowledge are required for a hopeful vision for the future. Manifesto II references a section on religion and states traditional religion renders a disservice to humanity. Manifesto II recognizes the following groups to be part of their naturalistic philosophy: &quot;scientific&quot;, &quot;ethical&quot;, &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;religious&quot;, and &quot;Marxist&quot; humanism.

===International Humanist and Ethical Union===
In 2002, the IHEU General Assembly unanimously adopted the Amsterdam Declaration 2002 which represents the official defining statement of World Humanism.

All member organisations of the International Humanist and Ethical Union are required by bylaw 5.1 to accept the &quot;Minimum Statement on Humanism&quot;:
Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.

To promote and unify &quot;Humanist&quot; identity, prominent members of the IHEU have endorsed the following statements on Humanist identity:
* All Humanists, nationally and internationally, should always use the one word Humanism as the name of Humanism: no added adjective, and the initial letter capital (by life stance orthography);
* All Humanists, nationally and internationally, should use a clear, recognizable and uniform symbol on their publications and elsewhere: our Humanist symbol the &quot;Happy Human&quot;;
* All Humanists, nationally and internationally, should seek to establish recognition of the fact that Humanism is a life stance.

===Council for Secular Humanism===
According to the Council for Secular Humanism, within the United States, the term &quot;secular humanism&quot; describes a world view with the following elements and principles:

*Need to test beliefs – A conviction that dogmas, ideologies and traditions, whether religious, political or social, must be weighed and tested by each individual and not simply accepted by faith.
*Reason, evidence, scientific method – A commitment to the use of critical reason, factual evidence and scientific method of inquiry in seeking solutions to human problems and answers to important human questions.
* Fulfillment, growth, creativity – A primary concern with fulfillment, growth and creativity for both the individual and humankind in general.
* Search for truth – A constant search for objective truth, with the understanding that new knowledge and experience constantly alter our imperfect perception of it.
* This life – A concern for this life (as opposed to an afterlife) and a commitment to making it meaningful through better understanding of ourselves, our history, our intellectual and artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us.
* Ethics – A search for viable individual, social and political principles of ethical conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.
* Justice and fairness – an interest in securing justice and fairness in society and in eliminating discrimination and intolerance.
* Building a better world – A conviction that with reason, an open exchange of ideas, good will, and tolerance, progress can be made in building a better world for ourselves and our children.

&quot;A Secular Humanist Declaration&quot; was issued in 1980 by the Council for Secular Humanism&#x27;s predecessor, CODESH. It lays out ten ideals: Free inquiry as opposed to censorship and imposition of belief; separation of church and state; the ideal of freedom from religious control and from jingoistic government control; ethics based on critical intelligence rather than that deduced from religious belief; moral education; religious skepticism; reason; a belief in science and technology as the best way of understanding the world; evolution; and education as the essential method of building humane, free, and democratic societies.

===American Humanist Association===
A general outline of Humanism is also set out in the &quot;Humanist Manifesto&quot; prepared by the American Humanist Association.

==Ethics and relationship to religious belief==

In the 20th and 21st centuries, members of Humanist organizations have disagreed as to whether Humanism is a religion. They categorize themselves in one of three ways. Religious (or ethical) humanism, in the tradition of the earliest humanist organizations in the UK and US, attempts to fulfil the traditional social role of religion. Contemporary use of the word &quot;religious&quot; did not have the same connotations as its today. Secular humanism considers all forms of religion, including religious humanism, to be superseded.

However, distinctions between &quot;ethical&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; humanists are for the most part historical, and practically meaningless in the present day or to contemporary individuals who identify with humanism. Since the mid-20th century, the development of new concepts such as the &quot;life stance&quot; (which encompasses both humanist views and religious outlooks) has defused this conflict. Most humanist organisations identify with &quot;humanism&quot; without a pre-modifier (such a &quot;secular&quot; or &quot;ethical&quot;) and assert humanism as a non-religious philosophy or approach to life. Generally speaking, all humanists, including religious humanists, reject deference to supernatural beliefs; promote the practical, methodological naturalism of science; and largely endorse the stance of metaphysical naturalism. The result is an approach to issues in a secular way. Humanism addresses ethics without reference to the supernatural as well, attesting that ethics is a human enterprise (see naturalistic ethics).

Accounts of humanism are also careful not to treat secular humanism analogously with religions, which implies a community who strictly attempt to adhere to the same obligations or beliefs. Holding a secular humanist philosophy does not prescribe a specific theory of morality or code of ethics. As stated by the Council for Secular Humanism,
Secular humanists affirm that with the present state of scientific knowledge, dogmatic belief in an absolutist moral or ethical system (e.g. Kantian, Islamic, Christian) is unreasonable. However, it affirms that individuals engaging in rational moral/ethical deliberations can discover some universal &quot;objective standards&quot;.
Many humanists adopt principles of the Golden Rule. Some believe that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society. However, they believe such necessary universality can and should be achieved by developing a richer notion of morality through reason, experience and scientific inquiry rather than through faith in a supernatural realm or source.
Humanists Andrew Copson and Alice Roberts, in their casual introduction to humanism &quot;The Little Book of Humanism&quot;, propose that a distinctive aspect of humanist morality is its recognition that every moral situation is in some sense unique, and so potentially calls for different approach than the last (i.e. the ability to vacillate situationally between consequentialism and virtue ethics). In the book, they quote from Kristen Bell&#x27;s advocacy of moral particularism as developed by Jonathan Dancy.

Humanism is compatible with atheism, and by definition usually entails at least a form of weak or agnostic atheism, and agnosticism,
but being atheist or agnostic does not automatically make one a humanist. Nevertheless, humanism is diametrically opposed to state atheism.
According to Paul Kurtz, considered by some to be the founder of the American secular humanist movement, one of the differences between Marxist–Leninist atheists and humanists is the latter&#x27;s commitment to &quot;human freedom and democracy&quot; while stating that the militant atheism of the Soviet Union consistently violated basic human rights.
Kurtz also stated that the &quot;defense of religious liberty is as precious to the humanist as are the rights of the believers&quot;. Greg M. Epstein states that, &quot;modern, organized Humanism began, in the minds of its founders, as nothing more nor less than a religion without a God&quot;.

Many humanists address ethics from the point of view of ethical naturalism, and some support an actual science of morality.

==Modern context==
Secular humanist organizations are found in all parts of the world. Those who call themselves humanists are estimated to number between four and five million people worldwide in 31 countries, but there is uncertainty because of the lack of universal definition throughout censuses. Humanism is a non-theistic belief system and, as such, it could be a sub-category of &quot;Religion&quot; only if that term is defined to mean &quot;Religion and (any) belief system&quot;. This is the case in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on freedom of religion &quot;and&quot; beliefs. Many national censuses contentiously define Humanism as a further sub-category of the sub-category &quot;No Religion&quot;, which typically includes atheist, rationalist and agnostic thought. In England, Wales 25% of people specify that they have &#x27;No religion&#x27; up from 15% in 2001 and in Australia, around 30% of the population specifies &quot;No Religion&quot; in the national census. In the US, the decennial census does not inquire about religious affiliation or its lack; surveys report the figure at roughly 13%. In the 2001 Canadian census, 16.5% of the populace reported having no religious affiliation. In the 2011 Scottish census, 37% stated they had no religion up from 28% in 2001. One of the largest Humanist organizations in the world (relative to population) is Norway&#x27;s &quot;Human-Etisk Forbund&quot;, which had over 86,000 members out of a population of around 4.6 million in 2013 – approximately 2% of the population.
The International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. It represents the views of over three million Humanists organized in over 100 national organizations in 30 countries. Originally based in the Netherlands, the IHEU now operates from London. Some regional groups that adhere to variants of the Humanist life stance, such as the humanist subgroup of the Unitarian Universalist Association, do not belong to the IHEU. Although the European Humanist Federation is also separate from the IHEU, the two organisations work together and share an agreed protocol.

Starting in the mid-20th century, religious fundamentalists and the religious right began using the term &quot;secular humanism&quot; in hostile fashion. Francis A. Schaeffer, an American theologian based in Switzerland, seizing upon the exclusion of the divine from most humanist writings, argued that rampant secular humanism would lead to moral relativism and ethical bankruptcy in his book &quot;How Should We Then Live: The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture&quot; (1976). Schaeffer portrayed secular humanism as pernicious and diabolical, and warned it would undermine the moral and spiritual tablet of America. His themes have been very widely repeated in Fundamentalist preaching in North America. Toumey (1993) found that secular humanism is typically portrayed as a vast evil conspiracy, deceitful and immoral, responsible for feminism, pornography, abortion, homosexuality, and New Age spirituality. In certain areas of the world, Humanism finds itself in conflict with religious fundamentalism, especially over the issue of the separation of church and state. Many Humanists see religions as superstitious, repressive and closed-minded, while religious fundamentalists may see Humanists as a threat to the values set out in their sacred texts.

In recent years, humanists such as Dwight Gilbert Jones and R. Joseph Hoffmann have decried the over-association of Humanism with affirmations of non-belief and atheism. Jones cites a lack of new ideas being presented or debated outside of secularism, while Hoffmann is unequivocal: &quot;I regard the use of the term &#x27;humanism&#x27; to mean secular humanism or atheism to be one of the greatest tragedies of twentieth century movementology, perpetrated by second-class minds and perpetuated by third-class polemicists and village atheists. The attempt to sever humanism from the religious and the spiritual was a flatfooted, largely American way of taking on the religious right. It lacked finesse, subtlety, and the European sense of history.&quot;

==Humanist celebrations==
Humanism, as a term which describes a person&#x27;s non-religious views, comes with no obligation to celebrate or revere specific days in the year as a religion would. As a result, individual humanists choose of their own accord whether to take part in prevailing national holidays where they live. For example, humanists in Europe and North America typically celebrate holidays, such as Christmas, but as secular holidays rather than Christian festivals. Other humanists choose to mark the winter and summer solstices and the equinoxes. European humanists may often emphasise the fact that human beings have found reasons to celebrate at these times in the Northern Hemisphere for thousands of years before the arrival of Christianity. Humanists may also identify culturally with religious traditions and holidays celebrated in their family in the community. For example, humanists with a Jewish identity will often celebrate most Jewish holidays in a secular manner.

Humanists International endorses World Humanist Day (21 June), Darwin Day (12 February), Human Rights Day (10 December) and HumanLight (23 December) as official days of humanist celebration, though none are yet a public holiday. Humanist organisations typically organise events around these dates which draw attention to their programmes of activities.

In many countries, humanist celebrants (officiants) perform celebrancy services for weddings, funerals, child namings, coming of age ceremonies, and other rituals. In countries like Scotland and Norway, these are extremely popular. In Scotland, more people have a humanist wedding than are married by any religious denomination, including Scotland&#x27;s largest churches; over 20% of Scottish weddings are humanist. In Norway, over 20% of young people choose humanist coming-of-age ceremonies every year.

==Legal mentions in the United States==

The issue of whether and in what sense secular humanism might be considered a religion, and what the implications of this would be, has become the subject of legal maneuvering and political debate in the United States. The first reference to &quot;secular humanism&quot; in a US legal context was in 1961, although church-state separation lawyer Leo Pfeffer had referred to it in his 1958 book, &quot;Creeds in Competition&quot;.

===Hatch amendment===

The Education for Economic Security Act of 1984 included a section, Section 20 U.S.C.A. 4059, which initially read: &quot;Grants under this subchapter [&#x27;Magnet School Assistance&#x27;] may not be used for consultants, for transportation or for any activity which does not augment academic improvement.&quot; With no public notice, Senator Orrin Hatch tacked onto the proposed exclusionary subsection the words &quot;or for any course of instruction the substance of which is Secular Humanism&quot;. Implementation of this provision ran into practical problems because neither the Senator&#x27;s staff, nor the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Labor and Human Resources, nor the Department of Justice could propose a definition of what would constitute a &quot;course of instruction the substance of which is Secular Humanism&quot;. So, this determination was left up to local school boards. The provision provoked a storm of controversy which within a year led Senator Hatch to propose, and Congress to pass, an amendment to delete from the statute all reference to secular humanism. While this episode did not dissuade fundamentalists from continuing to object to what they regarded as the &quot;teaching of Secular Humanism&quot;, it did point out the vagueness of the claim.

===Case law===

====&quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;====
The phrase &quot;secular humanism&quot; became prominent after it was used in the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins.&quot; In the 1961 decision, Justice Hugo Black commented in a footnote, &quot;Among religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism, and others.&quot;

====&quot;Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda&quot;====
The footnote in &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot; referenced &quot;Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda&quot;, a 1957 case in which an organization of humanists sought a tax exemption on the ground that they used their property &quot;solely and exclusively for religious worship.&quot; Despite the group&#x27;s non-theistic beliefs, the court determined that the activities of the &quot;Fellowship of Humanity&quot;, which included weekly Sunday meetings, were analogous to the activities of theistic churches and thus entitled to an exemption. The &quot;Fellowship of Humanity&quot; case itself referred to &quot;Humanism&quot; but did not mention the term &quot;secular humanism&quot;. Nonetheless, this case was cited by Justice Black to justify the inclusion of secular humanism in the list of religions in his note. Presumably Justice Black added the word &quot;secular&quot; to emphasize the non-theistic nature of the &quot;Fellowship of Humanity&quot; and distinguish their brand of humanism from that associated with, for example, Christian humanism.

====&quot;Washington Ethical Society v. District of Columbia&quot;====
Another case alluded to in the &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot; footnote, and said by some to have established secular humanism as a religion under the law, is the 1957 tax case of &quot;&quot;, 249 F.2d 127 (D.C. Cir. 1957). The &quot;Washington Ethical Society&quot; functions much like a church, but regards itself as a non-theistic religious institution, honoring the importance of ethical living without mandating a belief in a supernatural origin for ethics. The case involved denial of the Society&#x27;s application for tax exemption as a religious organization. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court&#x27;s ruling, defined the Society as a religious organization, and granted its tax exemption. The Society terms its practice Ethical Culture. Though Ethical Culture is based on a humanist philosophy, it is regarded by some as a type of religious humanism. Hence, it would seem most accurate to say that this case affirmed that a religion need not be theistic to qualify as a religion under the law, rather than asserting that it established generic secular humanism as a religion.

In the cases of both the &quot;Fellowship of Humanity&quot; and the &quot;Washington Ethical Society,&quot; the court decisions turned not so much on the particular beliefs of practitioners as on the function and form of the practice being similar to the function and form of the practices in other religious institutions.

====&quot;Peloza v. Capistrano School District&quot;====
The implication in Justice Black&#x27;s footnote that secular humanism is a religion has been seized upon by religious opponents of the teaching of evolution, who have made the argument that teaching evolution amounts to teaching a religious idea. The claim that secular humanism could be considered a religion for legal purposes was examined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in &quot;Peloza v. Capistrano School District&quot;, 37 F.3d 517 (9th Cir. 1994), &quot;cert. denied&quot;, 515 U.S. 1173 (1995). In this case, a science teacher argued that, by requiring him to teach evolution, his school district was forcing him to teach the &quot;religion&quot; of secular humanism. The Court responded, &quot;We reject this claim because neither the Supreme Court, nor this circuit, has ever held that evolutionism or Secular Humanism are &#x27;religions&#x27; for Establishment Clause purposes.&quot; The Supreme Court refused to review the case.

The decision in a subsequent case, &quot;Kalka v. Hawk et al.&quot;, offered this commentary:
The Court&#x27;s statement in &quot;Torcaso&quot; does not stand for the proposition that humanism, no matter in what form and no matter how practiced, amounts to a religion under the First Amendment. The Court offered no test for determining what system of beliefs qualified as a &quot;religion&quot; under the First Amendment. The most one may read into the &quot;Torcaso&quot; footnote is the idea that a particular non-theistic group calling itself the &quot;Fellowship of Humanity&quot; qualified as a religious organization under California law.

===Controversy===

Decisions about tax status have been based on whether an organization functions like a church. On the other hand, Establishment Clause cases turn on whether the ideas or symbols involved are inherently religious. An organization can function like a church while advocating beliefs that are not necessarily inherently religious. Author Marci Hamilton has pointed out: &quot;Moreover, the debate is not between secularists and the religious. The debate is believers and non-believers on the one side debating believers and non-believers on the other side. You&#x27;ve got citizens who are [...] of faith who believe in the separation of church and state and you have a set of believers who do not believe in the separation of church and state.&quot;

In the 1987 case of &quot;Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County&quot; a group of plaintiffs brought a case alleging that the school system was teaching the tenets of an anti-religious religion called &quot;secular humanism&quot; in violation of the Establishment Clause. The complainants asked that 44 different elementary through high school level textbooks (including books on home economics, social science and literature) be removed from the curriculum. Federal judge William Brevard Hand ruled for the plaintiffs agreeing that the books promoted secular humanism, which he ruled to be a religion. The Eleventh Circuit Court unanimously reversed him, with Judge Frank stating that Hand held a &quot;misconception of the relationship between church and state mandated by the establishment clause,&quot; commenting also that the textbooks did not show &quot;an attitude antagonistic to theistic belief. The message conveyed by these textbooks is one of neutrality: the textbooks neither endorse theistic religion as a system of belief, nor discredit it&quot;.

<doc id="29027" wikidata="Q751719" url="?curid=29027" title="Game Gear">
<text>The is an 8-bit fourth-generation handheld game console released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in April 1991 throughout North America and Europe, and during 1992 in Australia. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy, the Atari Lynx, and NEC&#x27;s TurboExpress. It shares much of its hardware with the Master System, and can play Master System games through the use of an adapter.

Although the Game Gear was rushed to market, it still went on sale more than a year after the Game Boy. With a full-color backlit screen, a landscape format and a more powerful Z80 CPU, Sega positioned the handheld device as technologically superior to the Game Boy. Ultimately, its unique game library and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress, but its short battery life, large size (due to its screen), lack of original games, and weak support from Sega left the Game Gear unable to surpass the Game Boy, selling 10.62 million units by March 1996. 

The Game Gear was discontinued in 1997. It was re-released as a budget system by Majesco Entertainment between 2000 and 2002, under license from Sega.

==History==
Developed as codename &quot;Project Mercury&quot;, the Game Gear was launched in Japan on October 6, 1990, in North America and Europe in 1991, and in Australia in 1992. Originally retailing at in Japan, in North America, and £99.99 in the United Kingdom, the Game Gear was developed to compete with the Game Boy, which Nintendo had released in 1989. The decision to make a handheld console was made by Sega&#x27;s CEO Hayao Nakayama and the name was chosen by newly appointed Sega of America CEO Michael Katz. Both Sega&#x27;s chairman Isao Okawa and cofounder David Rosen approved of the name. The console had been designed as a portable version of the Master System, with more powerful features than the Game Boy, including a full-color screen instead of monochromatic. According to former Sega console hardware research and development head Hideki Sato, Sega saw the Game Boy&#x27;s black and white screen as &quot;a challenge to make our own color handheld system&quot;.

To improve upon the design of its competition, Sega modeled the Game Gear with a similar shape to a Genesis controller, intending the curved surfaces and greater length more comfortable to hold than the Game Boy. The console&#x27;s mass was carefully considered from the beginning of the development, aiming for a total mass between that of the Game Boy and the Atari Lynx, another full-color screen competing product. Game Gear can use the Master Gear adaptor to play games from the similar Master System. The original Game Gear pack-in game is &quot;Columns&quot;, which is similar to &quot;Tetris&quot; which was bundled with the Game Boy launch.
With a late start into the handheld console market, Sega rushed to get the Game Gear into stores quickly, having lagged behind Nintendo in sales without a handheld on the market. As one method of doing so, Sega based the Game Gear hardware on the Master System, with a much larger 4,096 color palette compared to the Master System&#x27;s 64 colors. Part of the intention was easy conversion of Master System games. The Game Gear&#x27;s technological superiority over Game Boy means that Game Boy can run for more than 30 hours on four AA batteries and the Game Gear runs for three to five hours on six AA batteries. Its quick launch in Japan sold 40,000 units in its first two days, 90,000 within a month, and more than 600,000 back orders. According to Sega of America marketing director Robert Botch, &quot;there is clearly a need for a quality portable system that provides features other systems have failed to deliver. This means easy-to-view, full-color graphics and exciting quality games that appeal to all ages.&quot;

===Release and marketing===
Before the Game Gear&#x27;s launch in 1990, the 16-bit Genesis had been successfully marketed as a &quot;more mature&quot; option for players, and this was repeated against the Game Boy. Sega&#x27;s marketing in Japan did not take this perspective, instead opting for advertisements with Japanese women featuring the handheld, but Sega&#x27;s worldwide advertising prominently positioned the Game Gear as the &quot;cooler&quot; console than the Game Boy.

In North America, marketing for the Game Gear includes side-by-side comparisons against the Game Boy and liken Game Boy players to the obese and uneducated. Most of those advertisements feature the &quot;Sega Scream&quot; with a person yelling the name. One Sega advertisement in early 1994 features the quote, &quot;If you were color blind and had an IQ of less than 12, then you wouldn&#x27;t mind which portable you had.&quot; Such advertising drew outrage from Nintendo, who sought to have protests organized against Sega for insulting disabled persons. Sega of America president Tom Kalinske responded that Nintendo &quot;should spend more time improving their products and marketing rather than working on behind-the-scenes coercive activities&quot;. Ultimately, this debate would have little impact on sales for the Game Gear.

Europe and Australia were the last regions to receive the Game Gear. Due to delays, some importers paid up to £200. Upon launch in Europe, video game distributor Virgin Mastertronic unveiled the price as £99.99, positioning it as being more expensive than the Game Boy, but less expensive than the also full-color Atari Lynx. Marketing in the United Kingdom includes the slogan, &quot;To be this good takes Sega&quot;, and advertisements with a biker. In the United Kingdom, the Game Gear had a 16% share of the handheld market in January 1992, increasing to 40% by December 1992.

===Decline===
Sega reduced support for the Game Gear in favor of home consoles. The successful Genesis yielded two major peripherals, the Sega CD and the 32X. Sega&#x27;s new 32-bit Saturn console was launched in 1994. Though selling 10.62 million units by March 1996 (including 1.78 million in Japan), the Game Gear was never able to match the success of its main rival, the Game Boy, with ten times the sales. Game Gear&#x27;s late sales were further hurt by Nintendo&#x27;s release of the smaller Game Boy Pocket running on two AAA batteries.

Plans for a 16-bit fifth generation direct successor to the Game Gear were made and canceled, leaving only the Genesis Nomad, a portable version of the Genesis. Moreover, the Nomad was intended to supplement the Game Gear rather than replace it; in press coverage leading up to the Nomad&#x27;s release, Sega representatives said the company was not discontinuing the Game Gear in favor of the Nomad, and that &quot;We believe the two can co-exist&quot;. Though the Nomad had been released in 1995, Sega did not officially end support for the Game Gear until 1996 in Japan, and 1997 worldwide.

Though the system was originally discontinued in 1997, third-party publisher Majesco Entertainment released a version of the Game Gear at , with games in the year 2000 under license from Sega. New games were released, such as a port of &quot;Super Battletank&quot;. This machine is compatible with all previous Game Gear games, but incompatible with the TV Tuner and some Master System adaptors. The system and its re-released games were likely sold throughout 2000 and 2001 but were likely discontinued the following year. Over ten years later, on March 2, 2011, Nintendo announced that its 3DS Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop would feature Game Gear games.

==Technical specifications==

The Game Gear is designed to be compatible with Master System games and consequently, many of its internal components were inherited from that system. It shares the same CPU, the Zilog Z80, an 8-bit processor clocked at 3.5MHz, and the same sound chip, a Texas Instruments SN76489, a programmable sound generator. The chip generated stereo sound, audible using headphones as the device only included a single monaural speaker. The system also contains 8KB of RAM and 16KB of video RAM.

The Game Gear is wide, high, deep, and was designed to be played horizontally. At the center of the device was its color liquid-crystal display that measures diagonally and is able to display up to 32 simultaneous colors from a total palette of 4,096, with a frame rate of about 60Hz with 160×144 non-square pixels. The screen is backlit for low light using a small cold cathode fluorescent lamp tube. 

The Game Gear was powered by six AA batteries which provided an approximate battery life of 3 to 5 hours, a source of significant criticism from reviewers. To lengthen play time and reduce consumer cost, Sega released two types of external rechargeable battery packs. 
Available accessories included a TV Tuner with a whip antenna for the cartridge slot, to become a handheld television. Released at (equivalent to ), the add-on was expensive but unique for collectors and contributed to the system&#x27;s popularity. The Super Wide Gear magnifies the screen. The Car Gear adapter plugs into cigarette lighters to power the system while traveling, and the Gear to Gear Cable (VS Cable in Japan) establishes a data connection between two Game Gear systems using the same multiplayer game. Master Gear enables the Game Gear to play Master System games.

Game Gear model variations include several colors, including a blue &quot;sports&quot; variation in North America bundled with &quot;World Series Baseball &#x27;95&quot; or &quot;The Lion King&quot;. A white version was bundled with a TV tuner. Other versions include a red Coca-Cola theme bundled with &quot;Coca-Cola Kid&quot;, and the Kids Gear Japan-only variation for children.

==Game library==

Over 300 total Game Gear games were released, although only six launch games. Prices for game cartridges initially ranged from $24.99 to $29.99. The casings are molded black plastic with a rounded front to aid in removal. Games include &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;The GG Shinobi&quot;, &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, and &quot;Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;, which was considered the best game for the system by &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;. Later games include franchises that had originated on the successful 16-bit Genesis and much of the Game Gear&#x27;s library is Master System ports. Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear&#x27;s screen and the similarities to Master System hardware, it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the Game Gear.

Because of Nintendo&#x27;s control over the console video game market, few third-party developers were available to create games for Sega&#x27;s systems. This contributed to the many ports from Master System. Likewise, because of this, much of the Game Gear library is unique among handhelds, pulling sales away from the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress and helping to establish the Game Gear&#x27;s market position. However, the Game Boy&#x27;s library is over 1000 individual games. Several Game Gear games were released years later on the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop. The emulator for the Virtual Console releases was handled by M2.

==Game Gear Micro==
On June 3, 2020, as part of its 60th anniversary, Sega revealed the retroconsole. The Micro was released in Japan on October 6, 2020, through Japanese storefronts in four different versions, varying in color and the game selection, with each containing four separate Game Gear games. Each unit otherwise is the same size, measuring with a display, and is powered by 2 AAA batteries or through a separate USB charger. Each unit also includes a headphone jack. A magnifying accessory modeled after the original system&#x27;s Big Window accessory was included with preorders. A special version of the device (published by M2 and licensed by Sega) was being shipped with a limited edition of &quot;Aleste Collection&quot; in December 2020. This version includes a newly developed Game Gear title &quot;G.G. Aleste 3&quot; as well as four other &quot;Aleste&quot; titles.

==Reception==
Game Gear surpassed the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress, but lagged far behind the Game Boy in the handheld marketplace. Retrospective reception to the Game Gear is mixed. In 2008, &quot;GamePro&quot; listed the Game Gear as 10th on its list of the &quot;10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time&quot; and criticized aspects of the implementation of its technology, but also stated that the Game Gear could be considered a commercial success at nearly 11 million units sold. According to &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer Blake Snow, &quot;Unlike the Game Boy, the Game Gear rocked the landscape holding position, making it less cramped for human beings with two hands to hold. And even though the Game Gear could be considered a success, its bulky frame, relative high price, constant consumption of AA batteries, and a lack of appealing games ultimately kept Sega from releasing a true successor.&quot; In speaking with &quot;Famitsu DC&quot; for its November 1998 issue, Sato stated that the Game Gear achieved &quot;a respectable chunk of market share&quot; since overall &quot;about 14 million systems&quot; were sold, but that &quot;Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy was such a runaway success, and had gobbled up so much of the market, that our success was still seen as a failure, which I think is a shame.&quot;

&quot;GamesRadar+&quot; offered some praise for the system and its library, stating: &quot;With its 8-bit processor and bright color screen, it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands. How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic, Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car, or in the dark when we were supposed to be sleeping? You couldn&#x27;t do that on a Game Boy!&quot; By contrast, &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Levi Buchanan stated the Game Gear&#x27;s biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy, stating: &quot;the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival, which was bathed in quality games. It didn&#x27;t matter that the Game Gear was more powerful. The color screen did not reverse any fortunes. Content and innovation beat out technology, a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii.&quot; Buchanan praised some of the library: &quot;Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games, and fun is resilient against time.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; praised Sega&#x27;s accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear, noting that &quot;for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out, Sega&#x27;s Game Gear managed to last the longest, only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP. For its fans, it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever.&quot;

<text>The 32X is an add-on for the Sega Genesis video game console. Codenamed &quot;Project Mars&quot;, it was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the 32-bit era until the release of the Sega Saturn. The 32X uses its own ROM cartridges and has its own library of games. It was distributed under the name in Japan and South Korea, Genesis 32X in North America, Mega 32X in Brazil, and Mega Drive 32X in all other regions. 

Sega unveiled the 32X at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994, and presented it as a low-cost option for 32-bit games. It was developed in response to the Atari Jaguar and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994. Though the 32X was conceived as a new, standalone console, at the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, it became an add-on for the Genesis and made more powerful. The final design contained two 32-bit central processing units and a visual display processor. 

The 32X failed to attract third-party video game developers and consumers because of the announcement of the Saturn&#x27;s simultaneous release in Japan. Sega&#x27;s efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into time for game development, resulting in a weak library of 40 games that did not fully use the hardware, including Genesis ports. Sega produced 800,000 32X units and sold an estimated 665,000 by the end of 1994, selling the rest at steep discounts until it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn. 

The 32X is considered a commercial failure. Initial reception was positive, highlighting the low price and power expansion to the Genesis. However, later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, were mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and its market fragmentation of the Genesis.

==History==
The Sega Genesis was released in 1988. By early 1994, Sega had started to become concerned about competition from newer, more powerful 32-bit consoles, such as the Atari Jaguar and the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The Sega CD, a previous add-on for the Genesis, had not met commercial expectations, and the Genesis&#x27; successor, the Sega Saturn, would not be fully rolled out worldwide until late 1995. This left a nearly two-year gap that Sega worried would allow its competitors to gain traction. According to former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske, in regards to discussing about the longevity of the Genesis, &quot;Initially, the argument was that we could get another year of life out of the Genesis before we had to introduce the Saturn. Japan disagreed with me on that, so as kind of a stopgap measure, the 32X came up.&quot;

===Development===
During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Sega president Hayao Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Atari Jaguar. Included on this call were Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. One idea mooted by the Japanese team, referred to by former Sega of America producer Michael Latham as &quot;Genesis 2&quot;, was an entirely new independent console. This would have been a new Genesis model with an upgraded color palette and some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip.

According to Latham, Miller dismissed an upgraded Genesis as &quot;just a horrible idea. If all you&#x27;re going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. If it&#x27;s a new system with legitimate new software, great. But if the only thing it does is double the colors...&quot; Miller said his idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system in the form of an add-on. From these discussions, the new add-on, codenamed &quot;Project Mars&quot;, was advanced.

With Miller pushing for his American team to create the system, the 32X was designed as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit SuperH-2 processors, the same as those that would be used in the Saturn but with a lower clock speed. The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company Hitachi. The original design for the 32X add-on, according to Bayless, was created on a cocktail napkin, but Miller denied this. In another account, Bayless claimed that Franz began designing the 32X on a hotel notepad, drawing two SH-2 processors with separate framebuffers. 

Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games. This was justified by Sega&#x27;s statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it &quot;a coder&#x27;s dream for the day&quot; with its twin processors and 3D capabilities. Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato&#x27;s team in Japan. Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.

Before the 32X was launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X&#x27;s target launch date in North America. Sega of America was tasked with marketing the 32X with the Saturn&#x27;s Japan release occurring simultaneously. Their answer was to describe the 32X a &quot;transitional device&quot; between the Genesis and the Saturn; Bayless said this &quot;just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers&quot;.

===Promotion and release===

The unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago. Promoted as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s entry into &#x27;next generation&#x27; games&quot;, 32X was marketed for its US$159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn. However, Sega would not answer as to whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software. Trip Hawkins, founder of The 3DO Company, was willing to point out that it would not, stating, &quot;Everyone knows that 32X is a Band-Aid. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;next generation system.&#x27; It&#x27;s fairly expensive. It&#x27;s not particularly high-performance. It&#x27;s hard to program for, and it&#x27;s not compatible with the Saturn.&quot; In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis games, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. 

In August of that year, &quot;GamePro&quot; highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that &quot;[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or PlayStation systems and games from Japan. For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in &#x27;94.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; was more critical, questioning if the 32X was only there to fill in as a stopgap for the Christmas season in the US and Europe, and referred to the Japanese release as a &quot;PR exercise and quick money maker [rather] than a serious bid to get the machine into every home&quot;. Responding to concerns over the 32X being a stopgap, Kalinske said, &quot;Saturn will be at a price point that will not make it a massmarket item. In terms of volume and keeping the category exciting, it&#x27;s Genesis and 32X.&quot;

The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the holiday season that year. As announced, it retailed for $159.99 without a pack-in game. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system. Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. In the United States, nearly 500,000 units were sold by Christmas 1994, exceeding Sega&#x27;s initial sales projection. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn&#x27;s price would be at launch. The European release came in November 1994, at a price of £169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.

Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers. Despite Sega&#x27;s initial promises, only six games were available at its North American launch, including &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Arcade&quot;, &quot;Virtua Racing Deluxe&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Carnage&quot;. Although &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; was considered strong, &quot;Cosmic Carnage&quot; &quot;looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it&quot;. Games were available at a retail price of $69.95. Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an &quot;arcade system&quot;. Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, two weeks after the launch of the Saturn in the region. The 32X launched in Brazil in March 1995.

===Decline===
Despite the lower price console&#x27;s positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was &quot;a technological dead-end&quot;, many developers decided not to make games for the system. Problems plagued games developed in-house due to the 32X&#x27;s quick development time. According to Bayless, &quot;games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of.&quot; Kalinske has said that Sega of America did not receive enough support from Japan in game development. Development kits came out late, leaving little time for game development before the 32X release. According to one developer, the 32X&#x27;s hardware was significantly slower than the Saturn and lacked the capability for texture mapping.

Journalists were similarly concerned about Sega&#x27;s tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega&#x27;s approach to that of General Motors and segmenting the market for its consoles. In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to San Francisco for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Kalinske, live music with a local rapper, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.

Though the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32X&#x27;s third party publishers, including Capcom and Konami, cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation. The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a commercial failure. By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995. Sega was supporting five different consoles before this—Saturn, Genesis, Game Gear, Pico, and the Master System—as well as the Sega CD and 32X add-ons. Sales estimates for the 32X stood at 665,000 units at the end of 1994. Despite assurances from Sega that many games would be developed for the system, in early 1996, Sega finally conceded that it had promised too much out of the add-on and decided to discontinue the 32X in order to focus on the Saturn. In September 1995, the retail price for the 32X dropped to $99, and later the remaining inventory was cleared out of stores at $19.95, with 800,000 units sold in total.

===Sega Neptune===
The Sega Neptune is an unproduced two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega planned to release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned to be under $200. It was featured as early as March 1995, with &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; saying the console &quot;shows [Sega&#x27;s] commitment to the hardware&quot;, and that the system would be compatible with the Mega-CD. Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced too close to the Saturn to be a viable competitor. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for $199.

==Technical aspects and specifications==

The 32X can be used only in conjunction with a Genesis system. It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge. The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis. As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons. The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the Sega Genesis CDX system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of electric shock when the 32X and CDX were connected. Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis&#x27; cartridge slot.

Seated on top of a Genesis, the 32X measures . The 32X contains two Hitachi SH-2 32-bit RISC processors with a clock speed of 23 MHz, which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis. Its graphics processing unit is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000 polygons per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis. The 32X also includes 256 kilobytes of random-access memory (RAM), along with 256 kilobytes of video RAM. Sound is supplied through a pulse-width modulation sound source. Input/output is supplied to a television set via a provided A/V cable that supplies composite video and stereo audio, or through an RF modulator. Stereo audio can also be played through headphones via a headphone jack on the attached Genesis.

==Game library==
The 32X library consists of 40 games, including six that required both the 32X and Sega CD. Among them were ports of arcade games &quot;After Burner&quot;, &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars Arcade&quot;, a sidescroller with a hummingbird as a main character in &quot;Kolibri&quot;, and a 32X-exclusive &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; spinoff, &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot;. Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced ports of Genesis games, including &quot;NFL Quarterback Club&quot; and &quot;World Series Baseball &#x27;95&quot;. In a retrospective review of the console, &quot;Star Wars Arcade&quot; was considered the best game for the 32X by &quot;IGN&quot; for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In a separate review, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Levi Buchanan praised the 32X game &quot;Shadow Squadron&quot; as superior to &quot;Star Wars Arcade&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writer Damien McFerran, however, praised &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as &quot;the jewel in the 32X&#x27;s crown&quot;, and &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; named &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; as the best game for the system. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; &quot;the colorful wreath on 32X&#x27;s coffin&quot;, reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32X&#x27;s best release and a clear harbinger of the platform&#x27;s imminent discontinuation, since it was inferior to the already-released Saturn version of &quot;Virtua Fighter Remix&quot;, as well as the forthcoming Saturn release of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;.

Despite its 32-bit processing and potential for better graphics and sound than the Genesis, most games did not take advantage of the 32X hardware. &quot;Doom&quot; for the 32X received near-perfect reviews, but was later criticized as inferior to versions for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with missing levels, poor graphics and audio, jerky movement, and windowed gameplay. Franz believes few developers were willing to invest in designing games to work with the 32X&#x27;s improved audio abilities. One cause was the rush to release games for the 32X launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham said it took &quot;a lot of convincing&quot; to release the 32X launch game &quot;Cosmic Carnage.&quot; With &quot;Doom&quot;, id Software programmer John Carmack had to cut a third of the levels to have the game ready for the 32X launch. Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. Another factor was the architecture of the 32X&#x27;s dual processors and graphics processor having difficulty accessing RAM, leading to developers choosing to only use one processor for their games. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero insisted that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, but acknowledged that first-party support had been lackluster: &quot;I won&#x27;t lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Initial reception to the 32X and its games upon the launch of the add-on was positive. Four reviewers from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; graded the 32X well in their 1995 Buyer&#x27;s Guide, highlighting the add-on&#x27;s enhancements to the Genesis but questioning how long the system would be supported: one reviewer suggested the add-on had a &quot;bright future&quot; while another believed it was only meant to last until the release of the Saturn. A reviewer for &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that the 32X&#x27;s multiple input and power cords make it &quot;as complicated as setting up your VCR&quot; and noted some performance glitches with the prototype such as freezes and overheating, but expressed confidence that the production models would perform well and gave the add-on their overall approval. 

By late 1995, feedback to the add-on had soured. In its 1996 Buyer&#x27;s Guide, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;&#x27;s four reviewers scored the add-on 3, 3, 3, and 2 out of 10, criticizing the game library and Sega&#x27;s abandonment of the system in favor of the Saturn. A review in &quot;Next Generation&quot; panned the 32X for its weak polygon processing, the tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games, and its apparent function as &quot;simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for Saturn&quot;. The review gave it one out of five stars. &quot;Game Players&quot; assessed it as so much less powerful than the Saturn and PlayStation that its lower price could not be considered an enticement, and said that the vast majority of its games could have been done just as well on the Super NES. Additionally commenting that both first party and third party software support had been weak, they concluded, &quot;The lack of support [and] good games, and the release of Saturn make the 32X a system that never was.&quot;

Retrospectively, the 32X is widely criticized as having a shallow library with a lack of support and a poor idea in the wake of the release of the Sega Saturn in Japan. &quot;1UP.com&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X &quot;tainted just about everything it touched.&quot; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that &quot;it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&#x27;&quot;s Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;After Burner&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on&#x27;s price point, stating, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it&#x27;s just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness.&quot; Levi Buchanan, writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. According to Buchanan, &quot;I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one.&quot;

In particular, the console&#x27;s status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega&#x27;s video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. &quot;Allgame&quot;&#x27;s Scott Alan Marriott states that &quot;[e]very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. According to reviewer Blake Snow, &quot;Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if you were one of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega&#x27;s add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog.&quot; Writing for &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;, Reparaz noted that &quot;developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn&#x27;t split their user base with pricey add-ons.&quot; Reparaz went on to criticize Sega&#x27;s decision to release the 32X, noting that &quot;(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out.&quot; Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Buchanan points out, &quot;Notice that we haven&#x27;t seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that&#x27;s a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience.&quot;

Former executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X. Bayless believed firmly that the 32X served as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. Franz placed the 32X&#x27;s commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD. Miller remembered the 32X and his vision for the console positively, but conceded that the timing was wrong with the Saturn on the horizon.

<doc id="29031" wikidata="Q321219" url="?curid=29031" title="Severan dynasty">
<text>The Severan dynasty, sometimes called the [[Septimia gens|Septimian]] dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire between 193 and 235.
It was founded by the emperor Septimius Severus () and Julia Domna, his wife, when Septimius emerged victorious from civil war of 193 - 197, which begun with the Year of the Five Emperors.
Their two sons, Caracalla () and Geta (), ruled briefly after the death of Septimius.
In 217 - 218 there was a short interruption of dynasty&#x27;s control over the empire by reigns of Macrinus () and his son Diadumenian () before Julia Domna&#x27;s relatives assumed power by raising her two grandnephews, Elagabalus () and Severus Alexander (), in succession to the imperial office.

The dynasty&#x27;s women, Julia Domna, the mother of Caracalla and Geta, and her sister, Julia Maesa, the mother of Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, mothers of Elagabalus and Severus Alexander respectively, were all powerful &quot;augustae&quot;.
They were also instrumental in securing imperial positions for their male relatives.

Although Septimius Severus restored peace following the upheaval of the late 2nd century, the dynasty&#x27;s rule was disturbed by unstable family relationships and political instability, especially the rising power of the praetorian prefects.
All this foreshadowed the Crisis of the Third Century.

==History==

* denotes Junior Emperors
* denotes Caesars (official heirs)
===Septimius Severus (193–211)===
In April 9 145, Lucius Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, then in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis and now in Libya, into a Libyan-punic family of equestrian rank. He rose through military service to consular rank under the later emperors of the Antonine dynasty.
In summer 187 he married a Syrian noblewoman Julia Domna and the marriage produced two boys: Caracalla and Geta.
Julia Domna also held a prominent political role in government during her husband&#x27;s reign.
Severus was proclaimed emperor in 193 by his legionaries in Noricum during the political unrest that followed the death of Commodus,
and secured sole rule over the empire in early 197, after defeating Clodius Albinus at the Battle of Lugdunum.

In late 197 Severus fought a successful war against the Parthians, between 208 and 210 he campaigned with success against barbarian incursions in Roman Britain and rebuilt Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. In Rome, his relations with the Senate were poor, but he was popular with the commoners and with his soldiers, whose salary he raised. Starting in 197, his praetorian prefect, Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, was growing in influence, but he would be executed in 205.
Septimius died, from natural causes, in early 211 while on campaign in Britain.

During his reign, Severus debased the Roman currency several times -- for example upon his accession he decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 81.5% to 78.5%.
The Jews experienced more favorable conditions under the Severan dynasty: According to Jerome, both Septimius Severus and Antoninus &quot;very greatly cherished the Jews.&quot;

Septimius was succeeded by his sons Caracalla and Geta, whom he had elevated as co-emperors in the years preceding his death. The growing hostility between the brothers was initially buffered by Julia Domna&#x27;s mediation.

===Caracalla (198–217)===

The eldest son of Severus, born in 188 as Lucius Septimius Bassianus.
&quot;Caracalla&quot; was a nickname referring to the Gallic hooded tunic that he habitually wore.
In 195 Severus made him caesar and renamed him to Aurelius Antonius Marcus after Marcus Aurelius.
A while later, in 198, Severus made him augustus while also naming Caracalla&#x27;s younger brother, Geta, to caesar.

Caracalla hated his brother, and conflict between them culminated in the assassination of the latter in 211.
After the murder of his brother, Caracalla tried and gained goodwill of his legionaries with lavish pay raises. However, he also purged many of Geta&#x27;s supporters.

During his campaigns Caracalla let her [whose?] mother, who accompanied her son, to handle many official matters by correspondence and refer to him only major issues.
In 213 he campaigned against the Alamanni, and in 214 he fought with the Danubian Carpi.
Later he raised a Macedonian phalanx to emulate Alexander the Great, and marched through Asia and Syria to Alexandria, inviting mockery of many whom he executed.
During his reign he bestowed, for reasons not entirely clear, Roman citizenship to all non-slaves living within the borders of the empire.
The Baths of Caracalla in Rome are the most enduring monument of his rule.

Caracalla died in April 8 217. He was murdered near Carrhae while en route to a campaign against the Partians, the murder being committed by an evocatus attached to the Praetorian Guard on the order of a preatorian prefect, the future emperor Macrinus.

===Geta (209–211)===

The younger of Severus&#x27; two sons, Geta, was born in 189.
He was made caesar in 198 and co-&quot;augustus&quot; in 209 or 210 alongside his father and older brother Caracalla. Unlike the much more successful joint reign of Marcus Aurelius () and his brother Lucius Verus () the previous century, relations were hostile between the two Severan brothers, and soon after their father&#x27;s death Geta was murdered by his brother Caracalla.
Geta was murdered in their mother&#x27;s apartments, and died clung to his mother, by order of Caracalla, who then ruled as sole emperor.

===Interlude: Macrinus (217–218)===

Macrinus was the first Roman emperor who did not come from a senatorial family.
He was born in 164 at Caesarea in Mauretania, now Cherchell, Algeria.
Though not related to Severans while also being of just equestrian rank and having been born into a Moorish family, he rose through the ranks all the way to being a praetorian prefect under Caracalla.
In 217 Macrinus became involved in a successful conspiracy to kill Caracalla, and soon after the murder trooops saluted Macrinus as .

His made peace with the Parthian Empire, which involved paying reparations for the damage caused by Caracalla&#x27;s campaigns.
His troops considered the terms degrading to the Romans.
One of the reasons for his eventual downfall was his attempt at saving by paying serving soldiers of the Eastern troops by higher pay scales established during the rule of Caracalla while paying the new recruits by lower pay scales from the time of Septimius -- his troops were not impressed.
Due to a continuing threat from Parthia, he kept the rebellious forces in Syria, where they became one way or the other acquainted with Elagabalus.

In May 218 troops camping near Elesa revolted and hailed Elegabalus as emperor.
After months of rebellion and a failed attack on the rebellious troops, Macrinus met the army of Elagabalus near Antioch where he was decisively defeated.
Macrinus managed to escape with his son to Chalcedon where he was apprehended to be taken back to Antioch, but the guards murdered him en route.
During his rule Macrinus never entered the city of Rome.

===Elagabalus (218–222)===


Elagabalus was born Varius Avitus Bassianus in 203 and became known later as Marcus Aurelius Antonius.
The name &quot;Elagabalus&quot; followed the Latin nomenclature for the Syrian sun god Elagabal, of whom he was a priest.
At the age of 14, in 218, Elagabalus was crowned emperor by Gallic Third Legion.

There are two different versions how Elagabalus gained the throne.
In one version of events, Elagabalus&#x27;s grandmother, Julia Maesa, Julia Domna&#x27;s sister and sister-in-law of Septimius Severus, persuaded the Legio III Gallica to rebel against Macrinus by claiming that Elagabalus was actually Caracalla&#x27;s bastard son with one of her daughters.
She also used her enormous wealth to get soldiers swear fealty to Elagabalus.
Having succeeded, Maesa and her family were invited to enter the camp, where Elagabalus was clad in imperial purple and crowned as emperor.
Another account of the events tells how Elagabalus was being protected and raised by Gannys, a foster father and lover of his mother, Julia Soaemias.
In this version of events, Gannys dressed young Elagabalus in Caracalla&#x27;s childhood clothes and smuggled him into the camp at night, where soldiers eventually revolted the next morning.
In any case, he did arrive as emperor in Rome by summer 219.

Historical sources treat his reign negatively, but many of his failures can not be affirmed.
However, epigraphical and numismatic evidence shows that Elagabalus did replace Jupiter with Elagabal in late 220, and he also married a Vestal Virgin called Aquilia Severa.
In addition to these offences to Roman sensibilities, he was also accused of being murderous and bloodthirsty, but executions during his reign appear to be politically motivated instead of being the result of simple bloodlust.
Many, if not all, stories about his effeminacy, extravagance, and licentiousness are imaginations of ancient authors.

In 221, seeing that her grandson&#x27;s outrageous behaviour could mean the loss of power, Julia Maesa persuaded or forced Elagabalus to adopt his cousin, Severus Alexander, as and his heir.
At the same time he was forced divorce Aquilia in order to marry Annia Faustina, a relative of Marcus Aurelius, only to take Aquila back in a few months before the end of 221.
Elagabalus also tried on several occasions to murder Alexander, which enraged the troops.
In 222 Elagabalus was murdered and his corpse thrown into the sewer. The next day his cousin Alexander was hailed emperor by the troops.

===Alexander Severus (222–235)===


Born Gessius Bassianus Alexianus in ca. 209, in 221 Alexander was adopted at by Elagabalus from whence he was called Marcus Aurelius Alexander Caesar. The adoption happened at the urging of Julia Maesa, who was the grandmother of both cousins.

His cousin Elagabalus had made several attempts at Alexander&#x27;s life, which prompted the troops to mutiny, and things came to a head on March 6 when Elagabalus was put to death and Alexander raised to the throne.

Ruling from the age of 14 under the influence of his mother, Julia Avita Mamaea, ancient writers presented his reign as an efficient regime like the rule of Septimius Severus.
The rising strength of the Sasanian Empire () heralded perhaps the greatest external challenge that Rome faced in the 3rd century; however, in 231 Alexander organised an expedition to Parthia, nominally leading it, and by this did maintain control over the province of Mesopotamia.

Alexander&#x27;s reign ended in early 235 when he was murdered, together with his mother, by his own troops while he was wintering in Germany where he was in order to prosecute a war in Upper Germania.
He was deified in 238 after his memory had been condemned for a few years.

The death of Alexander was the event beginning the troubled Crisis of the Third Century. His successor was Maximinus Thrax (), the first in a series of weak emperors, which ended 50 years later with the Tetrarchy instituted in the reign of Diocletian ().

<text>The Sega CD, known as in most regions outside North America and Brazil, is a CD-ROM accessory and format for the Sega Genesis produced by Sega as part of the fourth generation of video game consoles. Originally released in November 1991, it came to North America in late 1992, and the rest of the world in 1993. The Sega CD plays CD-based games and adds hardware functionality such as a faster CPU and a custom graphics chip for enhanced sprite scaling and rotation. It can also play audio CDs and CD+G discs.

Sega sought to match the capabilities of the competing PC Engine CD-ROM² System, and partnered with JVC to design the Sega CD. Sega refused to consult with their American division until the project was complete, fearful of leaks. The Sega CD was redesigned several times by Sega and was also licensed to third parties, including Pioneer and Aiwa who released home audio products with Sega CD gaming capability. The main benefit of CD technology at the time was greater storage; CDs offered approximately 160 times more space than Genesis/Mega Drive cartridges. This benefit manifested as full-motion video (FMV) games such as the controversial &quot;Night Trap&quot;.

The Sega CD game library features acclaimed games such as &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Popful Mail&quot;, and &quot;Snatcher&quot;, but also many Genesis ports and poorly received FMV games. Only 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold, after which Sega discontinued it to focus on the Sega Saturn. Retrospective reception has been mixed, with praise for some games and functions, but criticism for its lack of deep games and its high price. Sega&#x27;s poor support for the Sega CD has been criticized as the beginning of the devaluation of its brand.

==History==
===Background===
Released in 1988, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in most territories outside of North America) was Sega&#x27;s entry into the fourth generation of video game consoles. In the early 1990s, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske helped make the Genesis a success by cutting the price, developing games for the American market with a new American team, continuing aggressive advertising campaigns, and selling &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; with the Genesis as a pack-in game.

By the early 1990s, compact discs (CDs) were making headway as a storage medium for music and video games. NEC had been the first to use CD technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system in early 1991, while the CD-i from Philips arrived later that year. According to Nick Thorpe of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Sega would have received criticism from investors and observers had it not developed a CD-ROM game system.

=== Development ===
Shortly after the release of the Genesis, Sega&#x27;s Consumer Products Research and Development Labs, led by manager Tomio Takami, were tasked with creating a CD-ROM add-on. It was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami&#x27;s team planned to implement hardware scaling and rotation similar to that of Sega&#x27;s arcade games, which required a dedicated digital signal processor. A custom graphics chip would implement these features, alongside an additional sound chip manufactured by Ricoh. According to Kalinske, Sega was ambitious about what CD-ROM technology would do for video games, with its potential for &quot;movie graphics&quot;, &quot;rock and roll concert sound&quot; and 3D animation. 

However, two major changes were made towards the end of development that dramatically raised the price of the add-on. Because the Genesis&#x27; Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD&#x27;s new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated. This second CPU has a clock speed of 12.5 MHz, faster than the 7.67 MHz CPU in the Genesis. Responding to rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to bring the TurboGrafx-CD RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega increased the Sega CD&#x27;s available RAM from 1 to 6 Mbit. This proved to be a technical challenge, since the Sega CD&#x27;s RAM access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively, and the developers had to focus on increasing the speed. The estimated cost of the device rose to US$370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard.

Sega of America was not informed of the project details until mid-1991. Despite being provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year, the American division was not given a functioning unit to test. According to former executive producer Michael Latham: &quot;When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don&#x27;t. They didn&#x27;t want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating.&quot; 

Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda assembled a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. The American staff were frustrated by the Sega CD&#x27;s construction. Former senior producer Scot Bayless said: &quot;[It] was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM. Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening.&quot; He said the problems were caused by certain games excessively seeking to different tracks on the disc (as opposed to continuously playing / streaming), leading to overheating of the motors which repositioned the laser head assembly.

===Launch===
As early as 1990, magazines were covering a CD-ROM expansion for the Genesis. Sega announced the release of the Mega-CD in Japan for late 1991, and North America (as the Sega CD) in 1992. It was unveiled to the public at the 1991 Tokyo Toy Show, to positive reception from critics, and at the Consumer Electronic Show in Chicago in mid-1991. It was released in Japan on December 12, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800. Though the Mega-CD sold quickly, the small install base of the Mega Drive in Japan meant that sales declined rapidly. Within its first three months, the Mega-CD sold 200,000 units, but only sold an additional 200,000 over the next three years. Third-party game development suffered because Sega took a long time to release software development kits. Other factors affecting sales included the high launch price of the Mega-CD in Japan and only two games available at launch, with only five published by Sega within the first year.

On October 15, 1992, the Mega-CD was released in North America as the Sega CD, with a retail price of US$299. Advertising included one of Sega&#x27;s slogans, &quot;Welcome to the Next Level&quot;. Though only 50,000 units were available at launch due to production problems, the Sega CD sold over 200,000 units by the end of 1992 and 300,000 by July 1993. As part of Sega&#x27;s sales, Blockbuster purchased Sega CD units for rental in their stores. Sega of America emphasized that the Sega CD&#x27;s additional storage space allowed for full-motion video (FMV), with Digital Pictures becoming an important partner. After the initial competition between Sega and Nintendo to develop a CD-based add-on, Nintendo canceled development of a CD add-on for the SNES after having partnered with Sony and then Philips to develop one.

The Mega-CD was launched in Europe in April 1993, starting with the United Kingdom on April 2, 1993, at a price of £269.99. The European version was packaged with &quot;Sol-Feace&quot; and &quot;Cobra Command&quot; in a two-disc set, along with a compilation CD of five Mega Drive games. Only 70,000 units were initially available in the UK, but 60,000 units were sold by August 1993. The Mega-CD was released in Australia in March 1993. Brazilian toy company Tectoy released the Sega CD in Brazil in October 1993, retaining the North American name despite the use of the name Mega Drive for the base console there.

Sega released a second model, the Sega CD 2 (Mega-CD 2), on April 23, 1993, in Japan. It was released in North America several months later at a price of US$229, bundled with one of the bestselling Sega CD games, &quot;Sewer Shark&quot;. Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not use a motorized disc tray. A limited number of games were developed that used the Sega CD and another Genesis add-on, the 32X, released in November 1994.

===&quot;Night Trap&quot; controversy===

On December 9, 1993, the United States Congress began hearings on video game violence and the marketing of violent video games to children. The Sega CD game &quot;Night Trap&quot;, an FMV adventure game by Digital Pictures, was at the center of debate. &quot;Night Trap&quot; had been brought to the attention of United States Senator Joe Lieberman, who said: &quot;It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. I know that the creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of &quot;Dracula&quot;; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message.&quot; Lieberman&#x27;s research concluded that the average video game player was between seven and twelve years old, and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Night Trap&quot; was discussed in Parliament. Former Sega Europe development director Mike Brogan noted that &quot;Night Trap&quot; brought Sega publicity, and helped reinforce Sega&#x27;s image as an &quot;edgy company with attitude&quot;. Despite the increased sales, Sega recalled &quot;Night Trap&quot; and rereleased it with revisions in 1994. Following the congressional hearings, video game manufacturers came together in 1994 to establish a unified rating system, the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

===Decline===
By the end of 1993, sales of the Sega CD had stalled in Japan and were slowing in North America. In Europe, sales of Mega-CD games were outpaced by games for the Amiga CD32. Newer CD-based consoles such as the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest. In late 1993, less than a year after the Sega CD had launched in North America and Europe, the media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. By 1994, units had been sold in the United States and 415,000 in Western Europe. Kalinske blamed the Sega CD&#x27;s high price for limiting its potential market; Sega attempted to add value in the US and the UK by bundling more games, with some packages including up to five games. 

In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega discontinued the Sega CD in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and that the Sega CD could not compete due to its high price and outdated single-speed drive. According to Thorpe, the Sega CD only reached a more popular price point in 1995, by which time customers were willing to wait for newer consoles. The last scheduled Sega CD games, ports of &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Brain Dead 13&quot;, were cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide.

==Technical specifications==

The Sega CD can only be used in conjunction with a Genesis system, attaching through an expansion slot on the side of the main console. It requires its own power supply. A core feature of the Sega CD is the increase in data storage by its games being CD-ROMs; whereas ROM cartridges of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, a CD-ROM disc can hold more than 640 megabytes of data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge. This increase in storage allows the Sega CD to play FMV games. In addition to playing its own library of games in CD-ROM format, the Sega CD can also play compact discs and karaoke CD+G discs, and can be used in conjunction with the 32X to play 32-bit games that use both add-ons. The second model, also known as the Sega CD 2, includes a steel joining plate to be screwed into the bottom of the Genesis and an extension spacer to work with the original Genesis model.

The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5 MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, which runs 5 MHz faster than the Genesis processor. It contains 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM is allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit is allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory in the form of a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system&#x27;s life. The graphics chip is a custom ASIC, and can perform similarly to the SNES&#x27;s Mode 7, but with the ability to handle more objects at the same time. Audio is supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis&#x27;s headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis. Sega released an additional accessory to be used with the Sega CD for karaoke, including a microphone input and various sound controls.

==Models==

Several models of the Sega CD were released. The original model used a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. The second model was redesigned to sit next to the Genesis and featured a top-loading disc tray. Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe), a combined Genesis and Sega CD, with additional functionality as a portable CD player.

Three additional system models were created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega, a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD with high-quality audio, on April 1, 1992, in Japan. The Wondermega was redesigned by JVC and released as the X&#x27;Eye in North America in September 1994. Its high price kept it out of the hands of average consumers. Another console, the LaserActive by Pioneer Corporation, can play Genesis and Sega CD games if equipped with the Mega-LD attachment developed by Sega. The LaserActive was positioned to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, but the combined system and Mega-LD pack retailed at too expensive a price for most consumers. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Mega Drive and Mega CD unit built into a boombox. The CSD-GM1 was released in Japan in 1994.

==Games==
The Sega CD supports a library of more than 200 games created by Sega and third-party publishers. Six Sega CD games were also released in versions that used both the Sega CD and 32X add-ons. 

Well regarded Sega CD games include &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Popful Mail&quot;, and &quot;Snatcher&quot;, as well as the controversial &quot;Night Trap&quot;. Although Sega created &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; for the Genesis to compete against the SNES port of the arcade hit &quot;Final Fight&quot;, the Sega CD received an enhanced version of &quot;Final Fight&quot; that has been praised for its greater faithfulness to the arcade original. &quot;Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side&quot; was noted for its impressive use of the Sega CD hardware as well as its violent content. In particular, &quot;Sonic CD&quot; garnered acclaim for its graphics and time travel gameplay, which improved upon the traditional &quot;Sonic&quot; formula. The Sega CD also received enhanced ports of Genesis games including &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;.

The Sega CD library includes several FMV games, such as &quot;Night Trap, Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; and &quot;Space Ace&quot;. FMV quality was substandard on the Sega CD due to poor video compression software and limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, the Sega CD&#x27;s limited color palette created &quot;a horrible grainy look&quot;. Likewise, most Genesis ports for the Sega CD featured additional FMV sequences, extra levels, and enhanced audio, but were otherwise identical to their Genesis release. The video quality in these sequences has been criticized as comparable to an old VHS tape.

Given a large number of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD&#x27;s game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. Kalinske felt this was a valid criticism, and that while it was useful for releasing collections of games, &quot;just doing cartridge games on a CD-ROM was not a step forward&quot;. According to Thorpe, the Sega CD&#x27;s games did not display enough advancement to justify the console price for most consumers. He felt that FMV games, targeted toward more casual players, were not enough to satisfy hardcore players.

==Reception and legacy==

Near the time of its release, the Sega CD was awarded Best New Peripheral of 1992 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. Four separate reviews scored the add-on 8, 9, 8, and 8 out of 10; reviewers cited its upgrades to the Genesis as well as its high-quality and expanding library of games. In 1995, four &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewers scored it 5 out of 10, citing its limited game library and substandard video quality. &quot;GamePro&quot; cited the same problems, noting that many games were simple ports of cartridge games with minimal enhancements; &quot;GamePro&quot; concluded that the Sega CD was merely &quot;a big memory device with CD sound&quot; rather than a meaningful upgrade. They gave it a &quot;thumbs sideways&quot; and recommended that Genesis fans buy an SNES before considering a Sega CD. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the Japanese Mega-CD 2 17 out of 40.

Retrospective reception of the Sega CD has been mixed, praising certain games but criticizing its value for money and limited upgrades over Genesis. According to &quot;GamePro,&quot; the Sega CD is the seventh-lowest-selling console; reviewer Blake Snow wrote: &quot;The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn&#x27;t do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience.&quot; However, Snow felt that the Sega CD had the greatest &quot;Sonic&quot; game in &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Levi Buchanan criticized Sega&#x27;s implementation of CD technology, arguing that it offered no new gameplay concepts. Jeremy Parish of &quot;USgamer&quot; wrote that Sega was not the only company of the period to &quot;muddy its waters&quot; with a CD add-on, and highlighted some &quot;gems&quot; for the system, but that &quot;the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against the fact that the add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [Genesis].&quot; In a separate article for &quot;1Up.com&quot;, Parish praised the Sega CD&#x27;s expansion of value to the Genesis. Writing for &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD&#x27;s limited sales, including its price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis, and the fact that it was not a standalone console. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; writer Aaron Birch, defended the Sega CD as &quot;ahead of its time&quot; and said that game developers had failed to meet the potential of CD technology.

Sega&#x27;s poor support for the Sega CD has been criticized as the first step in the devaluation of the Sega brand. Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Buchanan said the Sega CD, released without a strong library of games, &quot;looked like a strange, desperate move—something designed to nab some ink but without any real, thought-out strategy. Genesis owners that invested in the add-on were sorely disappointed, which undoubtedly helped sour the non-diehards on the brand.&quot; In &quot;GamePro&quot;, Snow wrote that the Sega CD was the first of several poorly supported Sega systems, which damaged the value of the brand and ultimately led to Sega&#x27;s exit from the hardware market. Thorpe wrote that, while it was possible for Sega to have brushed off the Sega CD&#x27;s failure, the failure of the Sega CD and the 32X together damaged faith in Sega&#x27;s support for its platforms.

Former Sega of America senior producer Scot Bayless attributes the unsuccessful market to a lack of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, &quot;It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don&#x27;t think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: &#x27;Why?&#x27; There&#x27;s a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that&#x27;s where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company fell in love with the idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made.&quot; Sega of America producer Michael Latham said he &quot;loved&quot; the Sega CD, and that it had been damaged by an abundance of &quot;Hollywood interactive film games&quot; instead of using it to make &quot;just plain great video games&quot;. Former Sega Europe president Nick Alexander said: &quot;The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen very much as the interim product it was.&quot; Kalinske said that the Sega CD had been an important learning experience for Sega for programming for discs, and that it was not a mistake but not &quot;as dramatically different as it needed to be&quot;.

<text>The Sega Pico, also known as is an educational video game console by Sega Toys. The Pico was released in June 1993 in Japan and November 1994 in North America and Europe, later reaching China in 2002.

Marketed as &quot;edutainment&quot;, the main focus of the Pico was educational video games for children between 3 and 7 years old. Releases for the Pico were focused on education for children and included titles supported by licensed franchised animated characters, including Sega&#x27;s own &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series.

Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena, in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998, later being re-released by Majesco Entertainment. Overall, Sega claims sales of 3.4 million Pico consoles and 11.2 million game cartridges, and over 350,000 Beena consoles and 800,000 cartridges. It was succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena, released in Japan in 2005. The ePICO, the successor to the Pico and Beena, was also released in Japan in 2024.

== Design and software ==
Powered by the same hardware used in the Sega Genesis, the physical shape of the Pico was designed to appear similar to a laptop. Included in the Pico is a stylus called the &quot;Magic Pen&quot;, and a pad to draw on. Controlling the games for the system is accomplished either by using the Magic Pen like a mouse, or by pressing the directional buttons on the console. The Pico does not include a screen, and instead must be connected to a monitor through the composite video output. Touching the pen to the pad allows drawing, or moving/animating a character on the screen.

Cartridges for the system were referred to as &quot;Storyware&quot;, and took the form of picture books with a cartridge slot on the bottom. The Pico changes the television display and the set of tasks for the player to accomplish each time a page is turned. Sound, including voices and music, also accompanied every page. Games for the Pico focused on education, including subjects such as music, counting, spelling, reading, matching, and coloring. Titles included licensed animated characters from various franchises, such as &quot;Disney&#x27;s The Lion King: Adventures at Pride Rock&quot; and &quot;A Year at Pooh Corner&quot;. Sega also released titles including their mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, including &quot;Sonic Gameworld&quot; and &quot;Tails and the Music Maker&quot;.

According to former Sega console hardware research and development head Hideki Sato, the development of the Sega Pico was possible due to the company&#x27;s past work on the My Card cartridges developed for the SG-1000, as well as on drawing tablets. The sensor technology used in the pad came from that developed for the 1987 arcade game &quot;World Derby&quot;, while its CPU and graphics chip came from the Genesis. The Pico does not include the Genesis&#x27;s Zilog Z80 8-bit coprocessor nor its Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesizer chip, but retains the Texas Instruments SN76489 programmable sound generator integrated onto the console&#x27;s graphics chip along with the addition of an NEC μPD7759 ADPCM chip, which came from Sega&#x27;s arcade system boards such as the System 16B and System C2.

== History ==
At a price of , the Pico was released in Japan in June 1993. In North America, Sega unveiled the Pico at the 1994 American International Toy Fair, showcasing its drawing and display abilities ahead of its release in November. The console was advertised at a price of approximately US$160, but was eventually released at a price of . &quot;Storyware&quot; cartridges sold for . The Pico&#x27;s slogan was &quot;The computer that thinks it&#x27;s a toy.&quot; The Sega Pico won a few awards, including the &quot;National Parenting Seal of Approval&quot;, a &quot;Platinum Seal Award&quot;, and a gold medal from the &quot;National Association of Parenting Publications Awards&quot;.

After a lack of success, Sega discontinued the Pico in North America in early 1998. Later, in August 1999, a remake of the Pico made by Majesco Entertainment was released in North America at a price of , with Storyware titles selling at . The Pico would later be released in China in 2002, priced at .

In early 1995, Sega of America reported that it had sold 400,000 units in North America. In 2000, Sega claimed that the Pico had sold units. As of April 2005, Sega claims that Pico consoles and software cartridges had been sold worldwide. The Pico was recognized in 1995 by being listed on Dr. Toy&#x27;s 100 Best Products, as well as being listed in &quot;Child&quot; as one of the best computer games available. According to Joseph Szadkowski of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Pico has enough power to be a serious learning aid that teaches counting, spelling, matching, problem-solving, memory, logic, hand/eye coordination and important, basic computer skills.&quot; Former Sega of America vice president of product development Joe Miller claims that he named his dog after the system because of his passion for the console. By contrast, Steven L. Kent claims that Sega of Japan CEO Hayao Nakayama watched the Pico &quot;utterly fail&quot; in North America.

== Yamaha Copera ==
In December 1993, Yamaha released the Copera in Japan at a price of . The Copera is an enhanced variant of the Pico designed for musical education, with additional Yamaha FM sound hardware, stereo audio output, a microphone input, and two MIDI ports. It is compatible with all Pico software, as well as dedicated software making use of the enhanced hardware known as &#x27;Mixt Books&#x27;, which are not compatible with regular Pico hardware.

== Advanced Pico Beena ==

The Advanced Pico Beena, also known simply as Beena or BeenaLite, is an educational console system targeted at young children sold by Sega Toys, released in 2005 in Japan. It is the successor to the Pico, and marketed around the &quot;learn while playing&quot; concept. According to Sega Toys, the focus of the Advanced Pico Beena is on learning in a new social environment, and is listed as their upper-end product. Topics listed as being educational focuses for the Beena include intellectual, moral, physical, dietary, and safety education. The name of the console was chosen to sound like the first syllables of &quot;Be Natural&quot;.

Compared to the Pico, Beena adds several functions. Beena can be played without a television, and supports multiplayer via a separately sold additional Magic Pen. The console also supports data saving. Playtime can be limited by settings in the system. Some games for the Beena offer adaptive difficulty, becoming more difficult to play based on the skill level of the player. The Beena Lite, a more affordable version of the console, was released on July 17, 2008. As of 2010, Sega estimated that 4.1 million Beena consoles had been sold, along with 20 million game cartridges.

== ePICO ==
The ePICO is an educational console system targeted at young children sold by Sega Fave, released on October 10, 2024 in Japan. It is the successor to the Advanced Pico Beena.

Like the Pico and Beena, it uses special picture book software for it to function. The device is similar to that of the CoCoPad, however the ePICO is not compatible with Pico, Beena, or CoCoPad software. Another feature is that it can be played with a special mat instead of solely playing with a stylus (also called Magic Pen). In addition, a function is planned to be developed for the &quot;ePICO Enthusiasm Report,&quot; a personal page for parents that will report on what their child is interested in, using the &quot;multiple intelligences theory&quot; developed at Harvard University.

<doc id="29034" wikidata="Q7446168" url="?curid=29034" title="Sega VR">
<text>The Sega VR is an unreleased virtual reality headset developed by Sega in the early 1990s. Planned as an add-on peripheral for the Sega Genesis and only publicly showcased at a number of trade shows and expositions, its release was postponed and later cancelled outright after Sega ran into development issues. At least four in-progress games for the hardware were in development before its cancellation.

The project was largely driven by Sega of America; a more successful, separate, and officially released attempt at a virtual reality headset, the Mega Visor Display, was overseen by Sega&#x27;s Japanese amusement divisions and United Kingdom-based collaborators Virtuality, and would be used in the VR-1 theme park ride and the &quot;Dennou Senki Net Merc&quot; arcade game. The similarly titled VR-1 is not to be confused with the Sega VR.

==Features==
The Sega VR&#x27;s design was based on an IDEO virtual reality head-mounted display containing LCD screens in the visor and stereo headphones. The headset tracking solution was developed by a small electronics company called Ono-Sendai that had been experimenting with VR headsets. The method employed was only capable of tracking two degrees of freedom but was very inexpensive, costing only around $1 per unit, making it affordable for the consumer market. The device used a magnetometer to detect azimuth relative to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and an optical sensor measuring the refraction of light at the boundary of a gas and fluid to detect tilt.

==Development==
Sega of America, flush with funds from the success of its Mega Drive/Genesis, announced the peripheral in 1991. It was later seen in 1993 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago, where it was demonstrated by Alan Hunter and appeared close to a finished product. The event stated that the headset was planned to use the Genesis hardware and would be released in late 1993 at with four confirmed launch games and the possibility of a port of arcade game &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. Sega later announced release was slated for early 1994, according to &quot;Electronic Games&quot;.

The Sega VR headset was never released to the general public and it vanished from release schedules in 1994. There are conflicting reports as to why the product was cancelled. Sega officially claimed to have terminated the project because the virtual reality effect was &quot;too realistic&quot;, so users might move while wearing the headset and injure themselves. However, Tom Kalinske, then president and CEO of Sega of America, stated that the system would not be released due to reports of it inducing motion sickness and severe headaches in users. Mark Pesce, who worked on the Sega VR project, says a SRI International conducted research on the product and warned Sega of the &quot;hazards of prolonged use&quot;.

==Games==
Only four original games are known to have been in development.

* &quot;Nuclear Rush&quot;: A simulation in which users pilot a hovercraft in a futuristic war.
* &quot;Iron Hammer&quot;: In this helicopter simulation, gamers pilot a flying gunship as in EA&#x27;s popular &quot;Strike&quot; series.
* &quot;Matrix Runner&quot;: Reported to be a cyberpunk adventure game inspired by Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Snatcher&quot;.
* &quot;Outlaw Racing&quot;: A vehicle racing and combat game.

Sega also announced a port of Sega AM2&#x27;s hit 1992 arcade game &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; as a launch game for the device, though it is not known how far this reached in development.

==Legacy==
Following the cancellation of the Sega VR, a few further attempts were made by Sega to develop virtual reality technology. A similar peripheral was reportedly made, but never seen, for the Saturn.

While Sega of America undertook development on the Sega VR, Sega of Japan endeavoured to create their own virtual reality project. Sega entered into an agreement to collaborate with the pioneering Virtuality Group on a VR arcade project in 1993. Following this the two companies entered into negotiations to build a new headset by combining their previous development assets in the field of VR.

The result of the agreement was the Mega Visor Display, publicly released for the first time in July 1994 as part of the VR-1 attraction installed at Sega&#x27;s flagship Joypolis indoor theme parks in Japan, as well as SegaWorld London and Sega World Sydney. Alongside the attraction, the MVD was praised in reviews at the time for its advancements in ergonomic design and graphical output, and was supposedly not fully matched in performance until the 2010s.

A second project to utilize the Mega Visor Display, the &quot;Dennou Senki Net Merc&quot; arcade game, was later demonstrated at Japan&#x27;s 1995 AOU (Amusement Operators Union) show, using the Sega Model 1 arcade system board to produce its 3D graphics. &quot;Net Merc&quot; subsequently received much more muted reception, with the game&#x27;s flat-shaded graphics compared unfavourably to the Sega Model 2&#x27;s textured-filtered graphics when showcased.

<text>The is a home video game console developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994, in Japan, May 11, 1995, in North America, and July 8, 1995, in Europe. Part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, it is the successor to the successful Genesis. The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, including several ports of arcade games and original games.

Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega&#x27;s groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. The Saturn was designed around a new CPU from the Japanese electronics company Hitachi. Another video display processor was added in early 1994 to better compete with the 3D graphics of Sony&#x27;s forthcoming PlayStation.

The Saturn was initially successful in Japan but not in the United States, where it was hindered by a surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the US, where it was discontinued in 1998. The Saturn is considered a commercial failure; this was affected by the cancellation of &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, planned as the first 3D entry in Sega&#x27;s popular &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. The Saturn was succeeded in 1998 by the Dreamcast, having sold 9.26 million units sold worldwide, most in Japan.

The Saturn has several well-regarded games, including &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; series, and the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series, although much of its library was confined to the Japanese market where the system fared better than the West. The Saturn&#x27;s reception is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support; Sega&#x27;s management has been criticized for its decisions during the Saturn&#x27;s development and discontinuation.

==History==
===Background===
In the early 1990s, Sega had success with the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in most countries outside of North America), backed by aggressive advertising campaigns and the popularity of its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Sega also had success with arcade games; in 1992 and 1993, the new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (the first 3D fighting game), crucial to popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. The Model 1 was expensive, so several alternatives helped bring Sega&#x27;s newest arcade games to Genesis, such as the Virtua Processor chip used for &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, and the 32X add-on.

===Development===
Development of the Saturn was supervised by Hideki Sato, Sega&#x27;s director and deputy general manager of research and development. According to project manager Hideki Okamura, the project codenamed Saturn started over two years before its announcement at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994. It was developed by the same team that developed the System 32 arcade board. Sato regrets that he did not go with the Model 1 arcade hardware as a base, as he was too concerned of leaving all the developers behind that were focused on sprites rather than 3D, which were the majority of developers.

In 1993, Sega and the Japanese electronics company Hitachi formed a joint venture to develop a new CPU for the Saturn, which resulted in the creation of the &quot;SuperH RISC Engine&quot; (or SH-2) later that year. The Saturn was designed around a dual-SH2 configuration. According to Kazuhiro Hamada, Sega&#x27;s section chief for Saturn development during the system&#x27;s conception, &quot;the SH-2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency. The chip has a calculation system similar to a DSP [digital signal processor], but we realized that a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world.&quot; Although the Saturn&#x27;s design was largely finished before the end of 1993, reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of Sony&#x27;s upcoming PlayStation console prompted Sega to include another video display processor (VDP) to improve 2D performance and 3D texture mapping. Sega considered making CD-ROM-based and cartridge-only versions of the Saturn, but discarded the idea due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge games.

According to president Tom Kalinske, Sega of America &quot;fought against the architecture of Saturn for quite some time&quot;. Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn, Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with Silicon Graphics, but Sega of Japan rejected the proposal. Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the Nintendo 64. Kalinske, Sony Electronic Publishing&#x27;s Olaf Olafsson, and Sony America&#x27;s Micky Schulhof had discussed development of a joint &quot;Sega/Sony hardware system&quot;, which never materialized due to Sega&#x27;s desire to create hardware for both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony&#x27;s competing notion of focusing on 3D technology. Publicly, Kalinske defended the Saturn&#x27;s design: &quot;Our people feel that they need the multiprocessing to be able to bring to the home what we&#x27;re doing next year in the arcades.&quot;

In 1993, Sega restructured its internal studios in preparation for the Saturn&#x27;s launch. To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn&#x27;s life, and to create a more energetic working environment, developers from Sega&#x27;s arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time. In early 1994, the Sega Titan Video arcade system was announced as an arcade counterpart to the Saturn. In April 1994, Acclaim Entertainment announced it would be the first American publisher to produce software for the Titan.

In January 1994, Sega began to develop the 32X add-on for the Genesis, as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The 32X was approved by Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to the former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega&#x27;s hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch by the end of the year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis games, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was justified by Sega&#x27;s statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X familiarized development teams with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because the machines share many parts and were prepared to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.

===Launch===
Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, at a price of ¥44,800 (equivalent to at the time). &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system&#x27;s early success in Japan. Though Sega had wanted to launch with &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot; and &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;, the only other first-party game available at launch was &quot;Wan Chai Connection&quot;. Boosted by the popularity of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, Sega&#x27;s initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side by side, the Saturn proved more popular.

Meanwhile, Sega released the 32X on November 21, 1994, in North America, December 3, 1994, in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, at less than half of the Saturn&#x27;s launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. Half a million Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation had a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.

In March 1995, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced the Saturn&#x27;s launch in the U.S. on &quot;Saturnday&quot; (Saturday), September 2, 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saturnday/1:1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation. At the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on May 11, 1995, Kalinske gave a keynote presentation in which he revealed the release price of (including a copy of &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;), and described the features of the console. Kalinske also revealed that, due to &quot;high consumer demand&quot;, Sega had already shipped 30,000 Saturns to Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Babbage&#x27;s, Electronics Boutique, and Software Etc. for immediate release. The announcement upset retailers who were not informed of the surprise release, including Best Buy and Walmart; KB Toys, which was not part of the early launch, responded by refusing to carry the Saturn and its games. Sony subsequently unveiled the retail price for the PlayStation; Olaf Olafsson, the head of Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), summoned Steve Race to the stage, who uttered &quot;$299&quot;, and then walked away to applause. The Saturn&#x27;s release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date, on July 8, 1995, at £399.99. European retailers and press did not have time to promote the system or its games, harming sales. The PlayStation launched in Europe on September 29, 1995; by November, it had already outsold the Saturn by a factor of three in the United Kingdom, where Sony had allocated £20 million of marketing during the holiday season compared to Sega&#x27;s £4 million.

The Saturn&#x27;s U.S. launch was accompanied by a reported $50 million advertising campaign including coverage in publications such as &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;. Early advertising for the system was targeted at a more mature, adult audience than the Genesis ads. The early rescheduling yielded only six launch games (all published by Sega) because most third-party games were scheduled around the original launch date. &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;″s relative lack of popularity in the West, combined with a release schedule of only two games between the surprise launch and September 1995, prevented Sega from capitalizing on the Saturn&#x27;s early timing. Within two days of its September 9, 1995, launch in North America, the PlayStation (backed by a large marketing campaign) had more units sold than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch, with almost all of the initial shipment of 100,000 units being sold in advance, and the rest selling out across the U.S.

A high-quality port of the Namco arcade game &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; contributed to the PlayStation&#x27;s early success, and garnered favorable media in comparison to the Saturn version of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, which was considered inferior to its arcade counterpart. Namco, a longtime arcade competitor with Sega, also unveiled the Namco System 11 arcade board, based on raw PlayStation hardware. Although the System 11 is technically inferior to Sega&#x27;s Model 2 arcade board, its lower price made it attractive to smaller arcades. Following a 1994 acquisition of Sega developers, Namco released &quot;Tekken&quot; for the System 11 and PlayStation. Directed by former &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; designer Seiichi Ishii, &quot;Tekken&quot; was intended to be fundamentally similar, with the addition of detailed textures and twice the frame rate. &quot;Tekken&quot; surpassed &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; in popularity due to its superior graphics and nearly arcade-perfect console port, becoming the first million-selling PlayStation game.

On October 2, Sega announced a Saturn price reduction to $299. High-quality Saturn ports of the Sega Model 2 arcade hits &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (running at 60 frames per second at a high resolution) were available by the end of the year and were generally regarded as superior to competitors on the PlayStation. Notwithstanding a subsequent increase in Saturn sales during the 1995 holiday season, the games were not enough to reverse the PlayStation&#x27;s decisive lead. By 1996, the PlayStation had a considerably larger library than the Saturn, although Sega hoped to generate interest with upcoming exclusives such as &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;. An informal survey of retailers showed that the Saturn and PlayStation sold in roughly equal numbers during the first quarter of 1996. Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20% of the entire U.S. video game market. On the first day of the May 1996 E3 show, Sony announced a PlayStation price reduction to $199, a reaction to the release of the Model 2 Saturn in Japan at a price roughly equivalent to $199. On the second day, Sega announced it would match this price, though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture.

===Changes at Sega===
After the launch of the PlayStation and Saturn, sales of 16-bit games and consoles continued to account for 64% of the video game market in 1995. Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis, and did not have the inventory to meet demand. Sega was able to capture 43% of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and sell more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995, but Kalinske estimated that &quot;we could have sold another 300,000 Genesis systems in the November/December timeframe.&quot; Nakayama&#x27;s decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis, based on the systems&#x27; relative performance in Japan, has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation.

Due to long-standing disagreements with Sega of Japan, Kalinske lost interest in his work as CEO of Sega of America. By early 1996, rumors were circulating that Kalinske planned to leave Sega, and a July 13 article in the press reported speculation that Sega of Japan was planning significant changes to Sega of America&#x27;s management. On July 16, 1996, Sega announced that Kalinske would leave Sega after September 30, and that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America. A former Honda executive, Irimajiri had been involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993. Sega also announced that David Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions as chairman and co-chairman of Sega of America, though both remained with the company. Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was named Sega of America&#x27;s executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations. Stolar, who had arranged a six-month PlayStation exclusivity deal for &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and helped build close relations with Electronic Arts while at Sony, was perceived as a major asset by Sega officials. Finally, Sega of America made plans to expand its PC software business.

Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn, deciding it was poorly designed, and publicly announced at E3 1997 that &quot;the Saturn is not our future&quot;. Though Stolar had &quot;no interest in lying to people&quot; about the Saturn&#x27;s prospects, he continued to emphasize quality games for the system, and later said that &quot;we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer&quot;. At Sony, Stolar had opposed the localization of Japanese games that he decided would not represent PlayStation well in North America, and advocated a similar policy for the Saturn, although he later sought to distance himself from his actions. These changes were accompanied by a softer image that Sega was beginning to portray in its advertising, including removing the &quot;Sega!&quot; scream and holding press events for the education industry. Marketing for the Saturn in Japan also changed with the introduction of Segata Sanshiro (played by Hiroshi Fujioka), a character in a series of TV advertisements starting in 1997; the character eventually starred in a Saturn game.

Temporarily abandoning arcade development, Sega AM2 head Yu Suzuki began developing several Saturn-exclusive games, including a role-playing game in the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series. Initially conceived as an obscure prototype, &quot;The Old Man and the Peach Tree&quot;, and intended to address the flaws of contemporary Japanese RPGs (such as poor non-player character artificial intelligence routines), &quot;Virtua Fighter RPG&quot; evolved into a planned 11-part, 45-hour &quot;revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema&quot;, which Suzuki hoped would become the Saturn&#x27;s killer app. The game was eventually released as &quot;Shenmue&quot; for the Saturn&#x27;s successor, the Dreamcast.

===Cancellation of &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;===
As Sonic Team was working on &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute (STI) with developing the first fully 3D entry in its popular &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. The game, &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a fisheye lens camera system that rotated levels with Sonic&#x27;s movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the engine created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development were wasted after Stolar rescinded STI&#x27;s access to Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; engine following an ultimatum by &quot;Nights&quot; programmer Yuji Naka. After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designers Chris Senn and Chris Coffin became ill, &quot;Sonic X-Treme&quot; was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Saturn, but development shifted to the Dreamcast as &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.

Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact a completed &quot;X-treme&quot; might have had on the market. David Houghton of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; described the prospect of &quot;a good 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game&quot; on the Saturn as &quot;a &#x27;What if...&#x27; situation on a par with the dinosaurs not becoming extinct&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Travis Fahs called &quot;X-treme&quot; &quot;the turning point not only for Sega&#x27;s mascot and their 32-bit console, but for the entire company [and] an empty vessel for Sega&#x27;s ambitions and the hopes of their fans&quot;. Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan website during the system&#x27;s lifespan, said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if [&quot;X-treme&quot;] could&#x27;ve saved the Saturn, but [...] &quot;Sonic&quot; helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn&#x27;t a great new &quot;Sonic&quot; title ready at or near the launch of the [Saturn].&quot; In a 2007 retrospective, producer Mike Wallis maintained that &quot;X-treme&quot; &quot;definitely would have been competitive&quot; with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reported in late 1996 that &quot;X-treme&quot; would have harmed Sega&#x27;s reputation if it did not compare well to contemporary competition. Naka said he had been relieved by the cancellation, because the game was not promising.

===Decline===
From 1993 to early 1996, although Sega&#x27;s revenue declined as part of an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo&#x27;s 30% and Sony&#x27;s 24%). Eight hundred thousand PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive price war, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two to one in 1996, and Sega&#x27;s 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had 2.9 million units sold in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million Saturn units sold. The Christmas 1996 &quot;Three Free&quot; pack, which bundled the Saturn with &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, drove sales dramatically and ensured the Saturn remained a competitor into 1997.

However, the Saturn failed to take the lead. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and its games were sharply reduced, and the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. in 1997. The 1997 release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; significantly increased the PlayStation&#x27;s popularity in Japan. The game helped push PlayStation sales ahead of the Saturn in Japan, after the PlayStation and Saturn had been very close in Japan prior to the game&#x27;s release. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo 40%, and Sega only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases proved helpful. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn&#x27;s poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America&#x27;s 200 employees were laid off in late 1997.

As a result of Sega&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as president in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar subsequently acceded to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion () and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion ().

Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega announced that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor. Only 7 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; is the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn lasted longer in Japan, with Irimajiri announcing in early 1998 that Sega would continue supporting the Saturn in Japan after its successor was released. Between June 1996 and August 1998, a further 1,103,468 consoles and 29,685,781 games were sold in Japan, giving the Saturn a Japanese attach rate of 16.71 games per console, the highest of that generation.

Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast, spread mainly by Sega, were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998, in Japan and on September 9, 1999, in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999 and announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce.

Worldwide Saturn sales include at least the following amounts in each territory: 5.75 million in Japan (surpassing Genesis sales of 3.58 million there), 1.8 million in the United States, 1 million in Europe, and 530,000 elsewhere. With lifetime sales of 9.26 million units, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure, although its install base in Japan, where it did better than the West, surpassed the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 5.54 million, where it became Sega&#x27;s highest-selling home console. The Saturn ultimately shipped more than 6 million units in Japan. Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor of the Saturn&#x27;s failure, because the system&#x27;s surprise launch had damaged Sega&#x27;s reputation with key retailers. Conversely, Nintendo&#x27;s long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage to Sega&#x27;s reputation caused by poorly supported Genesis add-ons are considered major factors allowing Sony&#x27;s establishment in the video game market.

==Technical specifications==

Featuring eight processors, the Saturn&#x27;s central processing units are two Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors clocked at 28.6 MHz and capable of 56 MIPS. It uses a Motorola 68EC000 running at 11.3 MHz as a sound controller; a custom sound processor with an integrated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6 MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both FM synthesis and 16-bit 44.1 kHz pulse-code modulation; and two video display processors: the VDP1 (which handles sprites and polygons) and the VDP2 (which handles backgrounds). Its double-speed CD-ROM drive is controlled by a dedicated Hitachi SH-1 processor to reduce load time. The System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all buses and functions as a co-processor of the main SH-2 CPU, has an internal DSP running at 14.3 MHz. It features a cartridge slot that allows memory expansion, 16 Mbit of work random-access memory (RAM), 12 Mbit of video RAM, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions, 4 Mbit of CD buffer RAM and 256 Kbit (32 KB) of battery backup RAM. Its RCA video output displays at resolutions from 320×224 to 704×224 pixels, with up to 16.78 million colors. The Saturn measures . It was packaged with an instruction manual, control pad, stereo AV cable, and 100 V AC power supply consuming approximately 15 W.

The Saturn had technically impressive hardware at the time of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4 KB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; used one CPU for each character, while &quot;Nights&quot; used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system&#x27;s most important features.

The Saturn&#x27;s design elicited mixed commentary among game developers and journalists. Developers quoted by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in December 1995 described the Saturn as &quot;a real coder&#x27;s machine [for] those who love to get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware [with] more flexibility [and] more calculating power than the PlayStation&quot;. The sound board was widely praised. Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little difference. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn&#x27;s use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was worse at generating polygons but better at sprites. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to use assembly language. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly had a speed increase of two to five times above higher-level languages such as C.

Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn&#x27;s development system. Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller&#x27;s Tales founder Jon Burton said that though the PlayStation was easier &quot;to get started on [...] you quickly reach [its] limits&quot;, whereas the Saturn&#x27;s &quot;complicated [hardware could] improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly&quot;. A major criticism was the Saturn&#x27;s use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation has a different design, based entirely on 3D triangle-based polygonal rendering, with no direct 2D support. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an &quot;essentially&quot; 2D system. For example, Steven L. Kent stated: &quot;Although Nintendo and Sony had true 3D game machines, Sega had a 2D console that did a good job with 3D objects but wasn&#x27;t optimized for 3D environments.&quot; The Saturn hardware is extremely difficult to emulate.

Several Saturn models were produced in Japan. An updated model in a recolored light gray (officially white) was released at ¥20,000 to reduce the system&#x27;s cost and raise its appeal among women and younger children. Two models were released by third parties: Hitachi released the Hi-Saturn (a smaller model equipped with a car navigation function), and JVC released the V-Saturn. Saturn controllers have various complementary color schemes. The system also supports several accessories. A wireless controller powered by AA batteries uses infrared signal to connect. Designed to work with &quot;Nights&quot;, the Saturn 3D Pad includes both a control pad and an analog stick for directional input. Sega also released several versions of arcade sticks as peripherals, including the Virtua Stick, the Virtua Stick Pro, the Mission Analog Stick, and the Twin Stick. Sega created a light gun peripheral, the Virtua Gun, for shooting games such as &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, and the Arcade Racer, a wheel for racing games. The Play Cable connects two Saturn consoles for multiplayer gaming across two screens, and a multitap connects up to six players to the same console. One console with two multitaps can support up to 12 players. Other accessories include RAM expansion cartridges, keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, and movie card.

Like the Genesis, the Saturn had an Internet-based gaming service. The Sega NetLink is a 28.8k modem for the cartridge slot for direct dial multiplayer games &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;Saturn Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally&quot;, and &quot;Virtual On: Cyber Troopers&quot;. In Japan, a pay-to-play service was used. It can be used for web browsing, email, and online chat. Because the NetLink was released before the keyboard, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses so that Saturn owners could browse with the joypad. In 1995, Sega announced a variant of the Saturn featuring a built-in NetLink modem codenamed Pluto, but it was never released.

Sega developed a Saturn-based arcade board, the Sega ST-V (or Titan), intended as an affordable alternative to Sega&#x27;s Model 2 arcade board and as a testing ground for upcoming Saturn software. The Titan was criticized for its comparatively weak performance compared to the Sega Model 2 arcade system by Yu Suzuki, and it was overproduced by Sega&#x27;s arcade division. Because Sega already had the &quot;Die Hard&quot; license, members of Sega AM1 working at the Sega Technical Institute developed &quot;Die Hard Arcade&quot; for the Titan to clear excess inventory. &quot;Die Hard&quot; became the most successful Sega arcade game produced in the United States at that point. Other games released for the Titan include &quot;Golden Axe: The Duel&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter Kids&quot;.

==Game library==

Much of the Saturn&#x27;s library is Sega&#x27;s arcade ports, including &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Last Bronx&quot;, &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, the &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; series, the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series, and &quot;Virtual-On&quot;. Saturn ports of 2D Capcom fighting games including &quot;Darkstalkers 3&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; were noted for their faithfulness to their arcade counterparts. &quot;Fighters Megamix&quot;, developed by Sega AM2 for the Saturn rather than arcades, combined characters from &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; to positive reviews. Highly rated Saturn exclusives include &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot;, &quot;Dragon Force&quot;, &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;, &quot;Nights&quot;, &quot;Panzer Dragoon II Zwei&quot;, and &quot;Shining Force III&quot;. PlayStation games such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, and &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot; received Saturn ports with mixed results. The first-person shooter &quot;PowerSlave&quot; featured some of the most impressive 3D graphics on the system, leading Sega to contract its developers, Lobotomy Software, to produce Saturn ports of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. While Electronic Arts&#x27;s limited support for the Saturn and Sega&#x27;s failure to develop a football game for late 1995 gave Sony the lead in the sports genre, &quot;Sega Sports&quot; published Saturn sports games including the well-regarded &quot;World Series Baseball&quot; and &quot;Sega Worldwide Soccer&quot; series.

Due to the cancellation of &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, the Saturn lacks an exclusive &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; platformer; instead it received a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis game &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, the compilation &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;, and a racing game, &quot;Sonic R&quot;. The platformer &quot;Bug!&quot; received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the &quot;Sonic&quot; series had. Considered one of the most important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of &quot;Nights&quot; involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, the emphasis by &quot;Nights&quot; on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Burning Rangers&quot;, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn&#x27;s lifespan and criticized for its short length.

Many of the system&#x27;s well-regarded titles were exclusive to Japan. Some of the biggest killer apps for the Saturn in Japan were the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series. Co-developed by Sega and Red Entertainment, &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; mixes elements of tactical RPGs, anime cutscenes, and visual novels. That and &quot;Grandia&quot; helped popularize the Saturn in its homeland, but never had a Western release due to Sega of America&#x27;s policy of not localizing RPGs and other Japanese games that might have damaged the system&#x27;s reputation in North America. Some games that launched on Saturn, such as &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Grandia&quot;, and &quot;&quot; only had a Western release on the PlayStation. Working Designs localized several Japanese Saturn games before a public feud between Sega of America&#x27;s Bernie Stolar and Working Designs president Victor Ireland resulted in the company switching their support to the PlayStation. According to the review aggregator GameRankings, &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; is the most acclaimed Saturn game; it was praised for its cinematic presentation, evocative plot, and unique battle system. However, Sega released fewer than 20,000 retail copies in North America in what &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Levi Buchanan characterized as an example of the Saturn&#x27;s &quot;ignominious send-off&quot; in the region. Similarly, only the first of three installments of &quot;Shining Force III&quot; was released outside Japan. The Saturn&#x27;s library also garnered criticism for its lack of sequels to high-profile Genesis-era Sega franchises, with Sega of Japan&#x27;s cancellation of a planned third installment in Sega of America&#x27;s popular &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; series cited as a significant source of controversy.

Later ports of Saturn games including &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;, &quot;Nights&quot;, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers&quot; continued to garner positive reviews. Partly due to rarity, Saturn games such as &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; and &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; are noted for their cult following. Due to the system&#x27;s commercial failure and hardware limitations, Saturn projects such as &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, &quot;Shenmue&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot; were cancelled and moved to the Dreamcast. As of February 1997, the cumulative software sold had surpassed 28 million units.

==Reception and legacy==
At the time of the Saturn&#x27;s release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; awarded it 24 out of 40, higher than the PlayStation&#x27;s 19 out of 40. In June 1995, Dennis Lynch of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Albert Kim of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the Saturn as the most advanced console available; Lynch praised the double-speed CD-ROM drive and &quot;intense surround-sound capabilities&quot; and Kim cited &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; as a &quot;lyrical and exhilarating epic&quot; demonstrating the ability of new technology to &quot;transform&quot; the industry. In December 1995, &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the Saturn three and a half stars out of five, highlighting Sega&#x27;s marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system&#x27;s complexity as a weakness. Four critics in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s December 1996 &quot;Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; rated the Saturn 8, 6, 7, and 8 out of 10 and the PlayStation 9, 10, 9, and 9. By December 1998, &quot;EGM&quot;″s reviews were more mixed, with reviewers citing the lack of games as a major problem. According to &quot;EGM&quot; reviewer Crispin Boyer, &quot;the Saturn is the only system that can thrill me one month and totally disappoint me the next&quot;.

Retrospective feedback of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library. According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com, &quot;the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time&quot;. In 2009, IGN named the Saturn the 18th-best console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, &quot;While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo [...] &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; noted that &quot;hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like &quot;Burning Rangers&quot;, &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot;, &quot;Dragon Force&quot; and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot;&quot;. In 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Keith Stuart wrote that &quot;the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line-up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history&quot;.

&quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s Damien McFerran wrote: &quot;Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Adam Redsell wrote &quot;[Sega&#x27;s] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the indie scene today.&quot; Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield said that &quot;the Saturn was a landing point for games that were too &#x27;adult&#x27; in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan [...] some games, like &quot;Enemy Zero&quot; used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served.&quot; Sewart praised the Saturn&#x27;s first-party games as &quot;Sega&#x27;s shining moment as a game developer&quot;, with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports. He also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN&#x27;s Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library&#x27;s lack of &quot;fresh ideas&quot; and &quot;precious few high-profile franchises&quot;, in contrast to what he described as Sega&#x27;s more creative Dreamcast output.

Sega has been criticized for its management of the Saturn. McFerran said its management staff had &quot;fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry&quot;. Stolar has also been criticized; according to Fahs, &quot;Stolar&#x27;s decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but [...] it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar&#x27;s redemption.&quot; Stolar defended his decision, saying, &quot;I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren&#x27;t going to win.&quot; Sheffield said that the Saturn&#x27;s quadrilaterals undermined third-party support, but because &quot;nVidia invested in quads&quot; at the same time, there had been &quot;a remote possibility&quot; they could have &quot;become the standard instead of triangles [...] if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era.&quot; Speaking more positively, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as &quot;the start of the future of console gaming&quot; because it &quot;got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time&quot;. In GamesRadar, Justin Towell wrote that the Saturn&#x27;s 3D Pad &quot;set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog shoulder triggers and left thumbstick [...] I don&#x27;t see any three-pronged controllers around the office these days.&quot;

Douglass C. Perry of Gamasutra noted that, from its surprise launch to its ultimate failure, the Saturn &quot;soured many gamers on Sega products&quot;. Sewart and IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan cited the failure of the Saturn as the major reason for Sega&#x27;s downfall as a hardware manufacturer, but USgamer&#x27;s Jeremy Parish described it as &quot;more a symptom [...] than a cause&quot; of the decline, which began with add-ons for the Genesis that fragmented the market and continued with Sega of America&#x27;s and Sega of Japan&#x27;s competing designs for the Dreamcast. Sheffield portrayed Sega&#x27;s mistakes with the Saturn as emblematic of the broader then-decline of the Japanese gaming industry: &quot;They thought they were invincible, and that structure and hierarchy were necessary for their survival, but more flexibility, and a greater participation with the West could have saved them.&quot; According to Stuart, Sega &quot;didn&#x27;t see [...] the roots of a prevailing trend, away from arcade conversions and traditional role-playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure&quot;. Pulp365 reviews editor Matt Paprocki concluded that &quot;the Saturn is a relic, but an important one, which represents the harshness of progress and what it can leave in its wake&quot;.

<doc id="29036" wikidata="Q184198" url="?curid=29036" title="Dreamcast">
<text>The is the final home video game console manufactured by Sega. It was released on November 27, 1998, in Japan; September 9, 1999, in North America; and October 14, 1999, in Europe. It was the first sixth-generation video game console, preceding Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube, and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox. The Dreamcast&#x27;s 2001 discontinuation ended Sega&#x27;s 18 years in the console market.

A team led by Hideki Sato began developing the Dreamcast in 1997. In contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful Saturn, the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with off-the-shelf components, including a Hitachi SH-4 CPU and an NEC PowerVR2 GPU. Sega used the GD-ROM media format to avoid the expenses of DVD-ROM technology. Developers were able to include a custom version of the Windows CE operating system on game discs to make porting PC games easy, and Sega&#x27;s NAOMI arcade system board allowed nearly identical conversions of arcade games. The Dreamcast was the first console to include a built-in modular modem for internet access and online play.

Though its Japanese release was beset by supply problems, the Dreamcast had a successful US launch backed by a large marketing campaign. However, sales steadily declined as Sony built anticipation for the PlayStation 2. Dreamcast sales did not meet Sega&#x27;s expectations, and attempts to renew interest through price cuts caused significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrew from the console business, and restructured itself as a third-party developer. A total of 9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide and over 600 games were produced. Its bestselling game, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998)—the first 3D game in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series—sold 2.5 million copies.

The Dreamcast&#x27;s commercial failure has been attributed to several factors, including competition from the PlayStation 2, limited third-party support, and the earlier failures of the 32X and Saturn having tarnished Sega&#x27;s reputation. In retrospect, reviewers have celebrated the Dreamcast as one of the greatest consoles. It is considered ahead of its time for pioneering concepts such as online play and downloadable content. Many Dreamcast games are regarded as innovative, including &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; (1999), &quot;Shenmue&quot; (1999), &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; (2000), and &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (2000). The Dreamcast remains popular in the video game homebrew community, which has developed private servers to preserve its online functions and unofficial Dreamcast software.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1988, Sega released the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in most countries outside North America), in the fourth generation of video game consoles. It became the most successful Sega console ever, at 30.75 million units sold. Its successor, the Saturn, was released in Japan in 1994. The Saturn is CD-ROM-based and has 2D and 3D graphics, but its complex dual-CPU architecture was more difficult to program than its chief competitor, the Sony PlayStation. Although the Saturn debuted before the PlayStation in Japan and the United States, its surprise US launch, four months earlier than scheduled, was marred by a lack of distribution, which remained a problem. Losses on the Saturn contributed to financial problems for Sega, whose revenue had declined between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry-wide slowdown.

Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri would replace Tom Kalinske as chairman and CEO of Sega of America, while Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, became Sega of America&#x27;s executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations. After the 1996 launch of the Nintendo 64, sales of the Saturn and its software fell sharply. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47 percent of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40 percent, and Sega controlled only 12 percent; neither price cuts nor high-profile games helped the Saturn. 
As a result of Sega&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation, Hayao Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri, and Stolar acceded to become CEO and president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reporting a consolidated net loss of (). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor. This effectively left the Western market without Sega games for more than a year. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega—leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released.

=== Development ===
As early as 1995, reports surfaced that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita or Alliance Semiconductor to create a new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit &quot;Saturn 2&quot; or an add-on peripheral. Dreamcast development was unrelated. Considering the Saturn&#x27;s poor performance, Irimajiri looked beyond Sega&#x27;s internal hardware development division to create a new console. In 1997, he enlisted IBM&#x27;s Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an eleven-person team to work on a secret project in the United States with the codename Blackbelt. Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega tasked both teams, and another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri&#x27;s choice to begin development externally and had his team start work. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of the mainboard. Initially known as Whitebelt, the project was later codenamed Dural, after the metallic female fighter from Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series.

Yamamoto&#x27;s group opted to use 3dfx Voodoo 2 and Voodoo Banshee graphics processors alongside a Motorola PowerPC 603e central processing unit (CPU), but Sega management later asked them to also use the SH-4 chip. Both processors have been described as &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; components. According to Charles Bellfield, the former Sega of America vice president of communications and former NEC brand manager, presentations of games using the NEC solution showcased the performance and low cost delivered by the SH-4 and PowerVR architecture. He said that Sega&#x27;s relationship with NEC, a Japanese company, likely also influenced the decision to use its hardware rather than the architecture developed in America. Stolar felt the US 3dfx version should have been used, but that &quot;Japan wanted the Japanese version, and Japan won&quot;. As a result, 3dfx filed a lawsuit against Sega and NEC claiming breach of contract, which was settled out of court.

The choice to use the PowerVR architecture concerned Electronic Arts (EA), a longtime developer for Sega consoles. EA had invested in 3dfx but was unfamiliar with the selected architecture, which was reportedly less powerful. According to Shiro Hagiwara (a general manager at Sega&#x27;s hardware division) and Ian Oliver (the managing director of the Sega subsidiary Cross Products), the SH-4 was chosen while still in development, following lengthy deliberation, as the only processor that &quot;could adapt to deliver the 3D geometry calculation performance necessary&quot;. By February 1998, Sega had renamed the project Katana, after the Japanese sword, although certain hardware specifications such as random access memory (RAM) were not finalized.

Knowing the Saturn had been set back by its high production costs and complex hardware, Sega took a different approach with the Dreamcast. Like previous Sega consoles, the Dreamcast was designed around intelligent subsystems working in parallel, but the selections of hardware were closer to personal computers than video game consoles, reducing cost. It also enabled software development to begin before any development kits had been completed, as Sega informed developers that any game developed with a Pentium II 200 in mind would run on the console. According to Damien McFerran, &quot;the motherboard was a masterpiece of clean, uncluttered design and compatibility&quot;.

The Chinese economist and future Sega.com CEO Brad Huang convinced the Sega chairman, Isao Okawa, to include a modem with every Dreamcast under opposition from Okawa&#x27;s staff over the additional cost per unit. To account for rapid changes in home data delivery, Sega designed the modem to be modular.

Sega selected the GD-ROM media format. Jointly developed by Sega and Yamaha, the GD-ROM could be mass-produced at a similar price to a normal CD-ROM, avoiding the greater expense of newer DVD-ROM technology.
Microsoft developed a custom Dreamcast version of Windows CE with DirectX API and dynamic-link libraries, making it easy to port PC games to the platform, although programmers would ultimately favor Sega&#x27;s development tools over those from Microsoft. A member of the Project Katana team speaking anonymously predicted this would be the case, speculating developers would prefer the greater performance possibilities offered by the Sega OS to the more user-friendly interface of the Microsoft OS. In late 1997, there were reports about the rumored system, then codenamed Dural, and that it had been demonstrated to a number of game developers.

The Dreamcast was finally revealed on May 21, 1998 in Tokyo. Sega held a public competition to name its new system and considered over 5,000 different entries before choosing &quot;Dreamcast&quot;—a portmanteau of &quot;dream&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot;. According to Katsutoshi Eguchi, Japanese game developer Kenji Eno submitted the name and created the Dreamcast&#x27;s spiral logo, but this has not been officially confirmed by Sega. Former Sega executive Kunihisa Ueno confirmed in his biography that a branding agency called Interbrand created the logo for the console, with Kenji Eno volunteering to name the console. Eno was paid for his involvement and signed a NDA to prevent his involvement from going public.

The Dreamcast&#x27;s startup sound was composed by the Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Because the Saturn had tarnished its reputation, Sega planned to remove its name from the console and establish a new gaming brand similar to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, but Irimajiri&#x27;s management team decided to retain it. Sega spent on hardware development, on software development, and on worldwide promotion—a sum which Irimajiri, a former Honda executive, humorously likened to the investments required to design new automobiles.

=== Launch ===

==== Japan ====
Despite a 75 percent drop in half-year profits just before the Japanese launch, Sega was confident about the Dreamcast. It drew significant interest and many pre-orders. However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Japanese Dreamcast launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of , and the stock sold out by the end of the day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of &quot;Virtua Fighter 3&quot;, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply.

Sega had announced that &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, the next game starring its mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, would launch with the Dreamcast and promoted it with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall, but it and &quot;Sega Rally Championship 2&quot; were delayed. They arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over one million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but sold fewer than 900,000, undermining Sega&#x27;s attempts to build an installed base sufficient to protect the Dreamcast after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. &quot;Seaman&quot;, released in July 1999, became the Dreamcast&#x27;s first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to , effectively making it unprofitable but increasing sales. The reduction and the release of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; helped Sega gain 17 percent on its shares.

==== North America ====
Before the Dreamcast&#x27;s release, Sega was dealt a blow when Electronic Arts, the largest third-party video game publisher at the time, announced it would not develop games for it. EA&#x27;s chief creative officer Bing Gordon said that Sega had &quot;flip-flopped&quot; on the hardware configuration, that EA developers did not want to work on it, and that Sega &quot;was not acting like a competent hardware company&quot;. Gordon also said that Sega could not afford to give them the &quot;kind of license that EA has had over the last five years&quot;. According to Stolar, president of EA at the time, Larry Probst, wanted exclusive rights as the only sports brand on Dreamcast, which Stolar could not accept due to Sega&#x27;s recent purchase of the sports game developer Visual Concepts. While EA&#x27;s &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series had established brand power, Stolar regarded Visual Concepts&#x27; &quot;NFL 2K&quot; as superior and would provide &quot;a breakthrough experience&quot; to launch the Dreamcast. While the Dreamcast would have none of EA&#x27;s popular sports games, &quot;Sega Sports&quot; games developed mainly by Visual Concepts helped to fill that void.
Working closely with Midway Games (which developed four North American launch games for the system) and taking advantage of the ten months following the Dreamcast&#x27;s release in Japan, Sega of America worked to ensure a more successful US launch with a minimum of 15 launch games. With lingering bitterness over the Saturn&#x27;s early release, Stolar repaired relations with major US retailers, with whom Sega presold 300,000 Dreamcast units. In addition, a pre-launch promotion enabled consumers to rent Dreamcasts from Hollywood Video starting on July 14. Sega of America&#x27;s senior vice president of marketing Peter Moore, a fan of the attitude previously associated with Sega&#x27;s brand, worked with Foote, Cone &amp; Belding and Access Communications to develop the &quot;It&#x27;s Thinking&quot; campaign of 15-second television commercials, which emphasized the Dreamcast&#x27;s hardware power. According to Moore: &quot;We needed to create something that would really intrigue consumers, somewhat apologize for the past, but invoke all the things we loved about Sega, primarily from the Genesis days.&quot; On August 11, Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired, leaving Moore to direct the launch.

The Dreamcast launched in North America on September 9, 1999, at a price of , which Sega&#x27;s marketing dubbed &quot;9/9/99 for &quot;. Eighteen launch games were available in the US Sega set a new sales record by selling more than 225,132 Dreamcast units in 24 hours, earning in what Moore called &quot;the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history&quot;. Within two weeks, US Dreamcast sales exceeded 500,000. By Christmas, Sega held 31 percent of the North American video game market share. Significant launch games included &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, the arcade fighting game &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, and Visual Concepts&#x27; football simulation &quot;NFL 2K&quot;. On November 4, Sega announced it had sold over one million Dreamcast units. The launch was marred by a glitch at one of Sega&#x27;s manufacturing plants, which produced defective GD-ROMs.

==== Europe ====
Sega released the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999, at a price of £200. By November 24, 400,000 consoles had been sold in Europe. By Christmas of 1999, Sega of Europe had sold 500,000 units, six months ahead of schedule. The price was dropped to £149.99 from September 8, 2000, with sales at around 800,000 in Europe at this point. Announcing the drop, Jean-François Cecillon, CEO of Sega Europe, commented: &quot;There are &#x27;X&#x27; amount of core gamers in Europe; the early adopters. We have reached 80 or 90 per cent of them now and the market is screaming for a price reduction. We have to acknowledge these things and go with the market&quot;. Sales did not continue at this pace, and by October 2000, Sega had sold only about one million units in Europe. As part of Sega&#x27;s promotions of the Dreamcast in Europe, it sponsored four European football clubs: Arsenal (England), Saint-Étienne (France), Sampdoria (Italy), and Deportivo de La Coruña (Spain).

==== Australia and New Zealand ====
Through the regional distributor Ozisoft, the Dreamcast went on sale in Australia and New Zealand on November 30, 1999, at a price of . The launch was planned for September, but was delayed due to problems with Internet compatibility and launch game availability, then delayed again from the revised date of October 25 for various reasons. There were severe problems at launch; besides a severe shortage of the consoles, only six of the thirty planned launch games were available for purchase on day one with no first-party software included, and additional peripherals were not available in stores.

The Ozisoft representative Steve O&#x27;Leary, in a statement released the day of launch, explained that the Australian Customs Service had impounded virtually all the supplied launch software, including demo discs, due to insufficient labeling of their country of origin; Ozisoft had received them only two days before launch, resulting in few games that were catalogued and prepared for shipment in time. O&#x27;Leary also said that the Dreamcast&#x27;s high demand in other markets had reduced the number of peripherals allotted to the region. Further complicating matters was the lack of an internet disc due to localization problems, and delays in securing an ISP contract, which was done through Telstra the day before launch. The online component was not ready until March 2000, at which point Ozisoft sent the necessary software to users who had sent in a filled-out reply paid card included with the console. The poor launch, combined with a lack of advertising and a high price point, produced lackluster sales in Australia; two large retail chains reported a combined total of 13 console sales over the first few days after launch.

=== Competition ===

Though the Dreamcast launch was successful, Sony held 60 percent of the overall video game market share in North America with the PlayStation at the end of 1999. On March 2, 1999, Sony revealed the first details of the PlayStation 2 (PS2), which Ken Kutaragi said would allow video games to convey unprecedented emotions. Sony estimated the PS2 could render 7.5 million to 16 million polygons per second, whereas independent estimates ranged from 3 million to 20 million, compared to Sega&#x27;s estimates of more than 3 million to 6 million for the Dreamcast. The PS2 would also use the DVD-ROM format, which could hold substantially more data than the Dreamcast&#x27;s GD-ROM, and would be backwards-compatible with hundreds of popular PlayStation games. Sony&#x27;s specifications appeared to render the Dreamcast obsolete months before its US launch, although reports later emerged that the PS2 was not as powerful as expected and difficult to develop on. The same year, Nintendo announced that its next console, the GameCube, would meet or exceed anything on the market, and Microsoft began development of its own console, the Xbox.

US Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 million by the end of 1999—began to decline as early as January 2000. Poor Japanese sales contributed to Sega&#x27;s ¥42.88 billion ($404 million) consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000, which followed a loss of ¥42.881 billion the previous year and marked Sega&#x27;s third consecutive annual loss. Although Sega&#x27;s overall sales for the term increased 27.4%, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded expectations, this coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan. At the same time, increasingly poor market conditions reduced the profitability of Sega&#x27;s Japanese arcade business, prompting Sega to close 246 locations.

Moore became the president and chief operating officer of Sega of America on May 8, 2000. He and Sega&#x27;s developers focused on the US market to prepare for the upcoming launch of the PS2. To that end, Sega of America launched its own internet service provider, Sega.com, led by CEO Brad Huang. On September 7, 2000, Sega.com launched SegaNet, the Dreamcast&#x27;s internet gaming service, at a subscription price of $21.95 per month. Although Sega had previously released only one Dreamcast game in the US that featured online multiplayer, &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, the launch of SegaNet combined with the release of &quot;NFL 2K1&quot;, with a robust online component, was intended to increase demand for the Dreamcast in the US market. The service later supported games including &quot;Bomberman Online&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. The September 7 launch coincided with a new advertising campaign to promote SegaNet, including advertising on the MTV Video Music Awards that day, which Sega sponsored for the second consecutive year. Sega employed aggressive pricing strategies around online gaming; in Japan, every Dreamcast sold included a free year of internet access, which Okawa personally paid for. Prior to the launch of SegaNet, Sega had already offered a $200 rebate to any Dreamcast owner who purchased two years of internet access from Sega.com. To increase SegaNet&#x27;s appeal in the US, Sega dropped the price of the Dreamcast to (compared to the PS2&#x27;s US launch price of ) and offered a rebate for the full price of a Dreamcast, and a free Dreamcast keyboard, with every 18-month SegaNet subscription.

=== Decline ===
Moore said that the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 million units in the US by the end of 2000 to remain a viable platform; Sega fell short of this goal, with some 3 million units sold. Moreover, Sega&#x27;s attempts to spur increased Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses. Instead of an expected profit, for the six months ending September 2000, Sega posted a () loss, with a projected year-end loss of . This estimate more than doubled to , and in March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of (). While the PS2&#x27;s October 26 US launch was marred by shortages, this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected; many consumers continued to wait for a PS2, while the PSone, a remodeled version of the original PlayStation, became the bestselling console in the US at the start of the 2000 holiday season. According to Moore, &quot;The PlayStation 2 effect that we were relying upon did not work for us... People will hang on for as long as possible... What effectively happened is the PlayStation 2 lack of availability froze the marketplace.&quot; Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the US video game market, while Sega held only 15 percent. According to Bellfield, Dreamcast software sold at an 8-to-1 ratio with the hardware, but the small install base meant this did not produce enough revenue to keep it viable. During the course of 2000, the PlayStation had sold five times more than Dreamcast despite being five year old hardware.

On May 22, 2000, Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega. Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business. His sentiments were not unique; Sega co-founder David Rosen had &quot;always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware&quot;, and Stolar had suggested Sega should have sold their company to Microsoft. In September 2000, in a meeting with Sega&#x27;s Japanese executives and the heads of the company&#x27;s major Japanese game development studios, Moore and Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business and focus on software, prompting the studio heads to walk out.

Amid speculation and rumors, Sega executives denied to the media that it would leave the console hardware business. Nevertheless, on January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a &quot;platform-agnostic&quot; third-party developer, although with continued Dreamcast software support for some time. Sega also announced a price reduction to to eliminate its unsold inventory, which was estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001. After a further reduction to $79, the Dreamcast was cleared out of stores at . The final Dreamcast unit manufactured was autographed by the heads of all nine of Sega&#x27;s internal game development studios, plus the heads of Visual Concepts and Sega&#x27;s sound studio Wave Master, and given away with all 55 first-party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by &quot;GamePro&quot;. Okawa, who had previously loaned Sega in 1999, died on March 16, 2001; shortly before his death, he forgave Sega&#x27;s debts to him and returned his worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping Sega survive the transition to third-party development. As part of this restructuring, nearly one third of Sega&#x27;s Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.

=== Aftermath and reaction ===
9.13 million Dreamcast units were sold worldwide. Despite the discontinuation of Dreamcast hardware, Sega continued to support the system and had stated that more than 30 new titles were confirmed for release for the remainder of 2001. In the United States, official game releases continued until the end of the first half of 2002. Sega continued to repair Dreamcast units until 2007. Many hardware developers that worked on the Dreamcast also joined pachinko and pachislot company Sammy Corporation, who soon merged with Sega. Hideki Sato pushed for leftover Dreamcast parts being used as displays in the machines that Sammy develops, including the very successful &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; pachinko machines. 

After five consecutive years of financial losses, Sega finally posted a profit for the fiscal year ending March 2003.

The announcement of Sega&#x27;s exit from hardware was met with enthusiasm. According to &quot;IGN&quot;″s Travis Fahs, &quot;Sega was a creatively fertile company with a rapidly expanding stable of properties to draw from. It seemed like they were in a perfect position to start a new life as a developer/publisher.&quot; Former Working Designs president Victor Ireland wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s actually a good thing ... because now Sega will survive, doing what they do best: software.&quot; The staff of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that &quot;from &quot;Sonic&quot; to &quot;Shenmue&quot;, Sega&#x27;s programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media ... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they do best for any machine on the market.&quot; &quot;Game Informer&quot;, commenting on Sega&#x27;s tendency to produce under-appreciated cult classics, wrote: &quot;Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself.&quot;

== Technical specifications ==
=== Hardware ===
The Dreamcast measures and weighs . Its main CPU is a two-way 360 MIPS superscalar Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC, clocked at 200 MHz with an 8 kB instruction cache and 16 kB data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented floating-point unit delivering 1.4 GFLOPS. Its 100 MHz NEC PowerVR2 rendering engine, integrated with the ASIC, can draw more than 3 million polygons per second and use deferred shading. Sega estimated the Dreamcast&#x27;s theoretical rendering capability at 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that &quot;game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance&quot;.

Graphical hardware effects include trilinear filtering, gouraud shading, z-buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, per-pixel translucency sorting and bump mapping. The Dreamcast can output approximately 16.77 million colors simultaneously and displays interlaced or progressive scan video at 640 × 480 video resolution. Its 67 MHz Yamaha AICA sound processor, with a 32-bit ARM7 RISC CPU core, can generate 64 voices with PCM or ADPCM, providing ten times the performance of the Saturn&#x27;s sound system. The Dreamcast has 16 MB main RAM, along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. It reads media using a 12× speed Yamaha GD-ROM drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and middleware application programming interfaces.

The Dreamcast can supply video through several accessories including A/V cables, RF modulator connectors S-Video cables and SCART. A VGA adapter allows Dreamcast to connect on computer displays or enhanced-definition television sets in 480p.

=== Models ===
Sega constructed numerous Dreamcast models, most of which were exclusive to Japan. The R7, a refurbished Dreamcast, was originally used as a network console in Japanese pachinko parlors. Another model, the Divers 2000 CX-1, is shaped similarly to Sonic&#x27;s head and includes a television and software for teleconferencing. A &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; version, limited to 2000 units, was targeted at female gamers in Japan. Special editions were created for &quot;Seaman&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;. Color variations were sold through the Dreamcast Direct service in Japan. Toyota also offered special Dreamcast units at 160 of its dealers in Japan. In North America, a limited edition black Dreamcast was released with a Sega Sports logo on the lid, which included matching Sega Sports-branded black controllers and two games.

=== Controllers and accessories ===
The Dreamcast has four ports for controller inputs, and was sold with one controller. The controller is based on the Saturn 3D controller and includes an analog stick, a D-pad, four action buttons, start button and two analog triggers. It received mostly negative reviews from critics; &quot;Edge&quot; described it as &quot;an ugly evolution of Saturn&#x27;s 3D controller&quot;, and was called &quot;[not] that great&quot; by &quot;1Up.com&quot;″s Sam Kennedy and &quot;lame&quot; by &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Andy McNamara. &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;unlike most controllers, Sega&#x27;s pad forces the user&#x27;s hands into an uncomfortable parallel position&quot;. Both the analog joystick and triggers uniquely used Hall effect sensors, which requires less calibration and leads to fewer issues with joystick drift.

Various third-party controllers, from companies such as Mad Catz, include additional buttons and other features; third parties also manufactured arcade-style joysticks for fighting games, such as Agetech&#x27;s Arcade Stick and Interact&#x27;s Alloy Arcade Stick. Mad Catz and Agetec created racing wheels for racing games. Sega did not release its official light guns in the US, but some third party light guns were available. The Dreamcast supports a Sega fishing &quot;reel and rod&quot; motion controller and a keyboard for text entry. Although it was designed for fishing games such as &quot;Sega Bass Fishing&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; is playable with the fishing controller, which translates vertical and horizontal movements into on-screen swordplay; &quot;IGN&quot; cited it as a predecessor to the Wii Remote. The Japanese Dreamcast port of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram&quot; supported a &quot;Twin Sticks&quot; peripheral, but its American publisher, Activision, opted not to release it in the US. The Dreamcast can connect to SNK&#x27;s Neo Geo Pocket Color, predating Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.

In most regions, the Dreamcast includes a removable modem for online connectivity, which is modular for future upgrades. In Brazil, due to the high price of the console, the modem was sold separately. The original Japanese model and all PAL models have a transfer rate of 33.6 kbit/s, and consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999, feature a 56 kbit/s dial-up modem. Broadband service was enabled through the later release of a broadband accessory in 2000 in Japan, and early 2001 in the US.

Sega also produced the Dreameye, a digital camera that could be connected to the Dreamcast and used to exchange pictures and participate in video chat over the internet. Sega hoped developers would use the Dreameye for future software, as some later did with Sony&#x27;s similar EyeToy peripheral. In addition, Sega investigated systems that would have allowed users to make telephone calls with the Dreamcast, and discussed with Motorola the development of an internet-enabled cell phone that would use technology from the console to enable quick downloads of games and other data.

=== Storage ===

In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card, the VMU, for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, non-volatile memory, a D-pad and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, be used as a minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. For example, players use the VMU to call plays in &quot;NFL 2K&quot; or raise virtual pets in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.

Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used &quot;as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past&quot;. After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller&#x27;s design, Sega&#x27;s engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. It is generally for vibration packs providing force feedback, such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Jump Pack&quot; and Performance&#x27;s &quot;Tremor Pack&quot;; it can be used for peripherals including a microphone, enabling voice control and player communication. Various third-party cards provide storage, and some contain the LCD screen addition. Iomega announced a Dreamcast-compatible zip drive storing up to on removable discs, but it was never released.

== Software ==

=== Game library ===
The Dreamcast library consists of over 600 games across all regions, in GD-ROM format. It uses regional lockout, only playing games released within its predetermined region; however, this is circumventable via modchip installation, boot discs, or cheat discs such as Datel&#x27;s Action Replay. In Japan, the Dreamcast was launched with &quot;Virtua Fighter 3tb&quot;, &quot;Pen Pen TriIcelon&quot;, &quot;Godzilla Generations&quot;, and &quot;July&quot;. In North America, it launched with 19 games, including the highly anticipated &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, and &quot;NFL 2K&quot;. In Europe, it was planned to launch with 10 games; this increased to 15 after the launch was delayed. Licensed Dreamcast games were released until mid-2002 in the US. Some indie developers continued to release games, such as 2007&#x27;s &quot;Last Hope&quot;, developed by the German studio NG:Dev.Team.

==== First-party games ====

In what has been called &quot;a brief moment of remarkable creativity&quot;, in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by their top designers. Studios included United Game Artists (UGA), Hitmaker, Smilebit, Overworks, WOW Entertainment, Amusement Vision, Sega Rosso, Wave Master, and Sonic Team, while Sega AM2 had been taken over earlier in the year by CSK Research Institute and became independent in 2001 as SEGA-AM2 Co., Ltd. Sega&#x27;s design studios were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process. This resulted in games such as UGA&#x27;s &quot;Rez&quot;, an attempt to simulate synaesthesia in the form of a rail shooter; Wow&#x27;s &quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot;, a version of &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot; remade into a touch typing trainer; and Hitmaker&#x27;s &quot;Segagaga&quot;, a Japan-exclusive role-playing game in which players are tasked with preventing Sega from going out of business.

Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, the first fully 3D platform game starring Sega&#x27;s mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, was considered the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the Dreamcast launch. At 2.5 million copies, it is the best-selling Dreamcast game. Sonic Team also developed the Dreamcast&#x27;s first online game—&quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;—which was praised for its addictive puzzle gameplay and &quot;frantic&quot; multiplayer matches, and the critically successful music game &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, which was noted for its expensive maracas peripheral and colorful aesthetic. Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, the first online console RPG, is considered a landmark game for refining and simplifying &quot;Diablo&quot;″s style of gameplay to appeal to console audiences.

UGA created the music game &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; for a female casual audience; players help a female outer-space news reporter, Ulala, fight aliens with &quot;groove energy&quot; by dancing. Hitmaker&#x27;s arcade ports include &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, an open-world arcade racing game known for its addictive gameplay with more than one million copies sold; and &quot;Virtua Tennis&quot;, which revitalized the tennis game genre. Smilebit&#x27;s &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, in which players control a Tokyo gang of rebellious inline skaters, is cited as a major example of Sega&#x27;s commitment to original concepts during the Dreamcast&#x27;s lifespan. &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; also popularized cel shaded graphics, though it failed to meet Sega&#x27;s sales expectations. The role-playing game &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot;, developed by Overworks and produced by Rieko Kodama, was acclaimed for its surreal Jules Verne-inspired fantasy world of floating islands and sky pirates, charming protagonists, exciting airship battles and memorable plot.

AM2 developed what Sega hoped would be the Dreamcast&#x27;s killer app, &quot;Shenmue&quot;, a &quot;revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema&quot;, with a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day-and-night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects, and introducing the quick-time event in its modern form, &quot;Shenmue&quot; went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. According to Moore, &quot;Shenmue&quot; sold &quot;extremely well&quot;, but had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast&#x27;s limited installed base.

Visual Concepts&#x27; &quot;NFL 2K&quot; football series and its &quot;NBA 2K&quot; basketball series were critically acclaimed. &quot;NFL 2K&quot; was considered an outstanding launch game for its high-quality visuals and &quot;insightful, context-friendly, and, yes, even funny commentary&quot;, while &quot;NFL 2K1&quot; featured groundbreaking online multiplayer earlier than its chief competitor, EA&#x27;s &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series. &quot;Madden&quot; and &quot;2K&quot; continued to compete on other platforms through 2004, with the &quot;2K&quot; series introducing innovations such as a first person perspective new to the genre, and eventually launching &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot; at the aggressively low price point of $19.95 until EA signed an exclusive agreement with the National Football League, effectively putting every other pro-football game out of business. After Sega sold Visual Concepts for $24 million in 2005, the &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series continued with publisher Take-Two Interactive. During the Dreamcast&#x27;s lifespan, Visual Concepts also collaborated with the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; level designer Hirokazu Yasuhara on the action-adventure game &quot;Floigan Bros.&quot; and developed the action game &quot;Ooga Booga&quot;.

==== Ports and third-party games ====
Before the launch of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega announced its NAOMI arcade board, a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shares the same technology as the Dreamcast, with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and a 160 MB flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive, allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom and Namco. The Dreamcast also used parts similar to those found in personal computers with Pentium II and III processors, allowing a handful of ports of PC games.

To appeal to the European market, Sega formed a French affiliate, No Cliché, which developed games such as &quot;Toy Commander&quot;. Sega Europe also approached Bizarre Creations to develop the racing game &quot;Metropolis Street Racer&quot;. Although Acclaim, SNK, Ubisoft, Midway, Activision, Infogrames, and Capcom supported the Dreamcast during its first year, third-party support proved difficult to obtain due to the failure of the Sega Saturn and the profitability of publishing for the PlayStation. Namco&#x27;s &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, for example, was released for the Dreamcast because of the relative unpopularity of the &quot;Soul&quot; series at the time; Namco&#x27;s more successful &quot;Tekken&quot; franchise was associated with the PlayStation console and PlayStation-based arcade boards. Capcom produced a number of fighting games for the Dreamcast, including the &quot;Power Stone&quot; series, and a temporarily exclusive entry in the popular &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series, &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;. The Dreamcast is known for several shoot &#x27;em ups, most notably Treasure&#x27;s &quot;Bangai-O&quot; and &quot;Ikaruga&quot;. Sega also revived franchises from the Genesis era, such as Appaloosa Interactive&#x27;s &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;.

=== Network services ===

Dricas was an Internet service for Dreamcast consoles in Japan. The service launched the week of October 28, 1998, with its feature set expanded in the weeks preceding the Dreamcast&#x27;s launch in Japan on November 27, 1998. Much of its infrastructure was developed by ISAO Corporation, which was spun-off from Sega on November 26, 1999. Its accompanying web browser, Dream Passport, provided the ability to connect via dial-up, browse the internet, receive and send e-mail, and chat with other users. Dricas persisted until March 7, 2000, when the service was consolidated into ISAO&#x27;s multi-platform online service, isao.net. Isao.net maintained online services and game servers for the Dreamcast until Sega ceased operation of the online servers for &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, along with its GameCube port, on March 31, 2007.

SegaNet was an Internet service for dial-up-based online gaming on the Dreamcast in the United States. The service was created by Sega in collaboration with GTE through its GTE Internetworking division, later renamed Genuity. Sega announced a partnership with AT&amp;T on August 4, 1999, making the AT&amp;T WorldNet service the preferred ISP for Dreamcast in the United States, and an agreement making Excite@Home as the exclusive portal partner for SegaNet. Microsoft participated somewhat in the development of the service, but they terminated their relationship with Sega just a few months before its launch over differences in its direction. SegaNet launched on September 7, 2000, and originally offered a rebate for a free Dreamcast and keyboard with a two-year contract. Because of the Dreamcast&#x27;s discontinuation, Sega announced they would discontinue the service on July 20, 2001, less than 11 months after launch. Online support for Dreamcast games via SegaNet continued until 2003.

Dreamarena was a free dial-up-based online gaming service provided for Dreamcast consoles in Europe, launching with the debut of the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999. The service was created and operated for Sega Europe by a partnership between ICL, BT and various ISPs. The service was accessed via the DreamKey browser, which was also built into some games such as &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. After the discontinuation of the Dreamcast, Sega closed Dreamarena on February 28, 2002.

== Reception and legacy ==

In December 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; rated the Dreamcast four out of five, writing: &quot;If you want the most powerful system available now, showcasing the best graphics at a reasonable price, this system is for you.&quot; However, &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave its future prognosis three out of five, noting that Sony and Nintendo were both due to release more powerful consoles. At the beginning of 2000, five &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewers scored the Dreamcast 8.5, 8.5, 8.5, 8.0, and 9.0 out of 10. In 2001, the &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewers scored it 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, and 9.5 out of 10. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; named the Dreamcast one of the best products of 1999.

Reasons cited for the failure of the Dreamcast include consumer excitement for the PS2; a lack of support from EA and Squaresoft, the most popular third parties in the US and Japan respectively; disagreement among executives over Sega&#x27;s future, and Okawa&#x27;s lack of commitment to the product; Sega&#x27;s lack of advertising money, with Bellfield doubting that Sega spent even &quot;half&quot; the $100 million it had pledged to promote the Dreamcast in the US; that the market was not ready for online gaming; Sega&#x27;s focus on &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers over mainstream consumers; poor timing; and damage to Sega&#x27;s reputation caused by its several poorly supported previous platforms. In &quot;GamePro&quot;, Blake Snow wrote of &quot;the much beloved [Dreamcast] launched years ahead of the competition but ultimately struggled to shed the negative reputation [Sega] had gained during the Saturn, Sega 32X, and Sega CD days. As a result, casual gamers and jaded third-party developers doubted Sega&#x27;s ability to deliver.&quot;

&quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Dan Whitehead noted that consumers&#x27; &quot;wait-and-see&quot; approach, and the lack of support from EA, were symptoms rather the cause of Sega&#x27;s decline. He concluded that &quot;Sega&#x27;s misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name&quot;. According to &quot;1Up.com&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Parish, it would be intellectually dishonest to blame Sony for &quot;killing the Dreamcast by overselling the PS2&quot;, as Sega&#x27;s lack of support for previous consoles had made customers hesitant to purchase Dreamcasts.

In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; named the Dreamcast the eighth-greatest video game console, praising its software and innovations, including its online play. In 2010, &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest console and said that it was &quot;gone too soon&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Edge&quot; named the Dreamcast the tenth-best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second-screen technology through the use of VMUs. &quot;Edge&quot; wrote that &quot;Sega&#x27;s console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... [b]ut its influence can still be felt today.&quot; Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; likened the Dreamcast to &quot;a small, square, white plastic JFK. A progressive force in some ways, perhaps misguided in others, but nevertheless a promising life cut tragically short by dark shadowy forces, spawning complex conspiracy theories that endure to this day.&quot; He wrote that its short lifespan &quot;may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever&quot;, as &quot;nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise&quot;. According to &quot;IGN&quot;″s Travis Fahs, &quot;Many hardware manufacturers have come and gone, but it&#x27;s unlikely any will go out with half as much class as Sega.&quot;

The Dreamcast&#x27;s game library was celebrated. In January 2000, three months after the Dreamcast&#x27;s North American launch, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that &quot;with triple-A stuff like &quot;Soul Calibur&quot;, &quot;NBA 2K&quot;, and soon &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; to kick around, we figure you&#x27;re happy you took the 128-bit plunge&quot;. In a retrospective, &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s Jeffrey L. Wilson referred to Dreamcast&#x27;s &quot;killer library&quot; and said that Sega&#x27;s creative influence and visual innovation had been at its peak. The staff of &quot;Edge&quot; agreed with this assessment of Dreamcast games, including Sega&#x27;s arcade conversions, stating that the system &quot;delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect&quot;. Damien McFerran of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; praised Dreamcast&#x27;s NAOMI arcade ports, and wrote: &quot;The thrill of playing &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again.&quot;

Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in &quot;Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association&quot;, argued that &quot;the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of video game development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde ... It is hard to imagine a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have.&quot; &quot;1Up.com&quot;″s Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast output, which included some of &quot;the most varied, creative, and fun [games] the company had ever produced&quot;, with its &quot;enervated&quot; status as a third-party. Fahs noted, &quot;The Dreamcast&#x27;s life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties.&quot; According to author Steven L. Kent, &quot;From &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Shenmue&quot; to &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and &quot;Seaman&quot;, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered.&quot;

Some journalists have compared the demise of the Dreamcast with changing trends in the video game industry. In &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, Duncan Harris wrote: &quot;One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture ... Sega&#x27;s console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games.&quot; Jeremy Parish, writing for &quot;USgamer&quot;, contrasted the Dreamcast&#x27;s diverse library with the &quot;suffocating sense of conservatism&quot; that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade. According to Sega&#x27;s head of product implementation, Tadashi Takezaki, the Dreamcast would have been Sega&#x27;s last video game console no matter how it sold because of the changes in the market and the rise of PCs. He praised the Dreamcast for its features, saying in 2013, &quot;The seeds we sowed with the Dreamcast are finally bearing fruit at this point in time. In some ways, we were going by the seat of our pants, but it was part of the Sega credo at the time — if it&#x27;s fun, then go for it.&quot;

The Dreamcast remains popular in the video game homebrew community. By 2014, unlicensed Dreamcast games formatted for MIL-CD, a multimedia-enhanced format developed by Sega and supported by the Dreamcast, continued to be released. After Sega shut down the official Dreamcast servers, hobbyists developed private servers to allow games such as &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; to continue being played online. Hobbyists have restored online functions for 40 Dreamcast games as of 2025.

<doc id="29039" wikidata="Q24771787" url="?curid=29039" title="SH3 domain">
<text>The SRC Homology 3 Domain (or SH3 domain) is a small protein domain of about 60 amino acid residues. Initially, SH3 was described as a conserved sequence in the viral adaptor protein v-Crk. This domain is also present in the molecules of phospholipase and several cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Abl and Src. It has also been identified in several other protein families such as: PI3 Kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, CDC24 and cdc25. SH3 domains are found in proteins of signaling pathways regulating the cytoskeleton, the Ras protein, and the Src kinase and many others. The SH3 proteins interact with adaptor proteins and tyrosine kinases. Interacting with tyrosine kinases, SH3 proteins usually bind far away from the active site. Approximately 300 SH3 domains are found in proteins encoded in the human genome. In addition to that, the SH3 domain was responsible for controlling protein-protein interactions in the signal transduction pathways and regulating the interactions of proteins involved in the cytoplasmic signaling.

==Structure==
The SH3 domain has a characteristic beta-barrel fold that consists of five or six β-strands arranged as two tightly packed anti-parallel β sheets. The linker regions may contain short helices. The SH3-type fold is an ancient fold found in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.

==Peptide binding==
The classical SH3 domain is usually found in proteins that interact with other proteins and mediate assembly of specific protein complexes, typically via binding to proline-rich peptides in their respective binding partner. Classical SH3 domains are restricted in humans to intracellular proteins, although the small human MIA family of extracellular proteins also contain a domain with an SH3-like fold.

Many SH3-binding epitopes of proteins have a consensus sequence that can be represented as a regular expression or Short linear motif:
 -X-P-p-X-P-
 1 2 3 4 5

with 1 and 4 being aliphatic amino acids, 2 and 5 always and 3 sometimes being proline. The sequence binds to the hydrophobic pocket of the SH3 domain. More recently, SH3 domains that bind to a core consensus motif R-x-x-K have been described. Examples are the C-terminal SH3 domains of adaptor proteins like Grb2 and Mona (a.k.a. Gads, Grap2, Grf40, GrpL etc.). Other SH3 binding motifs have emerged and are still emerging in the course of various molecular studies, highlighting the versatility of this domain.

==SH3 interactomes==
SH3 domain-mediated protein-protein interaction networks, &quot;i.e.&quot;, SH3 interactomes, revealed that worm SH3 interactome resembles the analogous yeast network because it is significantly enriched for proteins with roles in endocytosis. Nevertheless, orthologous SH3 domain-mediated interactions are highly rewired between worm and yeast.

<doc id="29040" wikidata="Q10861254" url="?curid=29040" title="Generalized Stokes theorem">
<text>In vector calculus and differential geometry the generalized Stokes theorem (sometimes with apostrophe as Stokes&#x27; theorem or Stokes&#x27;s theorem), also called the Stokes–Cartan theorem, is a statement about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from vector calculus. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus is the special case where the manifold is a line segment, Green’s theorem and Stokes&#x27; theorem are the cases of a surface in formula_1 or formula_2 and the divergence theorem is the case of a volume in formula_3 Hence, the theorem is sometimes referred to as the fundamental theorem of multivariate calculus.

Stokes&#x27; theorem says that the integral of a differential form formula_4 over the boundary formula_5 of some orientable manifold formula_6 is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative formula_7 over the whole of formula_6, i.e.,
formula_9

Stokes&#x27; theorem was formulated in its modern form by Élie Cartan in 1945, following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by Vito Volterra, Édouard Goursat, and Henri Poincaré.

This modern form of Stokes&#x27; theorem is a vast generalization of a classical result that Lord Kelvin communicated to George Stokes in a letter dated July 2, 1850. Stokes set the theorem as a question on the 1854 Smith&#x27;s Prize exam, which led to the result bearing his name. It was first published by Hermann Hankel in 1861. This classical case relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field formula_10 over a surface (that is, the flux of formula_11) in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over the surface boundary.

== Introduction ==
The second fundamental theorem of calculus states that the integral of a function formula_12 over the interval formula_13 can be calculated by finding an antiderivative formula_14 of formula_12:
formula_16

Stokes&#x27; theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of formula_14, formula_18. In the parlance of differential forms, this is saying that formula_19 is the exterior derivative of the 0-form, i.e. function, formula_14: in other words, that formula_21. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher degree differential forms formula_4 instead of just 0-forms such as formula_14.
* A closed interval formula_13 is a simple example of a one-dimensional manifold with boundary. Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points formula_25 and formula_26. Integrating formula_12 over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be orientable, and the form has to be compactly supported in order to give a well-defined integral.
* The two points formula_25 and formula_26 form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes&#x27; theorem applies to oriented manifolds formula_30 with boundary. The boundary formula_31 of formula_30 is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of formula_30. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, formula_25 inherits the opposite orientation as formula_26, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, &quot;integrating&quot; formula_14 over two boundary points formula_25, formula_26 is taking the difference formula_39.
In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral (formula_40) over a 1-dimensional manifold (formula_13) by considering the anti-derivative (formula_14) at the 0-dimensional boundaries (formula_43), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals (formula_7) over formula_45-dimensional manifolds (formula_6) by considering the antiderivative (formula_4) at the formula_48-dimensional boundaries (formula_5) of the manifold.

So the fundamental theorem reads:
formula_50

==Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary==
Let formula_6 be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension formula_45 with boundary and let formula_53 be a smooth formula_45-differential form that is compactly supported on formula_6. First, suppose that formula_53 is compactly supported in the domain of a single, oriented coordinate chart formula_57. In this case, we define the integral of formula_53 over formula_6 as
formula_60
i.e., via the pullback of formula_53 to formula_62.

More generally, the integral of formula_53 over formula_6 is defined as follows: Let formula_65 be a partition of unity associated with a locally finite cover formula_66 of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral
formula_67
where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to formula_62 as described above. This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.

The generalized Stokes theorem reads:
Here formula_69 is the exterior derivative, which is defined using the manifold structure only. The right-hand side is sometimes written as formula_70 to stress the fact that the formula_48-manifold formula_5 has no boundary. (This fact is also an implication of Stokes&#x27; theorem, since for a given smooth formula_45-dimensional manifold formula_6, application of the theorem twice gives formula_75 for any formula_76-form formula_4, which implies that formula_78.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate &quot;integral&quot; laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent &quot;differential&quot; formulations (see below).

The theorem is often used in situations where formula_6 is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often formula_80, on which the form formula_4 is defined.

==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==

Let be a smooth manifold. A (smooth) singular -simplex in is defined as a smooth map from the standard simplex in to . The group of singular -chains on is defined to be the free abelian group on the set of singular -simplices in . These groups, together with the boundary map, , define a chain complex. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual singular homology group (resp. the singular cohomology group ), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in .

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, , as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the de Rham cohomology groups formula_82.

Differential -forms can be integrated over a -simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to . Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of -forms to the th group of singular cochains, , the linear functionals on . In other words, a -form defines a functional
formula_83
on the -chains. Stokes&#x27; theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, , behaves like the &quot;dual&quot; of on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:

#closed forms, i.e., , have zero integral over &quot;boundaries&quot;, i.e. over manifolds that can be written as , and
#exact forms, i.e., , have zero integral over &quot;cycles&quot;, i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: .

De Rham&#x27;s theorem shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if are cycles generating the th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, , there exist a closed form, , such that
formula_84
and this form is unique up to exact forms.

Stokes&#x27; theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes&#x27; theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa. Formally stated, the latter reads:

== Underlying principle ==

To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes&#x27; theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, simplices), which usually is not difficult.

== Classical vector analysis example ==
Let formula_85 be a piecewise smooth Jordan plane curve. The Jordan curve theorem implies that formula_86 divides formula_1 into two components, a compact one and another that is non-compact. Let formula_88 denote the compact part that is bounded by formula_86 and suppose formula_90 is smooth, with formula_91. If formula_92 is the space curve defined by formula_93 and formula_10 is a smooth vector field on formula_95, then:
formula_96

This classical statement is a special case of the general formulation after making an identification of vector field with a 1-form and its curl with a two form through 
formula_97
formula_98

==Generalization to rough sets==
The formulation above, in which formula_6 is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications. For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two formula_100-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners. In such a case, the corner points mean that formula_6 is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes&#x27; theorem given above does not apply. Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes&#x27; theorem is still true. This is because formula_6 and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a measure zero set).

A version of Stokes&#x27; theorem that allows for roughness was proved by Whitney. Assume that formula_88 is a connected bounded open subset of formula_62. Call formula_88 a &quot;standard domain&quot; if it satisfies the following property: there exists a subset formula_106 of formula_107, open in formula_107, whose complement in formula_107 has Hausdorff formula_48-measure zero; and such that every point of formula_106 has a &quot;generalized normal vector&quot;. This is a vector formula_112 such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that formula_112 is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around formula_100, there exists a smooth function formula_115 such that formula_106 is the graph formula_117 and formula_88 is the region formula_119. Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff formula_48-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth formula_48-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side. He then proves that if formula_88 is a standard domain in formula_62, formula_4 is an formula_48-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on formula_126, smooth on formula_88, integrable on formula_106, and such that formula_7 is integrable on formula_88, then Stokes&#x27; theorem holds, that is,
formula_131

The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to geometric measure theory. Even more general versions of Stokes&#x27; theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.

==Special cases==
The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using Cartesian coordinates without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Classical (vector calculus) case===


This is a (dualized) (1 + 1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about vector fields). This special case is often just referred to as &quot;Stokes&#x27; theorem&quot; in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the curl theorem.

The classical Stokes&#x27; theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface formula_132 in Euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with formula_133) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, formula_134, must have positive orientation, meaning that formula_134 points counterclockwise when the surface normal, formula_45, points toward the viewer.

One consequence of this theorem is that the field lines of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:
===Green&#x27;s theorem===
Green&#x27;s theorem is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of , , and cited above.

Two of the four Maxwell equations involve curls of 3-D vector fields, and their differential and integral forms are related by the special 3-dimensional (vector calculus) case of Stokes&#x27; theorem. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see Differentiation under the integral sign):
The above listed subset of Maxwell&#x27;s equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in SI units. In other systems of units, such as CGS or Gaussian units, the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday&#x27;s law of induction and Ampère&#x27;s law take the forms:
formula_137
respectively, where is the speed of light in vacuum.

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise, the divergence theorem
formula_138
is a special case if we identify a vector field with the formula_48-form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case formula_140 where formula_141 is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives
formula_142
Since this holds for all formula_141 we find
formula_144

===Volume integral of gradient of scalar field===
Let formula_145 be a scalar field. Then
formula_146
where formula_147 is the normal vector to the surface formula_148 at a given point.

Proof:
Let formula_141 be a vector. Then
formula_150
Since this holds for any formula_141 (in particular, for every basis vector), the result follows.

<doc id="29042" wikidata="Q581100" url="?curid=29042" title="Superfetation">
<text>Superfetation (also spelled superfoetation – see fetus) is the simultaneous occurrence of more than one stage of developing offspring in the same animal.

In mammals, it manifests as the formation of an embryo from a subsequent menstrual cycle, while another embryo or fetus is already present in the uterus. When two separate instances of fertilisation occur during the same menstrual cycle, it is known as superfecundation.

==Humans==
While proposed cases of superfetation have been reported in humans, the existence of this phenomenon in humans has been deemed unlikely. Better explanations include differential growth between twins due to various reasons, such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Artificially-induced superfetation has been demonstrated, although only up to a short period after insemination.

A 2008 French study found evidence to suggest that superfetation is a reality for humans, but that it is so rare that there have been fewer than 10 recorded cases in the world.

In 2017, it was reported that an American woman who had agreed to act as a surrogate for a Chinese couple bore two babies, who were initially believed to be twins. Before the adoptive parents could return home to China, however, it was discovered that one of the babies was, in fact, the biological son of the surrogate. Doctors confirmed that the birth-mother had become pregnant with her and her partner&#x27;s child, roughly three weeks after becoming pregnant with the Chinese couple&#x27;s child.

There have been multiple cases in the United States of women who reported twins with a difference in age of a week or less and women who reported two surges of ovulation occurring within a few days of each other. Though rare, this condition is believed to affect as many as 0.3% of women, but one twin is often lost, so the true numbers are not known.

Research has found that 10% of women release two eggs in a cycle, but both eggs are released at the end of the same &quot;wave&quot; of follicullogenesis, which does not support the theory of superfetation in humans.

In 2017, a woman in İzmir, Turkey, became pregnant with two babies conceived about a month apart and she gave birth to both on October 7, 2017. According to the news report this event has officially been registered in global medical records as the 12th superfetation case. 

In September 2020, a woman in Wiltshire, England, gave birth to fraternal twins, who were conceived three weeks apart.

==Other animals==
Superfetation is normal for some species of poeciliid fish and has been clearly demonstrated for the European brown hare.

In domestic cats, superfecundation is common, but superfetation never has been definitively proven to occur.

Animals that have been claimed to be subject to superfetation include rodents (mice and rats), rabbits, horses, sheep, marsupials (kangaroos and sugar gliders), felines, and primates (humans).

<text>Steenbeck is a company that manufactures flatbed editors. Steenbeck is a brand name that has become synonymous with a type of flatbed film editing suite which is usable with both 16 mm and 35 mm optical sound and magnetic sound film.

The Steenbeck company was founded in 1931 by Wilhelm Steenbeck in Hamburg, Germany. Since then, Steenbeck editing tables have become ubiquitous in the film editing community and have seen significant use in television production. In total, more than 25,000 machines are in operation around the world. The company relocated to Venray, Netherlands, in September 2003, where it still manufactures editing tables.

Despite the move away from physical film stock – much editing is now based on digital media – devices such as the Lightworks non-linear film editing controller and archives still use the Steenbeck for controlling the process. The Steenbeck&#x27;s lower light levels and controllable speed make it a preferred piece of equipment for film archives (such as the Library of Congress&#x27;s motion picture collection) and restoration facilities as prints can be quickly and easily inspected with less risk of damage compared with a movie projector. Because there is no intermittent movement, the image is created through a rotating prism which scans the frames. Steenbeck machines were known to be exceptionally easy on film stock, due to their use of soft-edged nylon rollers.

<doc id="29045" wikidata="Q203986" url="?curid=29045" title="Speciesism">
<text>Speciesism () is a term used in philosophy regarding the treatment of individuals of different species. The term has several different definitions. Some specifically define speciesism as discrimination or unjustified treatment based on an individual&#x27;s species membership, while others define it as differential treatment without regard to whether the treatment is justified or not. Richard D. Ryder, who coined the term, defined it as &quot;a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one&#x27;s own species and against those of members of other species&quot;. Speciesism results in the belief that humans have the right to use non-human animals in exploitative ways which is pervasive in the modern society. Studies from 2015 and 2019 suggest that people who support animal exploitation also tend to have intersectional bias that encapsulates and endorses racist, sexist, and other prejudicial views, which furthers the beliefs in human supremacy and group dominance to justify systems of inequality and oppression.

As a term, speciesism first appeared during a protest against animal experimentation in 1970. Philosophers and animal rights advocates state that speciesism plays a role in the animal–industrial complex, including in the practice of factory farming, animal slaughter, blood sports (such as bullfighting, cockfighting and rodeos), the taking of animals&#x27; fur and skin, and experimentation on animals, as well as the refusal to help animals suffering in the wild due to natural processes, and the categorization of certain animals as alien, non-naturalized, feral and invasive giving then the justification to their killing or culling based on these classifications.

Notable proponents of the concept include Peter Singer, Oscar Horta, Steven M. Wise, Gary L. Francione, Melanie Joy, David Nibert, Steven Best, and Ingrid Newkirk. Among academics, the ethics, morality, and concept of speciesism has been the subject of substantial philosophical debate. Carl Cohen, Nel Noddings, Bernard Williams, Peter Staudenmaier, Christopher Grau, Douglas Maclean, Roger Scruton, Thomas Wells, and Robert Nozick have criticized the term or elements of it.

Buffon, a French naturalist, writing in &quot;Histoire Naturelle&quot;, published in 1753, questioned whether it could be doubted that animals &quot;whose organization is similar to ours, must experience similar sensations&quot;, and that &quot;those sensations must be proportioned to the activity and perfection of their senses&quot;. Despite these assertions, he insisted that there exists a gap between humans and other animals. In the poem &quot;Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne&quot;, Voltaire described a kinship between all sentient beings, humans and animals alike, stating: &quot;All sentient things, born by the same stern law, / Suffer like me, and like me also die.&quot;

==== Jeremy Bentham ====
Jeremy Bentham was the first Western philosopher to advocate for animals&#x27; equal consideration within a comprehensive, secular moral framework. He argued that species membership is morally irrelevant and that any being capable of suffering has intrinsic value. In his 1789 book, &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;, he wrote:The day may come, when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withheld from them but by the hand of tyranny.… [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Additionally, he was a strong proponent of animal welfare laws. However, he also accepted the killing and use of animals, provided that unnecessary cruelty was avoided.

==== Lewis Gompertz ====

In his 1824 work &quot;Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes&quot;, English writer and early animal rights advocate Lewis Gompertz argued for egalitarianism, extending it to nonhuman animals. He stated that humans and animals have highly similar feelings and sensations, noting that experiences like hunger, desire, fear, and anger affect both in similar ways. Gompertz also pointed out shared physiological characteristics between humans and animals, suggesting a similarity in sensation. He criticized the use of animals by humans, highlighting the disregard for their feelings, needs, and desires.

==== Charles Darwin ====

English naturalist Charles Darwin, writing in his notebook in 1838, asserted that man thinks of himself as a masterpiece produced by a deity, but that he thought it &quot;truer to consider him created from animals.&quot; In his 1871 book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, Darwin argued:There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties ... [t]he difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. We have seen that the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a well-developed condition, in the lower animals.

==== Arthur Schopenhauer ====

German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer asserted that anthropocentrism was a fundamental defect of Christianity and Judaism, arguing that these religions have been a source of immense suffering for sentient beings because they separate man from the world of animals, leading to the treatment of animals as only things. Schopenhauer praised Brahmanism and Buddhism for their focus on kinship between humans and other animals, as well as their emphasis on the connection between them through metempsychosis.

==== Secular and utilitarian animal advocacy ====
Secularists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advocated for animals based their stance on utilitarian principles and evolutionary kinship, critiquing the Christian church&#x27;s neglect of social justice and acceptance of suffering as divinely ordained. They sought a morality free from religious influence, initially supporting vivisection for human benefit but later questioning its necessity. Figures like G. W. Foote argued for broader utility, focusing on long-term moral principles rather than immediate gains. Embracing evolutionary theories, secularists highlighted the common origins and similarities between humans and animals, arguing that morality should extend to animals as they too experience pain and pleasure. They rejected the Christian theological gap between humans and animals, promoting scientific theories to support animal rights and welfare.

English writer and animal rights advocate Henry S. Salt, in his 1892 book &quot;Animals&#x27; Rights,&quot; argued that for humans to do justice to other animals, they must look beyond the conception of a &quot;great gulf&quot; between them, claiming instead that we should recognize the &quot;common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood&quot;.

Edward Payson Evans, an American scholar and animal rights advocate, criticized anthropocentric psychology and ethics in his 1897 work &quot;Evolutional Ethics and Animal Psychology&quot;. He argued that these views wrongfully treat humans as fundamentally different from other sentient beings, disregarding any moral obligations towards them. Evans believed that Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution implied moral duties not only towards enslaved humans but also towards nonhuman animals. He asserted that beyond kind treatment, animals need enforceable rights to protect them from cruelty. Evans contended that recognizing the kinship between humans and all sentient beings would make it impossible to mistreat them.

An 1898 article in &quot;The Zoophilist&quot;, titled &quot;Anthropocentric Ethics&quot;, argued that early civilizations, before Christianity, viewed tenderness and mercy towards sentient beings as a law. It highlighted that Zarathustra, Buddha, and early Greek philosophers, who practiced vegetarianism, espoused this philosophy. The article claimed that this understanding of human-animal kinship persisted into early Christianity but was challenged by figures like Origen, who saw animals as mere automata for human use. It concluded that the relationship between animal psychology and evolutionary ethics is gaining scientific and moral attention and can no longer be ignored.

In 1895, American zoologist, philosopher, and animal rights advocate J. Howard Moore described vegetarianism as the ethical result of recognizing the evolutionary kinship of all creatures, aligning with Darwin&#x27;s insights. He criticized the &quot;pre-Darwinian delusion&quot; that nonhuman animals were created for human use. In his 1899 book &quot;Better-World Philosophy&quot;, Moore argued that human ethics were still anthropocentric, evolving to include various human groups but not animals. He proposed &quot;zoocentricism&quot; as the next stage, considering the entire sentient universe. In his 1906 book &quot;The Universal Kinship&quot;, Moore criticized the &quot;provincialist&quot; attitude leading to animal mistreatment, comparing it to denying ethical relations among human groups. He condemned the human-centric perspective and urged consideration of victims&#x27; viewpoints, concluding that the Golden Rule should apply to all sentient beings, advocating equal ethical consideration for animals and humans: [D]o as you would be done by—and &quot;not&quot; to the dark man and the white woman alone, but to the sorrel horse and the gray squirrel as well; &quot;not&quot; to creatures of your own anatomy only, but to &quot;all&quot; creatures.

===Coining of the term===

The term &quot;speciesism&quot;, and the argument that it is a prejudice, first appeared in 1970 in a privately printed pamphlet written by British psychologist Richard D. Ryder. Ryder was a member of a group of academics in Oxford, England, the nascent animal rights community, now known as the Oxford Group. One of the group&#x27;s activities was distributing pamphlets about areas of concern; the pamphlet titled &quot;Speciesism&quot; was written to protest against animal experimentation. The term was intended by its proponents to create a rhetorical and categorical link to racism and sexism.

Ryder stated in the pamphlet that &quot;[s]ince Darwin, scientists have agreed that there is no &#x27;magical&#x27; essential difference between humans and other animals, biologically-speaking. Why then do we make an almost total distinction morally? If all organisms are on one physical continuum, then we should also be on the same moral continuum.&quot; He wrote that, at that time in the United Kingdom, 5,000,000 animals were being used each year in experiments, and that attempting to gain benefits for our own species through the mistreatment of others was &quot;just &#x27;speciesism&#x27; and as such it is a selfish emotional argument rather than a reasoned one&quot;. Ryder used the term again in an essay, &quot;Experiments on Animals&quot;, in &quot;Animals, Men and Morals&quot; (1971), a collection of essays on animal rights edited by philosophy graduate students Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch and John Harris, who were also members of the Oxford Group. Ryder wrote:

In as much as both &quot;race&quot; and &quot;species&quot; are vague terms used in the classification of living creatures according, largely, to physical appearance, an analogy can be made between them. Discrimination on grounds of race, although most universally condoned two centuries ago, is now widely condemned. Similarly, it may come to pass that enlightened minds may one day abhor &quot;speciesism&quot; as much as they now detest &quot;racism.&quot; The illogicality in both forms of prejudice is of an identical sort. If it is accepted as morally wrong to deliberately inflict suffering upon innocent human creatures, then it is only logical to also regard it as wrong to inflict suffering on innocent individuals of other species. ... The time has come to act upon this logic.

===Spread of the idea===

The term was popularized by the Australian philosopher Peter Singer in his book &quot;Animal Liberation&quot; (1975). Singer had known Ryder from his own time as a graduate philosophy student at Oxford. He credited Ryder with having coined the term and used it in the title of his book&#x27;s fifth chapter: &quot;Man&#x27;s Dominion ... &quot;a short history of speciesism&quot;&quot;, defining it as &quot;a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one&#x27;s own species and against those of members of other species&quot;:

Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Sexists violate the principle of equality by favouring the interests of their own sex. Similarly, speciesists allow the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is identical in each case.

Singer stated from a preference-utilitarian perspective, writing that speciesism violates the principle of equal consideration of interests, the idea based on Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s principle: &quot;each to count for one, and none for more than one.&quot; Singer stated that, although there may be differences between humans and nonhumans, they share the capacity to suffer, and we must give equal consideration to that suffering. Any position that allows similar cases to be treated in a dissimilar fashion fails to qualify as an acceptable moral theory. The term caught on; Singer wrote that it was an awkward word but that he could not think of a better one. It became an entry in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1985, defined as &quot;discrimination against or exploitation of animal species by human beings, based on an assumption of mankind&#x27;s superiority.&quot; In 1994 the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy&quot; offered a wider definition: &quot;By analogy with racism and sexism, the improper stance of refusing respect to the lives, dignity, or needs of animals of other than the human species.&quot;

=== Anti-speciesism movement ===
The French-language journal &quot;Cahiers antispécistes&quot; (&quot;Antispeciesist notebooks&quot;) was founded in 1991, by David Olivier, Yves Bonnardel and Françoise Blanchon, who were the first French activists to speak out against speciesism. The aim of the journal was to disseminate anti-speciesist ideas in France and to encourage debate on the topic of animal ethics, specifically on the difference between animal liberation and ecology. Estela Díaz and Oscar Horta assert that in Spanish-speaking countries, unlike English-speaking countries, anti-speciesism has become the dominant approach for animal advocacy. In Italy, the contemporary anti-speciesist movement has two main approaches: one that takes a strong, radical stance against the dominant societal norms, and another that aligns more with mainstream, neoliberal views.

In the 21st century, animal rights groups such as the Farm Animal Rights Movement and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have attempted to popularize the concept by promoting a World Day Against Speciesism on 5 June. The World Day for the End of Speciesism (WoDES) is a similar annual observance held at the end of August. The WoDES has been held annually since 2015.

==Social psychology and relationship with other prejudices==
Scholars including philosopher Peter Singer and botanist Brent Mishler have argued that speciesism is analogous to racism, the belief that some human races are superior to others.

In the 2019 book &quot;Why We Love and Exploit Animals&quot;, Kristof Dhont, Gordon Hodson, Ana C. Leite, and Alina Salmen reveal the psychological connections between speciesism and other prejudices such as racism and sexism. Marjetka Golež Kaučič connects racism and speciesism saying that discriminations based on race and species are strongly interrelated, with human rights providing the legal ground for the development of the animal rights. Kaučič further argues that racism and speciesism are further connected to issues of freedom, both collective and individual.

In one study, 242 participants responded to questions on the Speciesism Scale, and those who scored higher on this scale scored higher on racism, sexism, and homophobia scales. Other studies suggest that those who support animal exploitation also tend to endorse racist and sexist views, furthering the beliefs in human supremacy and group dominance in order to justify systems of inequality and oppression. It is suggested that the connection rests in the ideology of social dominance.

Psychologists have also considered examining speciesism as a specific psychological construct or attitude (as opposed to speciesism as a philosophy), which was achieved using a specifically designed Likert scale. Studies have found that speciesism is a stable construct that differs amongst personalities and correlates with other variables. For example, speciesism has been found to have a weak positive correlation with homophobia and right-wing authoritarianism, as well as slightly stronger correlations with political conservatism, racism and system justification. Moderate positive correlations were found with social dominance orientation and sexism. Social dominance orientation was theorised to be underpinning most of the correlations; controlling for social dominance orientation reduces all correlations substantially and renders many statistically insignificant. Speciesism likewise predicts levels of prosociality toward animals and behavioural food choices.

Those who state that speciesism is unfair to individuals of nonhuman species have often invoked mammals and chickens in the context of research or farming. There is not yet a clear definition or line agreed upon by a significant segment of the movement as to which species are to be treated equally with humans or in some ways additionally protected: mammals, birds, reptiles, arthropods, insects, bacteria, etc. This question is all the more complex since a study by Miralles et al. (2019) has brought to light the evolutionary component of human empathic and compassionate reactions and the influence of anthropomorphic mechanisms in our affective relationship with the living world as a whole: the more an organism is evolutionarily distant from us, the less we recognize ourselves in it and the less we are moved by its fate.

Some researchers have suggested that since speciesism could be considered, in terms of social psychology, a prejudice (defined as &quot;any attitude, emotion, or behaviour toward members of a group, which directly or indirectly implies some negativity or antipathy toward that group&quot;), then laypeople may be aware of a connection between it and other forms of &quot;traditional&quot; prejudice. Research suggests laypeople do indeed tend to infer similar personality traits and beliefs from a speciesist that they would from a racist, sexist or homophobe. However, it is not clear if there is a link between speciesism and non-traditional forms of prejudice such as negative attitudes towards the overweight or towards Christians.

Psychological studies have furthermore argued that people tend to &quot;morally value individuals of certain species less than others even when beliefs about intelligence and sentience are accounted for.&quot; One study identified that there are age-related differences in moral views of animal worth, with children holding less speciesist beliefs than adults; the authors argue that such findings indicate that the development of speciesist beliefs is socially constructed over an individual&#x27;s lifetime.

==Relationship with the animal–industrial complex==

Piers Beirne considers speciesism as the ideological anchor of the intersecting networks of the animal–industrial complex, such as factory farms, vivisection, hunting and fishing, zoos and aquaria, and wildlife trade. Amy Fitzgerald and Nik Taylor argue that the animal-industrial complex is both a consequence and cause of speciesism, which according to them is a form of discrimination similar to racism or sexism. They also argue that the obfuscation of meat&#x27;s animal origins is a critical part of the animal–industrial complex under capitalist and neoliberal regimes. Speciesism results in the belief that humans have the right to use non-human animals, which is pervasive in the modern society.

Sociologist David Nibert states,

Some scholars have argued that all kinds of animal production are rooted in speciesism, reducing animals to mere economic resources. Built on the production and slaughter of animals, the animal–industrial complex is perceived as the materialization of the institution of speciesism, with speciesism becoming &quot;a mode of production&quot;. In his 2011 book &quot;Critical Theory and Animal Liberation&quot;, J. Sanbonmatsu argues that speciesism is not ignorance or the absence of a moral code towards animals, but is a mode of production and material system imbricated with capitalism.

==Arguments in favor==

Philosopher Carl Cohen stated in 1986: &quot;Speciesism is not merely plausible; it is essential for right conduct, because those who will not make the morally relevant distinctions among species are almost certain, in consequence, to misapprehend their true obligations.&quot; Cohen writes that racism and sexism are wrong because there are no relevant differences between the sexes or races. Between people and animals, he states, there are significant differences; his view is that animals do not qualify for Kantian personhood, and as such have no rights.

Nel Noddings, the American feminist, has criticized Singer&#x27;s concept of speciesism for being simplistic, and for failing to take into account the context of species preference, as concepts of racism and sexism have taken into account the context of discrimination against humans. Peter Staudenmaier has stated that comparisons between speciesism and racism or sexism are trivializing:

The central analogy to the civil rights movement and the women&#x27;s movement is trivializing and ahistorical. Both of those social movements were initiated and driven by members of the dispossessed and excluded groups themselves, not by benevolent men or white people acting on their behalf. Both movements were built precisely around the idea of reclaiming and reasserting a shared humanity in the face of a society that had deprived it and denied it. No civil rights activist or feminist ever argued, &quot;We&#x27;re sentient beings too!&quot; They argued, &quot;We&#x27;re fully human too!&quot; Animal liberation doctrine, far from extending this humanist impulse, directly undermines it.

A similar argument was made by Bernard Williams, who observed that a difference between speciesism versus racism and sexism is that racists and sexists deny any input from those of a different race or sex when it comes to questioning how they should be treated. Conversely, when it comes to how animals should be treated by humans, Williams observed that it is only possible for humans to discuss that question. Williams observed that being a human being is often used as an argument against discrimination on the grounds of race or sex, whereas racism and sexism are seldom deployed to counter discrimination.

Williams also stated in favour of speciesism (which he termed &#x27;humanism&#x27;), arguing that &quot;Why are fancy properties which are grouped under the label of personhood &quot;morally relevant&quot; to issues of destroying a certain kind of animal, while the property of being a human being is not?&quot; Williams states that to respond by arguing that it is because these are properties considered valuable by human beings does not undermine speciesism as humans also consider human beings to be valuable, thus justifying speciesism. Williams then states that the only way to resolve this would be by arguing that these properties are &quot;simply better&quot; but in that case, one would need to justify why these properties are better if not because of human attachment to them. Christopher Grau supported Williams, arguing that if one used properties like rationality, sentience and moral agency as criteria for moral status as an alternative to species-based moral status, then it would need to be shown why these particular properties are to be used instead of others; there must be something that gives them special status. Grau states that to claim these are simply better properties would require the existence of an impartial observer, an &quot;enchanted picture of the universe&quot;, to state them to be so. Thus, Grau states that such properties have no greater justification as criteria for moral status than being a member of a species does. Grau also states that even if such an impartial perspective existed, it still would not necessarily be against speciesism, since it is entirely possible that there could be reasons given by an impartial observer for humans to care about humanity. Grau then further observes that if an impartial observer existed and valued only minimalizing suffering, it would likely be overcome with horror at the suffering of all individuals and would rather have humanity annihilate the planet than allow it to continue. Grau thus concludes that those endorsing the idea of deriving values from an impartial observer do not seem to have seriously considered the conclusions of such an idea.

Douglas Maclean agreed that Singer raised important questions and challenges, particularly with his argument from marginal cases. However, Maclean questioned if different species can be fitted with human morality, observing that animals were generally held exempt from morality; Maclean notes that most people would try to stop a man kidnapping and killing a woman but would regard a hawk capturing and killing a marmot with awe and criticise anyone who tried to intervene. Maclean thus suggests that morality only makes sense under human relations, with the further one gets from it, the less it can be applied.

The British philosopher Roger Scruton regards the emergence of the animal rights and anti-speciesism movement as &quot;the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview&quot;, because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he states, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species. Scruton argues that if animals have rights, then they also have duties, which animals would routinely violate, such as by breaking laws or killing other animals. He accuses anti-speciesism advocates of &quot;pre-scientific&quot; anthropomorphism, attributing traits to animals that are, he says, Beatrix Potter-like, where &quot;only man is vile.&quot; It is, he states, a fantasy, a world of escape.

Thomas Wells states that Singer&#x27;s call for ending animal suffering would justify simply exterminating every animal on the planet in order to prevent the numerous ways in which they suffer, as they could no longer feel any pain. Wells also stated that by focusing on the suffering humans inflict on animals and ignoring suffering animals inflict upon themselves or that inflicted by nature, Singer is creating a hierarchy where some suffering is more important than others, despite claiming to be committed to equality of suffering. Wells also states that the capacity to suffer, Singer&#x27;s criteria for moral status, is one of degree rather than absolute categories; Wells observes that Singer denies moral status to plants on the grounds they cannot subjectively feel anything (even though they react to stimuli), yet Wells alleges there is no indication that nonhuman animals feel pain and suffering the way humans do.

Robert Nozick notes that if species membership is irrelevant, then this would mean that endangered animals have no special claim.

The Rev. John Tuohey, founder of the Providence Center for Health Care Ethics, writes that the logic behind the anti-speciesism critique is flawed, and that, although the animal rights movement in the United States has been influential in slowing animal experimentation, and in some cases halting particular studies, no one has offered a compelling argument for species equality.

==Arguments against==

===Moral community, argument from marginal cases===

Paola Cavalieri writes that the current humanist paradigm is that only human beings are members of the moral community and that all are worthy of equal protection. Species membership, she writes, is &quot;ipso facto&quot; moral membership. The paradigm has an inclusive side (all human beings deserve equal protection) and an exclusive one (only human beings have that status).

Nonhumans do possess some moral status in many societies, but it generally extends only to protection against what Cavalieri calls &quot;wanton cruelty&quot;. Anti-speciesists state that the extension of moral membership to all humanity, regardless of individual properties such as intelligence, while denying it to nonhumans, also regardless of individual properties, is internally inconsistent. According to the argument from marginal cases, if infants, the senile, the comatose, and the cognitively disabled (marginal-case human beings) have a certain moral status, then nonhuman animals must be awarded that status too since there is no morally relevant ability that the marginal-case humans have that nonhumans lack.

American legal scholar Steven M. Wise states that speciesism is a bias as arbitrary as any other. He cites the philosopher R.G. Frey (1941–2012), a leading animal rights critic, who wrote in 1983 that, if forced to choose between abandoning experiments on animals and allowing experiments on &quot;marginal-case&quot; humans, he would choose the latter, &quot;not because I begin a monster and end up choosing the monstrous, but because I cannot think of anything at all compelling that cedes all human life of any quality greater value than animal life of any quality.&quot;

===&quot;Discontinuous mind&quot;===

Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist, wrote against speciesism in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; (1986), &quot;The Great Ape Project&quot; (1993), and &quot;The God Delusion&quot; (2006), elucidating the connection with evolutionary theory. He compares former racist attitudes and assumptions to their present-day speciesist counterparts. In the chapter &quot;The one true tree of life&quot; in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, he states that it is not only zoological taxonomy that is saved from awkward ambiguity by the extinction of intermediate forms but also human ethics and law. Dawkins states that what he calls the &quot;discontinuous mind&quot; is ubiquitous, dividing the world into units that reflect nothing but our use of language, and animals into discontinuous species:

The director of a zoo is entitled to &quot;put down&quot; a chimpanzee that is surplus to requirements, while any suggestion that he might &quot;put down&quot; a redundant keeper or ticket-seller would be greeted with howls of incredulous outrage. The chimpanzee is the property of the zoo. Humans are nowadays not supposed to be anybody&#x27;s property, yet the rationale for discriminating against chimpanzees is seldom spelled out, and I doubt if there is a defensible rationale at all. Such is the breathtaking speciesism of our Christian-inspired attitudes, the abortion of a single human zygote (most of them are destined to be spontaneously aborted anyway) can arouse more moral solicitude and righteous indignation than the vivisection of any number of intelligent adult chimpanzees! ... The only reason we can be comfortable with such a double standard is that the intermediates between humans and chimps are all dead.

Dawkins elaborated in a discussion with Singer at The Center for Inquiry in 2007 when asked whether he continues to eat meat: &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit like the position which many people would have held a couple of hundred years ago over slavery. Where lots of people felt morally uneasy about slavery but went along with it because the whole economy of the South depended upon slavery.&quot;

===Centrality of consciousness===

&quot;Libertarian extension&quot; is the idea that the intrinsic value of nature can be extended beyond sentient beings. This seeks to apply the principle of individual rights not only to all animals but also to objects without a nervous system such as trees, plants, and rocks. Ryder rejects this argument, writing that &quot;value cannot exist in the absence of consciousness or potential consciousness. Thus, rocks and rivers and houses have no interests and no rights of their own. This does not mean, of course, that they are not of value to us, and to many other [beings who experience pain], including those who need them as habitats and who would suffer without them.&quot;

===Comparisons to the Holocaust===

David Sztybel states in his paper, &quot;Can the Treatment of Animals Be Compared to the Holocaust?&quot; (2006), that the racism of the Nazis is comparable to the speciesism inherent in eating meat or using animal by-products, particularly those produced on factory farms. Y. Michael Barilan, an Israeli physician, states that speciesism is not the same thing as Nazi racism, because the latter extolled the abuser and condemned the weaker and the abused. He describes speciesism as the recognition of rights on the basis of group membership, rather than solely on the basis of moral considerations.

==Law and policy==
===Law===

The first major statute addressing animal protection in the United States, titled &quot;An Act for the More Effectual Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&quot;, was enacted in 1867. It provided the right to incriminate and enforce protection with regards to animal cruelty. The act, which has since been revised to suit modern cases state by state, originally addressed such things as animal neglect, abandonment, torture, fighting, transport, impound standards and licensing standards. Although an animal rights movement had already started as early as the late 1800s, some of the laws that would shape the way animals would be treated as industry grew, were enacted around the same time that Richard Ryder was bringing the notion of Speciesism to the conversation. Legislation was being proposed and passed in the U.S. that would reshape animal welfare in industry and science. Bills such as Humane Slaughter Act, which was created to alleviate some of the suffering felt by livestock during slaughter, was passed in 1958. Later the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, passed by the 89th United States Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was designed to put much stricter regulations and supervisions on the handling of animals used in laboratory experimentation and exhibition but has since been amended and expanded. These groundbreaking laws foreshadowed and influenced the shifting attitudes toward nonhuman animals in their rights to humane treatment which Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer would later popularize in the 1970s and 1980s.

===Great ape personhood===

Great ape personhood is the idea that the attributes of non-human great apes are such that their sentience and personhood should be recognized by the law, rather than simply protecting them as a group under animal cruelty legislation. Awarding personhood to nonhuman primates would require that their individual interests be taken into account.

<text>In radio communications, single-sideband modulation (SSB) or single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation (SSB-SC) is a type of modulation used to transmit information, such as an audio signal, by radio waves. A refinement of amplitude modulation, it uses transmitter power and bandwidth more efficiently. Amplitude modulation produces an output signal the bandwidth of which is twice the maximum frequency of the original baseband signal. Single-sideband modulation avoids this bandwidth increase, and the power wasted on a carrier, at the cost of increased device complexity and more difficult tuning at the receiver.

==Basic concept==
Radio transmitters work by mixing a radio frequency (RF) signal of a specific frequency, the carrier wave, with the audio signal to be broadcast. In AM transmitters this mixing usually takes place in the final RF amplifier (high level modulation). It is less common and much less efficient to do the mixing at low power and then amplify it in a linear amplifier. Either method produces a set of frequencies with a strong signal at the carrier frequency and with weaker signals at frequencies extending above and below the carrier frequency by the maximum frequency of the input signal. Thus the resulting signal has a spectrum whose bandwidth is twice the maximum frequency of the original input audio signal.

SSB takes advantage of the fact that the entire original signal is encoded in each of these &quot;sidebands&quot;. Since a good receiver can extract the complete original signal from either the upper or lower sideband, it is not essential to transmit both sidebands plus the carrier. There are several methods for eliminating the carrier and one sideband from the transmitted signal. Producing this single sideband signal can be done at high level in the final amplifier stage as with AM
but it is usually produced at a low power level and linearly amplified. The lower efficiency of linear amplification partially offsets the power advantage gained by eliminating the carrier and one sideband. Nevertheless, SSB transmissions use the available amplifier energy considerably more efficiently, providing longer-range transmission for the same power output. In addition, the occupied spectrum is less than half that of a full carrier AM signal.

SSB reception requires frequency stability and selectivity well beyond that of inexpensive AM receivers which is why broadcasters have seldom used it. In point-to-point communications where expensive receivers are in common use already they can successfully be adjusted to receive whichever sideband is being transmitted.

==History==
The first U.S. patent application for SSB modulation was filed on December 1, 1915, by John Renshaw Carson. The U.S. Navy experimented with SSB over its radio circuits before World War I. SSB first entered commercial service on January 7, 1927, on the longwave transatlantic public radiotelephone circuit between New York and London. The high power SSB transmitters were located at Rocky Point, New York, and Rugby, England. The receivers were in very quiet locations in Houlton, Maine, and Cupar, Scotland.

SSB was also used over long-distance telephone lines, as part of a technique known as frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). FDM was pioneered by telephone companies in the 1930s. With this technology, many simultaneous voice channels could be transmitted on a single physical circuit, for example in L-carrier. With SSB, channels could be spaced (usually) only 4,000 Hz apart, while offering a speech bandwidth of nominally 300 Hz to 3,400 Hz.

Amateur radio operators began serious experimentation with SSB after World War II. The Strategic Air Command established SSB as the radio standard for its aircraft in 1957. It has become a de facto standard for long-distance voice radio transmissions since then.

==Mathematical formulation==
Single-sideband has the mathematical form of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in the special case where one of the baseband waveforms is derived from the other, instead of being independent messages:

where formula_1 is the message (real-valued), formula_2 is its Hilbert transform, and formula_3 is the radio carrier frequency.

To understand this formula, we may express formula_4 as the real part of a complex-valued function, with no loss of information:

:formula_5

where formula_6 represents the imaginary unit.  formula_7 is the analytic representation of formula_8  which means that it comprises only the positive-frequency components of formula_4:

:formula_10

where formula_11 and formula_12 are the respective Fourier transforms of formula_7 and formula_14  Therefore, the frequency-translated function formula_15 contains only one side of formula_16  Since it also has only positive-frequency components, its inverse Fourier transform is the analytic representation of formula_17

:formula_18

and again the real part of this expression causes no loss of information.  With Euler&#x27;s formula to expand  formula_19  we obtain :

:formula_20

Coherent demodulation of formula_21 to recover formula_4 is the same as AM: multiply by formula_23  and lowpass to remove the &quot;double-frequency&quot; components around frequency formula_24. If the demodulating carrier is not in the correct phase (cosine phase here), then the demodulated signal will be some linear combination of formula_4 and formula_26, which is usually acceptable in voice communications (if the demodulation carrier frequency is not quite right, the phase will be drifting cyclically, which again is usually acceptable in voice communications if the frequency error is small enough, and amateur radio operators are sometimes tolerant of even larger frequency errors that cause unnatural-sounding pitch shifting effects).

===Lower sideband===
formula_4 can also be recovered as the real part of the complex-conjugate, formula_28 which represents the negative frequency portion of formula_16 When formula_3 is large enough that formula_31 has no negative frequencies, the product formula_32 is another analytic signal, whose real part is the actual &quot;lower-sideband&quot; transmission:

:formula_33

The sum of the two sideband signals is:

:formula_34

which is the classic model of suppressed-carrier double sideband AM.

==Practical implementations==
===Bandpass filtering===
One method of producing an SSB signal is to remove one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which is the case for a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.

===Hartley modulator===
An alternate method of generation known as a Hartley modulator, named after R. V. L. Hartley, uses phasing to suppress the unwanted sideband. To generate an SSB signal with this method, two versions of the original signal are generated, mutually 90° out of phase for any single frequency within the operating bandwidth. Each one of these signals then modulates carrier waves (of one frequency) that are also 90° out of phase with each other. By either adding or subtracting the resulting signals, a lower or upper sideband signal results. A benefit of this approach is to allow an analytical expression for SSB signals, which can be used to understand effects such as synchronous detection of SSB.

Shifting the baseband signal 90° out of phase cannot be done simply by delaying it, as it contains a large range of frequencies. In analog circuits, a wideband 90-degree phase-difference network is used. The method was popular in the days of vacuum tube radios, but later gained a bad reputation due to poorly adjusted commercial implementations. Modulation using this method is again gaining popularity in the homebrew and DSP fields. This method, utilizing the Hilbert transform to phase shift the baseband audio, can be done at low cost with digital circuitry.

===Weaver modulator===
Another variation, the Weaver modulator, uses only lowpass filters and quadrature mixers, and is a favored method in digital implementations.

In Weaver&#x27;s method, the band of interest is first translated to be centered at zero, conceptually by modulating a complex exponential formula_35 with frequency in the middle of the voiceband, but implemented by a quadrature pair of sine and cosine modulators at that frequency (e.g. 2 kHz). This complex signal or pair of real signals is then lowpass filtered to remove the undesired sideband that is not centered at zero. Then, the single-sideband complex signal centered at zero is upconverted to a real signal, by another pair of quadrature mixers, to the desired center frequency.

===Full, reduced, and suppressed-carrier SSB===

Conventional amplitude-modulated signals can be considered wasteful of power and bandwidth because they contain a carrier signal and two identical sidebands. Therefore, SSB transmitters are generally designed to minimize the amplitude of the carrier signal. When the carrier is removed from the transmitted signal, it is called &quot;suppressed-carrier SSB&quot;.

However, in order for a receiver to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to synchronize with the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.

In other cases, it may be desirable to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal&#x27;s bandwidth. This can be accomplished by transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called &quot;compatible (or full-carrier) SSB&quot; or &quot;amplitude modulation equivalent (AME)&quot;. In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.

A second, and perhaps more correct, definition of &quot;compatible single sideband&quot; (CSSB) refers to a form of amplitude and phase modulation in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. Since phase modulation is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further phase-shifted by 90° with respect to each other. This places the information terms in quadrature with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. Since phase modulation is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log of the value of the carrier level plus the phase-shifted audio/information term. This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6 dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly unmodulated carrier. At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0 dB reference level, and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6 dB. The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the &quot;sideband in use&quot;. At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20 dB at 3 kHz. The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.

A second series of approaches was designed and patented by Leonard R. Kahn. The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed by the use of the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin &quot;phase&quot;-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.

The Kahn CSSB method was also briefly used by Airphone as the modulation method employed for early consumer telephone calls that could be placed from an aircraft to ground. This was quickly supplanted by digital modulation methods to achieve even greater spectral efficiency.

While CSSB is seldom used today in the AM/MW broadcast bands worldwide, some amateur radio operators still experiment with it.

==Demodulation==
The front end of an SSB receiver is similar to that of an AM or FM receiver, consisting of a superheterodyne RF front end that produces a frequency-shifted version of the radio frequency (RF) signal within a standard intermediate frequency (IF) band.

To recover the original signal from the IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a beat frequency oscillator (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning. For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted. 
If the BFO frequency is off, the output signal will be frequency-shifted (up or down), making speech sound strange and &quot;Donald Duck&quot;-like, or unintelligible.

For audio communications, there is a common agreement about the BFO oscillator shift of 1.7 kHz. A voice signal is sensitive to about 50 Hz shift, with up to 100 Hz still bearable. Some receivers use a carrier recovery system, which attempts to automatically lock on to the exact IF frequency. The carrier recovery doesn&#x27;t solve the frequency shift. It gives better S/N ratio on the detector output.

As an example, consider an IF SSB signal centered at frequency formula_36 = 45000 Hz. The baseband frequency it needs to be shifted to is formula_37 = 2000 Hz. The BFO output waveform is formula_38. When the signal is multiplied by (aka &quot;heterodyned with&quot;) the BFO waveform, it shifts the signal to  formula_39, &quot;and&quot; to formula_40, which is known as the &quot;beat frequency&quot; or &quot;image frequency&quot;. The objective is to choose an formula_41 that results in  formula_42 = 2000 Hz. (The unwanted components at formula_43 can be removed by a lowpass filter; for which an output transducer or the human ear may serve).

There are two choices for formula_41: 43000 Hz and 47000 Hz, called &quot;low-side&quot; and &quot;high-side&quot; injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000 Hz will be distributed around 2000 Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a lower sideband, instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000 Hz) should be used.

If formula_45 is off by a small amount, then the beat frequency is not exactly formula_37, which can lead to the speech distortion mentioned earlier.

== SSB as a speech-scrambling technique ==

SSB techniques can also be adapted to frequency-shift and frequency-invert baseband waveforms (voice inversion). This voice scrambling method was made by running the audio of one side band modulated audio sample through its opposite (e.g. running an LSB modulated audio sample through a radio running USB modulation). 
These effects were used, in conjunction with other filtering techniques, during World War II as a simple method for speech encryption. Radiotelephone conversations between the US and Britain were intercepted and &quot;decrypted&quot; by the Germans; they included some early conversations between Franklin D. Roosevelt and Churchill. In fact, the signals could be understood directly by trained operators. Largely to allow secure communications between Roosevelt and Churchill, the SIGSALY system of digital encryption was devised.

Today, such simple inversion-based speech encryption techniques are easily decrypted using simple techniques and are no longer regarded as secure.

==Vestigial sideband (VSB)==

Limitation of single-sideband modulation being used for voice signals and not available for video/TV signals leads to the usage of vestigial sideband. A vestigial sideband (in radio communication) is a sideband that has been only partly cut off or suppressed. Television broadcasts (in analog video formats) use this method if the video is transmitted in AM, due to the large bandwidth used. It may also be used in digital transmission, such as the ATSC standardized 8VSB.

The broadcast or transport channel for TV in countries that use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6 MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.0 MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 0.75 MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. The carrier frequency is 1.25 MHz above the lower edge of the 6 MHz wide channel. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this is done in the IF amplifier.

==Frequencies for LSB and USB in amateur radio voice communication==
When single-sideband is used in amateur radio voice communications, it is common practice that for frequencies below 10 MHz, lower sideband (LSB) is used and for frequencies of 10 MHz and above, upper sideband (USB) is used. For example, on the 40 m band, voice communications often take place around 7.100 MHz using LSB mode. On the 20 m band at 14.200 MHz, USB mode would be used.

An exception to this rule applies to the five discrete amateur channels on the 60-meter band (near 5.3 MHz) where FCC rules specifically require USB.

== Extended single sideband (eSSB) ==
Extended single sideband is any J3E (SSB-SC) mode that exceeds the audio bandwidth of standard or traditional 2.9 kHz SSB J3E modes (ITU 2K90J3E) to support higher-quality sound. 
== Amplitude-companded single-sideband modulation (ACSSB) ==
Amplitude-companded single sideband (ACSSB) is a narrowband modulation method using a single sideband with a pilot tone, allowing an expander in the receiver to restore the amplitude that was severely compressed by the transmitter. It offers improved effective range over standard SSB modulation while simultaneously retaining backwards compatibility with standard SSB radios. ACSSB also offers reduced bandwidth and improved range for a given power level compared with narrow band FM modulation.

== Controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation (CESSB) ==

The generation of standard SSB modulation results in large envelope overshoots well above the average envelope level for a sinusoidal tone (even when the audio signal is peak-limited). The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation or CESSB) achieves about 3.8 dB of peak reduction for speech transmission. This results in an effective average power increase of about 140%.
Although the generation of the CESSB signal can be integrated into the SSB modulator, it is feasible to separate the generation of the CESSB signal (e.g. in form of an external speech preprocessor) from a standard SSB radio. This requires that the standard SSB radio&#x27;s modulator be linear-phase and have a sufficient bandwidth to pass the CESSB signal. If a standard SSB modulator meets these requirements, then the envelope control by the CESSB process is preserved.

<text>The szlachta ( ; Lithuanian: &quot;šlėkta;&quot; English&quot;: Nobility&quot;) were the noble estate of the realm in the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Depending on the definition, they were either a warrior caste or a social class, and they dominated those states by exercising political rights and power. Szlachta as a class differed significantly from the feudal nobility of Western Europe. The estate was officially abolished in 1921 by the March Constitution.

The origins of the &quot;szlachta&quot; are obscure and the subject of several theories. Traditionally, its members owned land (allods), often &quot;folwarks&quot;. The &quot;szlachta&quot; secured substantial and increasing political power and rights throughout its history, beginning with the reign of King Casimir III the Great between 1333 and 1370 in the Kingdom of Poland until the decline and end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. Apart from providing officers for the army, its chief civic obligations included electing the monarch and filling honorary and advisory roles at court that would later evolve into the upper legislative chamber, the Senate. The &quot;szlachta&quot; electorate also took part in the government of the Commonwealth via the lower legislative chamber of the Sejm (bicameral national parliament), composed of representatives elected at local &quot;sejmiks&quot; (local &quot;szlachta&quot; assemblies). Sejmiks performed various governmental functions at local levels, such as appointing officials and overseeing judicial and financial governance, including tax-raising. The &quot;szlachta&quot; assumed various governing positions, including &quot;voivode&quot;, &quot;marshal of voivodeship&quot;, castellan, and &quot;starosta&quot;.

In 1413, following a series of tentative personal unions between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the existing Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobilities formally joined the &quot;szlachta&quot;. As the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) evolved and expanded territorially after the Union of Lublin, its membership grew to include the leaders of Ducal Prussia and Livonia. Over time, membership in the &quot;szlachta&quot; grew to encompass around 8% to 15% of Polish-Lithuanian society, which made the membership an electorate that was several times larger than most noble classes in other countries; by contrast, nobles in Italy and France encompassed 1% during the early modern period.

Despite often enormous differences in wealth and political influence, few distinctions in law existed between the great magnates and lesser &quot;szlachta&quot;. The juridic principle of &quot;szlachta&quot; equality existed because &quot;szlachta&quot; land titles were allodial, not feudal, involving no requirement of feudal service to a liege Lord. Unlike absolute monarchs who eventually took reign in most other European countries, the Polish king was not an autocrat and not the szlachta&#x27;s overlord. The relatively few hereditary noble titles in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, while in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of old dynasties. During the three successive Partitions of Poland between 1772 and 1795, most of the &quot;szlachta&quot; began to lose legal privileges and social status, while &quot;szlachta&quot; elites became part of the nobilities of the three partitioning powers.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
In Polish, a nobleman is called a &quot;&quot;szlachcic&quot; and a noblewoman a &quot;szlachcianka&quot;&quot;.

The Polish term &quot;szlachta&quot; derived from the Old High German word &quot;slahta&quot;. In modern German &quot;Geschlecht&quot; – which originally came from the Proto-Germanic *&quot;slagiz&quot;, &quot;blow&quot;, &quot;strike&quot;, and shares the Anglo-Saxon root for &quot;slaughter&quot;, or the verb &quot;to slug&quot; – means &quot;breeding&quot; or &quot;gender&quot;. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish word for &quot;knight&quot; is &quot;rycerz&quot;, from the German &quot;Ritter&quot;, meaning &quot;rider&quot;. The Polish word for &quot;coat of arms&quot; is &quot;herb&quot; from the German &quot;Erbe&quot; (&quot;heritage&quot;).
17th-century Poles assumed &quot;szlachta&quot; came from the German &quot;schlachten&quot;, &quot;to slaughter&quot; or &quot;to butcher&quot;, and was therefore related to the German word for battle, &quot;Schlacht&quot;. Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, Lech, mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. The szlachta traced their descent from Lech, who allegedly founded the Polish kingdom in about the fifth century.

The Polish term &quot;szlachta&quot; designated the formalized, hereditary aristocracy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which constituted the nation itself, and ruled without competition. In official Latin documents of the old Commonwealth, the hereditary szlachta were referred to as &quot;nobilitas&quot; from the Latin term, and could be compared in legal status to English or British peers of the realm, or to the ancient Roman idea of &quot;cives&quot;, &quot;citizen&quot;. Until the second half of the 19th century, the Polish term &quot;&quot; (which now means &quot;citizen&quot;) could be used as a synonym for szlachta landlords.

Today the word &quot;szlachta&quot; simply translates as &quot;nobility&quot;. In its broadest sense, it can also denote some non-hereditary honorary knighthoods and baronial titles granted by other European monarchs, including the Holy See. Occasionally, 19th-century landowners of commoner descent were referred to as &quot;szlachta&quot; by courtesy or error, when they owned manorial estates, but were not in fact noble by birth. &quot;Szlachta&quot; also denotes the Ruthenian and Lithuanian nobility from before the old Commonwealth.

In the past, a misconception sometimes led to the mistranslation of &quot;szlachta&quot; as &quot;gentry&quot; rather than &quot;nobility&quot;. This mistaken practice began due to the inferior economic status of many &quot;szlachta&quot; members compared to that of the nobility in other European countries (see also Estates of the Realm &quot;regarding wealth and nobility&quot;). The &quot;szlachta&quot; included those rich and powerful enough to be great magnates down to the impoverished with an aristocratic lineage, but with no land, no castle, no money, no village, and no subject peasants. Historian M.Ross wrote in 1835: &quot;At least 60,000 families belong to this class, of which, however, only about 100 are wealthy; all the rest are poor.&quot;

A few exceptionally wealthy and powerful szlachta members constituted the &quot;magnateria&quot; and were known as magnates (magnates of Poland and Lithuania).

=== Composition ===

Adam Zamoyski argues that the szlachta were not exactly the same as the European nobility nor a gentry, as the szlachta fundamentally differed in law, rights, political power, origin, and composition from the feudal nobility of Western Europe. The szlachta did not rank below the king, as the szlachta&#x27;s relationship to the Polish king was not feudal. The szlachta stood as equals before the king. The king was not an autocrat, nor the szlachta&#x27;s overlord, as szlachta land was in allodium, not feudal tenure. Feudal dependence upon a Polish king did not exist for the szlachta and earlier in history some high-ranking szlachta (magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms and constantly sought to undermine Piast authority.

In 1459 Ostroróg presented a memorandum to the Sejm (parliament), submitting palatines, or Voivodes of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, receive the title of prince. Sons of a prince were to receive titles of counts and barons. Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were to receive the title of count. This attempt to introduce the hierarchy of noble titles common for European feudal systems for szlachta was rejected.

The fact the szlachta were equal before the king and deliberately opposed becoming a feudal nobility became a matter of law embedded as a constitutional principle of equality. The republicanism of ancient Rome was the szlachta&#x27;s ideal. Poland was known as the Most Serene Republic of Poland, Serenissima Res Publica Poloniae. The szlachta, not as a feudal nobility or gentry, but as an electorate, and an aristocracy and warrior caste, with no feudal dependence on a king, exercised supreme political power over that republic and elected kings as servants of a republic the szlachta regarded as the embodiment of their rights.

Over time, numerically most &quot;lesser&quot; szlachta became poorer, or were poorer than, their few rich peers with the same political status and status in law, and many &quot;lesser&quot; szlachta were worse off than commoners with land. They were called &quot;szlachta zagrodowa&quot;, that is, &quot;farm nobility&quot;, from &quot;zagroda&quot;, a farm, often little different from a peasant&#x27;s dwelling, sometimes referred to as &quot;drobna szlachta&quot;, &quot;petty nobles&quot; or yet, &quot;szlachta okoliczna&quot;, meaning &quot;local&quot;. Particularly impoverished szlachta families were often forced to become tenants of their wealthier peers. They were described as &quot;szlachta czynszowa&quot;, or &quot;tenant nobles&quot; who paid rent. See &quot;Szlachta categories&quot; for more.

=== Origins ===
==== Poland ====
The origins of the szlachta, while ancient, have always been considered obscure. As a result, its members often referred to it as &quot;odwieczna&quot; (perennial). Two popular historical theories about its origins have been put forward by its members and early historians and chroniclers. The first theory involved a presumed descent from the ancient Iranian tribe known as Sarmatians, who in the 2nd century AD, occupied lands in Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. The second theory involved a presumed szlachta descent from Japheth, one of Noah&#x27;s sons. By contrast, the peasantry were said to be the offspring of another son of Noah, Ham — and hence subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham. The Jews were considered the offspring of Shem. Other fanciful theories included its foundation by Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, or regional leaders who had not mixed their bloodlines with those of &#x27;slaves, prisoners, or aliens&#x27;.

Another theory describes its derivation from a non-Slavic warrior class, forming a distinct element known as the Lechici/Lekhi (&quot;Lechitów&quot;) within the ancient Polonic tribal groupings (Indo-European caste systems). Similar to Nazi racial ideology, which dictated the Polish elite were largely Nordic (the szlachta Boreyko coat of arms heralds a swastika), this hypothesis states this upper class was not of Slavonic extraction and was of a different origin than the Slavonic peasants (&quot;kmiecie&quot;; Latin: &quot;cmethones&quot;) over which they ruled.

In old Poland, there were two nations – szlachta and peasants. The szlachta were differentiated from the rural population. In harshly stratified and elitist Polish society, the szlachta&#x27;s sense of distinction led to practices that in later periods would be characterized as racism. Wacław Potocki, herbu Śreniawa (1621–1696), proclaimed peasants &quot;by nature&quot; are &quot;chained to the land and plow,&quot; that even an educated peasant would always remain a peasant, because &quot;it is impossible to transform a dog into a lynx.&quot; The szlachta were noble in the Aryan (see &quot;Alans&quot;) sense -- &quot;noble&quot; in contrast to the people over whom they ruled after coming into contact with them.

The szlachta traced their descent from Lech/Lekh, who allegedly founded the Polish kingdom in about the fifth century. Lechia was the name of Poland in antiquity, and the szlachta&#x27;s own name for themselves was Lechici/Lekhi. Richard Holt Hutton argued an exact counterpart of szlachta society was the system of tenure of southern India—an aristocracy of equality—settled as conquerors among a separate race. Some elements of the Polish state paralleled the Roman Empire in that full rights of citizenship were limited to the szlachta. According to British historian , the 16th-century szlachta ideal was a Greek polis—a body of citizens, a small merchant class, and a multitude of laborers. The laborers consisted of peasants in serfdom. The szlachta had the exclusive right to enter the clergy until the time of the three partitions of Poland–Lithuania, and the szlachta and clergy believed they were genetically superior to peasants. The szlachta regarded peasants as a lower species. Quoting Bishop of Poznań, Wawrzyniec Goślicki, herbu Grzymała (between 1530 and 1540–1607):
&quot;The kingdome of Polonia doth also consist of the said three sortes, that is, the king, nobility and people. But it is to be noted, that this word people includeth only knights and gentlemen. ... The gentlemen of Polonia doe represent the popular state, for in them consisteth a great part of the government, and they are as a Seminarie from whence Councellors and Kinges are taken.&quot;


===== Military caste and aristocracy =====
The szlachta were a caste, a military caste, as in Hindu society. In the year 1244, Bolesław, Duke of Masovia, identified members of the knights&#x27; clan as members of a &quot;genealogia:&quot;
&quot;I received my good servitors [Raciborz and Albert] from the land of [Great] Poland, and from the clan [&quot;genealogia&quot;] called Jelito, with my well-disposed knowledge [i.e., consent and encouragement] and the cry [&quot;vocitatio&quot;], [that is], the &quot;godło,&quot; [by the name of] &quot;Nagody,&quot; and I established them in the said land of mine, Masovia, [on the military tenure described elsewhere in the charter].&quot;
The documentation regarding Raciborz and Albert&#x27;s tenure is the earliest surviving of the use of the clan name and cry defining the honorable status of Polish knights. The names of knightly &quot;genealogiae&quot; only came to be associated with heraldic devices later in the Middle Ages and in the early modern period. The Polish clan name and cry ritualized the &quot;ius militare,&quot; i.e., the power to command an army; and they had been used sometime before 1244 to define knightly status. .
&quot;In Poland, the Radwanice were noted relatively early (1274) as the descendants of Radwan, a knight [more properly a &quot;rycerz&quot; from the German &quot;ritter&quot;] active a few decades earlier. ...&quot;
Escutcheons and hereditary coats of arms with eminent privileges attached is an honor derived from the ancient Germans. Where Germans did not inhabit, and where German customs were unknown, no such thing existed. The usage of heraldry in Poland was brought in by knights arriving from Silesia, Lusatia, Meissen, and Bohemia. Migrations from here were the most frequent, and the time period was the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. However, unlike other European chivalry, coats of arms were associated with Polish knights&#x27; clans&#x27; (&quot;genealogiae&quot;) names and war cries (&quot;godło&quot;), where heraldic devices came to be held in common by entire clans, fighting in regiments. .

Around the 14th century, there was little difference between knights and the &quot;szlachta&quot; in Poland. Members of the szlachta had the personal obligation to defend the country (&quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot;), thereby becoming within the kingdom a military caste and aristocracy with political power and extensive rights secured. Inclusion in the warrior caste was almost exclusively based on inheritance.

Concerning the early Polish tribes, geography contributed to long-standing traditions. The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the &quot;wiec&quot;, an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.

The tribes were ruled by clans (&quot;ród&quot;) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor, giving the ród/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See &quot;gens&quot;.) The &quot;starosta&quot; (or &quot;starszyna&quot;) had judicial and military power over the ród/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called &quot;grόd&quot; were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The &quot;opole&quot; was the territory occupied by a single tribe. The family unit of a tribe is called the &quot;rodzina&quot;, while a collection of tribes is a &quot;plemię&quot;.

Mieszko I of Poland (c. 935 – 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the Lekhitic tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I&#x27;s successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.

Another group of knights were granted land in allodium, not feudal tenure, by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish warrior belonging to the military caste living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a &quot;rycerz&quot;, very roughly equivalent to the English &quot;knight,&quot; the critical difference being the status of &quot;rycerz&quot; was almost strictly hereditary; the group of all such warriors was known as the &quot;rycerstwo&quot;. Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other group of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta (&quot;szlachta&quot; becomes the proper term for Polish aristocracy beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I&#x27;s and his successors&#x27; elite retinues. This rycerstwo/aristocracy secured more rights granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/aristocratic birth) could serve as officials in state administration.

Select rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early Piasts&#x27; endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called możni (Magnates). They had the same political status and status in law as the rycerstwo from which they all originated and to which they would return were their wealth lost. 

The Period of Division from, A.D., 1138 – A.D., 1314, which included nearly 200 years of fragmentation and which stemmed from Bolesław III&#x27;s division of Poland among his sons, was the genesis of the political structure where the great landowning szlachta (możni/Magnates, both ecclesiastical and lay), whose land was in allodium, not feudal tenure, were economically elevated above the rycerstwo they originated from. The prior political structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the Piast dynasty, this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.

Some możni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence. These możni (Magnates) constantly sought to undermine princely authority. In Gall Anonym&#x27;s chronicle, there is noted the nobility&#x27;s alarm when the Palatine Sieciech &quot;elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born&quot; entrusting them with state offices. 

==== Lithuania ====
In Lithuania Propria and in Samogitia, prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Lithuania by Mindaugas, nobles were called &quot;die beste leuten&quot; in German sources. In Lithuanian, nobles were named &quot;ponai&quot;. The higher nobility were named &quot;kunigai&quot; or &quot;kunigaikščiai&quot; (dukes) — a loanword from Scandinavian &quot;konung&quot;. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of Ruthenia in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared — &quot;bajorai&quot;, from Ruthenian &quot;бояре&quot;. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.

After the Union of Horodło, the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly Polonized, although they did preserve their national consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the Lithuanian language was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from Sarmatian tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century — &quot;šlėkta&quot;, a direct loanword from Polish &quot;szlachta&quot;. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.

The process of Polonization took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected. Major effects on the lesser Lithuanian nobility occurred after various sanctions were imposed by the Russian Empire, such as removing &quot;Lithuania&quot; from the names of the &quot;Gubernyas&quot; shortly after the November Uprising. After the January Uprising the sanctions went further, and Russian officials began to intensify Russification, and banned the printing of books in Lithuanian.

==== Ruthenia ====

After the principalities of Halych and Volhynia became integrated with the Grand Duchy, Ruthenia&#x27;s nobility gradually rendered loyalty to the multilingual and cultural melting pot that was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.

The rights of Orthodox nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the Union of Brest. See, for example, the careers of Senator Adam Kisiel and Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki.

==Origins of szlachta surnames==

The Proto-Slavic suffix &quot;-ьskъ&quot; means &quot;characteristic of&quot;, &quot;typical of&quot;.
This suffix exists in Polish as &quot;-ski&quot; (feminine: &quot;-ska&quot;). It&#x27;s attached to surnames derived from a person&#x27;s occupation, characteristics, patronymic surnames, or toponymic surnames (from a person&#x27;s place of residence, birth or family origin).
 In antiquity, the szlachta used topographic surnames to identify themselves. The expression &quot;z&quot; (meaning &quot;from&quot; sometimes &quot;at&quot;) plus the name of one&#x27;s patrimony or estate (dominion) carried the same prestige as &quot;de&quot; in French names such as &quot;de Châtellerault&quot;, and &quot;von&quot; or &quot;zu&quot; in German names such as &quot;von Weizsäcker&quot; or &quot;zu Rhein&quot;. For example, the family name of counts Litwiccy (Litwicki) was formed with the patronymic suffix -ic from the ethnic name Litwa, i.e. Lithuania, &#x27;nation of Lithuanians&#x27;. It refers to the early modern empire of Central Europe, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1648). In Polish &quot;z Dąbrówki&quot; and &quot;Dąbrowski&quot; mean the same thing: &quot;of, from Dąbrówka.&quot; More precisely, &quot;z Dąbrówki&quot; means owning the patrimony or estate Dąbrówka, not necessarily originating from. Almost all the surnames of genuine Polish szlachta can be traced back to a patrimony or locality, despite time scattering most families far from their original home. John of Zamość called himself John Zamoyski, Stephen of Potok called himself Potocki.

At least since the 17th century the surnames/cognomens of szlachta families became fixed and were inherited by following generations, remaining in that form until today. Prior to that time, a member of the family would simply use his Christian name (e.g., Jakub, Jan, Mikołaj, etc.), and the name of the coat of arms common to all members of his clan. A member of the family would be identified as, for example, &quot;Jakub z Dąbrówki&quot;, herbu Radwan, (Jacob to/at Dąbrówki of the knights&#x27; clan Radwan coat of arms), or &quot;Jakub z Dąbrówki, Żądło (cognomen) (later a przydomek/nickname/agnomen), herbu Radwan&quot; (Jacob to/at [owning] Dąbrówki with the distinguishing name Żądło of the knights&#x27; clan Radwan coat of arms), or &quot;Jakub Żądło, herbu Radwan&quot;.

The Polish state paralleled the Roman Empire in that full rights of citizenship were limited to the szlachta. The szlachta in Poland, where Latin was written and spoken far and wide, used the Roman naming convention of the tria nomina (praenomen, nomen, and cognomen) to distinguish Polish citizens/szlachta from the peasantry and foreigners, hence why multiple surnames are associated with many Polish coat of arms.

Example – Jakub: Radwan Żądło-Dąbrowski (sometimes Jakub: Radwan Dąbrowski-Żądło)

Praenomen

Jakub

Nomen (nomen gentile—name of the gens/ród or knights&#x27; clan):

Radwan

Cognomen (name of the family branch/sept within the Radwan gens):

For example—Braniecki, Dąbrowski, Czcikowski, Dostojewski, Górski, Nicki, Zebrzydowski, etc.

Agnomen (nickname, Polish ):

Żądło (prior to the 17th century, was a cognomen)

Bartosz Paprocki gives an example of the Rościszewski family taking different surnames from the names of various patrimonies or estates they owned. The branch of the Rościszewski family that settled in Chrapunia became the Chrapunski family, the branch of the Rościszewski family that settled in Strykwina became the Strykwinski family, and the branch of the Rościszewski family that settled in Borkow became known as the Borkowski family. Each family shared a common ancestor and belonged to the same knights&#x27; clan, so they bore the same coat of arms as the Rościszewski family.

Each knights&#x27; clan/gens/ród had its coat of arms, and there were only a limited number. Almost without exception, there were no family coat of arms. Each coat of arms bore a name, the clan&#x27;s call word. In most instances, the coat of arms belonged to many families within the clan. The Polish state paralleled the Roman Empire, and the szlachta had a different origin and structure in law than Western Europe&#x27;s feudal nobility. The clan/gens/ród system survived the whole of Polish history.

=== Heraldry ===

Coats of arms were very important to the szlachta. Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in Central Europe, while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in Moravia, e.g. Poraj coat of arms and in Germany, e.g. Junosza coat of arms.

Families who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.

At the Union of Horodło, forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.

==== Heritability ====
The tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a lozenge granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their distaff side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on to the next generation. The brisure was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.

Illegitimate children could adopt the mother&#x27;s surname and title by the consent of the mother&#x27;s father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father&#x27;s family, thereby acquiring the father&#x27;s surname, though not the title or arms.

== Ennoblement ==

=== Kingdom of Poland ===
The number of lawfully granted ennoblements (naturalization) after the 15th century was minimal.

In the Kingdom of Poland and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ennoblement (&quot;nobilitacja&quot;) may be equated with an individual given legal status as a &quot;szlachcic&quot; member of the Polish nobility. Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the sejm. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated coat of arms of that clan.

According to heraldic sources, the total number of lawful ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at 800. This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 – 0.000,001 of the historical population. Compare: historical demography of Poland. Charles-Joseph, 7th Prince of Ligne, when trying to obtain Polish noble status, supposedly said in 1784, &quot;It is easier to become a duke in Germany, than to be counted among Polish nobles.&quot;

The close of the late 18th century (see below) was a period in which a definite increase in the number of ennoblements can be noted. This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: Partitions of Poland, King Stanisław August Poniatowski).

==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====

According to heraldic sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all lawful ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).

Types of ennoblement:
* Adopcja herbowa – The &quot;old way&quot; of ennoblement, popular in the 14th century, connected with adoption into an existing szlachta clan by an act of the king. The king granted a fragment of his own coat of arms establishing an alliance with the king&#x27;s family, or a knight performed an adoption under their coat of arms, which required the confirmation of the king. This form of ennoblement was abolished in the 17th century.
* Skartabellat – Introduced by pacta conventa of the 17th century (since 1669), this was ennoblement into a sort of &quot;conditional&quot; or &quot;graduated nobility&quot; status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would &quot;mature&quot; to full szlachta status. In 1775 another requirement was imposed – they had to acquire a landed estate.
* Indygenat – from the Latin expression, &quot;indigenatus&quot;, recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and Sejm, after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.
* &quot;secret ennoblement&quot; – This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.

=== Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===
In the late 14th century, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great reformed the Grand Duchy&#x27;s army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors—&quot;bajorai&quot; (&quot;nobles&quot;; see the cognate &quot;boyar&quot;). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their military service to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men (veldams). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their family names, the Lithuanian pagan given names of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others. These families were granted their coats of arms under the Union of Horodlo (1413).

In 1506, King Sigismund I the Old confirmed the position of the Lithuanian Council of Lords in state politics and limited entry into the nobility.

== Privileges ==
Specific rights of the szlachta included:

# The right to hold outright ownership of land (Allod)—not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold. The szlachta had a monopoly on land. Peasants did not own land. See &quot;Polish landed gentry (Ziemiaństwo)&quot;.
# The right to join in political and military assemblies of the regional nobility.
# The right to form independent administrative councils for their locality.
# The right to cast a vote for Polish Kings.
# The right to travel freely anywhere in the old Commonwealth of the Polish and Lithuanian nobility; or outside it, as foreign policy dictated.
# The right to demand information from Crown offices.
# The right to spiritual semi-independence from the clergy.
# The right to interdict, in suitable ways, the passage of foreigners and townsmen through their territories.
# The right of priority over the courts of the peasantry.
# Special rights in Polish courts, including freedom from arbitrary arrest and freedom from corporal punishment.
# The right to sell their military or administrative services.
# Heraldic rights.
# The right to receive higher pay when entitled in the &quot;Levée en masse&quot; (mobilization of the szlachta for defence of the nation).
# Educational rights
# The right of importing duty-free goods often.
# The exclusive right to enter the clergy until the time of the three partitions of Poland.
# The right to try their peasants for major offences (reduced to minor offences only, after the 1760s).
Significant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta, as defined by Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax, a 1425 guarantee against the &#x27;arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property&#x27; of its members, a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial Sejms, and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners.

=== Real and false nobles ===
Nobles were born into a noble family, or adopted into a noble clan by an act of the King (this was abolished in 1633). The rarest way of achieving szlachta status was through ennoblement (naturalization) by a king or Sejm for reasons such as bravery in combat, service to the state, etc. There were claims some nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status. In the first half of the 16th century, hundreds of such &quot;false nobles&quot; were denounced by (1550–1630) in his &quot;Liber generationis plebeanorum (Liber chamorum)&quot;, or &quot;Book of Plebeian Genealogy (Ham&#x27;s Book)&quot;. Peasants were considered descendants of Ham, the son of Noah subject to bondage under the Curse of Ham. The law forbade commoners holding landed estates and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller&#x27;s life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king&#x27;s secretary. Many sejms issued decrees over the centuries in an attempt to resolve this issue, but with little success. It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the &#x27;lower orders&#x27; of society, but there are historians who claim nobles of such base origins formed a &#x27;significant&#x27; element of the szlachta.

Self-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from Baron, Marchese, Freiherr to Comte, all readily translatable into the Polish &quot;Hrabia&quot;. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the Ciechanowiecki family, who managed to restore a genuinely old Comital title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.

=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===
The szlachta secured many rights not secured to the nobility of other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the &#x27;nobility&#x27;s Commonwealth&#x27; because Royal elections in Poland were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling dynasty. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the Piasts, then the Jagiellons. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose &quot;the Polish king&quot; from among the dynasties&#x27; matrilinial descendants.

Poland&#x27;s successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne – the privileges having been specified in the king-elect&#x27;s Pacta conventa – and at other times, in exchange for &quot;ad hoc&quot; leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot;, a military call up. Poland&#x27;s nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.

In 1355 in Buda King Casimir III the Great issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, Louis I of Hungary. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.

==== Privilege of Koszyce and others ====
In 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (&quot;przywilej koszycki&quot;) to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, Jadwiga. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (&quot;łanowy&quot;) a limit of 2 groszes per &quot;łan&quot; of land, Old Polish units of measurement. In addition, the King&#x27;s right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, district offices were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.

In 1422 King Władysław II Jagiełło was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwińsk (&quot;przywilej czerwiński&quot;), which established the inviolability of nobles&#x27; property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over fiscal policy to the Royal Council, later, the Senate of Poland, including the right to mint coinage.

In 1430, with the Privileges of Jedlnia, confirmed at Kraków in 1433, Polish: &quot;przywileje jedlneńsko-krakowskie&quot;, based partially on his earlier Brześć Kujawski privilege (25 April 1425), King Władysław II Jagiełło granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English Magna Carta&#x27;s habeas corpus, known from its own Latin name as &quot;neminem captivabimus nisi jure victum&quot;. Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a warrant from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King Władysław&#x27;s &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for the easement was the nobles&#x27; guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On 2 May 1447 the same king issued the &quot;Wilno Pact, or Wilno Privilege&quot;, which gave the Lithuanian boyars the same rights as those already secured by the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot;.

In 1454, King Casimir IV granted the Nieszawa Statutes – Polish: &quot;statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie&quot;, clarifying the legal basis of voivodship sejmiks – local parliaments. The king could promulgate new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot;, only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, voivods and castellans. These privileges were demanded by the &quot;szlachta&quot; in exchange for their participation in the Thirteen Years&#x27; War.

==== First Royal Election ====
The first &quot;free election&quot; (Polish: &quot;wolna elekcja&quot;) of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put Casimir II on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only senators voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by John I Albert. For the duration of the Jagiellonian Dynasty, only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.

In 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at Piotrków. It comprised two chambers:
* a Senate of 81 bishops and other dignitaries
* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.
The numbers of senators and deputies later increased.

On 26 April 1496 King John I Albert granted the Privilege of Piotrków. The Statutes of Piotrków increased the nobility&#x27;s feudal power over serfs. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk &quot;mieszczaństwo&quot; were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the Church hierarchy were restricted to nobles.

On 23 October 1501, the Polish–Lithuanian union was reformed by the Union of Mielnik. It was there that the tradition of a coronation Sejm was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only – not in rank – attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them impeachable before the Senate for malfeasance. However, the Act of Mielnik of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated Senate of Poland than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives — &quot;non praestanda oboedientia&quot;, and to form confederations, armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.
On 3 May 1505 King Alexander I Jagiellon granted the Act of &quot;Nihil novi nisi commune consensu&quot; – &quot;I accept nothing new except by common consent&quot;. This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility&#x27;s powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the First Rzeczpospolita, the period of a &quot;szlachta&quot;-run &quot;Commonwealth&quot;.

In 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king&#x27;s permission. At about that time the &quot;Executionist Movement&quot;, seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrków they forced the Magnates to return many leased crown lands to the king, and the king to create a standing army wojsko kwarciane. One of the most famous members of this movement was Jan Zamoyski.

==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====

Until the death of Sigismund II Augustus, the last king of the Jagiellonian dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a Polish–Lithuanian monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;, the king&#x27;s &quot;pre-election pact&quot;, and the &quot;Henrican articles&quot;, named after the first freely elected king, Henry of Valois. The latter document was a virtual &quot;Polish constitution&quot; and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:
* Free election of kings
* Religious tolerance
* The Sejm to meet every two years
* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm
* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm
* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles
* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only
* Nobles&#x27; right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.

In 1578 king, Stefan Batory, created the Crown Tribunal to reduce the enormous pressure on the Royal Court. This placed much of the monarch&#x27;s juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Tribunal.

===Magnate oligarchy===
For many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. In 1459 Ostroróg presented a memorandum to the Sejm (parliament), submitting palatines, or Voivodes of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, receive the title of prince. Sons of the prince were to receive titles of counts and barons. Castellans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were to receive the title of count. All these submissions were rejected.

Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, &quot;karmazyni&quot;, the &quot;Crimsons&quot; – from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high office in the Commonwealth.. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200–300 persons could be classed as Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30–40 were considered as having significant impact on Poland&#x27;s politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary leases, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the &quot;ruch egzekucji praw&quot; — movement for the enforcement of the law – against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.

One of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create &quot;Ordynacjas&quot;, similar to Fee tails under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The &quot;Ordynacjas&quot; that belonged to families such as the Radziwiłł, Zamoyski, Potocki or Lubomirskis often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.

The difference between the &quot;magnateria&quot; and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.

=== Szlachta loss of influence ===
 The notion of the szlachta&#x27;s accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final Partitions of Poland, and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia or the Habsburg monarchy.

In the 1840s Nicholas I reduced 64,000 of lesser szlachta to a particular commoner status known as &quot;odnodvortsy&quot; (literally &quot;single-householders&quot;). Despite this, 62.8% of all Russia&#x27;s nobles were Polish szlachta in 1858 and still 46.1% in 1897.
Serfdom was abolished in Russian Poland on 19 February 1864. It was deliberately enacted with the aim of ruining the szlachta. Only in the Russian Partition did peasants pay the market price for land redemption, the average for the rest of the Russian Empire was 34% above the market rates. All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with Romania, Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished. All this was to punish the szlachta&#x27;s role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.
By 1864 80% of szlachta were &quot;déclassé&quot; – downward social mobility. One quarter of petty nobles were worse off than the average serf. While 48.9% of the land in Russian Poland was in peasant hands, nobles still held onto 46%.

In the Second Polish Republic the privileges of the nobility were legally abolished by the March Constitution in 1921 and as such not reinstated by any succeeding Polish law.
== Cultural and international connections ==
Despite preoccupations with warring, politics and status, the szlachta in Poland, as did people from all social classes, played its part in contributing in fields ranging from literature, art and architecture, philosophy, education, agriculture and the many branches of science, to technology and industry. Perhaps foremost among the cultural determinants of the nobility in Poland were its continuing international connections with the Rome-based Catholic Church. It was from the ranks of the szlachta that were drawn the church&#x27;s leading Prelates until the 20th century. Other international influences came through the more or less secretive and powerful Christian and lay organisations such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, focused on hospital and other charitable activity. The most notable Polish Maltese Knight was the Pozńan commander, Bartłomiej Nowodworski, founder in 1588 of the oldest school in Poland. One alumnus was John III Sobieski.
In the 18th century, after several false starts, international Freemasonry, &quot;wolnomularstwo&quot;, from western lodges, became established among the higher échelons of the szlachta, and in spite of membership of some clergy, it was intermittently but strongly opposed by the Catholic Church. After the partitions it became a cover for opposition to the occupying powers. Also in the 18th century there was a marked development in Patronage of the arts during the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, himself a freemason, and with the growth of social awareness, in Philanthropy.

=== Women as purveyors of culture ===
High-born women in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth exerted political and cultural influence throughout history in their own country and abroad, as queens, princesses and the wives or widows of magnates. Their cultural activities came into sharper relief in the 18th century with their hosting of salons in the French manner. They went on to publish as translators and writers and as facilitators of educational and social projects.

Notable women members of the szlachta who exerted political and/or cultural influence include:
* Queen Jadwiga (1373 ог 1374–1399)
* Bona Sforza (1494-1557), second wife of Sigismund I the Old
* Zofia Lubomirska
* Anna Jabłonowska
* Elzbieta Lubomirska
* Eleonora Czartoryska
* Izabela Czartoryska
* Barbara Sanguszko (1718–1791), poet, translator and moralist
* Tekla Teresa Lubienska (1767–1810), poet, playwright and translator

=== Gastronomy ===
The szlachta, no less than the rest of the population, placed a particular accent on food. It was at the centre of courtly and estate entertaining and in good times, at the heart of village life. During the Age of Enlightenment, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski emulated the French Salons by holding his famed Thursday Lunches for intellectuals and artists, drawn chiefly from the szlachta. His &quot;Wednesday Lunches&quot; were gatherings for policy makers in science, education and politics.

There was a tradition, particularly in Mazovia, kept until the 20th century, of estate owners laying on a festive banquet at the completion of harvest for their staff, known as &quot;Dożynki&quot;, as a way of expressing an acknowledgment of their work. It was equivalent to a harvest festival. Polish food varied according to region, as elsewhere in Europe, and was influenced by settlers, especially Jewish cuisine, and occupying armies.

=== Hunting ===

One of the favourite szlachta pastimes was hunting (&quot;łowiectwo&quot;). Before the formation of Poland as a state, hunting was accessible to everyone. With the introduction of rulers and rules, big game, generically &quot;zwierzyna&quot;: Aurochs, bison, deer and boar became the preserve of kings and princes on penalty of poachers&#x27; death. From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, &quot;Łowczy&quot;. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were &#x27;fair game&#x27; to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles. Over the centuries, at least two breeds of specialist hounds were bred in Poland. One was the Polish Hunting Dog, the &quot;brach&quot;. The other was the Ogar Polski. Count Xavier Branicki was so nostalgic about Polish hunting, that when he settled in France in the mid 19th century, and restored his estate at the Chateau de Montresor, he ordered a brace of Ogar Polski hounds from the Polish breeder and &quot;szlachcic&quot;, Piotr Orda.

== Demographics and stratification ==
The szlachta differed in many respects from the nobility in other countries. The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for absolute monarchy, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the political system to evolve into an oligarchy.

Szlachta members were also proportionately more numerous than their equivalents in all other European countries, constituting 6–12% of the entire population. By contrast, nobles in other European countries, except for Spain, amounted to a mere 1–3%. Most of the szlachta were &quot;minor nobles&quot; or smallholders. In Lithuania the minor nobility made up to 3/4 of the total szlachta population. By the mid-16th century the szlachta class consisted of at least 500,000 persons (some 25,000 families). Polish historian Tadeusz Korzon carried out an estimation of the social structure of Poland based on the documents of 1770–1780s, such as tax registers, partial censuses, etc. His estimate for the number of &quot;szlachta&quot; was 725,000 of total population 8.8 million. For comparison with other social classes, Christian clergy counted 50,000, Christian &quot;mieszczaństwo&quot; (burghers) counted 500,000, peasants of various categories (&quot;&quot;): 6.4 million, Jews (the fast growing group), e.g., 750,000 in 1764 and 900,000 in 1790. Korzon counted Armenians, Tatars, Greeks, and Russian &quot;raskolniks&quot; as separate social groups, totaling 250,000-300,000.

The proportion of nobles in the population varied across regions. In the 16th century, the highest proportion of nobles lived in the Płock Voivodeship (24,6%) and in Podlachia (26,7%), while Galicia had numerically the largest szlachta population. In districts, such as Wizna and Łomża, the szlachta constituted nearly half of the population. Regions with the lowest percentage of nobles were the Kraków Voivodeship with (1,7%), Royal Prussia with (3%) and the Sieradz Voivodeship with 4,6%. Before the Union of Lublin, inequality among nobles in terms of wealth and power was far greater in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania than in the Polish Kingdom. The further south and east one went, the more the territory was dominated by magnate families and other nobles. In the Lithuanian and Ruthenian palatinates, poor nobles were more likely to rent smallholdings from magnates than to own land themselves.

It has been said that the ruling elites were the only socio-political milieu to whom a sense of national consciousness could be attributed. All szlachta members, irrespective of their cultural/ethnic background, were regarded as belonging to a single &quot;political nation&quot; within the Commonwealth. Arguably, a common culture, the Catholic religion and the Polish language were seen as the main unifying factors in the dual state. Prior to the Partitions there was said to have been no Polish national identity as such. Only szlachta members, irrespective of their ethnicity or culture of origin, were considered as &quot;Poles&quot;.

Despite Polonisation in Lithuania and Ruthenia in the 17th-18th centuries, a large part of the lower szlachta managed to retain their cultural identity in various ways. Due to poverty most of the local szlachta had never had access to formal education nor to Polish language teaching and hence could not be expected to self-identify as &quot;Poles&quot;. It was common even for wealthy and in practice Polonised szlachta members still to refer to themselves as Lithuanian, &quot;Litwin&quot; or Ruthenian, &quot;Rusyn&quot;.

According to Polish estimates from the 1930s, 300,000 members of the common nobles &quot;s&quot; &quot;zlachta zagrodowa&quot; – inhabited the subcarpathian region of the Second Polish Republic out of 800,000 in the whole country. 90% of them were Ukrainian-speaking and 80% were Ukrainian Greek Catholics. In other parts of Ukraine with a significant szlachta population, such as the Bar or the Ovruch regions, the situation was similar despite Russification and earlier Polonization. As an example:


However the era of sovereign rule by the szlachta ended earlier than in other countries, excluding France, in 1795 (see Partitions of Poland). Since then their legitimacy and fate depended on the legislation and policies of the Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg monarchy. Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the March Constitution of Poland in 1921.

There were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility. The szlachta was not rigidly exclusive or closed as a class, but according to heraldic sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th and mid-18th century, is estimated at 800. This is an average of about two ennoblements per year.

According to two English journalists Richard Holt Hutton and Walter Bagehot writing on the subject in 1864,

and

Sociologist and historian, Jerzy Ryszard Szacki said in this context,
Others assert the szlachta were not a social class, but a caste, among them, historian Adam Zamoyski,
Jerzy Szacki continues,

Low-born individuals, including townsfolk &quot;mieszczanie&quot;, peasants &quot;chłopi&quot;, but not Jews &quot;Żydzi&quot;, could and did rise to official ennoblement in Commonwealth society, although Charles-Joseph, 7th Prince of Ligne, while trying to obtain Polish noble status, is supposed to have said in 1784,


According to heraldic sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward, half of which were enacted in the final years of the late 18th century. Hutton and Bagehot,

Each &quot;szlachcic&quot; was said to hold enormous potential influence over the country&#x27;s politics, far greater than that enjoyed by the citizens of modern democratic countries. Between 1652 and 1791, any nobleman could potentially nullify all the proceedings of a given &quot;sejm&quot; or &quot;sejmik&quot; by exercising his individual right of &quot;liberum veto&quot; – Latin for &quot;I do not allow&quot; – except in the case of a confederated sejm or confederated sejmik.

In old Poland, a nobleman could only marry a noblewoman, as intermarriage between &quot;castes&quot; was fraught with difficulties (); but, children of a legitimate marriage followed the condition of the father, never the mother, therefore, only the father transmitted his nobility to his children. See &quot;patrilineality&quot;. A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (&quot;&quot;) for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the &quot;Indygenat&quot;, certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a general sejm. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.

In theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct Lessees of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers &quot;de iure&quot;. The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwiłł, Lubomirski and Czartoryski, who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Count&quot;. See also The Princely Houses of Poland. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as &quot;Brother, Sir&quot; &quot;Panie bracie&quot; or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be &quot;Illustrious and Magnificent Lord&quot;, &quot;Magnificent Lord&quot;, &quot;Generous Lord&quot; or &quot;Noble Lord&quot; in descending order, or simply &quot;His/Her Grace Lord/Lady&quot;.

The notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish adage:
renderable in English:

or, preserving the Polish original&#x27;s rhyme scheme:


=== Szlachta categories ===
The nobility were divided by wealth into:
* magnates, the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants
* middle nobility (&quot;średnia szlachta&quot;): owners of one or more villages, often bearing official titles, or deputies from &quot;sejmiks&quot; (regional sejms) to the general &quot;Sejm&quot;

* petty nobility (&quot;drobna szlachta&quot;): owners of part of a village or of no land at all, they were often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms, including:
** &quot;&quot; – from &quot;zaścianek&quot;, poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, &quot;neighborhood/village nobility&quot;.
** &quot;szaraczkowa&quot; – &quot;grey nobility&quot;, from their grey, woollen, undyed żupans
** &quot;okoliczna&quot; – &quot;local nobility&quot;, similar to &quot;zaściankowa&quot;
** &quot;zagrodowa&quot; – from &quot;zagroda&quot;, a croft, often little more than a peasant&#x27;s dwelling
** &quot;zagonowa&quot; – from &quot;zagon&quot;, a small unit of land measure, &quot;hide nobility&quot;
** &quot;cząstkowa&quot; – &quot;partial&quot;, owners of only part of a single village
** &quot;panek&quot; – little &quot;pan&quot; (i.e., lordling), term used in Kaszuby, the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland
** &quot;hreczkosiej&quot; – &quot;buckwheat sowers&quot; – those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.
** szlachta służebna – petty nobility who possessed land on the condition of military service (mainly of Ruthenian origin, in Eastern Poland)
** quit-rent szlachta (&quot;szlachta czynszowa&quot;) – a class of impoverished szlachta who rented estates in the vast lands of magnates (predominantly in Ruthenian lands) 
** szlachta poddańcza – a step below the quit-rent szlachta: they required to work for the landlord who allotted them some land.
** &quot;szlachta-gołota&quot; – &quot;naked nobility&quot;, i.e., the landless szlachta; the poorest szlachta considered the &quot;lowest of the high.&quot;
** &quot;brukowa&quot; – town-street nobility: landless &quot;szlachta&quot; who earned a living in towns like other townsfolk

Polish landed gentry – &quot;ziemianie&quot;, or &quot;ziemiaństwo&quot; – was a social class of landowners with manorial estates. The vast majority were &quot;szlachta&quot;, including lesser nobility, and owned at least part of a village. Since titular manorial lordships were also open to burgers of certain privileged cities with royal charters, not all landed gentry had hereditary noble status. The term &quot;ziemiaństwo&quot; was also applied to wealthier landed peasants. Magnates, as owners of vast lands, generally were considered a separate social class.

Landless &quot;szlachta&quot; were sometimes excluded from taking part in &quot;sejmiks&quot;. Its political rights were removed altogether by the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The purpose of the move was to eliminate the purchases of &quot;szlachta-gołota&quot; voices in sejmiks by magnates to use them, e.g., in voting or in executing &quot;liberum veto&quot;.

&quot;Półpanek&quot; (&quot;half-lord&quot;); also podpanek/pidpanek (&quot;sub-lord&quot;) in Podolia and Ukrainian accent – a derogatory term for a petty &quot;szlachcic&quot; pretending to be wealthy.

In the Russian Partition of Poland, Tsar Nicholas I signed a ukase on 19 October 1831, titled &quot;On the Division and Disposition of Nobility in the Western Governorates&quot;, which required those claiming noble status to provide evidence to the Russian Office of Heraldry. The result was a drastic decrease in the number of petty &quot;szlachta&quot;, who were demoted into estates of the realm required to pay taxes.

== Sarmatism ==
The &quot;szlachta&quot;″s prevalent ideology, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of &quot;Sarmatism&quot;, a word derived from the legend that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the Sarmatians. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness became an important part of &quot;szlachta&quot; culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the &quot;żupan&quot;, &quot;kontusz&quot;, &quot;sukmana&quot;, &quot;pas kontuszowy&quot;, &quot;delia&quot; and made the scimitar-like &quot;szabla&quot; a near-obligatory item of everyday &quot;szlachta&quot; apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of national unity and pride in the szlachta&#x27;s &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; &quot;złota wolność&quot;. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the &quot;szlachta&quot; of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish Dog Latin peppered with &quot;macaronisms&quot; in everyday conversation.

== Explanatory notes ==
&quot;a.&quot; Estimates of the proportion of szlachta vary widely: 10–12% of the total population of historic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, around 8% of the total population in 1791 (up from 6.6% in the 16th century) or 6–8%.

<doc id="29054" wikidata="Q734781" url="?curid=29054" title="Syntactic sugar">
<text>In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language &quot;sweeter&quot; for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer. Syntactic sugar is usually a shorthand for a common operation that could also be expressed in an alternate, more verbose, form: The programmer has a choice of whether to use the shorter form or the longer form, but will usually use the shorter form since it is shorter and easier to type and read.

For example, many programming languages provide special syntax for referencing and updating array elements. Abstractly, an array reference is a procedure of two arguments: an array and a subscript vector, which could be expressed as codice_1. Instead, many languages provide syntax such as codice_2. Similarly an array element update is a procedure consisting of three arguments, for example codice_3, but many languages also provide syntax such as codice_4.

A construct in a language is syntactic sugar if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do: functionality and expressive power will remain the same.

Language processors, including compilers and static analyzers, often expand sugared constructs into their more verbose equivalents before processing, a process sometimes called &quot;desugaring&quot;.

== Origins ==
The term &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; was coined by Peter J. Landin in 1964 to describe the surface syntax of a simple ALGOL-like programming language which was defined semantically in terms of the applicative expressions of lambda calculus, centered on lexically replacing λ with &quot;where&quot;.

Later programming languages, such as CLU, ML and Scheme, extended the term to refer to syntax within a language which could be defined in terms of a language core of essential constructs; the convenient, higher-level features could be &quot;desugared&quot; and decomposed into that subset. This is, in fact, the usual mathematical practice of building up from primitives.

Building on Landin&#x27;s distinction between essential language constructs and syntactic sugar, in 1991, Matthias Felleisen proposed a codification of &quot;expressive power&quot; to align with &quot;widely held beliefs&quot; in the literature. He defined &quot;more expressive&quot; to mean that without the language constructs in question, a program would have to be completely reorganized.

== Notable examples ==
* In COBOL, many of the intermediate keywords are syntactic sugar that may optionally be omitted. For example, the sentence codice_5 and the sentence codice_6 perform exactly the same function, but the second makes the action to be performed clearer.
* Augmented assignment or compound assignment operators: For example, codice_7 is equivalent to codice_8 in C and similar languages, assuming codice_9 has no side effects such as if codice_9 is a regular variable. Some languages, such as Python may allow overloading augmented assignment operators, so they may behave differently than standard ones.
* In Perl, codice_11 is syntactic sugar for codice_12. Additionally, any statement can be followed by a condition, so codice_13 is equivalent to codice_14, but the former is more naturally formatted on a single line.
* In the C language, the codice_15 notation is syntactic sugar for codice_16. Likewise, the codice_17 notation is syntactic sugar for accessing members using the dereference operator codice_18.
* The codice_19 statement in C# ensures that certain objects are disposed of correctly. The compiler expands the statement into a try-finally block.
* The C# language allows variables to be declared as codice_20, which allows the compiler to infer the type of codice_21 from the expression codice_22, instead of requiring an explicit type declaration. Similarly, C++ allows codice_23 since C++11 and Java allows codice_20 since Java 11.
* Python list comprehensions (such as codice_25 for a list of squares) and decorators (such as codice_26).
* In Haskell, a string, denoted in quotation marks, is semantically equivalent to a list of characters. An optional language extension &quot;OverloadedStrings&quot; allows string literals to produce other types of values, such as Text, as well.
* In the tidyverse collection of R packages, the &quot;pipe&quot;, denoted by codice_27, declares that the data (or output of the function) preceding the pipe will serve as the first argument for the function following the pipe. So, codice_28 is equivalent to codice_29.
* In SQL, a mere codice_30 is equivalent to an codice_31, the latter clarifying that the join statement is specifically an inner join operation as opposed to an outer join operation. Likewise, one may omit the codice_32 from the codice_33, codice_34 and codice_35.
*Extension method in OOP languages in the form of codice_36 is syntactic sugar for calling a global function as codice_37. The reference to the object is passed as a hidden argument, usually accessible from within the method as codice_38.
*A parameter called by reference is syntactic sugar for technically passing a &quot;pointer&quot; as the parameter, but syntactically handling it as the variable itself, to avoid constant pointer de-referencing in the code inside the function.
* In Java, an codice_39 declaration enables the compiler to find classes that are not otherwise specified with fully qualified names. For example codice_40 allows the programmer to reference a Swing object such as codice_41 using the shorter name codice_42.
* In the ES6 version of JavaScript, arrow functions have a short form codice_43, which is equivalent to the longer form codice_44.
* In Scala, triple questions marks (codice_45) is equivalent to codice_46. This is useful to mark a place for code that has not yet been written.
* In JavaScript, if the key and value are the same in an object, you can only write it once. For example, codice_47 is equivalent to codice_48. This is called the Shorthand Property.

== Criticism ==
Some programmers feel that these syntax usability features are either unimportant or outright frivolous. Notably, special syntactic forms make a language less uniform and its specification more complex, and may cause problems as programs become large and complex. This view is particularly widespread in the Lisp community, as Lisp has very simple and regular syntax, and the surface syntax can easily be modified.
For example, Alan Perlis once quipped in &quot;Epigrams on Programming&quot;, in a reference to bracket-delimited languages, that &quot;Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons&quot;.

== Derivative terms ==

=== Syntactic salt ===
The metaphor has been extended by coining the term &quot;syntactic salt&quot;, which indicates a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code. Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop that programmers must jump through just to prove that they know what is going on, rather than to express a program action.

In C#, when hiding an inherited class member, a compiler warning is issued unless the codice_49 keyword is used to specify that the hiding is intentional. To avoid potential bugs owing to the similarity of the switch statement syntax with that of C or C++, C# requires a codice_50 for each non-empty codice_51 label of a codice_52 (unless codice_53, codice_54, or codice_55 is used) even though it does not allow implicit &quot;fall-through&quot;. (Using codice_56 and specifying the subsequent label produces a C/C++-like &quot;fall-through&quot;.)

Syntactic salt may defeat its purpose by making the code unreadable and thus worsen its quality – in extreme cases, the essential part of the code may be shorter than the overhead introduced to satisfy language requirements.

An alternative to syntactic salt is generating compiler warnings when there is high probability that the code is a result of a mistake – a practice common in modern C/C++ compilers.

=== Syntactic saccharin ===
Other extensions are &quot;syntactic saccharin&quot; and &quot;syntactic syrup&quot;, meaning gratuitous syntax that does not make programming any easier.

=== Sugared types ===
Data types with core syntactic support are said to be &quot;sugared types&quot;. Common examples include quote-delimited strings, curly braces for object and record types, and square brackets for arrays.

<doc id="29056" wikidata="Q191626" url="?curid=29056" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">
<text>is a character created by the Japanese game developers Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima. He is the star of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; franchise and the mascot of the Japanese video game company Sega. Sonic is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speed. He races through levels, collecting rings and avoiding obstacles, as he seeks to defeat his archenemy, Doctor Eggman. He is accompanied by supporting characters, such as his best friend and sidekick Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, romantic interest Amy Rose, and friendly rival Knuckles the Echidna.

Sonic made a cameo appearance in the arcade game &quot;Rad Mobile&quot; (1990) before starring in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, a platform game for the Sega Genesis, in 1991. Sega sought a mascot to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s Mario, and Ohshima designed Sonic based on a prototype programmed by Naka. Sonic&#x27;s design was influenced by a variety of sources, including Felix the Cat, Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson, and Santa Claus; his pigmentation was chosen to match Sega&#x27;s cobalt blue logo. Yuji Uekawa redesigned Sonic for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998) to suit the franchise&#x27;s transition to 3D computer graphics, with a more mature look designed to appeal to older players.

&quot;Sonic&quot; media characterizes Sonic as an impatient, snarky drifter and daredevil who despises injustice. He frequently battles Eggman, a mad scientist who seeks to steal the mystical Chaos Emeralds and take over the world. Sonic can curl into a ball to attack enemies and use the Chaos Emeralds to become invulnerable. He has appeared in over 100 video games, in addition to guest appearances in other Sega franchises and in crossover games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Jun&#x27;ichi Kanemaru voices Sonic in Japan, while his English voice has been provided by Ryan Drummond, Jason Griffith, and Roger Craig Smith.

Sonic is one of the most famous video game characters in history and an established pop culture icon. He is widely considered one of the greatest video game characters and his popularity inspired a wave of imitators. His likeness has been featured in merchandise and Sega sponsorships. The &quot;Sonic&quot; series is one of the bestselling video game franchises and was one of the key reasons for Sega&#x27;s success during the 16-bit era in the 1990s. Sonic has been adapted in comics, animations, and films, including a live-action film franchise distributed by Paramount Pictures in which he is voiced by Ben Schwartz.

==History==

While Sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s Mario series, several character designs were submitted by its research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo, a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later be the basis of Doctor Eggman&#x27;s design), and a rabbit (who would use its extendable ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in &quot;Ristar&quot;). Naoto Ohshima took some of these internal designs with him on a trip to New York City and sought feedback by asking random passersby at Central Park their opinions; of the designs, the spiky teal hedgehog, initially codenamed , led this informal poll, followed by Eggman and the dog character. Ohshima felt that people selected it because it &quot;transcends race and gender and things like that&quot;. On return to Japan, Ohshima pitched this to the department, and the hedgehog was ultimately selected as the new mascot.

The detailed design of Sonic was aimed to be something that could be easily drawn by children and be familiar, as well as exhibit a &quot;cool&quot; attitude, representative of the United States at the time. Sonic&#x27;s blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega&#x27;s cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by both Santa Claus and Michael Jackson&#x27;s boots with the addition of the color red, which was inspired by the contrast of those colors on Jackson&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bad&quot;; his personality was based on then-Governor of Arkansas and later President of the United States Bill Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Get it done&quot; attitude. To help sell the idea to Sega&#x27;s higher-ups, Ohshima pitched the concept framed by a fictional fighter pilot that had earned the name &quot;Hedgehog&quot; due to his spiky hair, and had decorated his plane with images of Sonic. When this pilot retired, he married a children&#x27;s book author, who wrote stories about the Sonic character, the first which became the plot for the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game; Ohshima stated that this influence can be seen in the logo of the game, which features Sonic in a pilot&#x27;s wing emblem.

The origins of &quot;Sonic&quot; can be traced farther back to a draft created by Naoto Ōshima in 1989, which years later turned into Sonic. Yuji Naka implemented the idea of a character running inside loops with an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. This concept was subsequently fleshed out by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara.

Sonic was created without the ability to swim because of a mistaken assumption by Yuji Naka that all hedgehogs could not do so. A group of fifteen people started working on the first &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game, and renamed themselves Sonic Team. The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Masato Nakamura of the band Dreams Come True. Sega sponsored the group&#x27;s &quot;Wonder 3&quot; tour, painting Sonic on the tour bus, distributing pamphlets advertising the game, and having footage of the game broadcast above stage prior to its release. The original concepts gave Sonic fangs and put him in a band with a human girlfriend named Madonna. However, a team from Sega of America, led by Madeline Schroeder, who calls herself &quot;Sonic&#x27;s mother&quot;, &quot;softened&quot; the character up for an American audience by removing those elements. This sparked a heated issue with Sonic Team. Naka later admitted that it was probably for the best.

Sonic&#x27;s appearance varies greatly depending on the medium and the style in which he is drawn. In the video games, Sonic&#x27;s original design by Ohshima was short and round, with short quills, a round body, and no visible irises. Artwork featuring this design and drawn by Akira Watanabe was displayed on the package artwork for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Sonic&#x27;s proportions would change for the release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; on the Mega Drive; Sonic&#x27;s head to height ratio was changed from 1:2 to 1:2.5. For the 1998 release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, Sonic was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa as a character with longer legs and a less spherical body, longer and more drooping quills, and green-colored irises. For the 2006 game, Sonic was redesigned to make him look adult-like and taller to appeal to the next generation players. This was also done because Sonic would interact with humans more often and his design was supposed to fit. An alternative &quot;Werehog&quot; form was introduced in &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, placing more emphasis on Sonic&#x27;s melee skills rather than speed. Although Tetsu Katano acknowledged the large negative fan response to the Werehog, he believes it could return in a future game.

Bob Raffei, CEO of &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; developer Big Red Button, stated that &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; Sonic is &quot;very different... both in tone and art direction.&quot; That version has blue-furred arms, more quills, and wears a brown neckerchief around his neck and athletic sports tape on his wrists and shoes.

===Voice portrayal===

Sonic originally had a few voice samples in &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, with designer Masato Nishimura providing the voice. Sonic&#x27;s first true voice actor was Takeshi Kusao for the arcade game &quot;SegaSonic the Hedgehog&quot;, with Junichi Kanemaru continually voicing the role beginning with the release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. Kanemaru also voices Sonic in &quot;Sonic X&quot;, &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, and the Japanese dub of the &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; films. In &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;, Sonic was voiced by Tomokazu Seki while in Werehog form. Jaleel White voiced the character in the DiC animated series &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic SatAM&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;. Sam Vincent provided his singing voice in the latter DiC cartoon.

Starting with &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, Sonic was voiced in English by Ryan Drummond. Drummond was replaced by Jason Griffith starting from &quot;Sonic X&quot;, with Griffith voicing Sonic within the games starting with &quot;Shadow The Hedgehog&quot; in 2005. Griffith was replaced by Roger Craig Smith, starting with &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot; and &quot;Sonic Colors&quot;. Smith announced on his Twitter account on January 29, 2021, that he would no longer voice Sonic, with his departure confirmed by Sega the same day. On May 26, 2021, Smith and Sega confirmed that he was voicing Sonic once again. Ben Schwartz voiced Sonic in the 2020 feature film and its 2022 and 2024 sequels. Canadian actor Deven Mack voices Sonic in the &quot;Sonic Prime&quot; animated series.
==Appearances==
===Video games===

Sonic&#x27;s first shown appearance in a video game was in the 1990 arcade racing game &quot;Rad Mobile&quot;, as a decorative ornament hanging from a rearview mirror. This was followed by an unlicensed appearance in &quot;The Adventures of Quik &amp; Silva&quot; as a villain. Sonic&#x27;s first playable appearance was in the platform game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, which also introduced his nemesis Dr. Robotnik. His two-tailed fox friend Tails joined him in the game&#x27;s 1992 sequel, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;. When all the Chaos Emeralds have been collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic by collecting 50 rings. Super Sonic is nearly invincible, runs faster, and jumps farther, but loses one ring per second and reverts to normal when his rings are depleted. &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, released in 1993, introduced Sonic&#x27;s self-appointed girlfriend Amy Rose and recurring robotic doppelgänger Metal Sonic as Sonic traveled through time to ensure a good future for the world. &quot;Sonic 3&quot; and its direct sequel &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;, both released in 1994, saw Sonic and Tails battle Robotnik again, with the additional threat of Knuckles, who is tricked by Robotnik into thinking Sonic is a threat. &quot;Sonic 4&quot; (2010–2012) continues where the story of &quot;Sonic 3&quot; left off, reducing Sonic to the only playable character and releasing in episodic installments. The second episode sees the return of both Tails as Sonic&#x27;s sidekick and Metal Sonic as a recurring enemy.

Other two-dimensional platformers starring Sonic include &quot;Sonic Chaos&quot; (1993), &quot;Sonic Triple Trouble&quot; (1994), &quot;Sonic Blast&quot; (1996), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure&quot; (1999), &quot;Sonic Advance&quot; (2001), &quot;Sonic Advance 2&quot; (2002), &quot;Sonic Advance 3&quot; (2004), &quot;Sonic Rush&quot; (2005), &quot;Sonic Rush Adventure&quot; (2007), &quot;Sonic Colors&quot; (2010), and &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; (2011), all in which were released for handheld consoles.

&quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998) was Sonic Team&#x27;s return to the character for a major game. It featured Sonic returning from vacation to find the city of Station Square under attack by a new foe named Chaos, under the control of Dr. Robotnik (now known as Dr. Eggman). It was also the first Sonic game to feature a complete voice-over. &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; (2001) placed Sonic on-the-run from the military (G.U.N.) after being mistaken for Shadow the Hedgehog. &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003) featured Sonic teaming up with Tails and Knuckles, along with other character teams like Team Rose and Chaotix, against the newly rebuilt Metal Sonic, who had betrayed his master with intentions of world domination. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006) features Sonic in the city of water, &quot;Soleanna&quot;, where he must rescue Princess Elise from Dr. Eggman while trying to avoid a new threat to his own life, Silver the Hedgehog. He is the only playable character in &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot; (2008), in which he unwillingly gains a new personality, &quot;Sonic the Werehog&quot;, the result of Sonic being fused with Dark Gaia&#x27;s power. He gains strength and flexibility in exchange for his speed, and new friends including a strange creature named Chip who helps him along the way. In &quot;Sonic Colors&quot; (2010), Eggman tries to harness the energy of alien beings known as &quot;Wisps&quot; for a mind-control beam. &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; (2011) features two playable incarnations of Sonic: the younger &quot;classic&quot; Sonic, whose gameplay is presented in a style reminiscent of the Mega Drive/Genesis games, and present-day &quot;modern&quot; Sonic, who uses the gameplay style present in &quot;Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Colors&quot;, going through stages from past games to save their friends. &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; features various theme songs including modern and retro versions that are able to be selected from throughout Sonic&#x27;s twenty-year history. In April 2013, Sega announced that &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; would launch in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.

&quot;Sonic and the Secret Rings&quot; (2007) features Sonic in the storybook world of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight&quot; (2009), continued the storybook theme, this time taking place within the realm of the Arthurian legend.

Sonic has also been featured in other games of many genres other than 2D and 3D platform games. These include &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot;, &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; (1995), the racing games &quot;Sonic Drift&quot; (1994), &quot;Sonic Drift 2&quot; (1995), &quot;Sonic R&quot; (1996), &quot;Sonic Riders&quot; (2006), &quot;Sonic Rivals&quot; (2006), &quot;Sonic Rivals 2&quot; (2007), &quot;Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity&quot; (2008), and &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot; (2010), the fighting games &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sonic Battle&quot; (2003), the mobile game &quot;Sonic Jump&quot; (2005), and the role-playing video game &quot;Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood&quot; (2008). Critics and fans have occasionally questioned why Sonic uses vehicles in several of the racing games, given his latent speed; however, it has been explained by Sega and in some official &quot;Sonic&quot; media that he does so in order to compete fairly with others in races.

Video games such as &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; (1993), &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; (1995), &quot;Tails&#x27; Skypatrol&quot; (1995), &quot;Tails Adventure&quot; (1995), and &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; (2005) starred supporting characters of the &quot;Sonic&quot; series, although Sonic himself cameos in most of them.

====Cameos and crossovers====
Sonic makes cameos in various other games, such as &quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg&quot; as a power-up, in the main hallway in &quot;Phantasy Star Universe&quot;, and in the 2008 remake of &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;. He is also a playable character in &quot;Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams&quot;. Nintendo, Sega&#x27;s former rival, references Sonic in &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot;, by showing Sonic&#x27;s shoes next to a trash can that reads &quot;No Hopers&quot; on the Cranky&#x27;s Video Game Heroes screen.

Sonic has appeared in several crossover games, including playable appearances in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008), &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; (2014), and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018), &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; (2015), and &quot;Cookie Run: Kingdom&quot; (2021). He appears in the crossover party game series &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot; and is also a playable character in all three &quot;Sega Superstars&quot; games. An official Sonic the Hedgehog skin is available in the platformer battle royale game &quot;Fall Guys&quot;. Sonic appears as a playable character in &quot;Puyo Puyo Tetris 2&quot; via free update. An official Sonic the Hedgehog world with skins are available with DLC in &quot;Minecraft&quot;. He is also appears as an unlockable playable character in &quot;Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD&quot;, &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&quot; and &quot;Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&quot;.

===Animation===
The first three animated series featuring Sonic were created by the international company DiC. The first of these series, &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, premiered in 1993, and depicts Sonic and his friend Tails opposing Doctor Ivo Robotnik and his robots on the planet Mobius. Another animated series premiering the same year, simply titled &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, depicts Sonic and a group of rebels aiming to defeat Robotnik in a futuristic version of Mobius. The third animated series, &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;, premiered in 1999, and features Sonic as the protagonist alongside his siblings Sonia and Manic.

In 1996, a two-part OVA, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; was released in Japan. For the American release, the two episodes combined and released as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie&quot; by ADV Films. A new series, &quot;Sonic X,&quot; began airing in 2003. The 78-episode anime series detailed Sonic&#x27;s struggle to protect the Chaos Emeralds from Eggman and new villains. Featuring a cross-world and interstellar journey, &quot;Sonic X&quot; depicted Sonic and his human friend Chris Thorndyke in quests to save the world. &quot;Sonic: Night of the Werehog&quot; is a short film produced by Sega&#x27;s VE Animation Studio, released to coincide with the release of &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;. In the film, Sonic and Chip enter a haunted house, and must deal with two ghosts trying to scare them in attempt to win the heart of the girl ghost. Sonic also makes multiple cameo appearances in the Disney films, &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; (2012) and its sequel &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018).

In October 2013, Sega announced a CGI animated series, &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;. The show ran for 104 11-minute episodes between 2014 and 2017 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and the UK, and Canal J and Gulli in France. Sonic makes several appearances in 2014 anime &quot;Hi-sCoool! SeHa Girls&quot; and guest-stars in the &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Meet Sonic&quot;.

In February 2021, &quot;Sonic Prime&quot; was announced by Netflix with a 2022 release window, though the series&#x27; development was initially revealed in a deleted tweet in December 2020. The show is primarily for children ages six to eleven, as well as longtime fans of the franchise. In October 2022, Netflix set its release for December. In the series, after recklessly breaking the Paradox Prism which breaks the entire universe and creates several alterative dimensions and versions of his friends, Sonic desperately seeks to restore them and embarks on a mission to find the shards of the Prism and fix it.

===Live-action films===
On June 10, 2014, a film based on the &quot;Sonic&quot; series was announced. Simply known as &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, it was produced by Neal Moritz on his Original Film banner alongside Takeshi Ito and Mie Onishi, with Toby Ascher as executive producer. The film was written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller and produced as a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Marza Animation Planet. The film is a live-action and CGI hybrid. The movie was filmed in 2018, with a release date initially set for November 8, 2019. Upon the release of the film&#x27;s first trailer in late April 2019, however, Sonic&#x27;s appearance was heavily criticized, leading to the director, Jeff Fowler, to announce a redesign of him, pushing back the release date to February 14, 2020. The second trailer for the film was released on November 12, 2019, featuring the redesign, which drew in a far more positive response from both fans and critics alike. In the first film, it centers on Sonic, born with supersonic speed powers and abilities, who befriends the sheriff named Tom Wachowski, to stop the villainous Dr. Robotnik who plots to have Sonic&#x27;s speed powers for world domination. Particular issues with his design included his teeth and legs. According to Paramount marketing president Marc Weinstock, the negative reaction to the original design resulted in a change to how video game adaptations are handled at the company. A sequel, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, was released on April 8, 2022, and it centers on Sonic and Tails on a race to prevent Robotnik and Knuckles from getting the hands on the Master Emerald.

The original design of Sonic from the first movie&#x27;s initial trailer appears in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, voiced by Tim Robinson. Named &quot;Ugly Sonic&quot;, he is portrayed as a washed up actor looking to make a comeback after he was kicked off the film.

Sonic briefly appears as a player&#x27;s avatar in the 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;.

===Print media===

Sonic&#x27;s first comic appearance was in a promotional comic printed in &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine (and also given away as a free pull-out with a copy of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; magazine), which established a backstory for the character involving the origin of his color and abilities and the transformation of kindly scientist Dr. Ovi Kintobor into the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik. Numerous British publications, including &quot;Sega handbook&quot; &quot;Stay Sonic&quot; (1993), four novels published by Virgin Books (1993–1994) and the comic book &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot; (1993–2001), published by Fleetway Publications/Egmont Publishing, used this premise as their basis.

The American comics published by Archie Comics, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1993–2017), &quot;Sonic X&quot; (2005–2008), and &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; (2009–2017) are based on the settings established by earlier animated TV series, the ABC &quot;SatAM&quot; cartoon, the &quot;Sonic X&quot; anime, and an expansion to the series, respectively. The former series is currently the second longest-running licensed comic series in the history of American comic books, second only to Marvel&#x27;s Conan series (first issue released in 1970).
In France two comic books named &quot;Sonic Adventures&quot; were published by Sirène in 1994. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognized Sonic comic as the longest-running comic based on a game. Archie Comics also released a twelve part crossover with Mega Man beginning in 2013. The Archie comics were later succeeded by a new comic series by IDW Publishing in 2018, which is currently ongoing.

Sonic has also been featured in two different manga. One series was simply called &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and featured a story about a normal hedgehog boy named Nicky who can change into Sonic. The other series was a compilation of short stories and was separated into two volumes, the first being called &quot;Dash and Spin&quot;, and the other called &quot;Super Fast Sonic!!&quot;.

==Characteristics==
According to various official materials from Sega, Sonic is described as a character who is &quot;like the wind&quot;: a drifter who lives as he wants, and makes life a series of events and adventures. Sonic hates oppression and staunchly defends freedom. Although he is mostly quick-witted and easygoing, he has a short temper and is often impatient with slower things. Sonic is a habitual daredevil hedgehog who is honest, loyal to friends, keeps his promises, and dislikes tears. He took the young Tails under his wing like a little brother, and is uninterested in marital proposals from Amy Rose. In times of crisis, he focuses intensely on the challenge, as if his personality had undergone an astonishing change.

Sonic&#x27;s greatest strength is his running speed, being known in the game&#x27;s universe as the world&#x27;s fastest hedgehog. Many of his abilities are variations on the tendency for hedgehogs to roll into tight balls for protection with the addition of spinning his body. Since his introduction in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Sonic&#x27;s primary offensive maneuver is the basic &quot;Spin Attack&quot; (or &quot;Sonic Spin Attack&quot;). Later games in the series expanded on this basic attack and two of these enhancements have become mainstays of his: the Spin Dash which was introduced in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and involves Sonic spinning on the spot before blasting off at full speed, and the Homing Attack, officially introduced in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, in which Sonic dashes toward a target in midair. Sonic&#x27;s only weakness is that he cannot swim, sinking like a rock if plunged to a deep body of water. The reason for this is because Yuji Naka had a misunderstanding about hedgehogs not being able to swim. The only exception is that he can swim in the Sonic the Hedgehog Adventure Gamebooks. When the seven Chaos Emeralds are collected and used, Sonic transforms into , a faster, stronger and invulnerable version of himself that can fly. In Super Sonic form, Sonic&#x27;s irises turn red and his body becomes golden.

==Reception and legacy==

As Sega&#x27;s mascot and one of the key reasons for the company&#x27;s success during the 16-bit era of video game consoles, Sonic is one of the most famous video game characters in the world. In 1993, Sonic became the first video game character to have a balloon in Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 1996, Sonic was also the first video game character to be seen in a Rose Parade. Sonic was one of the three game characters inducted on the inaugural Walk of Game class in 2005, along with former rivals Mario and Link (both from Nintendo). One of a class of genes involved in fruit fly embryonic development, called hedgehog genes, has been named &quot;sonic hedgehog&quot; after him.

On the other hand, Sonic&#x27;s apparent romantic relationship with Princess Elise in the 2006 video game resulted in major criticism. Sonic&#x27;s characterization and relationship with Eggman in &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; earned a positive response by Patrick Lee of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media.

Sonic has also been used as a symbol for Sega&#x27;s various sponsorships. Between 1993 and 1997, Sega sponsored the JEF United Ichihara Chiba football team, during which period Sonic appeared in the team&#x27;s uniform. During the 1993 Formula One championship, Sega sponsored the Williams Grand Prix team, which won the Constructors&#x27; Championship that year, as well as the team&#x27;s lead driver, Alain Prost, winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Sonic was featured in the cars, helmets, and their rivals McLaren used to paint a squashed hedgehog after winning races over Williams. The 1993 European Grand Prix featured a Sonic balloon and Sonic billboards. In 1992, according to Sega of America marketing director Al Nilsen, Sonic was found to be more recognizable than Mickey Mouse in the six-to eleven-year-old demographic, based on the character&#x27;s respective Q Scores, although this claim could not be confirmed by Q Score developer Marketing Evaluations, Inc.

Nintendo Power listed Sonic as their sixth favorite hero, stating that while he was originally Mario&#x27;s nemesis, he seems at home on Nintendo platforms. They added that he has remained as one of gaming&#x27;s greatest icons. In 2004, the character won a Golden Joystick Award for &quot;The Sun Ultimate Gaming Hero&quot;. The character&#x27;s popularity declined in the mid-1990s, and Sonic failed to place in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Coolest Mascot of 1996 in either the editors&#x27; or readers&#x27; picks, being beaten out by not only competitors Mario and Crash Bandicoot, but Sega&#x27;s own Nights; however, in a 2008 poll of 500 people, Sonic was voted the most popular video game character in the UK with a 24% vote while his old rival Mario came second with 21% of the vote. Later that year, Sonic was ranked as the most iconic video game character in an MSN rankings list. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked him as the 14th greatest video game character. And he was voted 10th out of the top 50 video game characters of all time in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; 2011 Gamers&#x27; Edition. Sonic ranked ninth on GameDaily&#x27;s Top 10 Smash Bros characters list. GameDaily also listed his &quot;next-generation stumble&quot; in their list of video game characters&#x27; worst moments, using his relationship with a human female as one of the worst parts of it. In 2024, a poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Sonic the Hedgehog as the fourth most iconic video-game character of all time, only behind Lara Croft, Mario and Agent 47.

Ken Balough, Sega&#x27;s former associate brand manager, said that Sonic&#x27;s appeal endured because the character is &quot;a gaming legend, first and foremost&quot; who originated &quot;from a series of games that defined a generation in gaming history, and his iconic personality was the epitome of speed in the early &#x27;90s, pushing the limits of what gamers knew and expected from high-speed action and platforming games.&quot;

A Japanese team developing the Radio &amp; Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI) instrumentation for the &quot;Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer&quot; spacecraft, launched by ESA and Airbus in 2022, was able to gain Sega&#x27;s approval to use Sonic as the mascot for the device. Specifically, Sonic appears on the logo of the RPWI in his classic design, the rendition being a redraw of how Sonic appears on the Japanese and PAL box art for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.
An Internet meme called &quot;Sanic&quot; has been used based on a poorly drawn Sonic; typically, the meme uses one of Sonic&#x27;s catchphrases but with poor grammar. Sega&#x27;s official Sonic Twitter account has made numerous references to it, and it appeared in official downloadable content for &quot;Sonic Forces&quot; on in-game shirts. The meme also appears as a drawing in the theatrical film.
