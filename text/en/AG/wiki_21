<text>State terrorism is terrorism that a state conducts against another state or against its own citizens.

Governments accused of state terrorism may justify these actions as efforts to combat internal dissent, suppress insurgencies, or maintain national security, often framing their actions within the context of counterterrorism or counterinsurgency. Accused actions of state terrorism are normally also criticised as severe violations of human rights and international law, but contrast with state-sponsored terrorism in that the state is carrying out the actions rather than sponsoring violent non-state actors who do so.

Historically, governments have been accused of using state terrorism in various settings. The exact definition and scope of state terrorism remain controversial, as some scholars and governments argue that terrorism is a tool used exclusively by non-state actors, while others maintain that state-directed violence intended to terrorize civilian populations should also be classified as terrorism.

==Definition==

There is neither an academic nor an international legal consensus regarding the proper definition of the word &quot;terrorism&quot;. Some scholars believe the actions of governments can be labelled &quot;terrorism&quot;. Using the term &#x27;terrorism&#x27; to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including &quot;shock and awe&quot; tactics:

However, others, including governments, international organisations, private institutions and scholars, believe the term &quot;terrorism&quot; is applicable only to the actions of violent non-state actors. This approach is termed as an &quot;actor-centric&quot; definition which emphasizes the characteristics of the groups or individuals who use terrorism; whilst act-centric definitions emphasize the unique aspects of terrorism from other acts of violence. Historically, the term terrorism was used to refer to actions taken by governments against their own citizens whereas now it is more often perceived as targeting of non-combatants as part of a strategy directed &quot;against&quot; governments.

Historian Henry Commager wrote that &quot;Even when definitions of terrorism allow for &#x27;state terrorism&#x27;, state actions in this area tend to be seen through the prism of war or national self-defense, not terror.&quot; While states may accuse other states of state-sponsored terrorism when they support insurgencies, individuals who accuse their governments of terrorism are seen as radicals, because actions by legitimate governments are not generally seen as illegitimate. Academic writing tends to follow the definitions accepted by states. Most states use the term &quot;terrorism&quot; for non-state actors only.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Online&quot; defines terrorism generally as &quot;the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective&quot;, and states that &quot;terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions&quot;. The encyclopedia adds that &quot;[e]stablishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments—or more often by factions within governments—against that government&#x27;s citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups.&quot;

While the most common modern usage of the word &quot;terrorism&quot; refers to political violence by insurgents or conspirators, several scholars make a broader interpretation of the nature of terrorism that encompasses the concepts of state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism. Michael Stohl argues, &quot;The use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.&quot; Stohl clarifies, however, that &quot;[n]ot all acts of state violence are terrorism. It is important to understand that in terrorism the violence threatened or perpetrated, has purposes broader than simple physical harm to a victim. The audience of the act or threat of violence is more important than the immediate victim.&quot;

Scholar Gus Martin describes state terrorism as terrorism &quot;committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats&quot;, which can be directed against both domestic and foreign targets. Noam Chomsky defines state terrorism as &quot;terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies&quot;.

Simon Taylor provides a definition of state terrorism as &quot;state agents using threats or acts of violence against civilians, marked by a callous indifference to human life, to instill fear in a community beyond the initial victim for the purpose of preventing a change or challenge to the status quo.&quot; These acts of violence can include both the types of state violence that some argue ought to be considered terrorism, such as: genocide, mass murders, ethnic cleansing, disappearances, detention without trial, and torture; and more widely accepted methods of terror including bombings and targeted killings.

Stohl and George A. Lopez have designated three categories of state terrorism, based on the openness or secrecy with which the acts are performed, and whether states directly perform the acts, support them, or acquiesce to them.

==History==

Aristotle wrote critically of terror employed by tyrants against their subjects. The earliest use of the word &quot;terrorism&quot; identified by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is a 1795 reference to tyrannical state behavior, the &quot;reign of terrorism&quot; in France. In that same year, Edmund Burke decried the &quot;thousands of those hell-hounds called terrorists&quot; who he believed threatened Europe. During the Reign of Terror, the Jacobin government and other factions of the French Revolution used the apparatus of the state to kill and intimidate political opponents, and the Oxford English Dictionary includes as one definition of terrorism &quot;Government by intimidation carried out by the party in power in France between 1789–1794&quot;. The original general meaning of terrorism was of terrorism by the state, as reflected in the 1798 supplement of the Dictionnaire of the , which described terrorism as , . Myra Williamson wrote:

Later examples of state terrorism include the police state measures employed by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s, and by Germany&#x27;s Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s. According to Igor Primoratz, &quot;Both [the Nazis and the Soviets] sought to impose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could be pursued only by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character—to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In both countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of, political police took to persecuting &#x27;potential&#x27; and &#x27;objective opponents&#x27;. In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random.&quot;

Military actions primarily directed against non-combatant targets have also been referred to as state terrorism. For example, the bombing of Guernica has been called an act of terrorism. Other examples of state terrorism may include the World War II bombings of Pearl Harbor, London, Dresden, Chongqing, and Hiroshima.

An act of sabotage, sometimes regarded as an act of terrorism, was the peacetime sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship owned by Greenpeace, which occurred while in port at Auckland, New Zealand on July 10, 1985. The bomb detonation killed Fernando Pereira, a Dutch photographer. The organisation who committed the attack, the Directorate-General for External Security (DSGE), is a branch of France&#x27;s intelligence services. The agents responsible pleaded guilty to manslaughter as part of a plea deal and were sentenced to ten years in prison, but were secretly released early to France under an agreement between the two countries&#x27; governments.

During the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland from the 1960s to the 1990s, the Military Reaction Force (MRF), a counterinsurgency unit of the British Intelligence Corps, was tasked with tracking down members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). During the period when it was active, the MRF was involved in the killings of Catholic civilians in Northern Ireland.

In November 2013, a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. Soldier H said: &quot;We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF.&quot; Soldier F added: &quot;We wanted to cause confusion.&quot; In June 1972, he was succeeded as commander by Captain James &#x27;Hamish&#x27; McGregor.

In June 2014, in the wake of the Panorama programme, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) opened an investigation into the matter. In an earlier review of the programme, the position of the PSNI was that none of the statements by soldiers in the programme could be taken as an admission of criminality.

==By country==
===Argentina===
The Dirty War is the name used for the period of state terrorism in Argentina between 1974 and 1983.

===Belarus===
===Brazil===
===Chile===
Chile during Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s rule was accused of state terror against political opponents.

===China===
The Uyghur American Association has claimed that Beijing&#x27;s approach to terrorism in Xinjiang constitutes state terrorism. In 2006, a Spanish court opened an investigation into claims that the Chinese state was committing acts of state terrorism in Tibet. However, the investigation was dropped in 2014.

===France===
French DGSE agents Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart sank the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, the flagship of the Greenpeace Organisation, in Auckland Harbour on July 10, 1985. The attack was aimed at stopping it from interfering in French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira and led to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand&#x27;s sovereignty as a modern nation. France initially denied any involvement in the attack, and it even joined in condemning the attack as a terrorist act. In July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation effort between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of Hao, so they could serve three years there, as well as an apology and an NZ$13 million payment from France to New Zealand.

===India===
===Iran===
===Israel===
In November 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Israel of being &quot;a terrorist state&quot; committing war crimes and violating international law in the Gaza Strip. He said Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories should be recognized as &quot;terrorists&quot;.

In December 2023, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the alleged genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and called Israel a &quot;terrorist state&quot;.

The 2024 Lebanon pager explosions, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,500, have been widely attributed to Israel. Iran referred to the attacks as &quot;Israeli terrorism&quot;. Leon Panetta, the former-CIA director, also termed the attack terrorism.

=== Italy ===
===Libya===

In the 1980s, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi was accused of state terrorism following attacks abroad such as the Lockerbie bombing. Between 9 July and 15 August 1984 seventeen merchant vessels were damaged in the Gulf of Suez and Bab al-Mandeb straits by underwater explosions. Terrorist group Al Jihad (thought to be a pro-Iranian Shiite group connected to the Palestine Liberation Organisation) issued a claim of responsibility for the mining, but circumstantial evidence indicated that Libya was responsible.

===Myanmar===

Myanmar has been accused of state terrorism in the internal conflict.

===North Korea===
North Korea has been accused of state terrorism on several occasions, such as in 1983 in the Rangoon bombing, the Gimpo International Airport bombing, and in 1987 when North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing everybody aboard.

===Pakistan===
===Qatar===
===Russia===

Following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the initial investigations into war crimes committed by Russian soldiers, there were calls for Russia to be designated a terrorist state. On May 10, 2022, Lithuania&#x27;s parliament designated Russia a terrorist state and its actions in Ukraine a genocide. The US Senate unanimously passed a resolution to this effect on July 27, 2022, and the US House of Representatives is to consider such legislation. On August 11, Latvia&#x27;s parliament designated Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Ukraine&#x27;s Verkhovna Rada on 20 August 2022 also designated Russia as a terrorist state. On October 17, the European Parliament approved a request to debate and vote on a resolution recognizing Russia as a terrorist state, which it did on November 23.

As of October 2023, the following states and organizations have designated Russia as terrorist or a sponsor of terrorism:

* (16 November 2022)
* (18 October 2022)
* European Parliament (23 November 2022)
* (11 August 2022)
* (10 May 2022)

===Saudi Arabia===
===South Africa===
Between 1979 and 1990, the Apartheid government in South Africa operated a branch of the South African Police known as Vlakplaas who routinely used methods of terrorism to support the state in maintaining Apartheid. These methods included the bombing of civilian buildings (COSATU House and Khotso House), and the targeted-killing and assassinations of anti-Apartheid activists.

In the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, the former Major-General and Commander of Vlakplaas, Sarel “Sakkie” du Plessis Crafford gave the following three reasons for the Apartheid state&#x27;s policy of extra-judicial killings:

#&quot;It scared off other supporters and potential supporters; it made people reluctant to offer open support; it created distrust and demoralization amongst cadres.
# &quot;It gave white voters confidence that the security forces were in control and winning the fight against Communism and terrorism.
# &quot;The information gleaned during the interrogation needed to be protected against disclosure.&quot;

The most notorious of the Vlakplaas operatives were Eugene de Kock and the askari Joe Mamasela, who were linked to several high-profile extra-judicial killings, including that of Griffiths Mxenge. Following South Africa&#x27;s transition to democracy, de Kock was later tried and convicted on eighty-nine charges and sentenced to 212 years in prison.

=== Soviet Union ===
===Spain===
===Sri Lanka===
===Syria===
===Turkey===
===United Kingdom===
During World War II, the United Kingdom created the Special Operations Executive (SOE) which, in the words of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, was to &quot;set Europe ablaze&quot; 
with sabotage and subversion in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. The British military historian John Keegan later wrote, &quot;We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification ... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy ... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain.&quot;

British Foreign Office documents declassified in 2021 revealed that during the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66, British propagandists secretly incited anti-communists including army generals to eliminate the PKI, and used black propaganda, due to Indonesian President Sukarno&#x27;s hostility to the formation of former British colonies into the Malayan federation from 1963. British Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s government had instructed propaganda specialists from the Foreign Office to send hundreds of inflammatory pamphlets to leading anti-communists in Indonesia, inciting them to kill the foreign minister, Subandrio, and claiming that ethnic Chinese Indonesians deserved the violence meted out to them.

Britain has been accused of involvement in state terrorism during the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland from the 1960s to the 1990s by covertly assisting loyalist paramilitaries.

===United States===

Ruth J. Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Sheffield, accuses the United States of sponsoring and deploying state terrorism, which she defines as &quot;the illegal targeting of individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to instill fear in a target audience beyond the direct victim&quot;, on an &quot;enormous scale&quot; during the Cold War. The United States government justified this policy by saying it needed to contain the spread of Communism, but Blakeley says the United States government also used it as a means to buttress and promote the interests of U.S. elites and multinational corporations. The U.S. supported governments who employed death squads throughout Latin America and counterinsurgency training of right-wing military forces included advocating the interrogation and torture of suspected insurgents. J. Patrice McSherry, a professor of political science at Long Island University, says &quot;hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans were tortured, abducted or killed by right-wing military regimes as part of the U.S.-led anti-communist crusade&quot;, which included U.S. support for Operation Condor and the Guatemalan military during the Guatemalan Civil War. John Henry Coatsworth, citing evidence provided by Freedom House, asserts that more people were repressed and killed throughout Latin America in the last three decades of the Cold War than in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc.
Declassified documents from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in 2017 confirm that U.S. officials directly facilitated and encouraged the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s. Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, says &quot;Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party&#x27;s unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration&#x27;s emerging plans for a post-Sukarno Indonesia.&quot; According to Simpson, the terror in Indonesia was an &quot;essential building block of the quasi neo-liberal policies the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia in the years to come&quot;. Historian John Roosa, who commented on documents which were released by the U.S. embassy in Jakarta in 2017, said they confirmed that &quot;the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.&quot; Geoffrey B. Robinson, a historian at UCLA, argues that without the support of the U.S. and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army&#x27;s program of mass killings would not have happened.

===Uzbekistan===
=== Venezuela ===
An Organization of American States report on human rights violations in Venezuela stated that , armed groups that support Nicolás Maduro and the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) party, murdered at least 131 individuals between 2014 and 2017 during anti-government protests.

The National Assembly of Venezuela designated the as terrorist groups due to their &quot;violence, paramilitary actions, intimidation, murders and other crimes&quot;, declaring their acts as state-sponsored terrorism.

==Criticism of the concept==

The chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has said the twelve previous international conventions on terrorism had never referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept, and when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions which deal with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law, rather than international anti-terrorism statutes. In a similar vein, Kofi Annan, at the time the United Nations Secretary-General, said it is &quot;time to set aside debates on so-called &#x27;state terrorism&#x27;. The use of force by states is already regulated under international law&quot;. Annan added, &quot;regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one&#x27;s cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.&quot;

Dr. Bruce Hoffman has argued that failing to differentiate between state and non-state violence ignores the fact that there is a &quot;fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence&quot;. Hoffman argues that even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets. For instance, rules which are codified in the Geneva and Hague Conventions on warfare prohibit taking civilians as hostages, outlaw reprisals against either civilians or POWs, recognise neutral territory, etc. Hoffman says &quot;even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules.&quot; Hoffman also says that when states transgress these rules of war &quot;the term &#x27;war crime&#x27; is used to describe such acts&quot;.

Walter Laqueur has said those who argue that state terrorism should be included in studies of terrorism ignore the fact that &quot;The very existence of a state is based on its monopoly of power. If it were different, states would not have the right, nor would they be in a position, to maintain that minimum of order on which all civilized life rests.&quot; Calling the concept a &quot;red herring&quot;, he stated: &quot;This argument has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states. It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and it rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence...&quot;

<doc id="29662" wikidata="Q166759" url="?curid=29662" title="List of rulers of Saxony">
<text>This article lists dukes, electors, and kings ruling over different territories named Saxony from the beginning of the Saxon Duchy in the 6th century to the end of the German monarchies in 1918.

The electors of Saxony from John the Steadfast onwards were Lutheran until Augustus II of Saxony converted to Catholicism in order to be elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. His descendants (including all Kings of Saxony) have since been Catholic.

==Old Saxony==
The original Duchy of Saxony comprised the lands of the Saxons in the north-western part of present-day Germany, namely, the contemporary German state of Lower Saxony as well as Westphalia and Western Saxony-Anhalt, not corresponding to the modern German state of Saxony.

Frankish king Charlemagne conquered Saxony and integrated it into the Carolingian Empire. In the later 9th century, power began to shift from the (Eastern) Frankish king to the local Saxon rulers, resulting in the emergence of the Younger stem duchy.

===Independent Saxony===
*Hadugato (fl. c. 531)
*Berthoald (fl. c. 622)
*Theoderic (fl. c. 743–744)
*Widukind (c. 777–785), leader against Charlemagne
*Albion (fl. c. 785–811)

===Saxony as part of Frankish kingdom(s)===

With the removal of the Welfs in 1180, the Duchy of Saxony was sharply reduced in territory. Westphalia fell to the archbishop of Cologne, while the Duchy of Brunswick remained with the Welfs. The Ascanian dukes had their base further east, near the Elbe, in what is sometimes called the &quot;younger Duchy of Saxony&quot;, resulting in the name Saxony moving towards the east. After the division, the counting of the dukes started anew. Though the first Ascanian duke is competingly counted as Bernard III (because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180) or as Bernard I, his successor, Albert I is already usually counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, Albert the Bear.

In the 10th century Emperor Otto I had created the County Palatine of Saxony in the Saale-Unstrut area of southern Saxony. The honour was initially held by a Count of Hessengau, then from the early 11th century by the Counts of Goseck, later by the counts of Sommerschenburg, and still later by the landgraves of Thuringia. When the Wettin landgraves succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony, the two positions merged.

==The &quot;Younger&quot; Saxony: The Duchy and the Electorate==
The new dukes replaced the Saxon horse emblem () and introduced their Ascanian family colours and emblem () added by a bendwise crancelin, symbolising the Saxon ducal crown, as new coat-of-arms of Saxony (). The later rulers of the House of Wettin adopted the Ascanian coat-of-arms.

After the division, the counting of the dukes started anew. Though the first Ascanian duke is counted either as Bernard III (because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180) or as Bernard I, his successor, Albert I is counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, Albert the Bear.

===House of Ascania===

The male line of the Saxe-Lauenburgish Ascanians was extinguished in 1689, after Julius Francis&#x27; death. In spite of having left two daughters to inherit the rights to the duchy, the House of Welf usurped the duchy, preventing the succession of the legitimate heiress, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, and resucceeded with its Brunswick and Lunenburg-Celle line. In fact, George William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was a great-great-grandson of Magnus I through his great-grandmother Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg. His descendants became Monarchs of Great Britain from 1714 on. In 1814, after being deposed by various occupations in the Napoleonic Wars, George III&#x27;s son, Regent George agreed to pass Saxe-Lauenburg to his Danish cousin in a general territorial realignment at the Congress of Vienna. This cousin was Frederick VI of Denmark, who changed the official colours of Saxe-Lauenburg to red and gold. The duchy changed hands again when, in 1865, Christian IX of Denmark was deposed in Second Schleswig War and resigned by Treaty of Vienna; Saxe-Lauenburg passed to William I of Prussia, to whom the Estates of Saxe-Lauenburg offered the ducal throne. The coat-of-arms of Saxe-Lauenburg was changed to the colours red and silver, with a border in the Prussian colours of black and white. Both duke and estates decided to merge Saxe-Lauenburg into Prussia, as district Duchy of Lauenburg, with effect from 1 July 1876.

===House of Wettin===
The Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg became extinct with the death of Elector Albert III in 1422, whereafter Emperor Sigismund bestowed the country and electoral dignity upon Margrave Frederick IV of Meissen, who had been a loyal supporter in the Hussite Wars. Late Albert&#x27;s Ascanian relative Duke Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg protested in vain. Frederick, now one of the seven Prince-electors, was a member of the House of Wettin, which since 1089 had ruled over the adjacent Margraviate of Meissen up the Elbe river, established under Emperor Otto I in 965, and since 1242 also over the Landgraviate of Thuringia. Thus, in 1423, Saxe-Wittenberg, the Margraviate of Meissen and Thuringia were united under one ruler, and the unified territory.
gradually received the name of (Upper) Saxony (or simply Saxony).

==Kingdom of Saxony==
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806. The Elector of Saxony, allied to Napoleon, anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Saxony in 1806.

<text>In microeconomics, supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that, holding all else equal, the unit price for a particular good or other traded item in a perfectly competitive market, will vary until it settles at the market-clearing price, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied such that an economic equilibrium is achieved for price and quantity transacted. The concept of supply and demand forms the theoretical basis of modern economics. 

In situations where a firm has market power, its decision on how much output to bring to market influences the market price, in violation of perfect competition. There, a more complicated model should be used; for example, an oligopoly or differentiated-product model. Likewise, where a buyer has market power, models such as monopsony will be more accurate. 

In macroeconomics, as well, the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model has been used to depict how the quantity of total output and the aggregate price level may be determined in equilibrium.

==Graphical representations==
===Supply schedule===
A supply schedule, depicted graphically as a supply curve, is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied by producers. Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost: Firms will produce additional output as long as the cost of extra production is less than the market price.

A rise in the cost of raw materials would decrease supply, shifting the supply curve to the left because at each possible price a smaller quantity would be supplied. This shift may also be thought of as an upwards shift in the supply curve, because the price must rise for producers to supply a given quantity. A fall in production costs would increase supply, shifting the supply curve to the right and down. 

Mathematically, a supply curve is represented by a supply function, giving the quantity supplied as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity supplied. The two most common specifications are:

1) linear supply function, e.g., the slanted line 
:formula_1, and

2) the constant-elasticity supply function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear supply function), e.g., the smooth curve
:formula_2
which can be rewritten as 
:formula_3

The concept of a supply curve assumes that firms are perfect competitors, having no influence over the market price. This is because each point on the supply curve answers the question, &quot;If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it sell?&quot; If a firm has market power—in violation of the perfect competitor model—its decision on how much output to bring to market influences the market price. Thus the firm is not &quot;faced with&quot; any given price, and a more complicated model, e.g., a monopoly or oligopoly or differentiated-product model, should be used.

Economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and the market supply curve. The market supply curve shows the total quantity supplied by all firms, so it is the sum of the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price (that is, the individual firms&#x27; supply curves are added horizontally).

Economists distinguish between short-run and long-run supply curve. &quot;Short run&quot; refers to a time period during which one or more inputs are fixed (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry is also fixed (if it is a market supply curve). &quot;Long run&quot; refers to a time period during which new firms enter or existing firms exit and all inputs can be adjusted fully to any price change. Long-run supply curves are flatter than short-run counterparts (with quantity more sensitive to price, more elastic supply).

Common determinants of supply are:

# Prices of inputs, including wages 
# The technology used, productivity 
# Firms&#x27; expectations about future prices
# Number of suppliers (for a market supply curve)

===Demand schedule===
A demand schedule, depicted graphically as a demand curve, represents the amount of a certain good that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices, assuming all other determinants of demand are held constant, such as income, tastes and preferences, and the prices of substitute and complementary goods. Generally, consumers will buy an additional unit as long as the marginal value of the extra unit is more than the market price they pay. According to the law of demand, the demand curve is always downward-sloping, meaning that as the price decreases, consumers will buy more of the good.

Mathematically, a demand curve is represented by a demand function, giving the quantity demanded as a function of its price and as many other variables as desired to better explain quantity demanded. The two most common specifications are linear demand, e.g., the slanted line 
:formula_4
and the constant-elasticity demand function (also called isoelastic or log-log or loglinear demand function), e.g., the smooth curve
:formula_5
which can be rewritten as 
:formula_6

As a matter of historical convention, a demand curve is drawn with price on the vertical &quot;y&quot;-axis and demand on the horizontal &quot;x&quot;-axis. In keeping with modern convention, a demand curve would instead be drawn with price on the &quot;x&quot;-axis and demand on the &quot;y&quot;-axis, because price is the independent variable and demand is the variable that is dependent upon price.

Just as the supply curve parallels the marginal cost curve, the demand curve parallels marginal utility, measured in dollars. Consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good, at a given price, if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price, that is, the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices. The demand schedule is defined as the &quot;willingness&quot; and &quot;ability&quot; of a consumer to purchase a given product at a certain time.

The demand curve is generally downward-sloping, but for some goods it is upward-sloping. Two such types of goods have been given definitions and names that are in common use: Veblen goods, goods which because of fashion or signalling are more attractive at higher prices, and Giffen goods, which, by virtue of being inferior goods that absorb a large part of a consumer&#x27;s income (e.g., staples such as the classic example of potatoes in Ireland), may see an increase in quantity demanded when the price rises. The reason the law of demand is violated for Giffen goods is that the rise in the price of the good has a strong income effect, sharply reducing the purchasing power of the consumer so that he switches away from luxury goods to the Giffen good, e.g., when the price of potatoes rises, the Irish peasant can no longer afford meat and eats more potatoes to cover for the lost calories.

As with the supply curve, the concept of a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor—that is, that the purchaser have no influence over the market price. This is true because each point on the demand curve answers the question, &quot;If buyers are &quot;faced with&quot; this potential price, how much of the product will they purchase?&quot; But, if a buyer has market power (that is, the amount he buys influences the price), he is not &quot;faced with&quot; any given price, and we must use a more complicated model, of monopsony.

As with supply curves, economists distinguish between the demand curve for an individual and the demand curve for a market. The market demand curve is obtained by adding the quantities from the individual demand curves at each price.

Common determinants of demand are:
# Income 
# Tastes and preferences 
# Prices of related goods and services 
# Consumers&#x27; expectations about future prices and incomes 
# Number of potential consumers 
# Advertising

===History of the curves===

Since supply and demand can be considered as functions of price they have a natural graphical representation. Demand curves were first drawn by Augustin Cournot in his (1838)see Cournot competition. Supply curves were added by Fleeming Jenkin in &quot;The Graphical Representation of the Laws of Supply and Demand...&quot; of 1870. Both sorts of curve were popularised by Alfred Marshall who, in his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; (1890), chose to represent pricenormally the independent variableby the vertical axis; a practice which remains common.

If supply or demand is a function of other variables besides price, it may be represented by a family of curves (with a change in the other variables constituting a shift between curves) or by a surface in a higher dimensional space.

==Microeconomics==

===Equilibrium===
Generally speaking, an equilibrium is defined to be the price-quantity pair where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. The analysis of various equilibria is a fundamental aspect of microeconomics.

====Market equilibrium====
A situation in a market when the price is such that the quantity demanded by consumers is correctly balanced by the quantity that firms wish to supply. In this situation, the market clears.

====Changes in market equilibrium====
Practical uses of supply and demand analysis often center on the different variables that change equilibrium price and quantity, represented as shifts in the respective curves. Comparative statics of such a shift traces the effects from the initial equilibrium to the new equilibrium.

====Demand curve shifts====
When consumers increase the quantity demanded &quot;at a given price&quot;, it is referred to as an &quot;increase in demand&quot;. Increased demand can be represented on the graph as the curve being shifted to the right. At each price point, a greater quantity is demanded, as from the initial curve to the new curve . In the diagram, this raises the equilibrium price from to the higher . This raises the equilibrium quantity from to the higher . (A movement along the curve is described as a &quot;change in the quantity demanded&quot; to distinguish it from a &quot;change in demand&quot;, that is, a shift of the curve.) The &quot;increase&quot; in demand has caused an increase in (equilibrium) quantity. The increase in demand could come from changing tastes and fashions, incomes, price changes in complementary and substitute goods, market expectations, and number of buyers. This would cause the entire demand curve to shift changing the equilibrium price and quantity. Note in the diagram that the shift of the demand curve, by causing a new equilibrium price to emerge, resulted in &quot;movement along&quot; the supply curve from the point to the point .

If the &quot;demand decreases&quot;, then the opposite happens: a shift of the curve to the left. If the demand starts at , and &quot;decreases&quot; to , the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The quantity supplied at each price is the same as before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different as a result of the change (shift) in demand.

====Supply curve shifts====
When technological progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. For example, assume that someone invents a better way of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve outward, to —an &quot;increase in supply&quot;. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from to . The equilibrium quantity increases from to as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. If the quantity supplied &quot;decreases&quot;, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at , and shifts leftward to , the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.

The movement of the supply curve in response to a change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the constant term of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change.

===Partial equilibrium===

Partial equilibrium, as the name suggests, takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium.

Jain proposes (attributed to George Stigler): &quot;A partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data, a standard example is price of a single product, the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis.&quot;

The supply-and-demand model is a partial equilibrium model of economic equilibrium, where the clearance on the market of some specific goods is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all substitutes and complements, as well as income levels of consumers are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy.

Here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand. It is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study equilibrium, efficiency and comparative statics. The stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach makes the model considerably more tractable, but may produce results which, while seemingly precise, do not effectively model real world economic
phenomena.

Partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected, ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any.

Hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets.

Léon Walras first formalized the idea of a one-period economic equilibrium of the general economic system, but it was French economist Antoine Augustin Cournot and English political economist Alfred Marshall who developed tractable models to analyze an economic system.

==Other markets==
The model of supply and demand also applies to various specialty markets.
The model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and demander are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell their labor for the highest price. The demanders of labor are businesses, which try to buy the type of labor they need at the lowest price. The equilibrium price for a certain type of labor is the wage rate. However, economist Steve Fleetwood revisited the empirical reality of supply and demand curves in labor markets and concluded that the evidence is &quot;at best inconclusive and at worst casts doubt on their existence.&quot; For instance, he cites Kaufman and Hotchkiss (2006): &quot;For adult men, nearly all studies find the labour supply curve to be negatively sloped or backward bending.&quot; Supply and demand can be used to explain physician shortages, nursing shortages or teacher shortages.

In both classical and Keynesian economics, the money market is analyzed as a supply-and-demand system with interest rates being the price. The money supply may be a vertical supply curve, if the central bank of a country chooses to use monetary policy to fix its value regardless of the interest rate; in this case the money supply is totally inelastic. On the other hand, the money supply curve is a horizontal line if the central bank is targeting a fixed interest rate and ignoring the value of the money supply; in this case the money supply curve is perfectly elastic. The demand for money intersects with the money supply to determine the interest rate.

According to some studies, the laws of supply and demand are applicable not only to the business relationships of people, but to the behaviour of social animals and to all living things that interact on the biological markets in scarce resource environments.

The model of supply and demand accurately describes the characteristic of metabolic systems: specifically, it explains how feedback inhibition allows metabolic pathways to respond to the demand for a metabolic intermediates while minimizing effects due to variation in the supply.

==Empirical estimation==
Demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price, quantity, and other data with sufficient information in the model. This can be done with &quot;simultaneous-equation methods of estimation&quot; in econometrics. Such methods allow solving for the model-relevant &quot;structural coefficients,&quot; the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory. The &quot;Parameter identification problem&quot; is a common issue in &quot;structural estimation.&quot; Typically, data on exogenous variables (that is, variables other than price and quantity, both of which are endogenous variables) are needed to perform such an estimation. An alternative to &quot;structural estimation&quot; is reduced-form estimation, which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables.

==Macroeconomic uses==
Demand and supply have also been generalized to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy, including the quantity of total output and the aggregate price level. The aggregate demand-aggregate supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics, but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand. Compared to microeconomic uses of demand and supply, different (and more controversial) theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money demand to interest rates, and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates.

==History==
The 256th couplet of Tirukkural, which was composed at least 2000 years ago, says that &quot;if people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price&quot;.

According to Hamid S. Hosseini, the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early Muslim scholars, such as fourteenth-century Syrian scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, who wrote: &quot;If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down.&quot;

Shifting focus to the English etymology of the expression, it has been confirmed that the phrase &#x27;supply and demand&#x27; was not used by English economics writers until after the end of the 17th century. 
In John Locke&#x27;s 1691 work &quot;Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money&quot;, Locke alluded to the idea of supply and demand, however, he failed to accurately label it as such and thus, he fell short in coining the phrase and conveying its true significance. Locke wrote: “The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers” and “that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to [the] Vent.” Locke&#x27;s terminology drew criticism from John Law. Law argued that,&quot;The Prices of Goods are not according to the quantity in proportion to the Vent, but in proportion to the Demand.&quot; From Law the demand part of the phrase was given its proper title and it began to circulate among &quot;prominent authorities&quot; in the 1730s. In 1755, Francis Hutcheson, in his &quot;A System of Moral Philosophy&quot;, furthered development toward the phrase by stipulating that, &quot;the prices of goods depend on these two jointly, the Demand... and the Difficulty of acquiring.&quot;

It was not until 1767 that the phrase &quot;supply and demand&quot; was first used by Scottish writer James Denham-Steuart in his &quot;Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy.&quot; He originated the use of this phrase by effectively combining &quot;supply&quot; and &quot;demand&quot; together in a number of different occasions such as price determination and competitive analysis. In Steuart&#x27;s chapter entitled &quot;Of Demand&quot;, he argues that &quot;The nature of Demand is to encourage industry; and when it is regularly made, the effect of it is, that the supply for the most part is found to be in proportion to it, and then the demand is simple&quot;. It is presumably from this chapter that the idea spread to other authors and economic thinkers. Adam Smith used the phrase after Steuart in his 1776 book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, Smith asserted that the supply price was fixed but that its &quot;merit&quot; (value) would decrease as its &quot;scarcity&quot; increased, this idea by Smith was later named the law of demand. In 1803, Thomas Robert Malthus used the phrase &quot;supply and demand&quot; twenty times in the second edition of the &quot;Essay on Population&quot;. 
And David Ricardo in his 1817 work, &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;, titled one chapter, &quot;On the Influence of Demand and Supply on Price&quot;. In &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;, Ricardo more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand. In 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his &quot;Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth&quot;, it included diagrams. It is important to note that the use of the phrase was still rare and only a few examples of more than 20 uses in a single work have been identified by the end of the second decade of the 19th century.

During the late 19th century the marginalist school of thought emerged. The main innovators of this approach were Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Léon Walras. The key idea was that the price was set by the subjective value of a good at the margin. This was a substantial change from Adam Smith&#x27;s thoughts on determining the supply price.

In his 1870 essay &quot;On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand&quot;, Fleeming Jenkin in the course of &quot;introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature&quot; published the first drawing of supply and demand curves in English, including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market. The model was further developed and popularized by Alfred Marshall in the 1890 textbook &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;.

==Criticism==
Piero Sraffa&#x27;s critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good. The notability of Sraffa&#x27;s critique is also demonstrated by Paul Samuelson&#x27;s comments and engagements with it over many years, for example:
:What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how &quot;nearly empty&quot; are &quot;all&quot; of Marshall&#x27;s partial equilibrium boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the &quot;Marshallian partial&quot; equilibrium box of &quot;constant&quot; cost is even more empty than the box of &quot;increasing&quot; cost.

Modern Post-Keynesians criticize the supply and demand model for failing to explain the prevalence of administered prices, in which retail prices are set by firms, primarily based on a mark-up over normal average unit costs, and are not responsive to changes in demand up to capacity.

<doc id="29665" wikidata="Q548235" url="?curid=29665" title="State capitalism">
<text>State capitalism is an economic system in which the state undertakes business and commercial (i.e., for-profit) economic activity and where the means of production are nationalized as state-owned enterprises (including the processes of capital accumulation, centralized management and wage labor). The definition can also include the state dominance of corporatized government agencies (agencies organized using business-management practices) or of public companies (such as publicly listed corporations) in which the state has controlling shares.

A state-capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts as a single huge corporation, extracting surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production. This designation applies regardless of the political aims of the state, even if the state is nominally socialist. Some scholars argue that the economy of the Soviet Union and of the Eastern Bloc countries modeled after it, including Maoist China, were state-capitalist systems, and some western commentators believe that the current economies of China and Singapore also constitute a mixture of state-capitalism with private-capitalism.

The label &quot;state capitalism&quot; is used by various authors in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, i.e. a private economy that is subject to economic planning and interventionism. It has also been used to describe the controlled economies of the Great Powers during World War I (1914–1918). Alternatively, state capitalism may refer to an economic system where the means of production are privately owned, but the state has considerable control over the allocation of credit and investment. This was the case with Western European countries during the post-war consensus and with France during the period of dirigisme after World War II. Other examples include Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew and Turkey,
as well as military dictatorships during the Cold War and fascist regimes such as Nazi Germany.

The phrase &quot;state capitalism&quot; has also come to be used (sometimes interchangeably with &quot;state monopoly capitalism&quot;) to describe a system where the state intervenes in the economy to protect and advance the interests of large-scale businesses. Noam Chomsky, a libertarian socialist, applies the term &quot;state capitalism&quot; to the economy of the United States, where large enterprises that are deemed by &quot;the powers that be&quot; as &quot;too big to fail&quot; receive publicly-funded government bailouts that mitigate the firms&#x27; assumption of risk and undermine market laws, and where private production is largely funded by the state at public expense, but private owners reap the profits. This practice is contrasted with the ideals of both socialism and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism.

There are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which existed before the Russian October Revolution of 1917. The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and that capitalist social relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism, fundamentally retaining the capitalist mode of production. In &quot;&quot; (1880), Friedrich Engels argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the bourgeois state. He argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism. In &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; (1916), Lenin claimed that World War I had transformed &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism into monopolist state capitalism.

== Origins and early usage ==

In &quot;&quot; (1880), Friedrich Engels described state ownership, i.e. state capitalism, as follows:
If the crisis revealed the incapacity of the bourgeoisie any longer to control the modern productive forces, the conversion of the great organizations for production and communication into joint-stock companies and state property shows that for this purpose the bourgeoisie can be dispensed with. All the social functions of the capitalists are now carried out by salaried employees. The capitalist has no longer any social activity save the pocketing of revenues, the clipping of coupons, and gambling on the stock exchange, where the different capitalists fleece each other of their capital. Just as at first the capitalist mode of production displaced the workers, so now it displaces the capitalists, relegating them to the superfluous population even if not in the first instance to the industrial reserve army.

Engels argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism, further writing:
But neither the conversion into joint stock companies nor into state property deprives the productive forces of their character as capital. In the case of joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state, too, is only the organization with which bourgeois society provides itself in order to maintain the general external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against encroachments either by the workers or by individual capitalists. The modern state, whatever its form, is then the state of the capitalists, the ideal collective body of all the capitalists. The more productive forces it takes over as its property, the more it becomes the real collective body of the capitalists, the more citizens it exploits. The workers remain wage-earners, proletarians. The capitalist relationship isn&#x27;t abolished; it is rather pushed to the extreme. But at this extreme it is transformed into its opposite. State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but it contains within itself the formal means, the key to the solution.
Engels described state capitalism as a new form or variant of capitalism. In 1896, following Engels, the German Social Democrat Wilhelm Liebknecht said: &quot;Nobody has combated State Socialism more than we German Socialists; nobody has shown more distinctively than I that State Socialism is really State capitalism.&quot;

It has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s critique during the First International of the potential for state exploitation under Marxist-inspired socialism, or to Jan Wacław Machajski&#x27;s argument in &quot;The Intellectual Worker&quot; (1905) that socialism was a movement of the intelligentsia as a class, resulting in a new type of society he termed &quot;state capitalism&quot;. For anarchists, state socialism is equivalent to state capitalism, hence oppressive and merely a shift from private capitalists to the state being the sole employer and capitalist.

In &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; and &quot;Imperialism and World Economy&quot;, both Vladimir Lenin and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively, had similarly identified the growth of state capitalism as one of the main features of capitalism in its imperialist epoch. In &quot;The State and Revolution&quot;, Lenin wrote that &quot;the erroneous bourgeois reformist assertion that monopoly capitalism or state-monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism, but can now be called &quot;state socialism&quot; and so on, is very common&quot;. During World War I, using Lenin&#x27;s idea that tsarism was taking a Prussian path to capitalism, the Bolshevik Nikolai Bukharin identified a new stage in the development of capitalism in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state—he termed this new stage &quot;state capitalism&quot;. After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term &quot;state capitalism&quot; positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of war communism and again during the New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the dictatorship of the proletariat to further central control and develop the productive forces, making the following point:
Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a victory.

Lenin argued the state should temporarily run the economy which would eventually be taken over by workers. To Lenin, &quot;state capitalism&quot; did not mean the state would run most of the economy, but that state capitalism would be one of five elements of the economy:
=== By the left ===
As a term and concept, state capitalism has been used by various socialists, including anarchists, Marxists, Leninists, left communists, Marxist–Leninists and Trotskyists.

==== Anarchists ====
Perhaps the earliest critique of the Soviet Union as state capitalist was formulated by the Russian anarchists as documented in Paul Avrich&#x27;s work on Russian anarchism.

The Russian anarchists&#x27; claim would become standard in anarchist works. Of the Soviet Union, the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman wrote an article from 1935 titled &quot;There Is No Communism in Russia&quot; in which she argued:
Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.

When speaking about Marxism, Murray Bookchin said the following:
Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement — notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian &#x27;socialism&#x27; turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described &#x27;socialism&#x27; as &#x27;nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people&#x27;. This is an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of contradictions.

While speaking about Leninism, the authors of &quot;An Anarchist FAQ&quot; say:
Rather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worst, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).

==== Classical and orthodox Marxists ====

Immediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, Karl Kautsky said:
After 1929, exiled Mensheviks such as Fyodor Dan began to argue that Stalin&#x27;s Russia constituted a state capitalist society. In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the Socialist Party of Great Britain independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the Catholic Church&#x27;s. As John O&#x27;Neill notes:
Writing in the Menshevik journal &quot;Socialist Courier&quot; on 25 April 25, Rudolf Hilferding rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that as practiced in the Soviet Union it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital. According to Hilferding, state capitalism was not a form of capitalism, but rather a form of totalitarianism.

==== Communist left and council communists ====

Another early analysis of the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating left communism. One major tendency of the 1918 Russian communist left criticised the re-employment of authoritarian capitalist relations and methods of production. As Valerian Osinsky in particular argued, &quot;one-man management&quot; (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished) and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production. Taylorism converted workers into the appendages of machines and piece work imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling petty bourgeois values into workers. In sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. In 1918, this tendency within the left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its transcendence lay in the workers&#x27; conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of Marx&#x27;s critique of alienation.

This type of criticism was revived on the left of the Russian Communist Party after the 10th Congress in 1921, which introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP). Many members of the Workers&#x27; Opposition and the Decists (both later banned) and two new underground left communist groups, Gavril Myasnikov&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Group and the Workers&#x27; Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class. The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.

The left and council communist traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist, although some left communists such as Amadeo Bordiga also referred to it as simply &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;capitalist mode of production&quot;. Otto Rühle, a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist Anton Pannekoek in &quot;State Capitalism and Dictatorship&quot; (1936).

==== Trotskyists ====

Leon Trotsky stated that the term &quot;state capitalism&quot; &quot;originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises&quot; and is therefore a &quot;partial negation&quot; of capitalism.

However, Trotsky rejected that description of the Soviet Union, claiming instead that it was a degenerated workers&#x27; state. After World War II, most Trotskyists accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being deformed workers&#x27; states. However, alternative opinions within the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a new class theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, Cuba, China and other self-proclaimed socialist states.

The discussion goes back to internal debates in the Left Opposition during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ante Ciliga, a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many within the Left Opposition to a theory of state capitalism influenced by Gavril Myasnikov&#x27;s Workers Group and other left communist factions.

Following his release and his return to activity in the International Left Opposition, Ciliga &quot;was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles&quot;. George Orwell, who was an anti-Stalinist leftist like Ciliga, used the term in his &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot; (1938).

After 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the Johnson–Forest Tendency of C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya, who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three Five Year Plans alongside readings of Marx&#x27;s early humanist writings. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.

Another is that of Tony Cliff, associated with the International Socialist Tendency and the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones. A relatively recent text by Stephen Resnick and Richard D. Wolff, titled &quot;Class Theory and History&quot;, explores what they term &quot;state capitalism&quot; in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.

Other terms used by critical left-wing theorists in discussing Soviet-style societies include bureaucratic collectivism, deformed workers&#x27; states, degenerated workers&#x27; states and the &quot;new class&quot;.

==== Maoists and anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninists ====
In the common program set up by the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country&#x27;s interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: &quot;Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism&quot;.

From 1956 to the late 1970s, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their Maoist or anti-revisionist adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of Nikita Khrushchev and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled &quot;socialist&quot; states. This was involved in the ideological Sino–Soviet split.

After Mao Zedong&#x27;s death, amidst the supporters of the Cultural Revolution and the Gang of Four, most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the CCP which likewise distanced itself from these former fraternal groups. The related theory of Hoxhaism was developed in 1978, largely by Socialist Albanian President Enver Hoxha, who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and revisionist economic policies.

Most current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being state capitalist from a certain point in their history onwards—most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and anti-revisionists also sometimes use the term &quot;social imperialism&quot; to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence—their phrase, &quot;socialist in words, imperialist in deeds&quot; denotes this.

===By liberal economists===

Murray Rothbard, an anarcho-capitalist philosopher, used the term &quot;state capitalism&quot; interchangeably with the term &quot;state monopoly capitalism&quot; and used it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.
Rothbard distinguished it from &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, where big business is not protected from market forces. This usage dates from the 1960s, when Harry Elmer Barnes described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as &quot;state capitalism&quot;. More recently, Andrei Illarionov, former economic adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, resigned in December 2005, protesting Russia&#x27;s &quot;embracement of state capitalism&quot;.

The term &quot;state capitalism&quot; is not used by classical liberals to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The explanation why was given by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises, who argued:
The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism — until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is &quot;State Capitalism.&quot; It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the &quot;classic&quot; ideal of egalitarian Socialism.

=== By Italian Fascists ===

On economic issues, Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would &quot;lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than state socialism turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation&quot;.

Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830–1870), followed by static capitalism (1870–1914) and then reaching its final form of decadent capitalism, also known as supercapitalism beginning in 1914.

Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the &quot;standardization of humankind&quot; and for causing excessive consumption. Mussolini claimed that at this stage of supercapitalism &quot;[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state&#x27;s arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously&quot;. Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy.

Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the bourgeoisie could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism only if the concept of economic individualism were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced. Private enterprise would control production, but it would be supervised by the state. Italian Fascism presented the economic system of corporatism as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.

== In Western countries and European studies ==
An alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the military–industrial complex in which autonomous entrepreneurial firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.

Both the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably Nikolai Bukharin, who in his book &quot;Imperialism and World Economy&quot; thought that advanced, imperialist countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.

State capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for national security. These may involve private investment as well. A government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include Neste, Equinor and OMV.

There are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite&#x27;s political power which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism&#x27;s creative destruction, the threat of revolution and any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill-equipped to inspire innovation.

Several European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the European Union. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt&#x27;s (2002) article on &quot;The Futures of European Capitalism&quot;, in which she divides modern European capitalism in three groups, namely market, managed and state. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-corporatist model.

The author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism. A general theory of capitalist forms, whereby state capitalism is a particular case, was developed by Ernesto Screpanti, who argued that Soviet-type economies of the 20th century used state capitalism to sustain processes of primitive accumulation. In their historical analysis of the Soviet Union, Marxist economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.

=== State monopoly capitalism ===
The theory of state monopoly capitalism was initially a neo-Stalinist doctrine popularised after World War II. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or oligopolistic businesses from competition by smaller firms.

The main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a monopoly or cartel position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial oligarchy or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government, and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.

State monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin&#x27;s definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in neo-Trotskyist theories of state capitalism as well as in libertarian anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.

==== Political implications ====
The strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the Joseph Stalin era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a people&#x27;s democratic alliance under the leadership of the communist party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called monopoly for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the anti-monopoly alliance. At the 1965 Afro-Asian Conference, delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algeri, Che Guevara argued that &quot;[e]ver since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries&quot;.

==== Criticism ====
When Eugen Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that &quot;under capitalism anarchy of production reigns&quot;.

Critics of the stamocap theory (e.g. Ernest Mandel and Leo Kofler) claimed the following :
* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist competition, the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the law of value. 
* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the state and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of which in reality did not exist in that way.
* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of neoliberal ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state&#x27;s influence in the economy. 
* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the communist party, or rather its central committee, played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party or its central committee.

== Current forms in the 21st century ==
State capitalism is distinguished from capitalist mixed economies where the state intervenes in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates businesses for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as corporations, companies or business enterprises.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

Many analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century. In his book &quot;The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations&quot;, political scientist Ian Bremmer describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Bremmer draws a broad definition of state capitalism as such:
Following on Bremmer, Aligica, and Tarko further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a rent-seeking society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.

In his article &quot;We&#x27;re All State Capitalists Now&quot;, British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University Niall Ferguson warns against &quot;an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into &#x27;market capitalist&#x27; and &#x27;state capitalist&#x27; camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary&quot;. He then notes: &quot;The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle. It is a contest that goes on within all three regions as we all struggle to strike the right balance between the economic institutions that generate wealth and the political institutions that regulate and redistribute it.&quot;

In the common program set up by the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in 1949, in effect the country&#x27;s interim constitution, state capitalism meant an economic system of corporatism. It provided as follows: &quot;Whenever necessary and possible, private capital shall be encouraged to develop in the direction of state capitalism.&quot;

Analysis of the Chinese model and the socialist market economy by the economists Julan Du and Chenggang Xu finds that the contemporary economic system of the People&#x27;s Republic of China represents a state capitalist system as opposed to a market socialist system. The reason for this categorization is the existence of financial markets in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a basic income/social dividend or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature. They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.

The Chinese government maintains that these reforms are actually the primary stage of socialism and the Chinese Communist Party remains nominally dedicated to establishing a socialist society and subsequently developing into full communism. This was reiterated by Xi Jinping at the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.

=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===
Some Taiwanese economists referred to Taiwan&#x27;s economic model during the Kuomintang dictatorship period as party-state capitalism&quot;.&quot; During this era, Taiwan&#x27;s economy had been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control. Today, Taiwan&#x27;s economy includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the state&#x27;s role in the economy has shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s.

=== Norway ===
According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Norway is &quot;embracing state capitalism&quot;, as the government of Norway, funded by the government&#x27;s ownership of the country&#x27;s oil reserves, has ownership stakes in many of the country&#x27;s largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stock market and operates the country&#x27;s largest non-listed companies including Equinor and Statkraft. There are legal limits however, as the Government Pension Fund of Norway is not allowed to own more than 15% of any single Norwegian company.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore has attracted some of the world&#x27;s most powerful corporations through business-friendly legislation and through the encouragement of Western-style corporatism, with close cooperation between the state and corporations. Singapore&#x27;s large holdings of government-linked companies and the state&#x27;s close cooperation with business are defining aspects of the economy of Singapore. Singapore&#x27;s government owns controlling shares in many government-linked companies and directs investment through sovereign wealth funds, an arrangement that has been cited as state capitalism when defined as &quot;system in which the state functions as the leading economic actor and uses markets primarily for political gain&quot;. Listed companies in which the government is the controlling shareholder account for 37% of the total stock market capitalization in Singapore.

<text>Syringomyelia is a generic term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord. Often, syringomyelia is used as a generic term before an etiology is determined. This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in loss of feeling, paralysis, weakness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, and extremities. 

Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. It may also lead to a cape-like bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation along the upper chest and arms. The combination of symptoms varies from one patient to another depending on the location of the syrinx within the spinal cord, as well as its extent.

Syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000 people, with symptoms usually beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or myelopathy.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Syringomyelia causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms, due to damage to the spinal cord. Patients may experience severe chronic pain, abnormal sensations and loss of sensation, particularly in the hands. Some patients experience paralysis or paresis, temporarily or permanently. A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, leading to Horner syndrome, abnormal body temperature or sweating, bowel control issues, or other problems. If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem, as in syringobulbia, vocal cord paralysis, ipsilateral tongue wasting, trigeminal nerve sensory loss, and other signs may be present. Rarely, bladder stones can occur at the onset of weakness in the lower extremities.
Classically, syringomyelia spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord, leaving pressure, vibration, touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities. Neuropathic arthropathy, also known as a Charcot joint, can occur, particularly in the shoulders, in patients with syringomyelia. The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to degeneration of the joint over time.

== Cause ==
Generally, there are two forms of syringomyelia: congenital and acquired. Syringomyelia is generally a chronic disorder that occurs over time, resulting in muscular atrophy. Acquired Syringomyelia can be caused by a serious physical trauma to the body such as in a road traffic accident. Syringomyelia can also be classified into communicating and noncommunicating forms. Communicating typically occurs due to lesions on the foramen magnum and noncommunicating occurring due to other spinal cord diseases.

===Congenital===
The first major form relates to an abnormality of the brain called an Arnold–Chiari malformation or Chiari malformation. This is the most common cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality, which may be due to a small posterior fossa, causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or neck portion of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining, called a valsalva maneuver, or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord—the arachnoid membrane—is inflamed. Some cases of syringomyelia are familial, although this is rare.

===Acquired===
The second major form of syringomyelia occurs as a complication of trauma, meningitis, hemorrhage, a tumor, or arachnoiditis. Here, the syrinx or cyst develops in a segment of the spinal cord damaged by one of these conditions. The syrinx then starts to expand. This is sometimes referred to as noncommunicating syringomyelia. Symptoms may appear months or even years after the initial injury, starting with pain, weakness, and sensory impairment originating at the site of trauma.

The primary symptom of post-traumatic syringomyelia (often referred to using the abbreviation of PTS) is pain, which may spread upward from the site of injury. Symptoms, such as pain, numbness, weakness, and disruption in temperature sensation, may be limited to one side of the body. Syringomyelia can also adversely affect sweating, sexual function, and, later, bladder and bowel control. A typical cause of PTS would be a car accident or similar trauma involving a whiplash injury.

What can make PTS difficult to diagnose is the fact that symptoms can often first appear long after the actual cause of the syrinx occurred (e.g., a car accident occurring and then the patient first experiencing PTS symptoms such as pain, loss of sensation, and reduced ability on the skin to feel varying degrees of hot and cold a number of months after the car accident).

== Pathogenesis ==
The pathogenesis of syringomyelia is debated. The cerebrospinal fluid also serves to cushion the brain. Excess cerebrospinal fluid in the central canal of the spinal cord is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the ependyma of the central canal. When fluid dissects into the surrounding white matter forming a cystic cavity or syrinx, the term syringomyelia is applied. As these conditions coexist in the majority of cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably.

It has been observed that obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces in the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation, and alleviation of the obstruction may improve symptoms. A number of pathological conditions can cause an obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid spaces. These include Chiari malformation, spinal arachnoiditis, scoliosis, spinal vertebrae misalignment, spinal tumors, spina bifida, and others. The reasons that blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid space within the subarachnoid space can result in syrinx formation are not fully understood although a small posterior fossa is one known cause. It is unclear if syrinx fluid originates from bulk movement of cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal cord, from bulk transmural movement of blood fluids through the spinal vasculature into the syrinx, or from a combination of both. Recent work suggests that central nervous system compliance is the underlying problem for the central nervous system, and also that hydrocephalus and syringomyelia have related causes.

== Diagnosis ==
Physicians now use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose syringomyelia. The MRI radiographer takes images of body anatomy, such as the brain and spinal cord, in vivid detail. This test will show the syrinx in the spine or any other conditions, such as the presence of a tumor. MRI is safe, painless, and informative and has greatly improved the diagnosis of syringomyelia.

The physician may order additional tests to help confirm the diagnosis. One of these is called electromyography (EMG), which show possible lower motor neuron damage. Note this test isn&#x27;t used diagnostically for injuries to the spine but to nerves and muscles. This would be part of a patient&#x27;s rehab routine. In addition, computed axial tomography (CT) scans of a patient&#x27;s head may reveal the presence of tumors and other abnormalities such as hydrocephalus.

Like MRI and CT scans, another test, called a myelogram, uses radiographs and requires a contrast medium to be injected into the subarachnoid space. Since the introduction of MRI, this test is rarely necessary to diagnose syringomyelia.

The possible causes are trauma, tumors, and congenital defects. It is most usually observed in the part of the spinal cord corresponding to the neck area. Symptoms are due to spinal cord damage and include pain, decreased sensation of touch, weakness, and loss of muscle tissue. The diagnosis is confirmed with a spinal CT, myelogram or MRI of the spinal cord. The cavity may be reduced by surgical decompression.

Furthermore, evidence also suggests that impact injuries to the thorax area highly correlate with the occurrence of a cervical-located syrinx.

== Treatment ==

===Surgery===
Treating syringomyelia sometimes requires surgery. Surgery involving the spinal cord carries certain risks, and as with any medical treatment, the potential benefits have to be weighed against the possible complications. On the other hand, delaying treatment can increase the risk of permanent damage. Evaluation of the condition is necessary because syringomyelia can remain stationary for long periods of time, and in some cases progress rapidly.

The main goal of surgical intervention is to correct the condition which led to the formation of the syrinx. Draining the syrinx can also help, by preventing it from becoming worse, but the symptoms the syrinx has already caused may not go away.

In cases involving an Arnold–Chiari malformation, the main goal of surgery is to provide more space for the cerebellum at the base of the skull and upper cervical spine, without entering the brain or spinal cord. This often causes the syrinx to shrink or disappear over time, as the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid is restored. If syringomyelia is caused by a tumor, removing the tumor – if possible – is the treatment of choice.

Most patients’ symptoms stabilize or have a modest improvement following surgery. Syringomyelia can come back, however, requiring additional surgeries which may be less effective.

In some cases, including both communicating and non-communicating forms of the condition, a syrinx may require ongoing drainage. This is done with a shunt, which uses tubes and valves to let cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain from the syrinx into another cavity within the body (usually the abdomen). This type of shunt, called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, is particularly useful in cases involving hydrocephalus. By continually draining the syrinx, a shunt can arrest the progression of symptoms and relieve pain, headache, and tightness.

Many factors affect the decision to use a shunt. There are risks of injury to the spinal cord, infection, drainage becoming blocked, and bleeding, and they do not always achieve the intended results. Draining the fluid more quickly does not produce better outcomes, but for some syrinxes, a shunt is the only drainage option.

In the case of trauma-related syringomyelia, the surgeon operates at the level of the initial injury. The syrinx collapses at surgery, but a tube or shunt is usually necessary to prevent it from returning.

===Non-surgical interventions===
Surgery is not always recommended for syringomyelia patients. While there is no medication which can cure the condition, for many patients, the main treatment is analgesia to manage the symptoms. Physicians specializing in pain management can develop a medication and treatment plan to ameliorate pain. Medications to combat any neuropathic pain symptoms such as shooting and stabbing pains (e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin) would be first-line choices. Opiates are usually prescribed for pain for management of this condition. Conversely, facet joint injections are not indicated for the treatment of syringomyelia.

Radiation is rare, but may be used if a tumor is involved. In these cases, it can halt the extension of a cavity and may help to alleviate pain.

Treatment is usually reserved for cases which are causing symptoms. Treatment may not provide enough benefits to be recommended for elderly patients, or when symptoms are stable instead of worsening. Whether treated or not, many patients are advised to avoid activities that involve straining.

A conservative approach may be recommended, as the natural history of syringomyelia is not yet well understood. When surgery is not currently advised, patients are monitored with regular physical evaluations and MRI&#x27;s.

== Research ==

The precise causes of syringomyelia are still unknown, although blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid has been known to be an important factor since the 1970s. Scientists in the UK and US continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of syrinxes in the spinal cord. It has been demonstrated that a block of the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Duke University in America and Warwick University are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia.

Surgical techniques are also being refined by the neurosurgical research community. Successful procedures expand the area around the cerebellum and spinal cord, improving the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and thereby reducing the syrinx.

It is also important to understand the role of birth defects in the development of hindbrain malformations that can lead to syringomyelia, as syringomyelia is a feature of intrauterine life and is also associated with spina bifida. Learning when these defects occur during the development of the fetus can help with the understanding of this and similar disorders, and may lead to preventive treatment that can stop the formation of some birth abnormalities.

Diagnostic technology is another area for continued research. MRI has enabled scientists to see the situation within the spine, including syringomyelia, before any symptoms appear. A new technology, known as dynamic MRI, allows investigators to view spinal fluid flow within the syrinx. CT scans allow physicians to see abnormalities in the brain, and other diagnostic tests have also improved greatly with the availability of new, non-toxic, contrast dyes.

<text>Sergio Aragonés Domenech ( , ; born 6 September 1937 in Sant Mateu, Castellón, Spain) is a Spanish-Mexican cartoonist and writer best known for his contributions to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine and creating the comic book &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;.

Among his peers and fans, Aragonés is widely regarded as &quot;the world&#x27;s fastest cartoonist&quot;. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; has described Aragonés as &quot;one of the most prolific and brilliant cartoonists of his generation&quot;. &quot;Mad&quot; editor Al Feldstein said, &quot;He could have drawn the whole magazine if we&#x27;d let him.&quot;

Aragonés has won numerous awards and accolades for his work, including Shazam Awards, a Harvey Award, an Inkpot Award, a Reuben Award, an Eisner Award, and a National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award. In October 2024, he was inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Born in Sant Mateu, Castellón, Spain, Aragonés emigrated with his family to France, due to the Spanish Civil War, before settling in Mexico at age 6. Aragonés had a passion for art since early childhood. As one anecdote goes, Aragonés was once left alone in a room by his parents with a box of crayons. His parents returned sometime later to find that he had covered the wall in hundreds upon hundreds of drawings. Aragonés recalled his early difficulties in Mexico, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have too many friends because I had just arrived. You&#x27;re the new kid, and you have an accent. I&#x27;ve always had an accent ... When the other kids make fun of you, you don&#x27;t want to get out of the house. So you stay at home, and what do you do? You take pencils and start drawing.&quot;

Aragonés used his drawing skills to assimilate. &quot;The earliest money I ever made was with drawings&quot;, he remembered. &quot;The teacher would give us homework, which would consist of copying Chapter Eleven, including the illustrations ... a beetle or a plant, the pistil of a flower, or soldiers – that type of thing. All the kids who couldn&#x27;t draw would leave a square where the drawing was, and I would charge them to draw that. The equivalent of a few pennies ... That&#x27;s probably why I draw so fast, because I drew so many of them.&quot;

He made his first professional sale in 1954 when a high school classmate submitted his work to a magazine without telling Aragonés. He continued to sell gag cartoons to magazines while studying architecture at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he learned pantomime under the direction of Alejandro Jodorowsky. &quot;I joined the class&quot;, Aragonés recalled, &quot;not to become a mime but to apply its physical aspects of movement to my comics.&quot; 

Aragonés taught Mexican Popular Art at the University of Mexico, and became engaged to one of his American students, Lilio Chomette. In 1962, Aragonés moved to the United States, where he married Chomette and settled with her in New York.

Art collector Jeff Singh spoke with Sergio at a convention and wrote. &quot;A friend told me that Sergio&#x27;s father was a film director/producer in Mexico. I asked about this and it is true. His father didn&#x27;t want the family on set for fear of actors and workers befriending the family in order to win favor with the father. Among the projects worked on, his father did work for the Irish McCalla TV series &quot;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&quot; which was filmed in Mexico (in 1955). On one of the rare occasions Sergio was on set the stuntman didn&#x27;t show up. Sergio had to put on the Sheena costume and did some stunts which I understand included swinging from a vine and diving into water. He was in his early teens at this time. He said they were pretty distant shots as despite the wig and costume he didn&#x27;t look at all like Irish. Irish was not on set that day and he lamented never having got to meet her.&quot;

==Arrival in the United States==
According to the artist, he arrived in New York in 1962 with nothing but 20 dollars and his portfolio of drawings. After working odd jobs around the city, Aragonés went to &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s offices on Third Avenue hoping to sell some of his cartoons. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I had anything that belonged in &quot;Mad,&quot;&quot; said Aragonés. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any satire. I didn&#x27;t have any articles. But everybody was telling me, &#x27;Oh, you should go to &quot;Mad&quot;.&quot;

Since his knowledge of English was not very extensive, he asked for the only &quot;Mad&quot; artist he knew of that spoke Spanish, Cuban-born artist Antonio Prohías, creator of the comic strip &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot;. Aragonés hoped Prohías could serve as an interpreter between him and the &quot;Mad&quot; editors. According to Aragonés, this proved to be a mistake, since Prohías knew even less English than he did. Prohías did receive Aragonés very enthusiastically and, with difficulty, introduced the young artist to the &quot;Mad&quot; editors as &quot;Sergio, my brother from Mexico,&quot; temporarily leading to even further confusion, as the &quot;Mad&quot; editors thought they were meeting &quot;Sergio Prohías.&quot; &quot;Mad&quot; editor Al Feldstein and publisher Bill Gaines liked what they saw, and Aragonés became a contributor to the magazine in 1963. His first sale was an assortment of astronaut cartoons which the editors arranged into a themed article. 

When associate editor Jerry DeFuccio encouraged Aragonés to submit more material in the future, the cartoonist took it to heart, producing a full article on motorcycle cops overnight. He returned to the &quot;Mad&quot; offices the following morning, and made his second sale. In 2022, Aragonés told an interviewer, &quot;I was back at the door before they opened. They were asking, &quot;What happened? What do you need?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I have your articles here.&quot; They couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had drawn close to 15 ideas and they loved it.&quot;

With little money and no connections in the United States, Aragonés spent so much time at the office that publisher Gaines allowed him to sleep there overnight. &quot;I don&#x27;t think any other company would have been so generous or friendly,&quot; Aragonés recalled 57 years later.

Aragonés worked continuously for &quot;Mad&quot; from 1963 to 2020, only stopping because the magazine transitioned into an almost-all-reprint format. His final new material appeared in an issue otherwise entirely filled with Aragonés reprints. It was the 491st issue to include new work by Aragonés, second only to Al Jaffee (509 issues). &quot;They told me, &#x27;Make &quot;Mad&quot; your home,&#x27;&quot; said Aragonés, &quot;and I took it literally.&quot;

==Marginals==
Aragonés has a featured section in every issue called &quot;A &quot;Mad&quot; Look At...&quot;, typically featuring 4–5 pages of speechless gag strips that are all related to a single subject, such as &quot;Gambling,&quot; &quot;UFOs&quot; or &quot;Pizza.&quot; Aragonés became famous for his wordless &quot;drawn-out dramas&quot; or &quot;marginals&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; marginalia) which were inserted into the margins and between panels of the magazine. The drawings are both horizontal and vertical, and occasionally extend around corners. Prior to Aragonés&#x27;s arrival at &quot;Mad&quot;, the magazine had sometimes filled its margins with text jokes under the catch-all heading &quot;Marginal Thinking.&quot; Aragonés convinced Feldstein to use his cartoons by creating a dummy sample issue with his Marginals drawn along the edges. The staff of &quot;Mad&quot; enjoyed his marginals, but did not expect him to be able to maintain the steady stream of small cartoons needed for each issue. Aragonés has provided marginals for every issue of &quot;Mad&quot; since 1963 except one (his contributions to that issue were lost by the Post Office). Associate Editor Jerry DeFuccio said, &quot;Writing the &#x27;Marginal Thinking&#x27; marginals had always been a pain in the butt. Sergio made the pain go away.&quot;

Aragonés is a very prolific artist; Al Jaffee once said, &quot;Sergio has, quite literally, drawn more cartoons on napkins in restaurants than most cartoonists draw in their entire careers.&quot; In 2002, writer Mark Evanier estimated that Aragonés had written and drawn more than 12,000 gag cartoons for &quot;Mad&quot; alone. His new marginal gags in the April 2024 &quot;Mad&quot; marked the 509th issue that Aragonés has contributed to, the most of any writer or artist. He passed Al Jaffee, whose work had appeared in 508 &quot;Mad&quot; issues between 1955 and 2020.

==Comic books==
In 1967, he began writing and illustrating full stories for various DC Comics titles, including &quot;The Adventures of Jerry Lewis&quot;, &quot;Angel and the Ape&quot;, &quot;Inferior Five&quot;, &quot;Young Romance&quot;, and for various horror anthologies. He wrote or plotted stories that were illustrated by other artists. Aragonés helped create DC&#x27;s Western series &quot;Bat Lash&quot; and the humor title &quot;Plop!&quot;. Aragonés broke with DC when the company began insisting on work-for-hire contracts; when Aragonés balked, an editor tore up Aragonés&#x27;s paycheck in front of his face. He&#x27;d been trying obliquely to sell a comic book premise to DC or Marvel, but neither company would allow Aragonés to retain the copyright. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want anyone stealing the idea&quot;, said Aragonés, &quot;and they weren&#x27;t able to talk on a theoretical basis.&quot;
Aragonés had created the humorous barbarian comic book &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; in the late 1970s, but the character did not appear in print until 1982. Groo was so named because Aragonés sought a name which meant nothing in any language. Writer Mark Evanier subsequently joined Aragonés on &quot;Groo.&quot; Evanier&#x27;s role originally was as something of a translator, as Aragonés was still somewhat shaky at expressing his ideas in English. Eventually, the two began collaborating on story ideas, and there have been several Groo stories in which Evanier is credited as the sole writer. Aragonés has since become fluent in English. The other regular contributors to the comic book are letterer Stan Sakai (himself the creator/artist of Usagi Yojimbo), and colorist Tom Luth. As a creator-owned series, &quot;Groo&quot; has survived the bankruptcy of a number of publishers, a fact which led to the industry joke that publishing the series was a precursor to a publisher&#x27;s demise. The title was initially published by Pacific Comics, briefly by Eclipse Comics, then Marvel Comics under their since-discontinued Epic Comics imprint which allowed creators to retain copyrights, then Image Comics, and currently Dark Horse Comics.

On 2 December 1982, Marty Feldman died from a heart attack in a hotel room in Mexico City. This occurred during the making of the film &quot;Yellowbeard&quot;. Aragonés, who was filming nearby and was dressed for his role as an armed policeman, had introduced himself to Feldman that night. He encountered Feldman abruptly, startling and frightening him, which may have induced Feldman&#x27;s heart attack. Aragonés has recounted the story with the punchline &quot;I killed Marty Feldman&quot;. The story was converted into a strip in Aragonés&#x27;s issue of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Solo&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Aragonés collaborated with the Belgian cartoonist François Walthéry on &quot;Natacha, l&#x27;hotesse de l&#x27;air&quot;, a well known series from the magazine &quot;Spirou&quot;. This story was titled &quot;Instantané pour Caltech&quot;. Aragonés appears in the strip as a police officer character ( / DUPUIS Editor – Belgium).

In April 2022, Aragonés was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Aragonés&#x27;s work can be found in other compilations, including &quot;The Big Book of the Weird, Wild West&quot;, in which he illustrates a retelling of the Donner Party incident. His cartoons have appeared in a series of paperback editions for &quot;Mad&quot;.

==Film and television==
In 1976, he had an acting role in the film &quot;Norman... Is That You?&quot; where he played one of the desk clerks at the &quot;Buenos Noches Hotel&quot;.

He appeared in the short-lived 1977 revival of TV&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In&quot;.

In addition to printed work, Aragonés has worked in television animation. He worked on the NBC program &quot;Speak Up America&quot; (1980) where he would draw during the show. His segments were used for many years on the Dick Clark &quot;Bloopers&quot; programs. Frequent collaborator Mark Evanier related an anecdote from their time on the short-lived 1983 NBC series &quot;The Half Hour Comedy Hour&quot;, which featured a guest appearance by model Jayne Kennedy:

This was one of the most beautiful women in the world, and she wore this dress that was very revealing. So much so, the censors wouldn&#x27;t let us put her on the air in it without adding some material. So we&#x27;re all talking to her, the writers and whoever, just in awe of this woman. And Sergio comes walking in looking like a homeless person, carrying his portfolio. And Jayne sees him and she shouts, &#x27;Sergio!&#x27; and she runs over and starts kissing him passionately. They&#x27;d worked together before, it turned out. But Johnny Carson comes walking out into the hallway and he thinks Jayne Kennedy is being sexually assaulted by a homeless person in the NBC hallways. He came over to make sure she was okay. She said it was fine, that she knew him, and I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s okay, he&#x27;s a cartoonist.&#x27; So Johnny gives that classic look and he says, &#x27;I knew I should have taken up drawing.&#x27;

Stan Lee interviewed Aragonés in the 1991 documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;.

In 2009, Aragonés told an interviewer, &quot;I&#x27;m thinking and laughing all day long. Every time I think of a joke, I&#x27;m also telling myself a new joke. It&#x27;s a great way to live.&quot;

He appeared as his own preserved head in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences&quot;, hosting the &quot;Last Actual Comic Book Booth&quot; at Comic Con 3010.

In 2020, Aragonés guest-starred in &quot;The Casagrandes&quot; episode &quot;Mexican Makeover&quot; voicing Lupe&#x27;s pet parrot and Sergio&#x27;s cousin Paco.

==Awards==

Aragonés&#x27;s work has won him numerous awards. He won Shazam Awards for Best Inker (Humor Division) in 1972 for his work on &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; and for Best Humor Story in 1972 for &quot;The Poster Plague&quot; from &quot;House of Mystery&quot; No. 202 with Steve Skeates. Aragonés received an Inkpot Award in 1976. He won the Harvey Award Special Award for Humor in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2001. He received the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1986, their Humor Comic Book Award for 1973, 1974, and 1976, their Magazine and Book Illustration Award for 1989, their Special Features Award for 1977, their Gag Cartoon Award for 1983, and their top Reuben Award in 1996 for his work on &quot;Mad&quot; and &quot;Groo the Wanderer.&quot; In 1985 he was awarded the Adamson Award for Best International Comic-Strip or Comic Book work in Sweden. In 1992 he became the first Mexican ever to win the Eisner Award for his work on &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;, along with Mark Evanier.

In 2009, an exhibition, &quot;Mad About Sergio&quot;, was held at the Ojai Valley Museum. Visitors saw examples of Aragonés&#x27;s cartooning dating back to childhood, publications he has appeared in, some of his awards, and Marginal-style sketches by Aragonés literally drawn onto the museum&#x27;s walls and display cases.

The Comic Art Professional Society award&#x27;s prize&#x27;s name is &quot;The Sergio&quot;, an homage to his work.

On 11 October 2024, the Harvey Awards announced that Aragonés was one of five comics creators to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame at the 36th annual Harvey Awards ceremony on 18 October at the New York Comic Con. The other four inductees were Arthur Adams, Larry Hama, Akira Toriyama, and John Buscema. Upon learning of the accolade, Aragonés commented, &quot;What an honor it is to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame. Harvey was a great inspiration to me and so many other cartoonists.&quot;

<doc id="29678" wikidata="Q601401" url="?curid=29678" title="Trade">
<text>Trade involves the transfer of goods and services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.

Traders generally negotiate through a medium of credit or exchange, such as money. Though some economists characterize barter (i.e. trading things without the use of money) as an early form of trade, money was invented before written history began. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is mostly based on conjecture and logical inference. Letters of credit, paper money, and non-physical money have greatly simplified and promoted trade as buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. 

In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trade for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able goodsincluding the production of scarce or limited natural resources elsewhere. For example, different regions&#x27; sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trading at market price between locations can benefit both locations. Different types of traders may specialize in trading different kinds of goods; for example, the spice trade and grain trade have both historically been important in the development of a global, international economy.

Retail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique, or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is the traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.

Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onward (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Trade&quot; is from Middle English &quot;trade&quot; (&quot;path, course of conduct&quot;), introduced into English by Hanseatic merchants, from Middle Low German &quot;trade&quot; (&quot;track, course&quot;), from Old Saxon &quot;trada&quot; (&quot;spoor, track&quot;), from Proto-Germanic &quot;*tradō&quot; (&quot;track, way&quot;), and cognate with Old English &quot;tredan&quot; (&quot;to tread&quot;).

&quot;Commerce&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;commercium&quot;, from &quot;cum&quot; &quot;together&quot; and &quot;merx&quot;, &quot;merchandise.&quot;

==History==
===Prehistory===
Trade originated from human communication in prehistoric times. Prehistoric peoples exchanged goods and services with each other in a gift economy before the innovation of modern-day currency. Peter Watson dates the history of long-distance commerce to years ago.

In the Mediterranean region, the earliest contact between cultures involved members of the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, principally using the Danube river, at a time beginning 35,000–30,000 BP.
There is evidence of the exchange of obsidian and flint during the Stone Age. Trade in obsidian is believed to have taken place in New Guinea from 17,000 BCE.
Robert Carr Bosanquet investigated trade in the Stone Age by excavations in 1901. The first clear archaeological evidence of trade in manufactured goods is found in south west Asia.

Archaeological evidence of obsidian use provides data on how this material was increasingly the preferred choice rather than chert from the late Mesolithic to Neolithic, requiring exchange as deposits of obsidian are rare in the Mediterranean region.

Obsidian provided the material to make cutting utensils or tools, although since other more easily obtainable materials were available, use was exclusive to the higher status of the tribe using &quot;the rich man&#x27;s flint&quot;. Obsidian has held its value relative to flint.

Early traders traded Obsidian at distances of 900 kilometres within the Mediterranean region.

Trade in the Mediterranean during the Neolithic of Europe was greatest in this material. Networks were in existence at around 12,000 BCE Anatolia was the source primarily for trade with the Levant, Iran and Egypt according to Zarins study of 1990. Melos and Lipari sources produced among the most widespread trading in the Mediterranean region as known to archaeology.

The Sari-i-Sang mine in the mountains of Afghanistan was the largest source for trade of lapis lazuli. The material was most largely traded during the Kassite period of Babylonia beginning 1595 BCE.

Adam Smith traces the origins of commerce to the very start of transactions in prehistoric times. Apart from traditional self-sufficiency, trading became a principal faculty for prehistoric people, who bartered what they had for goods and services from each other. Anthropologists have found no evidence of barter systems that did not exist alongside systems of credit.

===Ancient History===

====Mediterranean and Near East====
The earliest evidence of writing is deeply bound up in trade, as a system of clay tokens used for accounting – found in Upper Euphrates valley in Syria dated to the 10th millennium BCE – is one of the earliest versions of writing. 

Ebla was a prominent trading center during the third millennia BCE, with a network reaching into Anatolia and north Mesopotamia.

Materials used for creating jewelry were traded with Egypt since 3000 BCE. Long-range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BCE, when Sumerians in Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. The Phoenicians were noted sea traders, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, and as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. For this purpose they established trade colonies the Greeks called emporia. Along the coast of the Mediterranean, researchers have found a positive relationship between how well-connected a coastal location was and the local prevalence of archaeological sites from the Iron Age. This suggests that a location&#x27;s trade potential was an important determinant of human settlements.

The complaint tablet to Ea-nāṣir, dated 1750 BCE, documents the tribulations of a copper merchant at the time.

From the beginning of Greek civilization until the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, a financially lucrative trade brought valuable spice to Europe from the far east, including India and China. Roman commerce allowed its empire to flourish and endure. The latter Roman Republic and the Pax Romana of the Roman empire produced a stable and secure transportation network that enabled the shipment of trade goods without fear of significant piracy, as Rome had become the sole effective sea power in the Mediterranean with the conquest of Egypt and the near east.

In ancient Greece Hermes was the god of trade (commerce) and weights and measures. In ancient Rome, &quot;Mercurius&quot; was the god of merchants, whose festival was celebrated by traders on the 25th day of the fifth month. The concept of free trade was an antithesis to the will and economic direction of the sovereigns of the ancient Greek states. Free trade between states was stifled by the need for strict internal controls (via taxation) to maintain security within the treasury of the sovereign, which nevertheless enabled the maintenance of a &quot;&quot; of civility within the structures of functional community life.

The fall of the Roman empire and the succeeding Dark Ages brought instability to Western Europe and a near-collapse of the trade network in the western world. Trade, however, continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China, and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in the west. For instance, Radhanites were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of Jewish merchants who traded between the Christians in Europe and the Muslims of the Near East.

====Indo-Pacific====

The first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. Initiated by the indigenous peoples of Taiwan and the Philippines, the Maritime Jade Road was an extensive trading network connecting multiple areas in Southeast and East Asia. Its primary products were made of jade mined from Taiwan by Taiwanese indigenous peoples and processed mostly in the Philippines by indigenous Filipinos, especially in Batanes, Luzon, and Palawan. Some were also processed in Vietnam, while the peoples of Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia also participated in the massive trading network. The maritime road is one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for at least 3,000 years, where its peak production was from 2000 BCE to 500 CE, older than the Silk Road in mainland Eurasia and the later Maritime Silk Road. The Maritime Jade Road began to wane during its final centuries from 500 CE until 1000 CE. The entire period of the network was a golden age for the diverse societies of the region.

Sea-faring Southeast Asians also established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500 BC, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, sewn-plank boats, and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and sugarcane); as well as connecting the material cultures of India and China. Indonesians, in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued up to historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road.
==== Mesoamerica ====
The emergence of exchange networks in the Pre-Columbian societies of and near to Mexico are known to have occurred within recent years before and after 1500 BCE.

Trade networks reached north to Oasisamerica. There is evidence of established maritime trade with the cultures of northwestern South America and the Caribbean.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the Middle Ages, commerce developed in Europe by trading luxury goods at trade fairs. Wealth became converted into movable wealth or capital. Banking systems developed where money on account was transferred across national boundaries. Hand to hand markets became a feature of town life and were regulated by town authorities.

Western Europe established a complex and expansive trade network with cargo ships being the main carrier of goods; Cogs and Hulks are two examples of such cargo ships. Many ports would develop their own extensive trade networks. The English port city of Bristol traded with peoples from what is modern day Iceland, all along the western coast of France, and down to what is now Spain.

During the Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world. The Sogdians dominated the east–west trade route known as the Silk Road after the 4th century CE up to the 8th century CE, with Suyab and Talas ranking among their main centers in the north. They were the main caravan merchants of Central Asia.

From the Middle Ages, the maritime republics, in particular Venice, Pisa and Genoa, played a key role in trade along the Mediterranean. From the 11th to the late 15th centuries, the Venetian Republic and the Republic of Genoa were major trade centers. They dominated trade in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, having the monopoly between Europe and the Near East for centuries.

From the 8th to the 11th century, the Vikings and Varangians traded as they sailed from and to Scandinavia. Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to Kyivan Rus&#x27;. The Hanseatic League was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade monopoly over most of Northern Europe and the Baltic, between the 13th and 17th centuries.

===The Age of Sail and the Industrial Revolution===
Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama pioneered the European spice trade in 1498 when he reached Calicut after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the Age of Discovery in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling gold.

From 1070 onward, kingdoms in West Africa became significant members of global trade. This came initially through the movement of gold and other resources sent out by Muslim traders on the Trans-Saharan trading network. Beginning in the 16th century, European merchants would purchase gold, spices, cloth, timber and slaves from West African states as part of the triangular trade. This was often in exchange for cloth, iron, or cowrie shells which were used locally as currency.

Founded in 1352, the Bengal Sultanate was a major trading nation in the world and often referred to by Europeans as the wealthiest country with which to trade.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Portuguese gained an economic advantage in the Kingdom of Kongo due to different philosophies of trade. Whereas Portuguese traders concentrated on the accumulation of capital, in Kongo spiritual meaning was attached to many objects of trade. According to economic historian Toby Green, in Kongo &quot;giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power and privilege.&quot;

In the 16th century, the Seventeen Provinces were the center of free trade, imposing no exchange controls, and advocating the free movement of goods. Trade in the East Indies was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the Dutch Republic in the 17th century, and the British in the 18th century. The Spanish Empire developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.

In 1776, Adam Smith published the paper &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot;. It criticized Mercantilism, and argued that economic specialization could benefit nations just as much as firms. Since the division of labour was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more productive. Smith said that he considered all rationalizations of import and export controls &quot;dupery&quot;, which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.

In 1799, the Dutch East India Company, formerly the world&#x27;s largest company, became bankrupt, partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.
=== 19th century ===
In 1817, David Ricardo, James Mill and Robert Torrens showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of comparative advantage. In Principles of Political Economy and Taxation Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in economics:
: &quot;When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.&quot;

The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country&#x27;s self-interest to open its borders to imports.

John Stuart Mill proved that a country with monopoly pricing power on the international market could manipulate the terms of trade through maintaining tariffs, and that the response to this might be reciprocity in trade policy. Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier. This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the economic surplus of trade would accrue to a country following &quot;reciprocal&quot;, rather than completely free, trade policies. This was followed within a few years by the infant industry scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that the government had the duty to protect young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to industrialize and out-compete English exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.

===20th century===
The Great Depression was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s. During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.

The lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation. Only during World War II did the recession end in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement, intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions. It set up rules and institutions to regulate the international political economy: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank $ Bank for International Settlements). These organizations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement. In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to promote free trade.

The European Union became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, the biggest export market for around 80 countries.

===21st century===
Today, trade is merely a subset within a complex system of companies which try to maximize their profits by offering products and services to the market (which consists both of individuals and other companies) at the lowest production cost. A system of international trade has helped to develop the world economy but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower tariffs or to achieve free trade, has sometimes harmed third-world markets for local products.

===Free trade===
Free trade is a policy by which a government does not discriminate against imports or exports by applying tariffs or subsidies. This policy is also known as laissez-faire policy. This kind of policy does not necessarily imply a country will then abandon all control and taxation of imports and exports.

Free trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s:
* 1992 European Union lifted barriers to internal trade in goods and labour.
* January 1, 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect.
* 1994 The GATT Marrakech Agreement specified formation of the WTO.
* January 1, 1995 World Trade Organization was created to facilitate free trade, by mandating mutual most favored nation trading status between all signatories.
* EC was transformed into the European Union, which accomplished the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2002, through introducing the Euro, and creating this way a real single market between 13 member states as of January 1, 2007.
* 2005, the Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed; It includes the United States and the Dominican Republic.

== Perspectives ==

===Protectionism===

Protectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade. This policy often takes the form of tariffs and restrictive quotas. Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the Great Depression and the onset of World War II.

===Religion===
Islamic teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest).

Judeao-Christian teachings do not prohibit trade. They do prohibit fraud and dishonest measures. Historically they forbade charging interest on loans.

===Development of money===

The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called commodity money and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale&#x27;s teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used as an early form of money. In the Aztec Empire, under the rule of Montezuma cocoa beans became legitimate currency.

Currency was introduced as standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services. This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.

Numismatists have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of precious metal.

==Trends==

===Doha rounds===
The Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower barriers to trade around the world, with a focus on making trade more fair for developing countries. Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich developed countries, represented by the G20, and the major developing countries. Agricultural subsidies are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been the hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on trade facilitation and capacity building. The Doha round began in Doha, Qatar, and negotiations were continued in: Cancún, Mexico; Geneva, Switzerland; and Paris, France, and Hong Kong.

===China===
Beginning around 1978, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) began an experiment in economic reform. In contrast to the previous Soviet-style centrally planned economy, the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, which led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) Special Economic Zones located along the South-east coast.

The reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, price and demand. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China&#x27;s two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.

In 1991 China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization.

==International trade==

International trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders. In most countries, it represents a significant part of GDP. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, Amber Road), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of Industrialization, advanced transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing.

Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as South Korea, which adopted a policy of export-oriented industrialization, and India, which historically had a more closed policy. South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.

===Trade sanctions===
Trade sanctions against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action. An embargo, a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an embargo against Cuba for over 60 years. Embargoes are usually on a temporary basis. For example, Armenia put a temporary embargo on Turkish products and bans any imports from Turkey on December 31, 2020. The situation is prompted by food security concerns given Turkey&#x27;s hostile attitude towards Armenia.

===Fair trade===
The &quot;fair trade&quot; movement, also known as the &quot;trade justice&quot; movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of goods, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.

Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements. As such, it is a form of Protectionism.

<text>The tambourine is a musical instrument in the percussion family consisting of a frame, often of wood or plastic, with pairs of small metal jingles, called &quot;zills&quot;. Classically the term tambourine denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a head. Tambourines are often used with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, for example on a stand as part of a drum kit (and played with drum sticks), or they can be held in the hand and played by tapping, hitting, or shaking the instrument.

Tambourines come in many shapes with the most common being circular. It is found in many forms of music: Albanian folk music, Arabic folk music, Israeli folk music, Turkish folk music, Greek folk music, Italian folk music, French folk music, classical music, Galician traditional music, Asturian traditional music, Persian music, samba, gospel music, pop music, country music, and rock music.

==History==
The origin of the tambourine is unknown, but it appears in historical writings as early as 1700 BC and was used by ancient musicians first in Ancient Egypt, the Ancient Near East and eventually to Greece and other places. The tambourine passed to Europe by way of merchants or musicians. Tambourines were used in ancient Egypt, where they were known as the tof to the Hebrews, who mainly used the instrument in religious contexts. The word &quot;tambourine&quot; finds its origins in French &quot;tambourin&quot;, which referred to a long narrow drum used in Provence, the word being a diminutive of &quot;tambour&quot; &quot;drum,&quot; altered by influence of Arabic &quot;tunbur&quot; &quot;drum&quot;. from the Middle Persian word &quot;tambūr&quot; &quot;lute, drum&quot;.

==Playing==
The tambourine can be held in the hand or mounted on a stand, and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with the hand or a stick or using the tambourine to strike the leg or hip.

===Tambourine rolls===
There are several ways to achieve a tambourine roll. The easiest method is to rapidly rotate the hand holding the tambourine back and forth, pivoting at the wrist.

====Thumb roll====

An advanced playing technique is known as the thumb or finger roll. The middle finger or thumb is moved over the skin or rim of the tambourine, producing a fast roll from the jingles on the instrument. The thumb or middle finger of the hand not holding the tambourine is run around the head of the instrument approximately one centimeter from the rim with some pressure applied. If performed correctly, the finger should bounce along the head rapidly, producing the roll. Usually, the end of the roll is articulated using the heel of the hand or another finger. Beeswax or rosin is commonly smeared around the edges of the head to assist in the technique. These materials increase friction making it easier to execute. A continuous roll can be achieved by moving the thumb in a &quot;figure of 8&quot; pattern around the head.

==Popular music==
===Europe===
Various European folk traditions include the tambourine. The Romani people used the tambourine as a percussion instrument, and it was often passed around the audience to collect money after a performance. In the late 1700s, the tambourine had a surge in popularity in England, with some composers of salon music writing parts for tambourine, indicating as many as 30 different playing strokes or moves. The tambourines of this era often had a circular hole in the frame for the thumb, as one of the moves was to spin the tambourine on the upright thumb. In the late 19th century, The Salvation Army codified the tambourine as one of their important rhythm instruments. They preferred the term &quot;timbrel&quot; which was taken from the Bible. By 1945, Salvation Army performances often entailed elaborate tambourine choreography performed by squads in para-military style, more for visual appeal than for musicality.

===African American influence===

African American slaves were denied drums which might be used for long-distance communication. To supply rhythm in music, they turned to smaller percussion instruments such as the bones and the tambourine, as well as clapping and body percussion. The tambourine could accompany the singing of spirituals, and it was used for celebrations and dancing. The tambourine became one of the main instruments of the American minstrel show in the early 1800s, often performed by whites in blackface such as Ned Christy, or sometimes by actual black performers. On stage, the tambourine and bones players in minstrelsy stood to the far left and far right of the Interlocutor (master of ceremonies) and were titled Brother Tambo and Brother Bones: because of their position they were called the end men. The tambourine was also used in some vaudeville acts, including the 1840s dance and musical performances of Master Juba who was able to elicit a wide range of sounds from the instrument including the chugging of a steam train. Used for Pentecostal praise in revival meetings in the early 20th century, by the 1920s the tambourine was firmly established as the primary percussion instrument of gospel music. The tambourine was played by gospel groups and choirs, and carried prominently by singers who did not otherwise play an instrument, notably by Bessie Jones and Luther Magby.

At the same time, the tambourine expanded from gospel music to various forms of African American popular music including blues and jazz. For instance, singer and guitarist Blind Roosevelt Graves was accompanied by his brother Uaroy on tambourine and voice, singing both sacred and secular songs. Singer-songwriter Josh White got his start as a child performing for handouts in the street with an exuberant tambourine performance, beating the instrument&#x27;s drumhead on his elbows, knees, and head.

In the 1950s as gospel elements were incorporated into rhythm and blues by African American singers such as Ray Charles, the tambourine often accompanied the changes. It continued its foray into popular music within the music of Motown. Motown singers and musicians often grew up with gospel music, and they carried the tambourine into pop performance. The Supremes performed with two tambourines – more for choreography than percussion – played by Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson standing apart from Diana Ross. Jack Ashford&#x27;s distinctive tambourine playing was a dominant part of the rhythm section on many Motown records, for instance on the Miracles tune &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;.
Inspired by African American examples, musicians of all races have used the tambourine in modern pop music. It was featured in &quot;Green Tambourine&quot;, a busking-oriented song from the Lemon Pipers, a 1960s white American band. Similarly, the Byrds released a hit version of &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; in 1965, a folk rock and psychedelic rock recording of a song written by Bob Dylan. The tambourine part of the song serves to drive the beat forward.

Singers who rarely play an instrument are likely to play the tambourine at concerts: among the most well-known examples are Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison of the Doors, Janis Joplin leading Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Stevie Nicks as part of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo performer. Very often, the instrument used in pop music is the headless tambourine or &quot;jingle ring&quot;, lacking a drum head. The singer should, however, play the tambourine with the overall song arrangement in mind; in some cases, band members have purposely hidden the tambourine from an irresponsible lead singer who disregards the interplay of rhythm. On the other hand, skilled performers such as Jagger have brought a fine sense of timing to their tambourine playing. In the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1964 U.S. single of &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot;, the less-known version, Jagger lays the tambourine on the front of the beat while Charlie Watts holds the snare to the back of the beat, which allows the longer decay time of the tambourine to synchronise with the snare at the end. The result is an intentional feeling of running to catch up.

In jazz, the tambourine was used prominently but non-traditionally by percussionist Joe Texidor who backed Rahsaan Roland Kirk in 1969 on &quot;Volunteered Slavery&quot;. In 1960 when Nina Simone wanted to play the old minstrel song &quot;Li&#x27;l Liza Jane&quot; at the Newport Jazz Festival, she said &quot;Where&#x27;s my tambourine?&quot;, as heard on the album &quot;Nina Simone at Newport&quot;. Jazz drummer Herlin Riley often takes the stage while beating and shaking a tambourine, and he is featured on the tambourine in Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s jazz oratorio &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot;, which tells the story of slavery in the US.

Jazz, pop and rock drummers sometimes mount a headless tambourine in the drum kit. Some position the tambourine above the toms in the same manner as a cymbal, for instance, Nathan Followill of Kings of Leon, and Larry Mullen Jr of U2. Bill Ward of Black Sabbath connected a tambourine to a foot pedal, for his left foot to operate like a hi-hat. John Bonham of Led Zeppelin simply mounted a tambourine above the hi-hat for extra sonic colour. The Subdudes, a roots rock group from New Orleans, opted for a tambourine player, Steve Amedée, instead of a drummer.

==In classical music==

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was among the earliest western composers to include the tambourine in his compositions. Since the late eighteenth century it has become more common in western orchestral music, as exemplified in some of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s dance pieces from the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;. Gustav Holst&#x27;s seven-movement orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot; also features the tambourine in several places, especially in the &quot;Jupiter&quot; movement. Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; opera includes the famous &quot;Habanera&quot; aria which has a series of tambourine strikes in each chorus.

<text>Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent&#x27;s court. The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. If a player is unable to return the ball successfully, the opponent scores a point.

Playable at all levels of society and at all ages, tennis can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages. The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis. It had close connections to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.

The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.

Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the majors) are especially popular and are considered the highest level of competition for the sport. These tournaments are the Australian Open, played on hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay courts; Wimbledon, played on grass courts; and the US Open, also played on hardcourts. Additionally, tennis was one of the original Olympic sports, and has been consistently competed in the Summer Olympic Games since 1988.
== History ==
=== Predecessors ===
Historians believe that the game&#x27;s ancient origin lay in 12th-century northern France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. Louis X of France was a keen player of &quot;jeu de paume&quot; (&quot;game of the palm&quot;), which evolved into real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris &quot;around the end of the 13th century&quot;. In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. In June 1316 at Vincennes, Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there was also suspicion of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history&#x27;s first tennis player known by name. Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.

It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called &quot;tennis&quot;, from the French term &quot;tenez&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;hold!&quot;, &quot;receive!&quot; or &quot;take!&quot;, an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. Henry VIII of England was a big fan of this game, which is now known as real tennis.

An epitaph in St Michael&#x27;s Church, Coventry, written , read, in part:

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, as real tennis declined, new racket sports emerged in England.

The invention of the first lawn mower in Britain in 1830 is believed to have been a catalyst for the preparation of modern-style grass courts, sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches, greens, etc. This in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports, including lawn tennis, most football codes, lawn bowls and others.

=== Origins of the modern game ===

Between 1859 and 1865, Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera&#x27;s croquet lawn in Birmingham, England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world&#x27;s first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa. This is where &quot;lawn tennis&quot; was used as the name of an activity by a club for the first time.

In &quot;Tennis: A Cultural History&quot;, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on 8 December 1874, British army officer Walter Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis &quot;for a year and a half&quot;. In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called &quot;sphairistikè&quot; (, meaning &quot;ball-playing&quot;), and which was soon known simply as &quot;sticky&quot; – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend&#x27;s estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, Wales. According to Evans, turfgrass agronomist, &quot;Sports historians all agree that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis.&quot; According to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield &quot;popularized this game enormously. He produced a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game – and most importantly you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. He had very good connections with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874.&quot; The world&#x27;s oldest annual tennis tournament took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877. The first Championships culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules.

In the United States in 1874, Mary Ewing Outerbridge, a young socialite, returned from Bermuda with a &quot;sphairistikè&quot; set. She became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching British army officers play. She laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club at Camp Washington, Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York. The first American National championship was played there in September 1880. An Englishman named O.E. Woodhouse won the singles title, and a silver cup worth $100, by defeating Canadian I. F. Hellmuth. There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in New York.

On 21 May 1881, the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The US National Men&#x27;s Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island. The US National Women&#x27;s Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.

Tennis also became popular in France, where the French Championships date to 1891, although until 1925 they were open only to tennis players who were members of French clubs. Thus, Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open (dating to 1905) became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis. Together, these four events are called the Majors or &quot;Slams&quot; (a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball).

In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), now the International Tennis Federation (ITF), was founded and established three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. The World Grass Court Championships were awarded to Great Britain. The World Hard Court Championships were awarded to France; the term &quot;hard court&quot; was used for clay courts at the time. Some tournaments were held in Belgium instead. And the World Covered Court Championships for indoor courts were awarded annually; Sweden, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain each hosted the tournament. At a meeting held on 16 March 1923 in Paris, the title &quot;World Championship&quot; was dropped and a new category of &quot;Official Championship&quot; was created for events in Great Britain, France, the US and Australia – today&#x27;s Grand Slam events. The impact on the four recipient nations to replace the &quot;world championships&quot; with &quot;official championships&quot; was simple in a general sense: each became a major nation of the federation with enhanced voting power, and each now operated a major event.

The comprehensive rules promulgated in 1924 by the ILTF have remained largely stable in the ensuing 80 years, the one major change being the addition of the &quot;tiebreak&quot; system designed by Jimmy Van Alen. That same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games, but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts of then ITF president Philippe Chatrier, ITF general secretary David Gray and ITF vice president Pablo Llorens, with support from International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming, and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full-medal sport at Seoul in 1988.

The Davis Cup, an annual competition between men&#x27;s national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women&#x27;s national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the ITF.

In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Players &quot;turned pro&quot; would no longer be permitted to compete in the major (amateur) tournaments.

In 1968, commercial pressures and rumours of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the Open Era, in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis. With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis&#x27;s popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its middle-class English-speaking image (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists).

In 1954, Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, a nonprofit museum in Newport, Rhode Island. The building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world.

== Equipment ==

Part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. Beginners need only a racket and balls.

=== Rackets ===
The components of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.

Under modern rules of tennis, the rackets must adhere to the following guidelines;

* The hitting area, composed of the strings, must be flat and generally uniform.
* The frame of the hitting area may not be more than in length and in width.
* The entire racket must be of a fixed shape, size, weight, and weight distribution. There may not be any energy source built into the rackets.
* The rackets must not provide any kind of communication, instruction or advice to the player during the match.

The rules regarding rackets have changed over time, as material and engineering advances have been made. For example, the maximum length of the frame had been until 1997, when it was shortened to .

Many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. Wilson, Head and Babolat are three of the most commonly used brands; however, many more companies exist. The same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become better known by the public.

=== Strings ===

There are multiple types of tennis strings, including natural gut and synthetic stings made from materials such as nylon, kevlar, or polyester.

==== Natural gut ====
The first type of tennis strings available were natural gut strings, introduced by Babolat. They were the only type used until synthetic strings were introduced in the 1950s. Natural gut strings are still used frequently by players such as Roger Federer. They are made from cow intestines, and provide increased power, and are easier on the arm than most strings.

==== Synthetic ====
Most synthetic strings are made from monofilament or multifiliament nylon strings. Monofilament strings are cheap to buy, and are used widely by many recreational level players for their all round performance, while multifilament strings are created to mimic natural gut more closely by weaving together fibres, but are generally more expensive than their monofilament counterparts. Polyester strings allow for more spin on the ball than any other string, due to their firm strings, while keeping control of the ball, and this is why many players use them, especially higher player ones. Kevlar tennis strings are highly durable, and are mostly used by players that frequently break strings, because they maintain tension well, but these strings can be stiff on the arm.

==== Hybrid strings ====
Hybrid stringing is when a tennis racket is strung with two different strings for the mains (the vertical strings) and the crosses (the horizontal strings). This is most commonly done with two different strings that are made of different materials, but can also be done with two different types of the same string. A notable example of a player using hybrid strings is Roger Federer, using natural gut strings in his mains and polyester strings in his crosses.

=== Balls ===

Tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. Modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. Traditionally white, the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the 20th century to allow for improved visibility. Tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size, weight, deformation, and bounce to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as . Balls must weigh between . Tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the United States and Europe. Although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past 100 years, the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the Far East. The relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region. Tournaments that are played under the ITF Rules of Tennis must use balls that are approved by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and be named on the official ITF list of approved tennis balls.

== Manner of play ==

=== Court ===
Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and wide for singles matches and for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than . The net is high at the posts and high in the centre. The net posts are outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, outside the singles court on each side.

The modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield. In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield&#x27;s version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle.

Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. Grass, clay, and hard courts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found.

==== Lines ====
The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of a player&#x27;s side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.

The line dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player&#x27;s position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others.

=== Play of a single point ===
The players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the &quot;server&quot;, and the opposing player is the &quot;receiver&quot;. The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game between the two players or teams. For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the centre mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.

For a service to be legal, the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a &quot;let&quot; or &quot;net service&quot;, which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a &quot;foot fault&quot; when a player&#x27;s foot touches the baseline or an extension of the centre mark before the ball is hit. If the second service, after a fault, is also a fault, the server &quot;double faults&quot;, and the receiver wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service.

A legal service starts a &quot;rally&quot;, in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server&#x27;s court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel over or round the net into the other players&#x27; court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.

=== Scoring ===

==== Game, set, match ====
===== Game =====
A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as &quot;love&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;30&quot;, and &quot;40&quot;, respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player&#x27;s scores equal at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as &quot;40–40&quot;, but rather as &quot;deuce&quot;. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is &quot;advantage&quot; for the player in the lead. During informal games, advantage can also be called &quot;ad in&quot; or &quot;van in&quot; when the serving player is ahead, and &quot;ad out&quot; or &quot;van out&quot; when the receiving player is ahead; alternatively, either player may simply call out &quot;my ad&quot; or &quot;your ad&quot;.

The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player&#x27;s score first. In tournament play, the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., &quot;15–love&quot;) after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.

===== Set =====
A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6) a &quot;tiebreak&quot; is played. A tiebreak, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. A tiebreak game can be won by scoring at least seven points and at least two points more than the opponent. In a tiebreak, two players serve by &#x27;ABBA&#x27; system which has been proven to be fair. If a tiebreak is not played, the set is referred to as an &quot;advantage set&quot;, where the set continues without limit until one player leads by a two-game margin. A &quot;love set&quot; means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a &quot;jam donut&quot; in the US. In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player&#x27;s score first, e.g. &quot;6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5&quot;.

===== Match =====
A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five &quot;sets&quot; system. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match. Only in the final sets of matches at the Olympic Games and Fed Cup are tiebreaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches.

In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase &quot;Game, set, match&quot; followed by the winning person&#x27;s or team&#x27;s name.

==== Special point terms ====
===== Game point =====
A &quot;game point&quot; occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40–love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.

===== Break point =====
A &quot;break point&quot; occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love–40) consecutive chances to win the game has &quot;break point&quot;, &quot;double break point&quot; or &quot;triple break point&quot;, respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have &quot;converted&quot; their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a &quot;failure to convert.&quot; Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as &quot;breaking serve&quot;, as the receiver has disrupted, or &quot;broken&quot; the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as &quot;breaking back&quot;. Except where tiebreaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set (otherwise a two-game lead would never occur).

=== Rule variations ===
* No ad
: From &#x27;No advantage&#x27;. Scoring method created by Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.

* Pro set
: Instead of playing multiple sets, players may play one &quot;pro set&quot;. A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tiebreak is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring.

* Match tiebreak
: This is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tiebreak (also called &quot;super tiebreak&quot;) is played like a regular tiebreak, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tiebreaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player&#x27;s choice in USTA league play.

* Fast4
: Fast4 is a shortened format that offers a &quot;fast&quot; alternative, with four points, four games and four rules: there are no advantage scores, lets are played, tiebreakers apply at three games all, with it being first to five points with a &quot;sudden death&quot; point at four points all, and the first to four games wins the set. In the event of a no advantage deuce, the receiver gets to choose the service side. If a let occurs, the point continues as normal, and the non-receiver (in a doubles game) is permitted to return the serve. When players swap sides, they are not permitted to sit down and must be ready to play within sixty seconds. Between sets, players are permitted to sit down, and must be ready to play within ninety seconds.

Another, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles. This involves three players, with one person playing against a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as for a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.

&quot;Australian doubles&quot;, another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game, each player taking a turn at playing alone against the other two. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.

Wheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted. This rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and able-bodied matches. It is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an able-bodied player (referred to as &quot;one-up, one-down&quot;), or for a wheelchair player to play against an able-bodied player. In such cases, the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only.

== Match play ==
=== Continuity ===
A tennis match is intended to be continuous. Because stamina is a relevant factor, arbitrary delays are not permitted. In most cases, service is required to occur no more than 20 seconds after the end of the previous point. This is increased to 90 seconds when the players change ends (after every odd-numbered game), and a 2-minute break is permitted between sets. Other than this, breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players&#x27; control, such as rain, damaged footwear, damaged racket, or the need to retrieve an errant ball. Should a player be deemed to be stalling repeatedly, the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of &quot;point&quot;, &quot;game&quot;, and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.

In the event of a rain delay, darkness or other external conditions halting play, the match is resumed at a later time, with the same score as at the time of the delay, and each player at the same end of the court as when rain halted play, or as close to the same relative compass point if play is resumed on a different court.

=== Ball changes ===
Balls wear out quickly in serious play and, therefore, in ATP and WTA tournaments, they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games, because the first set of balls is also used for the pre-match warm-up. In ITF tournaments like Fed Cup, the balls are changed after every eleven games (rather than nine) with the first change occurring after only nine games (instead of seven). An exception is that a ball change may not take place at the beginning of a tiebreaker, in which case the ball change is delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set. As a courtesy to the receiver, the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. Continuity of the balls&#x27; condition is considered part of the game, so if a re-warm-up is required after an extended break in play (usually due to rain), then the re-warm-up is done using a separate set of balls, and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.

=== On-court coaching ===
A recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match. This has been introduced in women&#x27;s tennis for WTA Tour events in 2009 and allows the player to request her coach once per set.

== Stance ==
Stance refers to the way a player prepares themselves in order to best be able to return a shot. Essentially, it enables them to move quickly in order to achieve a particular stroke. There are four main stances in modern tennis: open, semi-open, closed, and neutral. All four stances involve the player crouching in some manner: as well as being a more efficient striking posture, it allows them to isometrically preload their muscles in order to play the stroke more dynamically. What stance is selected is strongly influenced by shot selection. A player may quickly alter their stance depending on the circumstances and the type of shot they intend to play. Any given stance also alters dramatically based upon the actual playing of the shot with dynamic movements and shifts of body weight occurring.

=== Open stance ===
This is the most common stance in tennis. The player&#x27;s feet are placed parallel to the net. They may be pointing sideways, directly at the net or diagonally towards it. This stance allows for a high degree of torso rotation which can add significant power to the stroke. This process is sometimes likened to the coiling and uncoiling of a spring. i.e. the torso is rotated as a means of preloading the muscular system in preparation for playing the stroke: this is the coiling phase. When the stroke is played the torso rotates to face forwards again, called uncoiling, and adds significant power to the stroke. A disadvantage of this stance is that it does not always allow &#x27;for proper weight transfer and maintenance of balance&#x27; when making powerful strokes. It is commonly used for forehand strokes; double-handed backhands can also be made effectively from it.

=== Semi-open stance ===
This stance is somewhere between open and closed and is a very flexible stance. The feet are aligned diagonally towards the net. It allows for a lot of shoulder rotation and the torso can be coiled, before being uncoiled into the shot in order to increase the power of the shot. It is commonly used in modern tennis especially by &#x27;top professional players on the forehand&#x27;. Two-handed backhands can also be employed from this stance.

=== Closed stance ===
The closed stance is the least commonly used of the three main stances. One foot is placed further towards the net with the other foot further from it; there is a diagonal alignment between the feet. It allows for effective torso rotation in order to increase the power of the shot. It is usually used to play backhand shots and it is rare to see forehand shots played from it. A stroke from this stance may entail the rear foot coming completely off the floor with bodyweight being transferred entirely to the front foot.
=== Neutral stance ===
This is sometimes also referred to as the square stance. One foot is positioned closer to the net and ahead of the other which is behind and in line with it. Both feet are aligned at a 90 degree angle to the net. The neutral stance is often taught early because &#x27;It allows beginners to learn about shifting weight and rotation of the body.&#x27; Forehands and backhands may be made from it.

== Shots ==

Competent tennis players have eight basic shots in their repertoire: the serve, forehand, backhand, volley, half-volley, overhead smash, drop shot, and lob.

=== Grip ===

A grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. The grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace, spin, and placement of the shot. Players use various grips during play, including the Continental (The &quot;Handshake Grip&quot;), Eastern (either semi-eastern or full eastern, usually used for backhands), and Western (semi-western or full western, usually for forehand grips) grips. Most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting; for example, slice shots and serves call for a Continental grip.

=== Serve ===
A serve (or, more formally, a &quot;service&quot;) in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the apex of its trajectory) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. The serve may be hit under- or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. If the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a &quot;let&quot; and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. There can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isn&#x27;t prepared. If the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve, then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.

Experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball is spinning counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter&#x27;s point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.

Some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point; however, advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. A winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an &quot;ace&quot;.

=== Forehand ===
For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. There are various grips for executing the forehand, and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. The most important ones are the &quot;continental&quot;, the &quot;eastern&quot;, the &quot;semi-western&quot;, and the &quot;western&quot;. For a number of years, the small, frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a &quot;western&quot; grip. Few top players used the &quot;western&quot; grip after the 1920s, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the &quot;western&quot; forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s, the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. Players such as Monica Seles or France&#x27;s Fabrice Santoro and Marion Bartoli are also notable players known for their two-handed forehands.

=== Backhand ===
For right-handed players, the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body, continues across their body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of their body. It can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. For most of the 20th century, the backhand was performed with one hand, using either an &quot;eastern&quot; or a &quot;continental&quot; grip. The first notable players to use two hands were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich, but they were lone exceptions. The two-handed grip gained popularity in the 1970s as Björn Borg, Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, and later Mats Wilander and Marat Safin used it to great effect, and it is now used by a large number of the world&#x27;s best players, including Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams.

Two hands give the player more control, while one hand can generate a slice shot, applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.

=== Other shots ===
A &quot;volley&quot; is a shot returned to the opponent in mid-air before the ball bounces, generally performed near the net, and is usually made with a stiff-wristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponent&#x27;s court. The &quot;half volley&quot; is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced, also generally in the vicinity of the net, and played with the racket close to the ground. The &quot;swinging volley&quot; is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. It is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent, as it returns the ball into the opponent&#x27;s court much faster than a standard volley.

From a poor defensive position on the baseline, the &quot;lob&quot; can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon, hitting the ball high and deep into the opponent&#x27;s court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponent&#x27;s head. If the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court, however, an opponent near the net may then hit an &quot;overhead smash&quot;, a hard, serve-like shot, to try to end the point.

A difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point is higher than the reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.

If their opponent is deep in their court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected &quot;drop shot&quot;, by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. Advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot, causing the ball to &quot;skid&quot; upon landing and bounce sideways, with less forward momentum toward their opponent, or even backwards towards the net, thus making it even more difficult to return.

== Tournaments ==

Tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. Common tournament configurations include men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, and doubles, where two players play on each side of the net. Tournaments may be organized for specific age groups, with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. Example of this include the Orange Bowl and Les Petits As junior tournaments. There are also tournaments for players with disabilities, such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis. In the four Grand Slam tournaments, the singles draws are limited to 128 players for each gender.

Most large tournaments seed players, but players may also be matched by their skill level. According to how well a person does in sanctioned play, a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. For example, the United States Tennis Association administers the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP), which rates players between 1.0 and 7.0 in 1/2 point increments. Average club players under this system would rate 3.0–4.5 while world class players would be 7.0 on this scale.

=== Grand Slam tournaments ===

The four Grand Slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. They are held annually and comprise, in chronological order, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Apart from the Olympic Games, Davis Cup, Fed Cup, and Hopman Cup, they are the only tournaments regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The ITF&#x27;s national associations, Tennis Australia (Australian Open), the Fédération Française de Tennis (French Open), the Lawn Tennis Association (Wimbledon) and the United States Tennis Association (US Open) are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.

Aside from the historical significance of these events, they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments, the ATP Masters 1000 (men) and Premier events (women). Another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. There are 128, more than any other professional tennis tournament. This draw is composed of 32 seeded players, other players ranked in the world&#x27;s top 100, qualifiers, and players who receive invitations through wild cards. Grand Slam men&#x27;s tournaments have best-of-five set matches while the women play best-of-three. Grand Slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks, the others being the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Masters.

Currently, the Grand Slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests. Grand Slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions. These tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. For example, players at Wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. Andre Agassi chose to skip Wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 citing the event&#x27;s traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly white&quot; dress code. Wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets, often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets.
*The French Open became an international tournament in 1925.

=== Men&#x27;s tournament structure ===
==== ATP 1000 ====
The ATP Masters 1000 is a group of nine tournaments that form the second-highest echelon in men&#x27;s tennis. Each event is held annually, and a win at one of these events is worth 1000 ranking points. When the ATP, led by Hamilton Jordan, began running the men&#x27;s tour in 1990, the directors designated the top nine tournaments, outside of the Grand Slam events, as &quot;Super 9&quot; events. In 2000 this became the Tennis Masters Series and in 2004 the ATP Masters Series. In November at the end of the tennis year, the world&#x27;s top eight players compete in the ATP Finals, a tournament with a rotating locale. It is currently held in Turin.

In August 2007 the ATP announced major changes to the tour that were introduced in 2009. The Masters Series was renamed to the &quot;ATP Masters 1000&quot;, the addition of the number 1000 referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. Contrary to earlier plans, the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the Monte-Carlo Masters remains part of the series although, unlike the other events, it does not have a mandatory player commitment. The Hamburg Masters has been downgraded to a 500-point event. The Madrid Masters moved to May and onto clay courts, and a new tournament in Shanghai took over Madrid&#x27;s former indoor October slot. As of 2011 six of the nine &quot;1000&quot; level tournaments are combined ATP and WTA events.

==== 500 and 250 series ====

The third and fourth tier of men&#x27;s tennis tournaments are formed by the ATP 500 series, consisting of 11 tournaments, and the ATP 250 series with 40 tournaments. Like the ATP Masters 1000, these events offer various amounts of prize money and the numbers refer to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of a tournament. The Dubai Tennis Championships offer the largest financial incentive to players, with total prize money of US$2,313,975 (2012). These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.

==== Challenger Tour and Futures tournaments ====
The Challenger Tour for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the ATP. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events. The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. Andre Agassi, between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings. The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between US$25,000 and US$150,000.

Below the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the ITF Men&#x27;s Circuit. These tournaments also contribute towards a player&#x27;s ATP rankings points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000. Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.

=== Women&#x27;s tournament structure ===
In 2021, the WTA rebranded, resembling the men&#x27;s tournament series, and also providing extra simplicity for fans and consumers. The numbers do not indicate ranking points, or prize money, but is a system to help define different levels of women&#x27;s tennis.

==== WTA 1000 ====
The WTA 1000 Tournaments (formerly the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 Tournaments), are a series of seven tournaments that are part of the second-highest tier in women&#x27;s tennis.

==== 500 and 250 Series ====
The third and fourth tier of women&#x27;s tennis tournaments are formed from the WTA 500 Series (formerly Premier 700), with fifteen tournaments, and the WTA 250 Series (formerly International), consisting of thirty tournaments.

==== WTA 125 ====
The WTA 125 Series (formerly 125K Series), is the lowest tier of women&#x27;s tennis, with fourteen tournaments.

== Players ==
=== Professional players ===
Professional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain prize money.

In recent years, professional tennis players have been mocked by tabloids and fans for the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players&#x27; grunting. This controversy has spurred the Grand Slam Committee, the International Tennis Association, and the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association to teach players techniques to avoid grunting.

====Singles and doubles professional careers====

While players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late 20s and early 30s, they can still continue competitively in doubles (as instanced by Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, who won doubles titles in their 40s).

In the Open Era, several female players such as Martina Navratilova, Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, and Venus Williams (the latter two sisters playing together) have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers. John McEnroe is one of the very few professional male players to be top ranked in both singles and doubles at the same time, and Yevgeny Kafelnikov is the most recent male player to win multiple Grand Slams in both singles and doubles during the same period of his career.

In terms of public attention and earnings (see below), singles champions have far surpassed their doubles counterparts. The Open Era, particularly the men&#x27;s side, has seen many top-ranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles, while having &quot;doubles specialists&quot; who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament. Notable doubles pairings include The Woodies (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) and the Bryan brothers (identical twin brothers Robert Charles &quot;Bob&quot; Bryan and Michael Carl &quot;Mike&quot; Bryan). Woodbridge has disliked the term &quot;doubles &#x27;specialists&#x27;&quot;, saying that he and Woodforde &quot;set a singles schedule and doubles fitted in around that&quot;, although later in Woodbridge&#x27;s career he focused exclusively on doubles as his singles ranking fell too low that it was no longer financially viable to recover at that age. Woodbridge noted that while top singles players earn enough that they do not need to nor want to play doubles, he suggested that lower-ranked singles players outside the Top Ten should play doubles to earn more playing time and money.

====Olympics====
The Olympics doubles tennis tournament necessitates that both members of a doubles pairing be from the same country, hence several top professional pairs such as Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares cannot compete in the Olympics. Top-ranked singles players that are usually rivals on the professional circuit, such as Boris Becker and Michael Stich, and Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka have formed a rare doubles partnership for the Olympics. Unlike professional tennis tournaments (see below) where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players, an Olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige. The Olympics is more of a priority for doubles champions while singles champions often skip the tournament. While the ATP has voted for Olympic results to count towards player ranking points, WTA players voted against it.

For the 2000 Olympics, Lisa Raymond was passed over for Team USA in favour of Serena Williams by captain Billie Jean King, even though Raymond was the top-ranked doubles player in the world at the time, and Raymond unsuccessfully challenged the selection.

====Prize money====
In professional tennis tournaments such as Wimbledon, the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage, followed by doubles, and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards. For instance in the US Open as of 2018, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles prize money (US$40,912,000) accounts for 80.9 percent of total player base compensation, while men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubles (US$6,140,840), men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles qualifying (US$3,008,000), and mixed doubles (US$505,000) account for 12.1 percent, 5.9 percent, and 1.0 percent, respectively. The singles winner receives US$3,800,000, while the doubles winning pair receives $700,000 and the mixed doubles winning pair receives US$155,000.

=== Grand Slam tournament winners ===

The following players have won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments (active players in bold):


=== Greatest male players ===
A frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the US Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge &quot;the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.&quot; In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever. Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the Open Era, Kramer was the best male champion.

By the 1960s, Budge and others had added Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad to the list of contenders. Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever. Gonzales said about Hoad, &quot;When Lew&#x27;s game was at its peak nobody could touch him. ... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique.&quot;

Before and during the Open Era, Rod Laver remains the only male player in history to have won the calendar year Grand Slam twice in 1962 and 1969 and also the calendar year Professional Grand Slam in 1967.

Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg, and John McEnroe had a fierce rivalry in the late 1970s and early 1980s that propelled &quot;the men&#x27;s game to new heights of popularity&quot;. Connors had a long and prolific career and holds the Open Era men&#x27;s singles records of 109 titles including eight Grand Slams, 1,557 matches played, and 1,274 match wins. Borg was regarded by his contemporaries as among the greatest ever, having a calm court demeanor and unrivalled physical conditioning, winning six French Opens and five straight Wimbledon titles, retiring at age 26 when he was still in his prime. McEnroe attained the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles, finishing his career with 77 singles and 78 doubles titles; this remains the highest men&#x27;s combined total of the Open Era.

The Agassi–Sampras rivalry showcased the two best players in the 1990s. Sampras had a precise and powerful serve while Agassi was considered to be one of the best service returners in the history of the game. By the early 2000s, Pete Sampras had won a then-record of 14 Grand Slam titles which was by far the most among his contemporaries. Sampras also held the record for most weeks at No. 1 with 286 until it was broken a decade later by Federer and Djokovic after that. Andre Agassi, was the first player to complete the Career Grand Slam on all modern three surfaces (hard, grass, and clay courts) as previous winners of Grand Slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only (Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall also won major Pro tournaments on the three surfaces). Agassi also is the only player to win all four Grand Slam titles along with the year-end championships and the olympics. Both Sampras and Agassi are regarded to be among the greatest players of all time.

By the early twenty-first century, the &#x27;Big Three&#x27; of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have dominated men&#x27;s singles tennis for two decades, collectively winning 66 major singles tournaments; Djokovic with an all-time record 24 titles, Nadal with 22 and Federer with 20. They have been ranked as world No. 1s in singles for a total 947 weeks (equivalent to 18 years); Djokovic for a record 428 weeks, Federer for 310, and Nadal for 209.

=== Greatest female players ===
As with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams being the three players most often nominated.

In March 2012 the Tennis Channel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time. It ranked Steffi Graf as the greatest female player (in 3rd place overall), followed by Martina Navratilova (4th place) and Margaret Court (8th place). The rankings were determined by an international panel.

Sportswriter John Wertheim of Sports Illustrated stated in an article in July 2010 that Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that &quot;Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can&#x27;t help feeling that she crushes the other legends.&quot;. In a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women&#x27;s tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot. This top-10 list was similar to the one published in June 2008 by the Bleacher Report who also ranked Martina Navratilova as the top female player of all time.

Steffi Graf is considered by some to be the greatest female player. Billie Jean King said in 1999, &quot;Steffi is definitely the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player of all time.&quot; Martina Navratilova has included Graf on her list of great players. In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press. Tennis writer Steve Flink, in his book &quot;The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century&quot;, named her as the best female player of the 20th century, directly followed by Martina Navratilova.

&quot;Tennis&quot; magazine selected Martina Navratilova as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1965 through 2005. Tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova &quot;arguably, the greatest player of all time.&quot; Billie Jean King said about Navratilova in 2006, &quot;She&#x27;s the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who&#x27;s ever lived.&quot;

In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena Williams as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era. In May 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of all time.

In November 2018, Tennis.com polled its readers to choose the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player of all time and Graf came in first. In July 2020, The Guardian polled its readers to determine the greatest female tennis player of the past 50 years, and Graf was the clear favorite, picking up nearly twice as many votes as any other player.

== Officials ==

In most professional play and some amateur competition, there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire (usually referred to simply as the umpire), who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. The umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. The umpire may be assisted by line judges, who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. There also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. The umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made.

In past tournaments, line judges tasked with calling the serve were sometimes assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate an out-of-bounds serve; one such system was called &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Cyclops has since largely been replaced by the Hawk-Eye system. In professional tournaments using this system, players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. The US Open, Miami Masters, US Open Series, and World Team Tennis started using this challenge system in 2006 and the Australian Open and Wimbledon introduced the system in 2007. In clay-court matches, such as at the French Open, a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the ball&#x27;s impact on the court surface.

The referee, who is usually located off the court, is the final authority about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire&#x27;s decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire&#x27;s decision on a question of fact. If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire&#x27;s decision. (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair.)

== Junior tennis ==
In tennis, a junior is a player under 18 who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. Players on the main adult tour who are under 18 must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. These players, however, are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.

The International Tennis Federation (ITF) conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) ranking. Most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through ITF, Satellite, Future, and Challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. The latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. Some juniors, however, such as Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Frenchman Gaël Monfils, have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the ATP tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.

In 2004, the ITF implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles, by combining two rankings (singles and doubles) into one combined tally. Junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the most prestigious junior events. Juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the Future, Satellite, or Challenger tours. Tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points, culminating with Grade A.

Leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions. To succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior&#x27;s growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.

== Injuries ==

Muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis. When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle, muscle strain can occur. Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occurs, which can result in redness, pain and swelling. Overuse is also common in tennis players of all levels. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recovery is the most common cause of injury.

== In popular culture ==

<text>Tiffani Amber Thiessen (born January 23, 1974) is an American actress. Her roles as Kelly Kapowski on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; (1989–1993) and its spin-off media, and as Valerie Malone on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1994–98) established her as a teen idol of the 1990s. As an adult, she has played Wilhemina &#x27;Billie&#x27; Chambers in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Fastlane&quot; (2002–2003), Natasha Drew in ABC&#x27;s &quot;What About Brian&quot; (2007), Elizabeth Burke in USA Network&#x27;s &quot;White Collar&quot; (2009–2014), and Lori Mendoza in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Alexa &amp; Katie&quot; (2018–2020). For the latter, she earned a Daytime Emmy Award nomination.

Thiessen has appeared in several films, such as &quot;Son in Law&quot; (1993), &quot;Speedway Junky&quot; (1999), &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money&quot; (1999), &quot;Love Stinks&quot; (1999), &quot;Ivans Xtc&quot; (2000), &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th&quot; (2000), &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002) and &quot;Cyborg Soldier&quot; (2008). She directed the short film &quot;Just Pray&quot; (2005), for which she earned a nomination from the Tribeca Festival for Best Narrative Short. She hosted the Cooking Channel series &quot;Dinner at Tiffani&#x27;s&quot; (2015–2017) and the MTV comedy clip show &quot;Deliciousness&quot; (2020–2022).

==Early life==
Thiessen was born in Long Beach, California, the daughter of Robyn (née Ernest), a homemaker, and Frank Thiessen, a park designer and landscape architect. She has credited her brother, Todd, as one of her most important sources of inspiration, and her mother and grandmother as role models. Thiessen told &quot;InStyle&quot; magazine: &quot;I&#x27;m a mutt. I have so much of everything in me, and half of it I don&#x27;t even know. German on one side, Greek, Turkish and Welsh on the other. My mom is very olive-skinned; I get my blue eyes from my dad.&quot;

==Career==
Thiessen participated in beauty pageants during her childhood and was crowned Miss Junior America in 1987. The following year, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Teen&quot; magazine, having won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Great Model Search&quot;. In 1989, she was named &quot;Cover Girl&quot;″s &quot;Model of the Year&quot;, and landed her first role of Kelly Kapowski on NBC&#x27;s television sitcom &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, starring until its end in 1993. The success of the show gave her career a boost and Thiessen received Young Artist Award nominations for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in 1990 and Best Young Actress Starring in an Off-Primetime Series in 1991 and 1993. Simultaneously, Thiessen guest-starred on series such as &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot;. In 1992, she starred in her first television movies &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot; and &quot;A Killer Among Friends&quot;, making her film debut in &quot;Son in Law&quot; in 1993. She then continued with starring in spin-off &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; in its single season (1993–94) and in television movie &quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot; (1994), which marked the end of the original &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; series.

In 1994, after her tenure on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; had ended, Thiessen landed the role of Valerie Malone in Fox&#x27;s Aaron Spelling-produced hit teen-drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, to fill the void after Shannen Doherty&#x27;s departure. She was the first actress to directly join the main cast of the show and portrayed Valerie until 1998, when she left in the early episodes of the ninth season of the show. While starring in &quot;90210&quot;, Thiessen began to take on continuous dramatic leading roles in television films: &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; (1995) and &quot;She Fought Alone&quot; (1995), &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and &quot;Buried Secrets&quot; in 1996. After her departure from the show, she appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Speedway Junky&quot; (1999), &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money&quot; (1999), &quot;Love Stinks&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (2000); she also guest-starred on &quot;NewsRadio&quot; (1999), &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot; (2000), &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (2001) and &quot;Good Morning, Miami&quot; (2003–04). In 2000, she was featured in the music video for &quot;You&#x27;re a God&quot; by Vertical Horizon, portraying a beauty pageant contestant, in her first music video appearance. That year she also dropped her middle name which she had been including professionally for many years and is now credited as simply Tiffani Thiessen. Thiessen was Spelling&#x27;s first choice to replace Doherty in the series &quot;Charmed&quot; in 2001, but she refused his offer because she was hoping the NBC pilot for &quot;Everything But the Girl&quot; would be picked up. The role eventually went to Rose McGowan.

Meanwhile, Thiessen starred in direct-to-video parody film &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth&quot; (2000) and in television movie &quot;Everything But the Girl&quot; (2001), before appearing in the Woody Allen-directed film &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002) and starring in action-drama series &quot;Fastlane&quot; (2002–03) as Wilhelmina &#x27;Billie&#x27; Chambers, for which she received a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice TV Actress – Drama/Action Adventure. In 2003, she launched her production company Tit 4 Tat Productions, producing and directing the short film &quot;Just Pray&quot; in 2005, which earned distinctions at several film festivals, including winning Best Score at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, an Academy Award qualifying festival. The original motion picture soundtrack album, co-produced by Thiessen and Al Gomes of Big Noise, was placed on the Official Ballot for the 49th Annual Grammy Awards by The Recording Academy in several categories including Best Compilation Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

Later on, she starred in television movies &quot;Stroller Wars&quot; (2006) and &quot;Pandemic&quot; (2007), she joined the cast of ABC&#x27;s drama &quot;What About Brian&quot; (2007) for its last five episodes and starred in the science fiction film &quot;Cyborg Soldier&quot; (2008). In 2008, she made her second music video appearance, this time for Ben Lee&#x27;s &quot;American Television&quot;. Thiessen appeared with her husband Brady Smith on the September 6, 2009 episode of season four of the reality show &quot;HGTV Design Star&quot;. Interior designer Lonni Paul, one of the final three contestants of the season, was given the task of redesigning Thiessen&#x27;s guest bedroom with an eco-friendly theme; Thiessen and Paul now have a nursery furniture line called PetitNest. From 2009 through 2014 Thiessen appeared in the USA Network crime series &quot;White Collar&quot; as Elizabeth Burke.

On February 4, 2015, Thiessen reunited with &quot;Saved By the Bell&quot; costars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Elizabeth Berkley, Dennis Haskins and Mario Lopez on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, in which they appeared in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sketch with host Jimmy Fallon. In the same year, Thiessen started hosting her own show on Cooking Channel called &quot;Dinner at Tiffani&#x27;s&quot;, which ran until 2017.

On June 7, 2017, Thiessen was cast as Lori Mendoza, mother of the Mendoza family on the multi camera Netflix sitcom &quot;Alexa &amp; Katie&quot;, which premiered its first two seasons on March 23 and December 26, 2018. In 2021, at the 48th Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, she was nominated in the category of Outstanding Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Daytime Fiction Program.

In March 2020, it was announced that Thiessen would join the cast of the &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; sequel series, reprising her role as Kelly Kapowski. She guest-starred in three episodes. The show premiered on NBCUniversal&#x27;s streaming network Peacock beginning November 2020. In November, it was announced that Thiessen would host the MTV comedy clip show &quot;Deliciousness&quot;, a spinoff of that network&#x27;s previous program, &quot;Ridiculousness&quot;.

==Charity work==
In April 2013, she participated in the One Bag party as part of Earth Month, in which the Glad company promoted &quot;clean, green living&quot;.

==Public image==
Thiessen was a teen idol during the 1990s, starting from her role as cheerleader Kelly Kapowski on &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; and then playing bad girl Valerie Malone on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. In a much-discussed moment, Justin Bieber appeared wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Thiessen in her &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; days at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards, admitting his admiration for her. Basketball player Chris Paul also revealed publicly that he was a fan of Thiessen back then, when she sent him an autographed 
&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;-era photograph of herself for his 29th birthday in 2014.

==Personal life==
Thiessen dated her &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; co-star Mark-Paul Gosselaar (who played Zack in the show). She also dated Mario Lopez, who played A.C. Slater, from 1991 to November 1993.

In early 1992, Thiessen started dating her future &quot;90210&quot; co-star Brian Austin Green, introduced by mutual friend David Faustino; they moved in together in July 1994, then broke up the next year. In 1999, she went through a difficult period in her personal life, when David Strickland, also an actor, whom she had begun dating, died by suicide. From 2001 to the spring of 2003, she was engaged to actor Richard Ruccolo, whom she had met during the &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot; run. She married actor Brady Smith on July 9, 2005, and they have two children: a daughter born in 2010, and a son born in 2015.

Thiessen served as maid of honor at &quot;90210&quot; co-star and best friend Jennie Garth&#x27;s 2001 wedding to actor Peter Facinelli, with whom she co-starred on &quot;Fastlane.&quot; Garth and Thiessen&#x27;s friendship has since come to an end. Her friendship with fellow &quot;90210&quot; star Tori Spelling also ended after Spelling&#x27;s marriage to her first husband ended.

<doc id="29778" wikidata="Q8743" url="?curid=29778" title="Thomas Edison">
<text>Thomas Alva Edison (February11, 1847October18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.

Edison was raised in the American Midwest. Early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world&#x27;s first film studio, the Black Maria. With 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries, Edison is regarded as the most prolific inventor in American history. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 due to complications from diabetes.

==Early life==
Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in Chenango County, New York). His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been &quot;Edeson&quot;.

His great-grandfather, loyalist John Edeson, fled New Jersey for Nova Scotia in 1784. The family moved to Middlesex County, Upper Canada, around 1811, and his grandfather, Capt. Samuel Edison Sr. served with the 1st Middlesex Militia during the War of 1812. His father, Samuel Edison Jr. moved to Vienna, Ontario, and fled to Ohio after his involvement in the Rebellion of 1837.

Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, a former school teacher. He attended school for only a few months. However, one biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own. As a child, he became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.

Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness. He was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other. It is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day historians and medical professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD.

It is known that early in his career he enrolled in a chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art to support his work on a new telegraphy system with Charles Batchelor. This appears to have been his only enrollment in courses at an institution of higher learning.

==Early career==
Thomas Edison began his career as a news butcher, selling newspapers, candy, and vegetables on trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments. At age 15, in 1862, he saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie&#x27;s father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison&#x27;s first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments until he left the job rather than be fired after being held responsible for a near collision of two trains.

Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the &quot;Grand Trunk Herald&quot;, which he sold with his other papers. This began Edison&#x27;s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. Ultimately, his entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, formerly one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.

In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter preoccupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss&#x27;s desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.

His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, , which was granted on June 1, 1869. Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.

==Menlo Park laboratory (1876–1886)==
===Research and development facility===
Edison&#x27;s major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison&#x27;s quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 , which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison&#x27;s first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.

William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device. 

In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was &quot;a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting&quot;. Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague&#x27;s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison&#x27;s mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm&#x27;s law, Joule&#x27;s law and economics.

Nearly all of Edison&#x27;s patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.

In just over a decade, Edison&#x27;s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have &quot;a stock of almost every conceivable material&quot;. A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained &quot;eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark&#x27;s teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock&#x27;s tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...&quot; and the list goes on.

Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; famous quotation: &quot;There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.&quot; This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.

In Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. Edison&#x27;s name is registered on 1,093 patents.

===Phonograph===

Edison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as &quot;The Wizard of Menlo Park&quot;.

His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as &quot;the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other&quot;. In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and President Hayes. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Edison as a &quot;genius&quot; and his presentation as &quot;a scene... that will live in history&quot;. Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.

===Carbon telephone transmitter===
In 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a &quot;transmitter&quot;) by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.

Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electric current passed through it. His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner&#x27;s loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitter&#x27;s invention) and David Edward Hughes&#x27; study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).

Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union. In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.

===Electric light===
In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb. In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success. Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta&#x27;s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel.

These early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament. Edison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using &quot;a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires&quot;.

The patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including &quot;cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways&quot;. It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200 hours.

Attempts to prevent blackening of the bulb due to emission of charged carbon from the hot filament culminated in Edison effect bulbs, which redirected and controlled the mysterious unidirectional current. Edison&#x27;s 1883 patent for voltage-regulating is notably the first US patent for an electronic device due to its use of an Edison effect bulb as an active component. Subsequent scientists studied, applied, and eventually evolved the bulbs into vacuum tubes, a core component of early analog and digital electronics of the 20th century. 

In 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: &quot;We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.&quot;

Henry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison&#x27;s 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard&#x27;s company&#x27;s new steamer, the &quot;Columbia&quot;. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard&#x27;s request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the &quot;Columbia&quot; went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed &quot;Columbia&quot; new lighting system. The &quot;Columbia&quot; was Edison&#x27;s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1895.

In 1880, Lewis Latimer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation, began working for the United States Electric Lighting Company run by Edison&#x27;s rival Hiram S. Maxim. While working for Maxim, Latimer invented a process for making carbon filaments for light bulbs and helped install broad-scale lighting systems for New York City, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London. Latimer holds the patent for the electric lamp issued in 1881, and a second patent for the &quot;process of manufacturing carbons&quot; (the filament used in incandescent light bulbs), issued in 1882.

On October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison&#x27;s patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years. In 1885, Latimer switched camps and started working with Edison. On October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison&#x27;s electric light improvement claim for &quot;a filament of carbon of high resistance&quot; was valid. To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, who held an 1880 British patent on a similar incandescent electric lamp, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.

The incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well. Mahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison&#x27;s electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison&#x27;s assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation. In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theater. The first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson&#x27;s textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882.

In 1901, Edison attended the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. His company, the Edison Manufacturing Company, was given the task of installing the electric lights on the various buildings and structures that were built for the exposition. At night Edison made a panorama photograph of the illuminated buildings.

===Electric power distribution===
After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric &quot;utility&quot; to compete with the existing gas light utilities. On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility. On September 4, 1882, in Pearl Street, New York City, his 600 kW cogeneration steam-powered generating station, Pearl Street Station&#x27;s, electrical power distribution system was switched on, providing 110 volts direct current (DC), initially to 59 customers in lower Manhattan, quickly growing to 508 customers with 10,164 lamps. The power station was decommissioned in 1895.

Eight months earlier in January 1882, to demonstrate feasibility, Edison had switched on the 93 kW first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. This was a smaller 110 V DC supply system, eventually supplying 3,000 street lights and a number of nearby private dwellings, but was shut down in September 1886 as uneconomic, since he was unable to extend the premises.

On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.

===War of currents===
As Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and &quot;step down&quot; (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison&#x27;s patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply. Edison&#x27;s DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison&#x27;s DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.

Edison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, &quot;Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.&quot; Many reasons have been suggested for Edison&#x27;s anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. The primary reason was that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC, and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison&#x27;s mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison&#x27;s 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.

Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it. Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a &quot;war of the currents&quot;. The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse, via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to ensure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.

Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric. In 1890 he told president Henry Villard he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time. Edison&#x27;s dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison&#x27;s Electric&#x27;s own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 Edison Machine Works began developing AC-based equipment. Cut-throat competition and patent battles were bleeding off cash in the competing companies and the idea of a merger was being put forward in financial circles. The War of Currents ended in 1892 when the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with its main alternating current based rival, The Thomson-Houston Company, that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market. Edison served as a figurehead on the company&#x27;s board of directors for a few years before selling his shares.
==West Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931)==

Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as &quot;Glenmont&quot; in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 () and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture. The building materials were pre-cut in New England by the Kennebec Framing Company and the Stephen Nye Lumber Company of Fairfield Maine. The materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.

Due to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.

Edison became concerned with America&#x27;s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. Edison&#x27;s work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.

The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey S. Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project, while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder. After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on &quot;Solidago leavenworthii&quot;, also known as Leavenworth&#x27;s Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.

During the 1911 New York Electrical show, Edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he did not have a &quot;chunk of it&quot;. The representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the &quot;continuous stimulation in the copper industry&quot;.

==Other inventions and projects==

===Fluoroscopy===
Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.

The fundamental design of Edison&#x27;s fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, including mediastinal cancer.

In 1903, a shaken Edison said: &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.&quot; Nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today.

===Tasimeter===

Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation. His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878. The device was not patented since Edison could find no practical mass-market application for it.

===Telegraph improvements===

The key to Edison&#x27;s initial reputation and success was his work in the field of telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This, together with his studies in chemistry at the Cooper Union, allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. His innovations also included the development of the quadruplex, the first system which could simultaneously transmit four messages through a single wire.

===Motion pictures===

Edison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, labeled the &quot;Kinetograph&quot;. He did the electromechanical design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.

In April 1896, Thomas Armat&#x27;s Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison&#x27;s name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.

Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when wealthy American businessman Irving T. Bush (1869–1948) bought a dozen machines from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck &amp; Co of Cologne.

The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison&#x27;s Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists. On May 14, 1895, the Edison&#x27;s Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.

Edison&#x27;s film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as &quot;Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze&quot; (1894), &quot;The Kiss&quot; (1896), &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903), &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1910), and the first &quot;Frankenstein&quot; film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title &quot;Electrocuting an Elephant&quot;.

As the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other&#x27;s films. To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.

In 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.

Edison said his favorite movie was &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. He thought that talkies had &quot;spoiled everything&quot; for him. &quot;There isn&#x27;t any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.&quot; His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.

===Mining===
Starting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.

In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada, and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903. A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.

===Rechargeable battery===
In the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an &quot;accumulator&quot;). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles. The then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel–iron battery by the Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner.

Edison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company, and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects, with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was exhausted, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel–iron battery was never very successful; by the time it was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for turning over gas-powered car starter motors.

===Chemicals===

At the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive: most chemicals were imported from Europe. The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in a shortage of imported chemicals. One of particular importance to Edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records—presumably as phenolic resins of the Bakelite type.

At the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting. Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells. Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate. Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.

Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake facility using processes developed by his chemists. He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.

Phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. Bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. Aspirin, too was a phenol derivative. Invented in 1899, it had become a blockbuster drug. Bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in Rensselaer, New York, but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war. Edison was able to oblige.

Bayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in Piscataway, New Jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin. It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate. Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses. He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to salicylic acid by Heyden, some of which was exported.

===Spirit Phone===
In 1920, Edison spoke to &quot;American Magazine&quot;, saying that he had been working on a device for some time to see if it was possible to communicate with the dead. Edison said the device would work on scientific principles, not by occult means. The press had a field day over Edison&#x27;s remarks. The actual nature of this invention remained a mystery; there were no details revealed to the public. In 2015, Philippe Baudouin, a French journalist, found a copy of Edison&#x27;s diary in a thrift store with a chapter not found in the previously published editions. The new chapter details Edison&#x27;s theories of the afterlife and the scientific basis by which communication with the dead might be achieved.

==Final years==

Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison Illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford&#x27;s internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison&#x27;s death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated.

In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that &quot;The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.&quot; He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club&#x27;s meetings.

Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.

This fleet of cars would serve commuters in North Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison&#x27;s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by NJ Transit.

Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; &quot;the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours&quot;. He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, &quot;Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.&quot; She also said that during one of his periodic &quot;great scientific adventures&quot;, Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.

Edison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.

===Death===
Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, &quot;Glenmont&quot; in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben officiated at the funeral; Edison is buried behind the home.

Edison&#x27;s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor&#x27;s room shortly after his death, as a memento. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison&#x27;s hands were also made. Mina died in 1947.

==Marriages and children==
On December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:
* Marion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed &quot;Dot&quot;
* Thomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed &quot;Dash&quot;
* William Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.

Mary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.

Edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.
On February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947) in Akron, Ohio. She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:
* Madeleine Edison (1888–1979), who married John Eyre Sloane.
* Charles Edison (1890–1969), Governor of New Jersey (1941–1944), who took over his father&#x27;s company and experimental laboratories upon his father&#x27;s death.
* Theodore Miller Edison (1898–1992), (MIT Physics 1923), credited with more than 80 patents.

Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.

Wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison&#x27;s son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr., became a problem for his father and his father&#x27;s business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as &quot;The Latest Edison Discovery&quot;. The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35 () per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., experiencing alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his half-brother Charles.

===On religion and metaphysics===

Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a &quot;freethinker&quot;. Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;. Edison defended Paine&#x27;s &quot;scientific deism&quot;, saying, &quot;He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.&quot; In 1878, Edison joined the Theosophical Society in New Jersey, but according to its founder, Helena Blavatsky, he was not a very active member. In an October 2, 1910, interview in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;, Edison stated:

Edison was labeled an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:
He also stated, &quot;I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.&quot; In 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of &quot;American Magazine&quot; that he was working on a &quot;spirit phone&quot; to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated. Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1926 that &quot;I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.&quot;

=== On politics ===
Edison was a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage. He said in 1915, &quot;Every woman in this country is going to have the vote.&quot; Edison notably signed onto a statement supporting women&#x27;s suffrage which was published to counter anti-suffragist literature spread by Senator James Edgar Martine.

Nonviolence was key to Edison&#x27;s political and moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, &quot;I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.&quot; Edison&#x27;s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: &quot;Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.&quot; He was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life. Following a tour of Europe in 1911, Edison spoke negatively about &quot;the belligerent nationalism that he had sensed in every country he visited&quot;.

Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the &quot;New York Times&quot; as stating: &quot;Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.&quot; In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. Edison argued that, if the government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.

In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled &quot;A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System&quot;. In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison&#x27;s proposals failed to find support and were abandoned.

In the 2005 television series &quot;The Greatest American&quot;, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.
* In 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.
* In 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.

=== Commemorations and popular culture ===
Thomas Edison has been honored twice with two different U.S. postage stamps. The first was released in 1929 at Menlo Park, NJ, two years before his death; a 2-cent red, on the 50th anniversary of his invention of the incandescent light, and again in 1947, 3-cent violet, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, first released in Milan, Ohio, his place of birth.

Edison has also appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, television shows, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon, and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.

<text>Thomas Reid (; 7 May (O.S. 26 April) 1710 – 7 October 1796) was a religiously trained Scottish philosopher best known for his philosophical method, his theory of perception, and its wide implications on epistemology, and as the developer and defender of an agent-causal theory of free will. He also focused extensively on ethics, theory of action, language and philosophy of mind. 

He was the founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense and played an integral role in the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A contemporary of David Hume, Reid was also &quot;Hume&#x27;s earliest and fiercest critic&quot;.

==Life==
Reid was born in the manse at Strachan, Aberdeenshire, on 26 April 1710, the son of Lewis Reid (1676–1762) and his wife Margaret Gregory, first cousin to James Gregory. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School then the O&#x27;Neil Grammar School in Kincardine.

He went to the University of Aberdeen in 1723 and graduated MA in 1726. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1731 when he came of age. He began his career as a minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a minister when he was given a professorship at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote &quot;An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense&quot; (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the &#x27;Aberdeen Philosophical Society, popularly known as the &#x27;Wise Club&#x27; (a literary-philosophical association). Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: &quot;Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man&quot; (1785) and &quot;Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind&quot; (1788). However, in 1787 he is still listed as &quot;Professor of Moral Philosophy&quot; at the university, but his classes were being taught by Archibald Arthur.

In 1740 Thomas Reid married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the London physician George Reid. His wife and &quot;numerous&quot; children predeceased him, except for a daughter who married Patrick Carmichael. Reid died of palsy, in Glasgow. He was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building.

==Philosophical work==
===Overview===
Reid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of &quot;sensus communis&quot;) is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry. He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our &quot;sensus communis&quot; are built justify our belief that there is an external world.

In his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume. He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, René Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them. He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry.&quot; Hume responded that the work &quot;is wrote in a lively entertaining manner,&quot; although he found &quot;there seems to be some Defect in Method&quot;, and he criticized Reid&#x27;s doctrine for implying the presence of innate ideas. (pp. 256–257)

===Thomas Reid&#x27;s theory of common sense===
Reid&#x27;s theory of knowledge had a strong influence on his theory of morals. He thought epistemology was an introductory part to practical ethics: When we are confirmed in our common beliefs by philosophy, all we have to do is to act according to them, because we know what is right. His moral philosophy is reminiscent of Roman stoicism in its emphasis on the agency of the subject and self-control. He often quotes Cicero, from whom he adopted the term &quot;sensus communis&quot;. Reid&#x27;s answer to Hume&#x27;s sceptical and naturalist arguments was to enumerate a set of principles of &quot;common sense&quot; (&quot;sensus communis&quot;) which constitute the foundations of rational thought. Anyone who undertakes a philosophical argument, for example, must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like, &quot;I am talking to a real person,&quot; and &quot;There is an external world whose laws do not change,&quot; among many other positive, substantive claims. For Reid, the belief in the truth of these principles is not rational; rather, reason itself demands these principles as prerequisites, as does the innate &quot;constitution&quot; of the human mind. It is for this reason (and possibly a mocking attitude toward Hume and Berkeley) that Reid sees belief in the principles of common sense as a litmus test for sanity. For example, in &quot;The Intellectual Powers of Man&quot; he states, &quot;For, before men can reason together, they must agree in first principles; and it is impossible to reason with a man who has no principles in common with you.&quot; One of the first principles he goes on to list is that &quot;qualities must necessarily be in something that is figured, coloured, hard or soft, that moves or resists. It is not to these qualities, but to that which is the subject of them, that we give the name body. If any man should think fit to deny that these things are qualities, or that they require any subject, I leave him to enjoy his opinion as a man who denies first principles, and is not fit to be reasoned with.&quot;

Reid also made positive arguments based in phenomenological insight to put forth a novel mixture of direct realism and ordinary language philosophy. In a typical passage in &quot;The Intellectual Powers of Man&quot; he asserts that when he has a conception of a centaur, the thing he conceives is an animal, and no idea is an animal; therefore, the thing he conceives is not an idea, but a centaur. This point relies both on an account of the subjective experience of conceiving an object and also on an account of what we mean when we use words. Because Reid saw his philosophy as publicly accessible knowledge, available both through introspection and through the proper understanding of how language is used, he saw it as the philosophy of common sense.

==== Exploring sense and language ====
Reid started out with a &#x27;common sense&#x27; based on a direct experience of an external reality but then proceeded to explore in two directions—external to the senses, and internal to human language—to account more effectively for the role of rationality.

Reid saw language as based on an innate capacity pre-dating human consciousness, and acting as an instrument for that consciousness. (In Reid&#x27;s terms: it is an &#x27;artificial&#x27; instrument based on a &#x27;natural&#x27; capacity.) On this view, language becomes a means of examining the original form of human cognition. Reid notes that current human language contains two distinct elements: first, the acoustic element, the sounds; and secondly the meanings—which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as such. This state of the language, which he calls &#x27;artificial&#x27;, cannot be the primeval one, which he terms &#x27;natural&#x27;, wherein sound was not an abstract sign, but a concrete gesture or natural sign. Reid looks to the way a child learns language, by imitating sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the various groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech. If, says Reid, the child needed to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all. Here Reid distinguishes between natural and artificial signs:

:&quot;It is by natural signs chiefly that we give force and energy to language; and the less language has of them, it is the less expressive and persuasive. ... Artificial signs signify, but they do not express; they speak to the intellect, as algebraic characters may do, but the passions and the affections and the will hear them not: these continue dormant and inactive, till we speak to them in &quot;the language of nature&quot;, to which they are all attention and obedience.&quot; (p. 52)

His external exploration, regarding the senses, led Reid to his critical distinction between &#x27;sensation&#x27; and &#x27;perception&#x27;. While we become aware of an object through the senses, the content of that perception is not identical with the sum total of the sensations caused in our consciousness. Thus, while we tend to focus on the object perceived, we pay no attention to the process leading from sensation to perception, which contains the knowledge of the thing as real. How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter&#x27;s existence? Reid&#x27;s answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it, as a child does. In the case of the adult, the focus is on perceiving, but with the child, it is on receiving of the sensations in their living nature. For Reid, the perception of the child is different from the adult, and he states that man must become like a child to get past the artificial perception of the adult, which leads to Hume&#x27;s view that what we perceive is an illusion. Also, the artist provides a key to the true content of sense experience, as he engages the &#x27;language of nature&#x27;:

:&quot;It were easy to show, that the fine arts of the musician, the painter, the actor, and the orator, so far as they are expressive .. are nothing else but the language of nature, which we brought into the world with us, but have unlearned by disuse and so find the greatest difficulty in recovering it.&quot; (p. 53)

:&quot;That without a natural knowledge of the connection between these [natural] signs and the things signified by them, the language could never have been invented and established among men; and, That the fine arts are all founded upon this connection, which we may call the natural language of mankind.&quot; (p. 59)

Thus, for Reid, common sense was based on the innate capacity of man in an earlier epoch to directly participate in nature, and one we find to some extent in the child and artist, but one that from a philosophical and scientific perspective, we must re-awaken at a higher level in the human mind above nature. Why does Reid believe that perception is the way to recognize? Well, to him &quot;an experience is purely subjective and purely negative. It supports the validity of a proposition, only on the fact that I find that it is impossible for me not to hold it for true, to suppose it therefore not true&quot; (Reid, 753). To understand this better, it is important to know that Reid divides his definition of perception into two categories: conception, and belief. &quot;Conception is Reid&#x27;s way of saying to visualize an object, so then we can affirm or deny qualities about that thing. Reid believes that beliefs are our direct thoughts of an object, and what that object is&quot; (Buras, The Functions of Sensations to Reid). So, to Reid, what we see, what we visualize, what we believe of an object, is that object&#x27;s true reality. Reid believes in direct objectivity, our senses guide us to what is right since we cannot trust our own thoughts. &quot;The worlds of common sense and of philosophy are reciprocally the converse of each other&quot; (Reid, 841). Reid believes that Philosophy overcomplicates the question of what is real. So, what does Common Sense actually mean then? Well, &quot;common sense is the senses being pulled all together to form one idea&quot; (Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid, 164). Common sense (all the senses combined) is how we truly identify the reality of an object; since all that can be perceived about an object, are all pulled into one perception. How do people reach the point of accessing common sense? That&#x27;s the trick, everyone is born with the ability to access common sense, that is why it is called common sense. &quot;The principles of common sense are common to all of humanity,&quot; (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid).

Common sense works as such: If all men observe an item and believe the same qualities about that item, then the knowledge of that item is universally true. It is common knowledge, which without explanation is held true by other people; so, what is universally seen is universally believed. &quot;The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a community, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge,&quot; (Reid, 155). The combination of the same ideas, of a thing, by multiple people, is what confirms the reality of an object. Reid also believes that the philosophers of his time exaggerated what is truly real. Where most philosophers believe that what we see is not fully what that thing is, for example, Descartes, Reid counters this argument simply by stating that &quot;such a hypothesis is no more likely to be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the way we perceive it to be,&quot; (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid). Reality is what we make it out to be, nothing more.

Reid also claimed that this discovery of the link between the natural sign and the thing signified was the basis of natural philosophy and science, as proposed by Bacon in his radical method of discovery of the innate laws of nature:

:The great Lord Verulam had a perfect comprehension of this, when he called it &quot;an interpretation of nature&quot;. No man ever more distinctly understood, or happily expressed the nature and foundation of the philosophic art. What is all we know of mechanics, astronomy, and optics, but connections established by nature and discovered by experience or observation, and consequences deduced from them? (..) What we commonly call natural &quot;causes&quot; might, with more propriety, be called natural &quot;signs&quot;, and what we call &quot;effects&quot;, the things signified. The causes have no proper efficiency or causality, as far as we know; and all we can certainly affirm, is, that nature hath established a constant conjunction between them and the things called their effects; (..). (p. 59)

==== Influences ====
It has been claimed that Reid&#x27;s reputation waned after attacks on the Scottish School of Common Sense by Immanuel Kant (although Kant, only 14 years Reid&#x27;s junior, also bestowed much praise on Scottish philosophy—Kant attacked the work of Reid, but admitted he had never actually read his works) and by John Stuart Mill. But Reid&#x27;s was the philosophy taught in the colleges of North America during the 19th century and was championed by Victor Cousin, a French philosopher. Justus Buchler has shown that Reid was an important influence on the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who shared Reid&#x27;s concern to revalue common sense and whose work links Reid to pragmatism. To Peirce, conceptions of truth and the real involve the notion of a community without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed), and capable of a definite increase of knowledge. Common sense is socially evolved, open to verification much like scientific method, and constantly evolving, as evidence, perception, and practice warrant, albeit with a slowness that Peirce came only in later years to see, at which point he owned his &quot;adhesion, under inevitable modification, to the opinion of...Thomas Reid, in the matter of Common Sense&quot;. (Peirce called his version &quot;critical common-sensism&quot;). By contrast, on Reid&#x27;s concept, the &quot;sensus communis&quot; is not a social evolutionary product but rather a precondition of the possibility that humans could reason with each other. The work of Thomas Reid influenced the work of Noah Porter and James McCosh in the 19th century United States and is based upon the claim of universal principles of objective truth. Pragmatism is not the development of the work of the Scottish &quot;Common Sense&quot; School—it is the negation of it. There are clear links between the work of the Scottish Common Sense School and the work of the Oxford Realist philosophers Harold Prichard and Sir William David Ross in the 20th century.

Reid&#x27;s reputation has revived in the wake of the advocacy of common sense as a philosophical method or criterion by G. E. Moore early in the 20th century, and more recently because of the attention given to Reid by contemporary philosophers, in particular philosophers of religion in the school of Reformed epistemology such as William Alston, Alvin Plantinga, and Nicholas Wolterstorff, seeking to rebut charges that theistic belief is irrational where it has no doxastic foundations (that is, where that belief is not inferred from other adequately grounded beliefs).

He wrote a number of important philosophical works, including &quot;Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense&quot; (1764, Glasgow &amp; London), &quot;Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man&quot; (1785) and &quot;Essays on the Active Powers of Man&quot; (1788). In 1844, Schopenhauer praised Reid for explaining that the perception of external objects does not result from the raw data that is received through the five senses:
===Other philosophical positions===
Though known mainly for his epistemology, Reid is also noted for his views in the theory of action and the metaphysics of personal identity. Reid held an incompatibilist or libertarian notion of freedom, holding that we are capable of free actions of which we are the cause, and for which we are morally appraisable. Regarding personal identity, he rejected Locke&#x27;s account that self-consciousness in the form of memory of one&#x27;s experiences was the basis of a person&#x27;s being identical with their self over time. Reid held that continuity of memory was neither necessary nor sufficient to make one numerically the same person at different times.
Reid also argued that the operation of our mind connecting sensations with belief in an external world is accounted for only by an intentional Creator. In his natural religion lectures, Reid provides five arguments for the existence of God, focusing on two mainly, the cosmological and design. Reid loved and frequently used Samuel Clarke&#x27;s cosmological argument, which says, in short that the universe either has always been, or began to exist, so there must be a cause (or first principle) for both (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). As everything is either necessary or contingent, an Independent being is required for contingency (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). Reid spends even more time on his design argument, but is unclear exactly what he wanted his argument to be, as his lectures only went as far as his students needed. Though there is no perfect interpretation, Reid states that &quot;there are in fact the clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of nature&quot; (Cuneo and Woudenberg 291) If something carries marks of design (regularity or variety of structure), there must be an intelligent being behind it (Reid EIP 66). This can&#x27;t be known by experience, fitting with the casual excellence principle, but the cause can be seen in works of nature (Cuneo and Woudenberg 241).

<text>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American independent horror film produced, co-composed, and directed by Tobe Hooper, who co-wrote it with Kim Henkel. The film stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, and Gunnar Hansen. The plot follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era&#x27;s political climate. Although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional.

Hooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. Due to the film&#x27;s violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by the Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally, being banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence.

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was released in the United States on October 11, 1974. While the film initially received mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since become widely regarded as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, masked figure. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books, and video games. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the early hours of August 18, 1973, a grave robber steals several corpses from a cemetery near Newt, Muerto County, Texas. The robber ties a rotting corpse and other body parts onto a monument, creating a grisly display that is discovered by a local resident as the sun rises.

Driving in a van, five teenagers take a road trip through the area: Sally Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, Kirk, and Sally&#x27;s paraplegic brother Franklin. They stop at the cemetery to check on the grave of Sally and Franklin&#x27;s grandfather, which appears undisturbed. As the group drives past a slaughterhouse, Franklin recounts the Hardesty family&#x27;s history with animal slaughter. They soon pick up a hitchhiker, who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin&#x27;s pocket knife and cuts himself, then takes a single Polaroid picture of the group, for which he demands money. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and attacks Franklin with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van, where he smears blood on the side as they drive off. Low on gas, the group stops at a station whose proprietor says that no fuel is available. The group explores a nearby abandoned house, owned by the Hardesty family.

Kirk and Pam leave the others behind, planning to visit a nearby swimming hole mentioned by Franklin. On their way there, they discover another house, surrounded by run-down cars, and run by gas-powered generators. Hoping to barter for gas, Kirk enters the house through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. As he searches the house, a large man wearing a mask made of skin appears and murders Kirk with a hammer. When Pam enters the house, she stumbles into a room strewn with decaying remains and furniture made from human and animal bones. She attempts to flee but is caught by the man and impaled on a meat hook. The man then starts up a chainsaw, dismembering Kirk as Pam watches. In the evening, Jerry searches for Pam and Kirk. When he enters the other house, he finds Pam&#x27;s nearly-dead, spasming body in a chest freezer and is killed by the masked man.

With darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. En route, the masked man ambushes them, killing Franklin with the chainsaw. The man chases Sally into the house, where she finds a very old, seemingly dead man and a woman&#x27;s rotting corpse. She escapes from the man by jumping through a second-floor window, and she flees to the gas station. With the man in pursuit, Sally arrives at the gas station when he seems to disappear. The station&#x27;s proprietor comforts Sally with the offer of help, after which he beats and subdues her, loading her into his pickup truck. The proprietor drives to the other house, and the hitchhiker appears. The proprietor scolds him for his actions at the cemetery, identifying the hitchhiker as the grave robber. As they enter the house, the masked man reappears, dressed in women&#x27;s clothing. The proprietor identifies the masked man and the hitchhiker as brothers, and the hitchhiker refers to the masked man as &quot;Leatherface&quot;. The two brothers bring the old man—&quot;Grandpa&quot;—down the stairs and cut Sally&#x27;s finger so that Grandpa can suck her blood, Sally then faints from the ordeal.

The next morning, Sally regains consciousness. The men taunt her and bicker with each other, resolving to kill her with a hammer. They try to include Grandpa in the activity, but Grandpa is too weak. Sally breaks free and runs onto a road in front of the house, pursued by the brothers. An oncoming truck accidentally runs over the hitchhiker, killing him. The truck driver attacks Leatherface with a large wrench, causing him to fall and injure his leg with the chainsaw. Sally, covered in blood, flags down a passing pickup truck and climbs into the bed, narrowly escaping Leatherface. As the pickup drives away, Sally laughs hysterically while an enraged Leatherface swings his chainsaw in the road as the sun rises.

==Production==
===Development===
The concept for &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; arose in the early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an assistant film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on murderer Ed Gein, who committed his crimes in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991). During development, several names for the film were considered, including &quot;Saturn in Retrograde&quot;, &quot;Head Cheese&quot;, &quot;Stalking Leatherface&quot;, and &quot;Leatherface&quot;.
Hooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the &quot;film you are about to see is true&quot;, was a response to being &quot;lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world&quot;. It reflected the skepticism against the Richard Nixon administration in the wake of the Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, the 1973 economic recession, and &quot;the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War&quot;. The &quot;lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things&quot; that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by &quot;showing brains spilled all over the road&quot;, led to his belief that &quot;man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film&quot;. The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd.

Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the screenplay and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel as president and Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of the cast and crew that he would have to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.

===Casting===
Many of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members&#x27; costumes.

Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as having an intellectual disability and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits, for which he was paid in marijuana.

===Filming===

The primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was hot and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110°F (43 °C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, &quot;It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn&#x27;t wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn&#x27;t have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that [mask] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.&quot;

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was mainly shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, low-speed Ektachrome Commercial film that required considerably more light than modern digital cameras and even most filmstocks of the day. This allowed more mobility and cost savings over shooting on the standard theatrical 35mm format of the time, without significant sacrifices to image quality. Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.

The special effects were simple and limited by the budget. The on-screen blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds &quot;Grandpa&quot;. The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood to come out of its tube, so instead Burns&#x27;s index finger was cut with a razor. Burns&#x27;s costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was &quot;virtually solid&quot; by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface dismembers Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within of Vail&#x27;s face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim&#x27;s head. Still, the shoot was quite dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that &quot;everyone hated me by the end of the production&quot; and that &quot;it just took years for them to kind of cool off.&quot;

The gas station featured in several scenes of the film is located in Bastrop, Texas. It now operates as a horror-themed attraction, Texas barbecue restaurant, and motel. To maintain its resemblance to the film, the owners preserved various antiques, including the vintage sign that reads &quot;We Slaughter Barbecue&quot;.

===Post-production===
The production exceeded its original $60,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) budget during editing. Sources differ on the film&#x27;s final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted). A film production group, Pie in the Sky, partially led by future President of the Texas State Bar Joe K. Longley provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) in exchange for 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Distributing Company. David Foster, who would later produce the 1982 horror film &quot;The Thing&quot;, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston&#x27;s West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex&#x27;s profits and a deferred fee of $500 (about $ inflation-adjusted).

On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, &quot;We made a deal with the devil, [sigh], and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved.&quot; They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjusted) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983, New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.

== Release ==
&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; premiered in Austin, Texas, on October 1, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded. It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matinée and its false marketing as a &quot;true story&quot; helped it attract a broad audience. For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads. The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th-highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget. Among independent films, it was overtaken in 1978 by John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;, which grossed $47 million.

Hooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a &quot;PG&quot; rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore. Instead, it was originally rated &quot;X&quot;. After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an &quot;R&quot; rating. A distributor restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an &quot;R&quot;. In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust and in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges.

After its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London, &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman. While the British ban was in force the word &quot;chainsaw&quot; itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films. In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; uncut for release with an 18 certificate, and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.

When the 83-minute version of the film was submitted to the Australian Classification Board by distributor Seven Keys in June 1975, the Board denied the film a classification, and similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year. In 1981, the 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Film Distributors was again refused registration. It was later submitted by Filmways Australasian Distributors and approved for an &quot;R&quot; rating in 1984. It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany. In Sweden, it would also symbolize a video nasty, a discussed topic at the time.

The film was released in 2021 in Australia and 2024 in Russia, grossing $36,879 at the international box office. It grossed $2.5 million in Blu-Ray home sales.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; received a mixed reaction upon its initial release. Linda Gross of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;despicable&quot; and described Henkel and Hooper as more concerned with creating a realistic atmosphere than with its &quot;plastic script&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said it was &quot;as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises&quot;, yet praised its acting and technical execution. Donald B. Berrigan of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; praised the lead performance of Burns: &quot;Marilyn Burns, as Sally, deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history.&quot; Patrick Taggart of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; hailed it as the most important horror film since George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968). &quot;Variety&quot; found the picture to be well-made, despite what it called the &quot;heavy doses of gore&quot;. John McCarty of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; stated that the house featured in the film made the Bates motel &quot;look positively pleasant by comparison&quot;. Revisiting the film in his 1976 article &quot;Fashions in Pornography&quot; for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Stephen Koch found its sadistic violence to be extreme and unimaginative.
Critics later frequently praised both the film&#x27;s aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it managed to be &quot;horrifying without being a bloodbath (you&#x27;ll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)&quot;, Bruce Westbrook of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; thought it was &quot;intelligent&quot; in its &quot;bloodless depiction of violence&quot;, while Anton Bitel felt the fact that it was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences &quot;a punishing assault on the senses&quot;. In &quot;Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema&quot;, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;subtle touches&quot;—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.

It has often been described as one of the scariest films of all time. Rex Reed called it the most terrifying film he had ever seen. &quot;Empire&quot; described it as &quot;the most purely horrifying horror movie ever made&quot; and called it &quot;never less than totally committed to scaring you witless&quot;. Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering &quot;what kind of Mansonite crazoid&quot; could have created such a thing. It is a work of &quot;cataclysmic terror&quot;, in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, &quot;I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country.&quot; Critic Robin Wood found it one of the few horror films to possess &quot;the authentic quality of nightmare&quot;. Quentin Tarantino called it &quot;one of the few perfect movies ever made.&quot;

Based on 85 reviews published since 2000, the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 84% of critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 8.20/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Thanks to a smart script and documentary-style camerawork, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; achieves start-to-finish suspense, making it a classic in low-budget exploitation cinema.&quot;

===Cultural impact===
&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; is widely considered one of the greatest—and most controversial—horror films of all time and a major influence on the genre. In 1999, Richard Zoglin of &quot;Time&quot; commented that it had &quot;set a new standard for slasher films&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as &quot;cheap, grubby and out of control&quot;, Mark Olsen of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared that it &quot;both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture&quot;. In his book &quot;Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film&quot;, David Hogan called it &quot;the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity.&quot; According to Bill Nichols, it &quot;achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal&quot;. Leonard Wolf praised the film as &quot;an exquisite work of art&quot; and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.

Leatherface has gained a reputation as a significant character in the horror genre. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, &quot;In our collective consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask.&quot; Don Sumner called &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, it laid the foundations for the &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead&quot;, and &quot;Blair Witch&quot; horror franchises. Wes Craven crafted his 1977 film &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; as an homage to &quot;Massacre&quot;, while Ridley Scott cited Hooper&#x27;s film as an inspiration for his 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;. French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career. Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his work, including his films &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005).

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was selected for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival Directors&#x27; Fortnight and London Film Festival. In 1976, it won the Special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;. In a 2005 &quot;Total Film&quot; poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time. It was named among &quot;Time&quot;″s top 25 horror films in 2007. In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films. In a 2010 &quot;Total Film&quot; poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero. In 2010, as well, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films. It was also voted the greatest horror film of all time in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; 2013 list of the greatest horror films of all time. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2017 list by &quot;Complex&quot; and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2017 list by &quot;Thrillist&quot;. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2018 list by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2018 list by &quot;Esquire&quot;. In 2024, Variety selected it as the greatest horror movie of all time.

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with director Hooper accepting the award, and it is part of the permanent collection of New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art. In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine as one of the 250 greatest films. The Academy Film Archive houses the Texas Chain Saw Massacre Collection, which contains over fifty items, including many original elements for the film.

==Themes and analysis==
===Contemporary American life===

Critic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses &quot;about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process&quot;, concerns amplified during the 1970s by the &quot;delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate&quot;. &quot;If &quot;Psycho&quot; began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic&quot;, he writes, &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; &quot;carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock&#x27;s film while refusing comforting closure&quot;.

Robin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances. He states that the picture &quot;brings to focus a spirit of negativity ... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness&quot;. Naomi Merritt explores the film&#x27;s representation of &quot;cannibalistic capitalism&quot; in relation to Georges Bataille&#x27;s theory of taboo and transgression. She elaborates on Wood&#x27;s analysis, stating that the Sawyer family&#x27;s values &quot;reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions ... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.&quot;

In Kim Newman&#x27;s view, Hooper&#x27;s presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager. Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of &quot;Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing&quot;, states, &quot;The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody ... this delicate balance is struck in &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.&quot;

===Violence against women===
The underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence. Stephen Prince comments that the horror is &quot;born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms ... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.&quot; As with many slasher films, it incorporates the &quot;final girl&quot; trope—the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters: Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver. Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters. The specific case of &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered—hung on a meathook—and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture. In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film. She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves.

In one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women. On first viewing &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable. Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students. One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally&#x27;s, as the &quot;most freaky thing&quot; in the film.

According to Jesse Stommel of &quot;Bright Lights Film Journal&quot;, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.

===Vegetarianism===
&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; has been described as &quot;the ultimate pro-vegetarian film&quot; due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans&#x27; being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper has confirmed that &quot;it&#x27;s a film about meat&quot; and even gave up meat while making the film, saying, &quot;In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; it&#x27;s about the chain of life and killing sentient beings.&quot; Writer-director Guillermo del Toro became a vegetarian for a time after seeing the film.

==Post-release ==

&quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; has appeared on various home video formats. In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video. The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding &quot;video nasties&quot;. After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was released on LaserDisc in the United States in November 1993. It was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia.

In 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014, a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films&#x27; US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards. In 2024, for the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the film was released to Ultra HD Blu-ray and re-released to VHS in a collector&#x27;s edition.

In 1982, shortly after &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.

The film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. &quot;&quot; (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot;. &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation&quot;, starring Renée Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning&quot;, in 2006. A seventh film, &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot;, was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, &quot;Leatherface&quot;, was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017. Another sequel, &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, was released exclusively on Netflix on February 18, 2022.

===Adaptations===
In 2023, both a tabletop game and a pinball machine based on the film were released. In 2025, a haunted house attraction called Universal Horror Unleashed will feature characters from the film.

<text>The Big Lebowski () is a 1998 crime comedy film written, directed, produced and co-edited by Joel and Ethan Coen. It follows the life of Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity then learns that a millionaire, also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski&#x27;s trophy wife is supposedly kidnapped and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude&#x27;s friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money for the Dude and himself. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Jon Polito and Ben Gazzara also appear in supporting roles.

The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, &quot;We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that&#x27;s ultimately unimportant.&quot; The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.

&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Reviews have since become largely positive and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==

In 1990 or 1991, slacker and avid bowler Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski is attacked in his Los Angeles home by two enforcers for porn kingpin Jackie Treehorn, to whom a different Jeffrey Lebowski&#x27;s wife owes money. One enforcer urinates on the Dude&#x27;s rug before the two realize they have the wrong man and leave.

After consulting his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (&quot;the big Lebowski&quot;), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowski&#x27;s trophy wife and her German nihilist friend Uli. Soon afterward, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and Lebowski hires the Dude to deliver a ransom. That night, another group of thugs ambushes the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski&#x27;s daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it.

Convinced the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter fakes the ransom drop. He and the Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the Dude&#x27;s car trunk. While they are bowling, the car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny&#x27;s. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money her father illegally withdrew from the family&#x27;s charity foundation.

The police recover the Dude&#x27;s car. The briefcase is missing but the Dude finds a clue: a sheet of homework signed by a teenager named Larry Sellers. Walter learns that Larry is the good-for-nothing son of Arthur Digby Sellers, a principal writer for the television show &quot;Branded&quot;, that Walter reveres. The Dude and Walter visit Larry but get no information from him, as Larry remains mute and affectless through Walter&#x27;s increasingly volatile and obscene interrogation. Walter assumes a sports car in front of Larry&#x27;s house was purchased with the ransom and smashes it. The car actually belongs to a neighbor, who smashes the Dude&#x27;s car in return.

Jackie Treehorn&#x27;s thugs abduct the Dude and bring him to the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and Larry has the money then passes out from a spiked drink Treehorn gave him. He is arrested while wandering deliriously in Malibu and evicted by the police chief. On his way home Bunny (whose toes are intact) drives by, unnoticed by the Dude.

Maude is waiting for the Dude at his home and has sex with him, wishing to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact. She tells the Dude that her father has no money of his own; he is dependent on an allowance that Maude gives him from her inheritance from her late mother.

The Dude and Walter confront Lebowski and find Bunny has returned, having simply gone out of town without telling anyone. Bunny&#x27;s nihilist friends took the opportunity to blackmail Lebowski, who in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase never contained any money. An enraged Walter suspects Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair but his condition is real.

Walter and the Dude are bowling when a rival bowler, Jesus Quintana, interrupts them. Walter had previously stated that he could not bowl on Saturdays since he is shomer Shabbos. In a tirade, Quintana implies he does not believe Walter&#x27;s excuse for not bowling on Saturday, threatens Walter and the Dude and storms out. Outside the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dude&#x27;s car and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off but Donny dies from a heart attack. On a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Walter eulogizes Donny&#x27;s passing, but ultimately ruins it by unrelatedly referring to his fallen comrades in Vietnam. As he scatters Donny&#x27;s ashes, they are blown back onto the Dude by an ill-timed updraft. As Walter tries to brush off the ashes, the Dude finally loses his temper and yells at him for everything that has happened. After apologizing and consoling the Dude, the two go bowling.

At the bowling alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movie&#x27;s narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the film and states that while he &quot;didn&#x27;t like seeing Donny go&quot;, he remains inspired by the Dude and that Maude is pregnant with a &quot;little Lebowski on the way.&quot;

=== Development ===
The Dude is mostly inspired by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature, &quot;Blood Simple&quot;. Dowd had been a member of the Seattle Seven, liked to drink white Russians, and was known as &quot;The Dude&quot;. The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that &quot;tied the room together&quot;. Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for &quot;Blood Simple&quot;. Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them many stories from his own life, including some about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car. As in the film, Exline&#x27;s car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader&#x27;s homework under the passenger seat.

Exline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because &quot;it&#x27;s a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation&quot;. The Coens met filmmaker John Milius when they were in Los Angeles making &quot;Barton Fink&quot; and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who also served as a source for creating Jeff Bridges&#x27; character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius&#x27;s film &quot;Big Wednesday&quot;.

Before David Huddleston was cast as &quot;Big&quot; Jeffrey Lebowski, the Coens considered Robert Duvall (who did not like the script), Anthony Hopkins (who was not interested in playing an American), Gene Hackman (who was taking a break from acting at the time), Jack Nicholson (who was not interested, he only wanted to portray Moses), Tommy Lee Jones (who was considered &quot;too young&quot;), Ned Beatty, Michael Caine, Bruce Dern, James Coburn, Charles Durning, Jackie Cooper, Fred Ward, Richard Mulligan, Rod Steiger, Peter Boyle, Lloyd Bridges, Paul Dooley, Pat Hingle, Jonathan Winters, Norman Mailer, George C. Scott, Jerry Falwell, Gore Vidal, Andy Griffith, William F. Buckley, and Ernest Borgnine; the Coens&#x27; top choice was Marlon Brando. Charlize Theron was considered for the role of Bunny Lebowski. David Cross auditioned for the role of Brandt.

According to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann, &quot;who worked naked from a swing&quot;, and on Yoko Ono. The character of Jesus Quintana, a bowling opponent of The Dude&#x27;s team, was inspired in part by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988 at the Public Theater in a play called &quot;Mi Puta Vida&quot; in which he played a pederast-type character, &quot;so we thought, let&#x27;s make Turturro a pederast. It&#x27;ll be something he can really run with,&quot; Joel said in an interview.

The film&#x27;s overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, &quot;We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that&#x27;s why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.&quot; The use of the Stranger&#x27;s voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, &quot;He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it&#x27;s the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn&#x27;t want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It&#x27;s as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain.&quot;

The significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, &quot;important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.&quot;

=== Screenplay ===
The Coen Brothers wrote &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; around the same time as &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for &quot;Roseanne&quot; and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film &quot;Wild Bill&quot;. The Coens decided to make &quot;Fargo&quot; in the meantime. According to Ethan, &quot;the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter&quot;, which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in &quot;Barton Fink&quot;. They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author&#x27;s fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; &quot;is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges&quot;. When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often &quot;encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we&#x27;ve already accumulated pieces for several future movies.&quot; In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an &quot;effete art-world hanger-on&quot;, known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude&#x27;s car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.

=== Pre-production ===
PolyGram and Working Title Films, which had funded &quot;Fargo&quot;, backed &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; with a budget of $15 million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, &quot;we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who&#x27;s going to play the role. In &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn&#x27;t know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.&quot; The Coens originally considered Mel Gibson for the role of The Dude, but he did not take the pitch too seriously. Bridges was hesitant to play the role as he was worried that would be a bad example for his daughters, but his daughter Jessica convinced him to take it after a meeting. In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually &quot;drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.&quot; The actor went into his own closet with the film&#x27;s wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character&#x27;s clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the &quot;Gladiator&quot; or what they called the &quot;Chin Strap&quot; and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut.

For the film&#x27;s look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and for it to be &quot;consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy&quot;, Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film&#x27;s production designer Richard Heinrichs&#x27; design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he &quot;came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior&quot;. This carried over to the film&#x27;s dream sequences. &quot;Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars&quot;, remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn&#x27;s Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn&#x27;s beach party to be Inca-themed, with a &quot;very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there&#x27;s a very sacrificial quality to it.&quot;

Cinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.

=== Principal photography ===
Actual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude&#x27;s Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges &quot;was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, &#x27;Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?&#x27; I&#x27;d reply &#x27;Yes&#x27; usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.&quot; Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997, while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.

Joel Coen said that Jeff Bridges was upset there was no playback monitor so Bridges made them get a playback monitor at the end of the second week of production.

The scenes in Jackie Treehorn&#x27;s house were shot in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.

Deakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude&#x27;s apartment, Deakins said, &quot;it&#x27;s kind of seedy and the light&#x27;s pretty nasty&quot; with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot much of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.

To achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera &quot;on something like a barbecue spit&quot;, according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball.

== Soundtrack ==

The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers&#x27; films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers&#x27; &quot;Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)&quot;, the Gipsy Kings&#x27; cover of &quot;Hotel California&quot;, and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; and &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, &quot;T Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.&quot; Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Man in Me&quot;. However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt&#x27;s cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;, which plays over the film&#x27;s closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, &quot;It got to the part where the Dude says, &#x27;I hate the fuckin&#x27; Eagles, man!&#x27; Klein stands up and says, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, you can have the song!&#x27; That was beautiful.&quot; Burnett was going to be credited on the film as &quot;Music Supervisor&quot;, but asked his credit to be &quot;Music Archivist&quot; because he &quot;hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to think of me as management&quot;.

For Joel, &quot;the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies&quot;. Music defines each character. For example, Bob Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot; was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was Henry Mancini&#x27;s &quot;Lujon&quot; by for Jackie Treehorn. &quot;The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there&#x27;s a musical signature for each of them&quot;, remarked Ethan in an interview.
The character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band Kraftwerk. The album cover of their record &quot;Nagelbett&quot; (&quot;bed of nails&quot;) is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk song and album. In the lyrics the phrase &quot;We believe in nothing&quot; is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn&#x27;s nihilism in the film.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; received its world premiere at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 1998, at the 1,300-capacity Eccles Theater. It was also screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival before opening in the United States and Canada on March 6, 1998, in 1,207 theaters. It grossed $5.5 million on its opening weekend, finishing up with a gross of $18 million in the United States and Canada, just above its US$15 million budget. The film&#x27;s worldwide gross outside of the US and Canada was $28.7 million, (including $2.6 million in the United Kingdom) bringing its worldwide gross to $46.7 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;″s shaggy dog story won&#x27;t satisfy everybody, but those who abide will be treated to a rambling succession of comic delights, with Jeff Bridges&#x27; laconic performance really tying the movie together.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Many critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices. Peter Howell, in his review for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of &quot;Fargo&quot;. There&#x27;s a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps.&quot; Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and in 2011 stated that &quot;it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film.&quot;

Todd McCarthy in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;One of the film&#x27;s indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell&#x27;s original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was &quot;too passive a hero to sustain interest,&quot; but that there was &quot;enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe praised the Coens and &quot;their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana – but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented – the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better.&quot;

Janet Maslin praised Bridges&#x27; performance in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair.&quot; Andrew Sarris, in his review for the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, wrote: &quot;The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there&#x27;ll be anything else like it the rest of this year.&quot; In a five star review for &quot;Empire,&quot; Ian Nathan wrote: &quot;For those who delight in the Coens&#x27; divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana&quot; and &quot;in a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as &quot;weirdly engaging.&quot; In a 2010 review, he raised his original score to four stars out of four and added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; canon.

However, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;: &quot;To be sure, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it represents a moral position—and the Coens&#x27; relative styling of their figures invariably does—it&#x27;s an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie.&quot; Dave Kehr, in his review for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, criticized the film&#x27;s premise as a &quot;tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the film as &quot;a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Since its original release, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; has become a cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves &quot;achievers&quot;. Steve Palopoli wrote about the film&#x27;s emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before.
An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities. The festival&#x27;s main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.

Dudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film&#x27;s main character, was founded in 2005. Also known as &quot;The Church of the Latter-Day Dude&quot; (a name parody of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), the organization has ordained over 220,000 &quot;Dudeist Priests&quot; all over the world via its website.

&quot;The Big Lebowski and Philosophy: Keeping Your Mind Limber with Abiding Wisdom,&quot; published in 2012 by Wiley, is a collection of 18 essays by different writers analyzing the movie&#x27;s philosophical themes of nihilism, war and politics, money and materialism, idealism and morality, and the Dude as the philosopher&#x27;s hero who struggles to live the good life in spite of the challenges he endures.

Two species of African spider are named after the film and main character: &quot;Anelosimus biglebowski&quot; and &quot;Anelosimus dude&quot;, both described in 2006. Additionally, an extinct Permian conifer genus is named after the film in honor of its creators. The first species described within this genus in 2007 is based on 270-million-year-old plant fossils from Texas, and is called &quot;Lebowskia grandifolia&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list. The film was also ranked No. 34 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot; and ranked No. 15 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since &#x27;83&quot; list. In addition, the magazine also ranked The Dude No. 14 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years&quot; poll. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll. Roger Ebert added &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; to his list of &quot;Great Movies&quot; in March 2010.

=== Spin-off ===
The Coen brothers have stated that they will never make a sequel to &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. Nevertheless, John Turturro expressed interest in reprising his role as Jesus Quintana, and in 2014, he announced that he had requested permission to use the character. In August 2016, it was reported that Turturro would reprise his role as Jesus Quintana in &quot;The Jesus Rolls&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, based on the 1974 French film &quot;Going Places&quot;, with Turturro starring, writing, and directing. It was released in 2020. The Coen brothers, although having granted Turturro the right to use the character, were not involved, and no other character from &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; was featured in the film.

=== Stella Artois commercial ===
On January 24, 2019, Jeff Bridges posted a 5-second clip on Twitter with the statement: &quot;Can&#x27;t be living in the past, man. Stay tuned&quot; and showing Bridges as the Dude, walking through a room as a tumbleweed rolls by. The clip was a teaser trailer for an ad during Super Bowl LIII which featured Bridges reprising the role of The Dude for a Stella Artois commercial.

=== Use as social and political analysis ===
The film has been used as a tool for analysis on a number of issues. In September 2008, &quot;Slate&quot; published an article that interpreted &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; as a political critique. The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is &quot;a neocon,&quot; citing the film&#x27;s references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War. The article says Sobchak&#x27;s aggressive and impulsive attitude, which always results in catastrophe, is an allegory of neoconservative foreign policy and its supposed consequences.

A journal article by Brian Wall, published in the feminist journal &quot;Camera Obscura,&quot; uses the film to explain Karl Marx&#x27;s commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism.

In &quot;That Rug Really Tied the Room Together,&quot; first published in 2001, Joseph Natoli argues that The Dude represents a counter narrative to the post-Reaganomic entrepreneurial rush for &quot;return on investment&quot; on display in such films as &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;

The movie has been used as a carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues.

== Home media ==
Universal Studios Home Entertainment released a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD on October 18, 2005, with extra features that included an &quot;introduction by Mortimer Young&quot;, &quot;Jeff Bridges&#x27; Photography&quot;, &quot;Making of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Production Notes&quot;. In addition, a limited-edition &quot;Achiever&#x27;s Edition Gift Set&quot; also included &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; Bowling Shammy Towel, four Collectible Coasters that included photographs and quotable lines from the film, and eight Exclusive Photo Cards from Jeff Bridges&#x27; personal collection.
A &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on September 9, 2008, and features all of the extras from the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; and &quot;The Dude&#x27;s Life: Strikes and Gutters ... Ups and Downs ...

There are both a standard release and a Limited Edition which features &quot;Bowling Ball Packaging&quot; and is individually numbered.

A high-definition version of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; was released by Universal on HD DVD format on June 26, 2007. The film was released in Blu-ray format in Italy by Cecchi Gori.

On August 16, 2011, Universal Pictures released &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; on Blu-ray. The limited-edition package includes a Jeff Bridges photo book, a ten-years-on retrospective, and an in-depth look at the annual Lebowski Fest. The film is also available in the Blu-ray Coen Brothers box set released in the UK; however, this version is region-free and will work in any Blu-ray player.

&quot;The Rock&quot; was dedicated to the memory of Simpson, who died five months before its release. It was released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through the Hollywood Pictures label on June 7, 1996. It received positive reviews and was nominated for Best Sound at the 69th Academy Awards. It earned over $335 million at the box office on a production budget of $75 million, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1996. &quot;The Rock&quot; was remade in India in 2003 as &quot;&quot;.

&quot;The Rock&quot; was the basis for false descriptions of the Iraqi chemical weapons program. Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service was led to believe Saddam Hussein was continuing to produce weapons of mass destruction by a false agent who based his reports on &quot;The Rock&quot;, according to the Chilcot Inquiry.

==Plot==

Disillusioned USMC Brigadier General Francis Hummel and his rogue group of Force Recon marines, including his loyal subordinate Major Tom Baxter, steal 15 rockets filled with lethal VX gas from a U.S. Navy facility. The next day, they seize control of Alcatraz Island, taking the tourists and guards hostage. Hummel contacts the FBI and threatens to launch the rockets at the San Francisco Bay Area unless the government pays him $100 million, of which some will be donated to each family of the men who died during his command but were never compensated.

The Department of Defense and the FBI plot to retake Alcatraz by infiltrating the old tunnel system beneath the island, with Navy SEALs led by Commander Anderson. They recruit FBI chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed to join them and disarm the rockets safely. With no knowledge of the latest architecture of the tunnels, FBI Director Womack and others reluctantly call on the aid of the imprisoned John Mason, a former British MI6 and SAS operative and the only man to escape Alcatraz after he stole a microfilm created by J. Edgar Hoover containing classified U.S. information. Mason refused to reveal the microfilm&#x27;s location after being captured, knowing he would be killed and was imprisoned without trial. Mason agrees after signing a pardon that clears his record, though Womack destroys it shortly after.

Mason escapes and leads the FBI on a car chase, causing a rampage through the city before being caught by Goodspeed when he meets with his estranged daughter, Jade. At the command center, Mason negotiates to join the team heading to Alcatraz. The team infiltrates the prison, but Hummel&#x27;s men are alerted to their presence and ambush them in the shower room. Hummel tries to convince Anderson to surrender, but the zealous Captain Frye and Captain Darrow deliberately cause a shootout that kills Anderson and his team. Mason and Goodspeed managed to evade them. Believing the mission to be a failure, Mason prepares to leave until Goodspeed reveals the truth about the VX, explaining that Mason&#x27;s daughter and his pregnant fiancée, Carla, would be killed as well.

Mason works together with Goodspeed to disable twelve rockets and kill several Marines. After Hummel threatens to execute a hostage, Mason surrenders to stall him while Goodspeed disables another rocket before also being captured. They escape from their cells, but Mason, having assessed Hummel as a soldier who doesn&#x27;t kill innocents, leaves, with Goodspeed continuing on his own. Caught and held at gunpoint, Goodspeed is forced to surrender, but Mason saves him, convinced that Goodspeed&#x27;s unborn child needs its father.

As the ransom deadline passes, Frye and Darrow pressure Hummel into firing a rocket, but he redirects it to detonate in the sea. Hummel explains the rockets were a bluff and that he never intended to kill anyone. Realizing they will not be paid, Frye and Darrow convince the remaining soldiers to mutiny against Hummel and Baxter. Hummel is mortally wounded but tells Goodspeed the location of the last rocket.

An airstrike is initiated to destroy Alcatraz with experimental thermite plasma bombs, which will neutralize the gas but kill everyone on the island. Goodspeed and Mason kill the remaining Marines before signaling to abort the attack. However, one of the bombs was already dropped at the back of the island. The blast throws Goodspeed into the bay, but Mason saves him from drowning.

Goodspeed confirms the mission&#x27;s success to Womack but claims Mason was killed in the explosion before telling Mason that Womack shredded his pardon. The pair part ways amicably, with Mason recommending Goodspeed to a church in Kansas where he kept the microfilm. Sometime later, Goodspeed and his newly wedded wife, Carla, recover the microfilm from the church.

==Production==

=== Writing and pre-production ===
Jonathan Hensleigh participated in writing the script, which became the subject of a dispute with the Writers Guild of America. The spec script (by David Weisberg and Douglas Cook) was reworked by several writers, but other than the original team, Mark Rosner was the only one granted official credit by guild arbitration. The rule is that the credited writing team must contribute 50% of the final script (effectively limiting credits to the screenplay&#x27;s initial authors, plus one re-write team). Despite his work on the script, Hensleigh was not credited in the film. Michael Bay wrote an open letter of protest, in which he criticized the arbitration procedure as a &quot;sham&quot; and a &quot;travesty&quot;. He said Hensleigh had worked closely with him and should have received screen credit.

British screenwriting team Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were brought in at Connery&#x27;s request to rewrite his lines, but ended up altering much of the film&#x27;s dialogue. Quentin Tarantino and Aaron Sorkin were also uncredited script doctors.

=== Casting ===
At one point, Arnold Schwarzenegger was to have played the role of Goodspeed. Schwarzenegger turned the role down because he did not like the script.

=== Filming ===
Most of &quot;The Rock&quot; was shot on location in the Alcatraz Prison on Alcatraz Island. As it is governed by the National Park Service, it was not possible to close Alcatraz, and much of the filming had to accommodate tour parties. The scene in which FBI Director Womack is thrown off the balcony was filmed on location at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. The filming led to numerous calls to the hotel by people who saw a man dangling from the balcony. The closing scene was shot outside the Sacred Heart Mission Church in Saticoy, California.

&quot;The Rock&quot; was Bay&#x27;s first film shot in a widescreen 2.39:1 aspect ratio, via Super 35. On the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD of &quot;Armageddon&quot;, Bay recalls not liking the format, due to the quality of the release prints, and did not touch the format again until &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, at which point the digital intermediate process was available.

There were tensions during shooting between Bay and Walt Disney Studios executives who were supervising the production. On the commentary track for the Criterion Collection DVD, Bay recalls a time when he was preparing to leave the set for a meeting with the executives when he was approached by Connery in golfing attire. Connery, who also produced the film, asked Bay where he was going, and when Bay explained he had a meeting with the executives, Connery asked if he could accompany him. When Bay arrived in the conference room, the executives were surprised when they saw Connery behind him. According to Bay, Connery stood up for Bay and insisted that he was doing a good job and should be left alone.

==Music==
The soundtrack to &quot;The Rock&quot; was released on the same day as the film, June 7, 1996, by Hollywood Records. Hans Zimmer and his longtime collaborator Nick Glennie-Smith were the principal composers, while Harry Gregson-Williams was the score producer, with additional music composed by Don Harper, Steven M. Stern and Gregson-Williams. The film represents the first collaboration between Zimmer and Bay, the composer would write and/or produce the scores for many of Bay’s films moving forward.

==Reception==

===Box office===
For its opening weekend, the film grossed $25 million, beating out &quot;&quot; to reach the number one spot. Upon opening, it surpassed &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; to achieve the highest opening weekend for a live-action Disney film. It would be overtaken by &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; during its second weekend. Produced on a $75 million budget, &quot;The Rock&quot; grossed a total of $134 million in the U.S. and Canada and $201 million elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $335 million. It was the seventh-highest-grossing film for the U.S. box office in 1996, and the fourth highest-grossing U.S. film worldwide that year.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;For visceral thrills, it can&#x27;t be beat. Just don&#x27;t expect &quot;The Rock&quot; to engage your brain.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising it as &quot;a first-rate, slam-bang action thriller with a lot of style and no little humor&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, commenting &quot;The yarn has its share of gaping holes and jaw-dropping improbabilities, but director Michael Bay sweeps them all aside with his never-take-a-breath pacing.&quot; Richard Corliss, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote: &quot;Slick, brutal and almost human, this is the team-spirit action movie &quot;&quot; should have been.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;The Rock&quot; won several minor awards, including &#x27;Best On-Screen Duo&#x27; for Connery and Cage at the MTV Movie Awards. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound (Kevin O&#x27;Connell, Greg P. Russell and Keith A. Wester).

The film was selected for a limited edition DVD release by the Criterion Collection, a distributor of primarily arthouse films it categorizes as &quot;important classic and contemporary films&quot; and &quot;cinema at its finest&quot;. In an essay supporting the selection of &quot;The Rock&quot;, Roger Ebert, who was strongly critical of most of Bay&#x27;s later films, gave the film 3 1/2 out of four stars, calling it &quot;an action picture that rises to the top of the genre because of a literate, witty screenplay and skilled craftsmanship in the direction and special effects.&quot;

In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;The Rock&quot; was listed at 74th place on the list. In 2019, Tom Reimann from Collider ranked &quot;The Rock&quot; as Bay&#x27;s best film and &quot;a perfect snapshot of the height of 90s action movies&quot;.

==Iraqi chemical weapons program==
In September 2002, MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove said the agency had acquired information from a new source revealing that Iraq was stepping up production of chemical and biological warfare agents. The source, who was said to have &quot;direct access&quot;, claimed senior staff were working seven days a week while the regime was concentrating a great deal of effort on the production of anthrax. Dearlove told the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), Sir John Scarlett, that they were &quot;on the edge of (a) significant intel breakthrough&quot; which could be the &quot;key to unlock&quot; Iraq&#x27;s weapons programme.

However, it was noticed that the agent&#x27;s description of glass containers, not typically used for chemical munitions, resembled the nerve gas inaccurately depicted in glass beads or spheres in &quot;The Rock&quot;. By February 2003 – a month before the invasion of Iraq – MI6 concluded that their source had been lying &quot;over a period of time&quot; but failed to inform No 10 or others, even though Prime Minister Tony Blair had been briefed on this intelligence. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, the false claims of weapons of mass destruction were the justification for UK&#x27;s entering the war.

Weisberg said, &quot;What was so amazing was anybody in the poison gas community would immediately know that this was total bullshit – such obvious bullshit&quot;. Weisberg said he was unsurprised a desperate agent might resort to films for inspiration, but dismayed that authorities &quot;didn&#x27;t do apparently the most basic fact-checking or vetting of the information. If you&#x27;d just asked a chemical weapons expert, it would have been immediately obvious it was ludicrous.&quot; Weisberg said he had had some &quot;funny emails&quot; after the report, but he felt &quot;it&#x27;s not a nice legacy for the film&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s tragic that we went to war,&quot; he concluded.

==Unproduced sequel==
In June 2017, director Michael Bay discussed his idea for a follow-up to &quot;The Rock&quot; that never developed past the concept that Goodspeed and Mason are chased by the government after escaping, due to possession of the microfilm as shown in the ending.

<doc id="29789" wikidata="Q49389" url="?curid=29789" title="Tourism">
<text>Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel. UN Tourism defines tourism more generally, in terms which go &quot;beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only&quot;, as people &quot;travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes&quot;. Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller&#x27;s own country) or international. International tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country&#x27;s balance of payments.

Between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009 tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (see Great Recession), and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. These numbers, however, recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization has estimated that global international tourist arrivals might have decreased by 58% to 78% in 2020, leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.

Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to trillion ( billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012. Emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.

Global tourism accounts for 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies. For this reason, many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism to mitigate the negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism. The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs such as the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in 2017. 

Tourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism, as well as the cruise ship industry.

==Etymology==
The English-language word &quot;tourist&quot; was used in 1772 and &quot;tourism&quot; in 1811. These words derive from the word &quot;tour&quot;, which comes from Old English , from Old French , from Latin - &quot;to turn on a lathe&quot;, which is itself from Ancient Greek () - &quot;lathe&quot;.

==Definitions==
In 1936, the League of Nations defined a &quot;foreign tourist&quot; as &quot;someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours&quot;. Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as &quot;the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.&quot; In 1976, the Tourism Society of England&#x27;s definition was: &quot;Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.&quot; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.

In 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its &quot;Recommendations on Tourism Statistics&quot;:
*Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

Other groupings derived from the above grouping:
* National tourism, a combination of domestic and outbound tourism
* Regional tourism, a combination of domestic and inbound tourism
* International tourism, a combination of inbound and outbound tourism

The terms &quot;tourism&quot; and &quot;travel&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms &quot;tourism&quot; and &quot;tourist&quot; are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, &quot;traveller&quot; is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.

There are many varieties of tourism. Of those types, there are multiple forms of outdoor-oriented tourism. Outdoor tourism is generally categorized into nature, eco, and adventure tourism (NEAT). These categories share many similarities but also have specific unique characteristics. Nature tourism generally encompasses tourism activities that would take place outside. Nature tourism appeals to a large audience of tourists and many may not know they are participating in this form of tourism. This type of tourism has a low barrier to entry and is accessible to a large population. Ecotourism focuses on education, maintaining a social responsibility for the community and the environment, as well as centering economic growth around the local economy. Weaver describes ecotourism as sustainable nature-based tourism. Ecotourism is more specific than nature tourism and works toward accomplishing a specific goal through the outdoors. Finally, we have adventure tourism. Adventure tourism is the most extreme of the categories and includes participation in activities and sports that require a level of skill or experience, risk, and physical exertion. Adventure tourism often appeals less to the general public than nature and ecotourism and tends to draw in individuals who partake in such activities with limited marketing.

It is important to understand that these definitions may vary. Perceived risk in adventure tourism is subjective and may change for each individual.

Examples of these tourism types include...

Nature tourism

* Hiking, walking, camping

Ecotourism

* Guided tours focusing on educating, summer camps, outdoor classes

Adventure tourism

* White water rafting, ice climbing, mountaineering

===Tourism products===
According to the World Tourism Organization, a tourism product is:
Tourism product covers a wide variety of services including:
* Accommodation services from low-cost homestays to five-star hotels
* Hospitality services including food and beverage serving centers
* Health care services like massages
* All modes of transport, its booking and rental
* Travel agencies, guided tours and tourist guides
* Cultural services such as religious monuments, museums, and historical places
* Shopping
* Additional travel services like airport parking, airport hotels and travel insurance

===International tourism===

International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders. Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people &quot;traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes&quot;. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.

In 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide. By 2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million, producing $1.22 trillion USD in destination spending. The COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend.

International tourism has significant impacts on the environment, exacerbated in part by the problems created by air travel but also by other issues, including wealthy tourists bringing lifestyles that stress local infrastructure, water and trash systems among others.

==Basis==
Tourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting. According to Dean MacCannell, tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience. By viewing the &quot;exotic,&quot; tourists learn what they themselves are not: that is, they are &quot;un-exotic,&quot; or normal.

According to MacCannell, all modern tourism experiences the &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;exotic&quot; as &quot;developmentally inferior&quot; to the modern—that is, to the lived experience of the tourist.

== History ==
===Ancient===
Travel outside a person&#x27;s local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times travelled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines. As early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travellers. Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC. Ancient Roman tourists during the Republic would visit spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae. They were popular among the rich. The Roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their or . Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola near Trieste. Pausanias wrote his &quot;Description of Greece&quot; in the second century AD. In ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.

===Medieval===
By the post-classical era, many religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam had developed traditions of pilgrimage. &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (), which uses a pilgrimage as a framing device, remains a classic of English literature, and &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (), which holds a seminal place in Chinese literature, has a Buddhist pilgrimage at the center of its narrative.

In medieval Italy, Petrarch wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of Mont Ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized (a &#x27;cold lack of curiosity&#x27;); this account is regarded as one of the first known instances of travel being undertaken for its own sake. The Burgundian poet later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the Jura Mountains.

In China, &#x27;travel record literature&#x27; () became popular during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). Travel writers such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the &#x27;daytrip essay&#x27; &quot;Record of Stone Bell Mountain&quot; by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.
===Grand Tour===

Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, the young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked on a journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility. He travelled through territories of today&#x27;s Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, where he admired the siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary. It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and Thomas Cook made the &quot;Cook&#x27;s Tour&quot; a byword.

The Grand Tour became a status symbol for upper-class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann&#x27;s theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers, and travellers (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France, and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour&#x27;s main destinations were to those centers, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

===Emergence of leisure travel===


Leisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdomthe first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new middle class. Cox &amp; Kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In Nice, France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the &quot;Promenade des Anglais&quot;; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old, well-established palace hotels have names like the &quot;Hotel Bristol&quot;, &quot;Hotel Carlton&quot;, or &quot;Hotel Majestic&quot;reflecting the dominance of English customers.

A pioneer of the travel agency business, Thomas Cook&#x27;s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at Kibworth. With the opening of the extended Midland Counties Railway, he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from Leicester Campbell Street station to a rally in Loughborough, away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains. During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday school children. In 1844, the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition. The following year he started his &quot;grand circular tours&quot; of Europe. During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt, and the United States. Cook established &quot;inclusive independent travel&quot;, whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food, and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

== Economic significance of tourism ==

The tourism industry, as part of the service sector, has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The &quot;Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980&quot; recognized its importance as &quot;an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations.&quot;

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting for 30% of the world&#x27;s trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism. It is also claimed that travel broadens the mind.

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, transits, trains and taxicabs); lodging (including hotels, hostels, homestays, resorts and renting out rooms); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants, casinos, festivals, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest. Tourism frequently also puts additional pressure on the local environment.

The economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets, the cultural property and the nature of the travel location. The World Heritage Sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets. But even a country&#x27;s current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism. For example, the fascination of the British royal family brings millions of tourists to Great Britain every year and thus the economy around £550 million a year. The Habsburg family can be mentioned in Central Europe. According to estimates, the Habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of 60 million euros per year for Vienna alone. The tourist principle &quot;Habsburg sells&quot; applies.

==Tourism, cultural heritage and UNESCO==
Cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism. Cultural tourism is one of the mega-trends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales. As UNESCO is increasingly observing, the cultural heritage is needed for tourism, but also endangered by it. The &quot;ICOMOS - International Cultural Tourism Charter&quot; from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems. As a result of the tourist hazard, for example, the Lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists. Overtourism is an important buzzword in this area. Furthermore, the focus of UNESCO in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population. And there is intensive cooperation between UNESCO, the United Nations, the United Nations peacekeeping and Blue Shield International. There are extensive international and national considerations, studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war. In particular, it is also about training civilian and military personnel. But the involvement of the locals is particularly important. The founding president of Blue Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words: &quot;Without the local community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible&#x27;.

==Cruise ships==

Cruising is a popular form of water tourism. Leisure cruise ships were introduced by the P&amp;O in 1844, sailing from Southampton to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens. In 1891, German businessman Albert Ballin sailed the ship &quot;Augusta Victoria&quot; from Hamburg into the Mediterranean Sea. 29 June 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was &quot;Prinzessin Victoria Luise&quot;, built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.

== Modern day tourism ==

=== Mass tourism ===

Mass tourism and its tourist attractions have emerged as among the most iconic demonstration of western consumer societies. Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals. This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and was pioneered by Thomas Cook. Cook took advantage of Europe&#x27;s rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses, in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used Thomas Cook &amp; Son.

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads. One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In Continental Europe, early seaside resorts included: Heiligendamm, founded in 1793 at the Baltic Sea, being the first seaside resort; Ostend, popularized by the people of Brussels; Boulogne-sur-Mer and Deauville for the Parisians; Taormina in Sicily. In the United States, the first seaside resorts in the European style were at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.

By the mid-20th century, the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the Spanish economic &quot;miracle&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists discussed negative socio-cultural impacts of tourism on host communities. Since the 1980s the positive aspects of tourism began to be recognized as well.

In more recent times, mass tourism is something which has become a negative experience for local residents of cities and destinations that experience heavy tourism, especially in summer months. In July 2024 for example, protests by local residents in Barcelona, Spain were held in the city, where ″thousands of people joined an anti-tourism protest amid rising housing costs.″

===Niche tourism===

Niche tourism refers to the specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics. Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:

* Agritourism
* Birth tourism
* Coastal island tourism 
* Culinary tourism
* Cultural tourism
* Dark tourism (also called &quot;black tourism&quot; or &quot;grief tourism&quot;)
* Eco tourism
* Extreme tourism
* Film tourism
* Geotourism
* Heritage tourism
* LGBT tourism
* Medical tourism
* Nautical tourism
* Pop-culture tourism
* Religious tourism
* Sex tourism
* Slum tourism
* Sports tourism
* Tallest buildings tourism
* Trains tourism (e.g., steam and model railways)
* Virtual tourism
* War tourism
* Wellness tourism
* Wildlife tourism

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term &quot;destination&quot; in the descriptions, such as destination weddings, and terms such as location vacation.

===Winter tourism===

St. Moritz, Switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend. It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.

Major ski resorts are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey), Canada, the United States (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and Lebanon.

==Recent developments==
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialized holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted destination hotels.

The developments in air transport infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. A major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels. The WHO estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time. There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example, some retirement-age people sustain year-round tourism. This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations, such as in Bali and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives. Thousands of people died including many tourists. This, together with the vast clean-up operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like CouchSurfing and airbnb being established. There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in Dubai.

===Sustainable tourism===
===Ecotourism===

Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveller; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities, and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights. &quot;Take only memories and leave only footprints&quot; is a very common slogan in protected areas. Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.

===Volunteer tourism===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying &quot;to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society&quot;. VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism. However, increasingly, voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives, while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist. Increasingly, organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.

===Pro-poor tourism===
Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists&#x27; money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang, Laos. There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.

===Recession tourism===

Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place at once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation. In general, studies have primarily focused on the short-term effects of the crisis on tourism demand, often overlooking the long-term implications for the competitive positioning of the impacted destinations.

===Medical tourism===

When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Eastern Europe, Cuba and Canada where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. dentistry), travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as &quot;medical tourism&quot;.

===Educational tourism===

Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment. Brent W. Ritchie, publisher of Managing Educational Tourism, created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last 15 years. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program. In 2018, one impact was many exchange students traveled to America to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education.

=== Event tourism ===

This type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city/region. This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by Southwest that is hosted in Austin, Texas annually. Every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform. People are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown, which defines event tourism.

===Creative tourism===
Creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism, since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the Grand Tour, which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards, who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the European Commission, including cultural and crafts tourism, known as sustainable tourism. They have defined &quot;creative tourism&quot; as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as UNESCO, who through the Creative Cities Network, have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place. UNESCO wrote in one of its documents: &quot;&#x27;Creative Tourism&#x27; involves more interaction, in which the visitor has an educational, emotional, social, and participative interaction with the place, its living culture, and the people who live there. They feel like a citizen.&quot; Saying so, the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops, classes and activities related to the culture of the destination.

More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.

The growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditoriums).

===Experiential tourism===
Experiential travel (or &quot;immersion travel&quot;) is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its history, people, food and culture.

The term &quot;experiential travel&quot; has been mentioned in publications since 1985, but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later.

===Dark tourism===

One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000) as &quot;dark&quot; tourism. This type of tourism involves visits to &quot;dark&quot; sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide, for example concentration camps. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes youth hostels and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations, trade unions, or in Communist times publicly owned enterprises. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, Walter Hunziker proposed the following definition: &quot;Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low-income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services&quot;.

===Doom tourism===
Also known as &quot;tourism of doom,&quot; or &quot;last chance tourism&quot;, involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of Mount Kilimanjaro, the melting glaciers of Patagonia, or the coral of the Great Barrier Reef) before it is too late. The trend emerged in the 21st century, identified in 2007 by travel trade magazine in 2007 and explored in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, This type of tourism has been on the rise. Some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual&#x27;s carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing. As of 2024, climate change has been making Last Chance Tourism more popular, and riskier. In August 2024, an American was killed visiting an ice cave at the foot of the Breidamerkurjokull glacier.

===Religious tourism===

Religious tourism, in particular pilgrimage, can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion. Religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.

=== DNA tourism ===
DNA tourism, also called &quot;ancestry tourism&quot; or &quot;heritage travel&quot;, is tourism based on DNA testing. These tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from, or where their relatives reside, based on the results of DNA tests. DNA tourism became a growing trend in 2019.

==Impacts on destinations==

== Tourism industry growth ==
In 2004 the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4 percent. With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.

As a result of the late-2000s recession, international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7 percent during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8 percent. By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6 percent over six quarters. While this was considerably milder than what occurred after the September 11 attacks, the decline was at twice the rate, as real GDP has fallen. However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. The UNWTO has noted, that tourists increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury, and that this shift in attitudes may explain tourist numbers recovering globally in 2009.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context. Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

=== Liabilities and insurance ===
After the September 11 attacks the tourism industry operators had to consider the health and safety of tourists because it became increasingly difficult to obtain liability insurance. The organisations willing to provide insurance to tourism industry operators required, that operators put in place best practice risk management structures. This included, that whatever was promised in the contract about the holiday was really delivered by the operator.

=== Space tourism ===


There has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030. The space market has been around since 1979, however, there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport on its Soyuz and the Chinese Shenzhou being the only two spacecrafts suitable for human travel . In April 2001, Dennis Tito, a customer of the Russian Soyuz became the first tourist to visit space. In May 2011, Virgin Galactic launched its SpaceShipTwo plane that allows people to travel 2 hours space at the advertised price of $200,000 per seat. A challenge that the commercial space tourism industry faces is to be able to have fundings from private investments needed to lower the cost of access to space in addition to being able to encourage both private and public sector support to increase capacity to allow commercial passengers. With space tourism still being new concept, there are many factors that needs to be considered for the industry. From its actual demand to its risk factor to its liabilities and insurance issues, there are still a lot of research that needs to be conducted. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that the industry is expected to grow by 18% - 26% per year during 2020 to 2030.

=== Sports tourism ===

Sports tourism that attracts spectators is associated with negative impacts such as traffic congestion, vandalism, and anti-social behaviour. Sports tourist destinations may therefore be subject public displays of resentment and antagonism even though the host community benefits substantially. Sports tourism growth and decline can be subject to international commercial sporting events. For example, the irreversible environmental damage caused by the 1992 Winter Olympics is cited as a reason for stagnating ski tourism.

=== Security in Tourism ===
Security in Tourism is a sub-discipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists. Risks are evaluated by their impact and nature. Tourism security includes methodologies, theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations. Three academic waves are significant in tourism security: risk perception theory, disaster management, and post-disaster consumption.

Andrew Spencer &amp; Peter Tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define. It includes a set of sub-disciplines, and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry. The rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide. Some threats include, for example, terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between delivery-country and receiving-tourist countries. Today, island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations 

=== Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic ===
In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) reported a 70% decrease in international travel in 2020, where 165 of 217 worldwide destinations completely stopped international tourism by April 2020. Since every country imposes different travel restrictions, it makes traveling plans complicated and often too difficult to figure out, thus the willingness to travel for the general population decreases. It is estimated that the United States lost 147 billion U.S. dollars in revenue from tourism between January and October 2020. Spain had the next highest loss of revenue at around 46.7 billion U.S dollars, and countries in Africa collectively lost about 55 billion dollars during April and June 2020.

<text>The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.

The title refers to the story&#x27;s main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron, who in an earlier age created the One Ring, allowing him to rule the other Rings of Power given to men, dwarves, and elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Aiding the hobbits are the wizard Gandalf, the men Aragorn and Boromir, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli, who unite as the Company of the Ring in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron&#x27;s armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.

Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be a single volume in a two-volume set, along with &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. For economic reasons, it was first published over the course of a year, from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955, in three volumes rather than one, under the titles &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;; &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; appeared only after the author&#x27;s death. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of chronologies, genealogies, and linguistic information. These three volumes were later published as a boxed set in 1957, and even finally as a single volume in 1968, following the author&#x27;s original intent.

Tolkien&#x27;s work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes, literary devices, and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written, and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien&#x27;s works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games. 

Award-winning adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain&#x27;s best-loved novel of all time in a 2003 poll by the BBC called The Big Read.

== Plot ==

=== &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; ===

Bilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir. Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the Dark Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee. They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving Tom&#x27;s house, they are caught by a barrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight&#x27;s spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight&#x27;s hoard. 
The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell. At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb &quot;athelas&quot;. They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.

Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond&#x27;s care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron. The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron&#x27;s hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor.
The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West.
After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through the Mines of Moria. They learn that Balin and his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed by Orcs. They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her.
Galadriel&#x27;s husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down the River Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts him.

=== &quot;The Two Towers&quot; ===


A party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. The Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards. They ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees King Théoden from the influence of Saruman&#x27;s spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm&#x27;s Deep; Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents destroy Isengard, Saruman&#x27;s stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden&#x27;s aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm&#x27;s Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is a &quot;palantír&quot;, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.
Frodo and Sam struggle through the barren hills of the Emyn Muil. They realize they are being tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to steal the Ring.
The Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded, so they travel south through Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. They are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir&#x27;s brother, and brought to the secret fastness of Henneth Annûn. Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying orders to arrest strangers, releases them. Gollum guides the hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol. Frodo holds up his gift, the Phial of Galadriel, which holds the light of Eärendil&#x27;s star: it drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts through a giant web using his sword Sting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam picks up Sting and the Phial. He wounds the monster. Believing Frodo to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs take Frodo; Sam overhears them saying that Frodo is still alive.

=== &quot;The Return of the King&quot; ===


Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor&#x27;s aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city&#x27;s gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs&#x27; ships up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden&#x27;s niece Éowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron&#x27;s army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Théoden is killed. Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.
Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer: he claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum reappears. He bites off Frodo&#x27;s Ring finger. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power. All he created collapses, the Nazgûl perish, and Aragorn wins the battle of the Morannon. Aragorn is crowned King, and weds Arwen, Elrond&#x27;s daughter. Théoden is buried; Éomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Éowyn is engaged to Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn. The four hobbits travel home, only to find it has been taken over by Saruman&#x27;s men. Merry raises a rebellion and scours the Shire. Saruman reveals crimes that Wormtongue has done, causing Wormtongue to turn on Saruman and kill him in front of Bag End, Frodo&#x27;s home. Wormtongue then is killed by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts to heal the Shire. Frodo, broken by the quest, leaves a few years later, sailing from the Grey Havens over the Sea to find peace.

Extensive appendices outline more details of the history, cultures, genealogies, and languages that Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth. In antiquarian style, they provide background details for the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the stories.

=== Frame story ===

Tolkien presents &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; within a fictional frame story where he is not the original author, but merely the translator of part of an ancient document, the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;. That book is modelled on the real &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;, which similarly presents an older mythology. Various details of the frame story appear in the Prologue, its &quot;Note on Shire Records&quot;, and in the Appendices, notably Appendix F. In this frame story, the &quot;Red Book&quot; is the purported source of Tolkien&#x27;s other works relating to Middle-earth: &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Background ===

Although a major work in itself, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was only the last movement of a much older set of narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, in a process he described as &quot;mythopoeia&quot;.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; started as a sequel to Tolkien&#x27;s work &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, published in 1937. The popularity of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; led George Allen &amp; Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, putting &quot;Roverandom&quot; on hold, and accepting &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, Allen &amp; Unwin continued to ask for more stories about hobbits.

=== Writing ===

Persuaded by his publishers, he started &quot;a new Hobbit&quot; in December 1937. After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (&quot;A Long-Expected Party&quot;) arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo&#x27;s disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the title &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; did not come until the spring of 1938. Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work. As the story progressed, he brought in elements from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; mythology.

Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, marked exams to bring in a little extra income, and wrote many drafts. Tolkien abandoned &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; during most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944, as a serial for his son Christopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with the Royal Air Force. Tolkien made another major effort in 1946 and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947. The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949. The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection at Marquette University.

=== Poetry ===

Unusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry. These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy). Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry. Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds. The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien&#x27;s prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil&#x27;s speech in metre.

=== Illustrations ===

Tolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space. He prepared a variety of types of illustration – maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul – but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of Durin were included in the first edition.

The hardback editions sometimes had cover illustrations by Tolkien, sometimes by other artists. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Barbara Remington&#x27;s cover designs for Ballantine&#x27;s paperback editions &quot;achieved mass-cult status in the 1960s, particularly on college campuses&quot; across America.

=== Influences ===

Tolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, Christianity, mythology and Germanic heroic legend including the Norse &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-century epic poetry &quot;The Kalevala&quot; by Elias Lönnrot, and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.
He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology.
Commentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien&#x27;s writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard. The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence, and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt&#x27;s home.
Tolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War. Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces. The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry.

=== Themes ===

Scholars and critics have identified many themes in the book with its complex interlaced narrative, including a reversed quest, the struggle of good and evil, death and immortality, fate and free will, the addictive danger of power, and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering.
There is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape. Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality. To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred &quot;history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.&quot;

Some commentators have criticized the book for being a story about men for boys, with no significant women; or about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; of containing no sign of religion; or of racism. Other commentators responded by noting that there are three powerful women in the book, Galadriel, Éowyn, and Arwen; that life, even in rural Hobbiton, is not idealized; that Christianity is a pervasive theme; and that Tolkien was sharply anti-racist both in peacetime and during the Second World War, while Middle-earth is evidently polycultural.

== Publication history ==

A dispute with his publisher, George Allen &amp; Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950. Tolkien intended &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; but Allen &amp; Unwin were unwilling to do this. After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; itself &quot;urgently wanted cutting&quot;, Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952. Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, &quot;I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff&quot;, fearing his work would never see the light of day.

For publication, the work was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales: &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (Books I and II), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (Books III and IV), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (Books V and VI plus six appendices). Delays in producing appendices, maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped – on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Houghton Mifflin published &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; on 21 October 1954, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; on 21 April 1955, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; on 5 January 1956.

&quot;The Return of the King&quot; was especially delayed as Tolkien revised the ending and prepared appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the title &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher&#x27;s preference. Tolkien wrote that the title &quot;The Two Towers&quot; &quot;can be left ambiguous&quot;, but considered naming the two as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol. However, a month later he wrote a note published at the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc.

Tolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: Vol. 1, &quot;The Ring Sets Out&quot; and &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;; Vol. 2, &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot; and &quot;The Ring Goes East&quot;; Vol. 3, &quot;The War of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The End of the Third Age&quot;. However, these individual book titles were dropped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien suggested the volume titles: Vol. 1, &quot;The Shadow Grows&quot;; Vol. 2, &quot;The Ring in the Shadow&quot;; Vol. 3, &quot;The War of the Ring&quot; or &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

Because the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; &quot;trilogy&quot;. In a letter to the poet W. H. Auden, who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956, Tolkien himself made use of the term &quot;trilogy&quot; for the work though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book. It is often called a novel; however, Tolkien objected to this term as he viewed it as a heroic romance.

The books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits. It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with at least 50 million copies sold by 2003 and over 150 million copies sold by 2007. The work was published in the UK by Allen &amp; Unwin until 1990, when the publisher and its assets were acquired by HarperCollins.

=== Editions and revisions ===


In the early 1960s Donald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisher Ace Books, claimed that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was not protected in the United States under American copyright law because Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States. Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without paying royalties to him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection. Grass-roots pressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.

Authorized editions followed from Ballantine Books and Houghton Mifflin to tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, published in 1965. The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, selling a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On 4 September 1966, the novel debuted on &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by 4 December, a position it held for eight weeks. Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised by Christopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.

In 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition, Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected. The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Yet more corrections were made in the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014. Several editions, including the 50th Anniversary Edition, print the whole work in one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.

===Posthumous publication of drafts===

From 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text&#x27;s development, in volumes 6–9 of his &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; series. The four volumes carry the titles &quot;The Return of the Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot;, &quot;The War of the Ring&quot;, and &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;.

=== Translations ===


The work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38, and reportedly at least 70, languages. Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by Åke Ohlmarks, Tolkien wrote a &quot;Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1967). Because &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; purports to be a translation of the fictitious &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, using the English language to represent the Westron of the &quot;original&quot;, Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.

== Reception ==

=== 1950s ===

Early reviews of the work were mixed. The initial review in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century&quot;. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; echoed this sentiment, stating that &quot;the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and those who are going to read them.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; appeared to predict the books&#x27; popularity, writing in its review that they were &quot;destined to outlast our time&quot;. W. H. Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien&#x27;s and an admirer of his writings, regarded &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Kenneth F. Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, &quot;... if you don&#x27;t read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear&quot;. On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, writing that &quot;All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes ... and will never come to puberty ... Hardly one of them knows anything about women&quot;, causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher. In 1956, the literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote a review entitled &quot;Oo, Those Awful Orcs!&quot;, calling Tolkien&#x27;s work &quot;juvenile trash&quot;, and saying &quot;Dr. Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.&quot;

Within Tolkien&#x27;s literary group, The Inklings, the work had a mixed reception. Hugo Dyson complained loudly at its readings, whereas C. S. Lewis had very different feelings, writing, &quot;here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.&quot; Lewis observed that the writing is rich, in that some of the &#x27;good&#x27; characters have darker sides, and likewise some of the villains have &quot;good impulses&quot;. Despite the mixed reviews and the lack of a paperback until the 1960s, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; initially sold well in hardback.

=== Later ===

Judith Shulevitz, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, criticized the &quot;pedantry&quot; of Tolkien&#x27;s literary style, saying that he &quot;formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself&quot;. The critic Richard Jenkyns, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself were, according to Jenkyns, &quot;anemic, and lacking in fibre&quot;. The science fiction author David Brin interprets the work as holding unquestioning devotion to a traditional hierarchical social structure. In his essay &quot;Epic Pooh&quot;, fantasy author Michael Moorcock critiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the &quot;paternalism&quot; of the narrative voice and the power structures in the narrative. Tom Shippey, like Tolkien an English philologist, notes the wide gulf between Tolkien&#x27;s supporters, both popular and academic, and his literary detractors, and attempts to explain in detail both why the literary establishment disliked &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the work&#x27;s subtlety, themes, and merits, including the impression of depth that it conveys. The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury analysed Tolkien&#x27;s prose style in detail, showing that it was generally quite plain, varying to suit the voices of the different characters, and rising to a heroic register for special moments.

=== Awards ===

In 1957, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was awarded the International Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of the Ace Books and Ballantine paperbacks helped &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; become immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by all of three different measures: sales, library borrowings, and reader surveys. In the 2003 &quot;Big Read&quot; survey conducted in Britain by the BBC, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was found to be the &quot;Nation&#x27;s best-loved book&quot;. In similar 2004 polls both Germany and Australia chose &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as their favourite book. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was judged to be their favourite &quot;book of the millennium&quot;. In 2019, the BBC News listed &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; on its list of the &quot;100 most inspiring novels&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has been adapted into various media, including radio, stage, motion pictures, and videogames.

=== Radio ===

The book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio station WBAI produced a short radio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments.

=== Motion pictures ===

A variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien&#x27;s book, among them Stanley Kubrick, who thought it unfilmable, Michelangelo Antonioni, Jim Henson, Heinz Edelmann, and John Boorman. A Swedish live action television film, &quot;Sagan om ringen&quot;, was broadcast in 1971. In 1978, Ralph Bakshi made an animated film version covering &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and part of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, to mixed reviews. In 1980, Rankin/Bass released an animated TV special based on the closing chapters of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, gaining mixed reviews. In Finland, a live action television miniseries, &quot;Hobitit&quot;, was broadcast in 1993 based on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with a flashback to Bilbo&#x27;s encounter with Gollum in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

A far more successful adaptation was Peter Jackson&#x27;s live action &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, produced by New Line Cinema and released in three instalments as &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003). All three parts won multiple Academy Awards, including consecutive Best Picture nominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11 Oscars (something only two other films in history, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;, have accomplished), including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. Commentators including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are divided on how faithfully Jackson adapted Tolkien&#x27;s work, or whether a film version is inevitably different, and if so the reasons for any changes, and the effectiveness of the result.

&quot;The Hunt for Gollum&quot;, a 2009 film by Chris Bouchard, and the 2009 &quot;Born of Hope&quot;, written by Paula DiSante and directed by Kate Madison, are fan films based on details in the appendices of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

From September 2022, Amazon has been presenting a multi-season television series of stories, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. It is set at the beginning of the Second Age, long before the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, based on materials in the novel&#x27;s appendices.

In early 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that multiple new movies set in Middle-earth are in development, and will be produced along with New Line Cinema and Freemode.

=== Audiobooks ===

In 1990, Recorded Books published an audio version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, read by the British actor Rob Inglis. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, was first staged in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2006 and opened in London in June 2007; it was a commercial failure.

In 2013, the artist Phil Dragash recorded the whole of the book, using the score from Peter Jackson&#x27;s movies.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, Andy Serkis read the entire book of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; online to raise money for charity. He then recorded the work again as an audiobook. The cover art was done by Alan Lee. In 2021, Serkis recorded &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novels.

== Legacy ==

=== Influence on fantasy ===

The enormous popularity of Tolkien&#x27;s work expanded the demand for fantasy. Largely thanks to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitations, such as &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, which Lin Carter called &quot;the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,&quot; as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such as &quot;The Last Ringbearer&quot;.
&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; among other fantasy books. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However, Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.
Because Dungeons &amp; Dragons has gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing video games, the influence of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; extends to many of them, with titles such as &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;EverQuest&quot;, the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series, and &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series of games as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.

=== Music ===

In 1965, the composer and songwriter Donald Swann, best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders &amp; Swann, set six poems from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and one from &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; (&quot;Errantry&quot;) to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for &quot;Namárië&quot; (Galadriel&#x27;s lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted. The songs were published in 1967 as &quot;The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle&quot;, and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as &quot;Poems and Songs of Middle Earth&quot;.

Rock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy-embracing counter-culture of the time. The British rock band Led Zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, such as mentioning Gollum and Mordor in &quot;Ramble On&quot;, the Misty Mountains in &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, and Ringwraiths in &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;. In 1970, the Swedish musician Bo Hansson released an instrumental concept album entitled &quot;Sagan om ringen&quot; (&quot;The Saga of the Ring&quot;, the title of the Swedish translation at the time). The album was subsequently released internationally as &quot;Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1972. From the 1980s onwards, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien.

In 1988, the Dutch composer and trombonist Johan de Meij completed his &quot;Symphony No. 1 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;. It had 5 movements, titled &quot;Gandalf&quot;, &quot;Lothlórien&quot;, &quot;Gollum&quot;, &quot;Journey in the Dark&quot;, and &quot;Hobbits&quot;.

The 1991 album &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; by the Irish musician Enya contains an instrumental titled &quot;Lothlórien&quot;, in reference to the home of the wood-elves.

=== Impact on popular culture ===

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga. &quot;Frodo Lives!&quot; and &quot;Gandalf for President&quot; were two phrases popular among United States Tolkien fans during this time. Its impact is such that the words &quot;Tolkienian&quot; and &quot;Tolkienesque&quot; have entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as &quot;Orc&quot; and &quot;Warg&quot;, have become widespread in that domain.
Among its effects are numerous parodies, especially &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages.

In 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights to &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to United Artists under an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of £10,000 () plus a 7.5% royalty after costs, payable to Allen &amp; Unwin and the author. In 1976, three years after the author&#x27;s death, United Artists sold the rights to Saul Zaentz Company, who now trade as Tolkien Enterprises. Since then all &quot;authorised&quot; merchandise has been signed off by Tolkien Enterprises, although the intellectual property rights of the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.

Outside commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, with posters and calendars created by illustrators such as Barbara Remington.

The work was named Britain&#x27;s best novel of all time in the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read. In 2015, the BBC ranked &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; 26th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels. It was included in &quot;Le Monde&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Books of the Century&quot;.

<doc id="29801" wikidata="Q45354" url="?curid=29801" title="The Doors">
<text>The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, comprising vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, primarily due to Morrison&#x27;s lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era&#x27;s counterculture.

The band took its name from the title of the English writer Aldous Huxley&#x27;s book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, itself a reference to a quote by the English poet William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their debut &quot;The Doors&quot; (1967), &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1967), and &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; (1971). Dubbed the &quot;Kings of Acid Rock&quot;, they were one of the most successful bands of their time and by 1972, the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.

Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio, releasing two more albums until disbanding in 1973. In 1978, they reformed for the album &quot;An American Prayer&quot;, which combined new music with Morrison&#x27;s recitings of his poetry recorded in 1969 and 1970. They reunited again briefly in 1993 when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and for several one-off projects in the 21st century. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as &quot;The Doors of the 21st Century&quot;. Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band&#x27;s name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek&#x27;s death in 2013.

The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified Gold LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 34 million albums in the United States and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which ranked them 41st on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins (July 1965 – August 1966) ===

The Doors began with a chance meeting between acquaintances Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach in July 1965. They recognized each other as they had both attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. Morrison confided in Manzarek that he had been writing songs. As Morrison would later relate to Jerry Hopkins in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Those first five or six songs I wrote, I was just taking notes at a fantastic rock concert that was going on inside my head. And once I&#x27;d written the songs, I had to sing them.&quot; With Manzarek&#x27;s encouragement, Morrison sang the opening words of &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;: &quot;Let&#x27;s swim to the moon, let&#x27;s climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide.&quot; Manzarek was inspired, thinking of the music he could play to accompany these &quot;cool and spooky&quot; lyrics.

Manzarek was then in an unsuccessful band called Rick &amp; the Ravens with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes. Densmore joined the group later in August 1965. Together, they combined varied musical backgrounds, from jazz, rock, blues, and folk music idioms. The five, along with bass player Patty Sullivan, and now christened the Doors, recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965, at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles. The band took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s book &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, itself derived from a line in William Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;: &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite&quot;. In late 1965, after Manzarek&#x27;s two brothers left, guitarist Robby Krieger joined.
From February to May 1966, the group had a residency at the &quot;rundown&quot; and &quot;sleazy&quot; Los Angeles club London Fog, appearing on the bill with &quot;Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer&quot;. The experience gave Morrison confidence to perform in front of a live audience, and the band as a whole to develop and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire&quot; into the pieces that would appear on their debut album. Manzarek later said that at the London Fog the band &quot;became this collective entity, this unit of oneness ... that is where the magic began to happen.&quot; The group soon graduated to the more esteemed Whisky a Go Go after being booked by Ronnie Haran, where they were the house band (starting from May 1966), supporting acts, including Van Morrison&#x27;s group Them. On their last night together the two bands joined up for &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; and a twenty-minute jam session of &quot;Gloria&quot;.

On August 10, 1966, they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman, who was present at the recommendation of Love singer Arthur Lee, whose group was with Elektra Records. After Holzman and producer Paul A. Rothchild saw two sets of the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go, they signed them to the Elektra Records label on August 18 — the start of a long and successful partnership with Rothchild and sound engineer Bruce Botnick. The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966, when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the Greek myth of Oedipus during &quot;The End&quot;.

=== &quot;The Doors&quot; and &quot;Strange Days&quot; (August 1966 – December 1967) ===

The Doors recorded their self-titled debut album around August 1966, at Sunset Sound Studios. The record was officially released in the first week of January 1967. It included the nearly 12-minute musical drama &quot;The End&quot;. In November 1966, Mark Abramson directed a promotional film for the lead single &quot;Break On Through (To the Other Side)&quot;. The group also made several television appearances, such as on &quot;Shebang&quot;, a Los Angeles television show, miming to a playback of &quot;Break On Through&quot;. In early 1967, the group appeared on &quot;The Clay Cole Show&quot; (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6 p.m. on WPIX Channel 11 out of New York City) where they performed their single &quot;Break On Through&quot;. Since the single acquired only minor recognition, the band turned to &quot;Light My Fire&quot;; it became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, selling over one million copies.

From March 7 to 11, 1967, the Doors performed at the Matrix Club in San Francisco. The March 7 and 10 shows were recorded by Peter Abram, co-owner of the Matrix. These recordings are notable as they are among the earliest live recordings of the band to circulate. On November 18, 2008, the Doors published a compilation of these recordings, &quot;Live at the Matrix 1967&quot;, on the band&#x27;s boutique Bright Midnight Archives label.

On August 25, 1967, they appeared on American television, guest-starring on the variety TV series &quot;Malibu U&quot;, performing &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, though they did not appear live. The band is seen on a beach and Morrison is lip-synching the song in playback. The music video did not gain any commercial success and the performance fell into relative obscurity. It was not until they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; that they gained attention on television.

The Doors made their international television debut on October 16, 1967, performing a live version of &quot;The End&quot; for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) at their Parliament Street Colour Studio in Toronto. It was recorded in September when they were in Toronto and transmitted on the show &quot;O&#x27;Keefe Centre Presents&quot;. The misconception that it was at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre stems mostly from the title, as the venue shown in the video has a dance floor, which the Centre didn&#x27;t have. But after its initial broadcasts, the performance remained unreleased except in bootleg form until the release of &quot;The Doors Soundstage Performances&quot; DVD in 2002.

On September 17, 1967, the Doors gave a memorable performance of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. According to Manzarek, network executives asked that the word &quot;higher&quot; be removed, due to a possible reference to drug use. The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (the group has given conflicting accounts). Either way, &quot;higher&quot; was sung out on national television, and the show&#x27;s host, Ed Sullivan, canceled another six shows that had been planned. After the program&#x27;s producer told the band they would never perform on the show again, Morrison reportedly replied: &quot;Hey man. We just &quot;did&quot; the Sullivan Show.&quot;

On December 24, the Doors performed &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; live for &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. Their performance was taped for later broadcast. From December 26 to 28, the group played at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco; during one set, in the middle of &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, the band stopped performing to watch themselves on &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot; on a television set wheeled onto the stage.

The Doors spent several weeks in Sunset Studios in Los Angeles recording their second album, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, experimenting with the new technology, notably the Moog synthesizer they now had available. The commercial success of &quot;Strange Days&quot; was middling, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart but quickly dropping, along with a series of underperforming singles. The chorus from the album&#x27;s single &quot;People Are Strange&quot; inspired the name of the 2009 documentary of the Doors, &quot;When You&#x27;re Strange&quot;.

Although session musician Larry Knechtel had occasionally contributed bass on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Strange Days&quot; was the first Doors album recorded with a studio musician, playing bass on the majority of the record, and this continued on all subsequent studio albums. Manzarek explained that his keyboard bass was well-suited for live situations but that it lacked the &quot;articulation&quot; needed for studio recording. Douglas Lubahn played on &quot;Strange Days&quot; and the next two albums; but the band used several other musicians for this role, often using more than one bassist on the same album. Kerry Magness, Leroy Vinnegar, Harvey Brooks, Ray Neopolitan, Lonnie Mack, Jerry Scheff, Jack Conrad (who played a major role in the post Morrison years touring with the group in 1971 and 1972), Chris Ethridge, Charles Larkey and Leland Sklar are credited as bassists who worked with the band.

=== New Haven incident (December 1967) ===

On December 9, 1967, the Doors performed a now-infamous concert at New Haven Arena in New Haven, Connecticut, which ended abruptly when Morrison was arrested by local police. Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a live performance. Prior to the start of the concert, Morrison was either having a private conversation with or kissing a female fan backstage in a bathroom shower stall when a police officer happened upon them. Unaware that he was the lead singer of the band, the officer told Morrison and the fan to leave, to which Morrison said, &quot;Eat it.&quot; The policeman took out a can of mace and warned Morrison, &quot;Last chance&quot;, to which Morrison replied, &quot;Last chance to eat it.&quot; There is some discrepancy as to what happened next: according to &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, the fan ran away and Morrison was maced; but Manzarek recounts in his book that both Morrison and the fan were sprayed.

The Doors&#x27; main act was delayed for an hour while Morrison recovered, after which the band took the stage very late. According to music journalist Gillian G. Gaar, the police still did not consider the issue resolved and wanted to charge him. Halfway through the first set, Morrison proceeded to create an improvised song about his experience with the &quot;little man in blue&quot;. It was an obscenity-laced account to the audience, describing what had happened backstage and taunting the police, who were surrounding the stage. Later, the police lieutenant approached Morrison, during which Morrison thrust the microphone against his mouth and remarked, &quot;Say your thing, man.&quot; The concert came to an abrupt end when Morrison was dragged from the stage by the police. The audience, already restless from waiting so long for the band to perform, became unruly. Morrison was taken to a local police station, photographed and booked on charges of inciting a riot, indecency and public obscenity. Charges against Morrison, as well as those against three journalists also arrested in the incident (Mike Zwerin, Yvonne Chabrier and Tim Page), were dropped several weeks later for lack of evidence.

=== &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; (April–December 1968) ===

Recording of the group&#x27;s third album in April 1968 was marred by tension as a result of Morrison&#x27;s increasing dependence on alcohol and the rejection of the 17-minute &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; by band producer Paul Rothchild, who considered the work not commercial enough. Approaching the height of their popularity, the Doors played a series of outdoor shows that led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at Chicago Coliseum on May 10.

The band began to branch out from their initial form for this third LP, and began writing new material. &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; became their first and only album to reach number 1 on the US charts, and the single &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, the publisher of the Kinks&#x27; 1964 hit &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter Ray Davies ultimately chose not to sue. Kinks guitarist Dave Davies was particularly irritated by the similarity. In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary &quot;The Doors Are Open&quot;.
A month after a riotous concert at the Singer Bowl in New York City, the group flew to Great Britain for their first performance outside North America. They held a press conference at the ICA Gallery in London and played shows at the Roundhouse. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;The Doors Are Open&quot;, later released on video. They played dates in Europe, along with Jefferson Airplane, including a show in Amsterdam where Morrison collapsed on stage after a drug binge (including marijuana, hashish and unspecified pills).
The group flew back to the United States and played nine more dates before returning to work in November on their fourth LP. They ended the year with a successful new single, &quot;Touch Me&quot; (released in December 1968), which reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 in the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 in early 1969; this was the group&#x27;s third and last American number-one single.

=== Miami incident (March 1969) ===
On March 1, 1969, at the Dinner Key Auditorium in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami, Florida, the Doors gave the most controversial and consequential performance of their career, one that nearly &quot;derailed the band&quot;. The auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar that had no air conditioning on that hot night, and the seats had been removed by the promoter to boost ticket sales.

Morrison had been drinking all day and had missed connecting flights to Miami. By the time he arrived, drunk, the concert was over an hour late. The restless crowd of 12,000, packed into a facility designed to hold 7,000, was subjected to undue silences in Morrison&#x27;s singing, which strained the music from the beginning of the performance. Morrison had recently attended a play by an experimental acting company the Living Theatre and was inspired by their &quot;antagonistic&quot; style of performance art. Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, &quot;Love me. I can&#x27;t take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin&#x27;. Ain&#x27;t nobody gonna love my ass?&quot; and alternately, &quot;You&#x27;re all a bunch of fuckin&#x27; idiots!&quot; and &quot;You’re all a bunch of slaves!&quot; while screaming &quot;What are you gonna do about it?&quot; over and over again.

As the band began their second song, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, Morrison started shouting in protest, forcing the band to a halt. At one point, Morrison removed the hat of an onstage police officer and threw it into the crowd; the officer reacted by taking Morrison&#x27;s hat and throwing it in the same direction. Manager Bill Siddons recalled, &quot;The gig was a bizarre, circus-like thing, there was this guy carrying a sheep and the wildest people that I&#x27;d ever seen.&quot; Equipment chief Vince Treanor said, &quot;Somebody jumped up and poured champagne on Jim so he took his shirt off, he was soaking wet. &#x27;Let&#x27;s see a little skin, let&#x27;s get naked,&#x27; he said, and the audience started taking their clothes off.&quot; Having removed his shirt, Morrison held it in front of his groin area and started to make hand movements behind it. Manzarek described the incident as a mass &quot;religious hallucination&quot;.

On March 5, the Dade County Sheriff&#x27;s office issued a warrant for Morrison&#x27;s arrest, claiming Morrison had exposed his penis while on stage, shouted obscenities to the crowd, simulated oral sex on Krieger, and was drunk at the time of his performance. Morrison turned down a plea bargain that required the Doors to perform a free Miami concert. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail with hard labor, and ordered to pay a $500 fine. Morrison remained free, pending an appeal of his conviction, and died before the matter was legally resolved. In 2007 Florida Governor Charlie Crist suggested the possibility of a posthumous pardon for Morrison, which was announced as successful on December 9, 2010. Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek have denied the allegation that Morrison exposed himself on stage that night.

=== &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; (May–July 1969) ===
Morrison, who was increasingly distancing himself from the music, announced to the other Doors members his intention to quit the group; Manzarek convinced him to stay for six more months, ahead of completing &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, the Doors&#x27; forthcoming album.
Released in July 1969, &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; was their first-and-only to feature brass and string arrangements. The concept was suggested by Rothchild to the band, after listening to many examples by various groups who also explored the same radical departure. Both jazz-influenced Densmore and Manzarek agreed with the recommendation, but Morrison declined to incorporate orchestral accompaniment on his compositions. The lead single, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, featured saxophonist Curtis Amy.
While the band was trying faintly to maintain their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound gave the album an experimental feel, causing critics to attack their musical integrity. According to Densmore in his biography &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, individual writing credits were noted for the first time because of Morrison&#x27;s reluctance to sing the lyrics of Krieger&#x27;s song &quot;Tell All the People&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band&#x27;s fourth hit album.

=== &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; (November 1969 – December 1970) ===

During the recording of their next album, &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot;, in November 1969, Morrison again found himself in trouble with the law after harassing airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see the Rolling Stones in concert. Both Morrison and his friend and traveling companion Tom Baker were charged with &quot;interfering with the flight of an intercontinental aircraft and public drunkenness&quot;. If convicted of the most serious charge, Morrison could have faced a ten-year federal prison sentence for the incident. The charges were dropped in April 1970 after an airline stewardess reversed her testimony to say she mistakenly identified Morrison as Baker.

The Doors staged a return to a more conventional direction after the experimental &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, with their fifth LP &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; in 1970. Featuring a consistent blues rock sound, the album&#x27;s opener was &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;. The record reached No. 4 in the United States and revived their status among their core fanbase and the rock press. Dave Marsh, the editor of &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, said of the album: &quot;the most horrifying rock and roll I have ever heard. When they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re simply unbeatable. I know this is the best record I&#x27;ve listened to  ... so far&quot;. &quot;Rock Magazine&quot; called it &quot;without any doubt their ballsiest (and best) album to date&quot;. &quot;Circus&quot; magazine praised it as &quot;possibly the best album yet from the Doors&quot; and &quot;good hard, evil rock, and one of the best albums released this decade&quot;. The album also saw Morrison returning as main songwriter, writing or co-writing all of the album&#x27;s tracks. The 40th anniversary CD reissue of &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; contains outtakes and alternative takes, including different versions of &quot;The Spy&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; (with Lonnie Mack on bass guitar and the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s John Sebastian on harmonica).

July 1970 saw the release of the group&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Absolutely Live&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 position on the charts. The record was completed by producer Rothchild, who confirmed that the album&#x27;s final mixing consisted of many bits and pieces from various and different band concerts. &quot;There must be 2000 edits on that album,&quot; he told an interviewer years later. &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; also includes the first release of the lengthy piece &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot;.

Although the Doors continued to face de facto bans in more conservative American markets and earned new bans at Salt Lake City&#x27;s Salt Palace and Detroit&#x27;s Cobo Hall following tumultuous concerts, the band managed to play 18 concerts in the United States, Mexico and Canada following the Miami incident in 1969, and 23 dates in the United States and Canada throughout the first half of 1970. The group later made it to the Isle of Wight Festival on August 29; performing on the same day as John Sebastian, Shawn Phillips, Lighthouse, Joni Mitchell, Tiny Tim, Miles Davis, Ten Years After, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the Who, Sly and the Family Stone and Melanie; the performance was the last captured on the band&#x27;s Roadhouse Blues Tour.

On December 8, 1970, his 27th birthday, Morrison recorded another poetry session. Part of this would end up on &quot;An American Prayer&quot; in 1978 with music, and is currently in the possession of the Courson family. Shortly thereafter, a new tour to promote their upcoming album would comprise only three dates. Two concerts were held in Dallas on December 11. During the Doors&#x27; last public performance with Morrison, at The Warehouse in New Orleans, on December 12, 1970, Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show. After the concert, Densmore, Manzarek and Krieger came to a mutual agreement that they should end their live act, claiming Morrison was ready to retire from performing.

=== &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and Morrison&#x27;s leave of absence and death (December 1970 – July 1971) ===

Despite Morrison&#x27;s conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, the Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with the album &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, recorded in Los Angeles in 1971. The album included rhythm guitarist Marc Benno on several tracks and prominently featured bassist Jerry Scheff, best known for his work in Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band. Despite a comparatively low &quot;Billboard&quot; chart peak at No. 9, &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; contained two Top 20 hits and went on to be their second bestselling studio album, surpassed in sales only by their debut. The album explored their R&amp;B roots, although during rehearsals they had a falling-out with Paul Rothchild, who was dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s effort. Denouncing &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; as &quot;cocktail lounge music&quot;, he quit and handed the production to Bruce Botnick and the Doors.

The title track and two singles (&quot;Love Her Madly&quot; and &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;) remain mainstays of rock radio programming, with the latter being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its special significance to recorded music. In the song &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, Morrison makes an anagram of his name to chant &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin&quot;. During the sessions, a short clip of the band performing &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; was filmed. As far as is known, this is the last clip of the Doors performing with Morrison.

On March 11, 1971, near the end of the mixing of &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;, Morrison took a leave of absence from the Doors and moved to Paris with Pamela Courson; he had visited the city the previous summer. On July 3, 1971, following months of residency, Morrison was found dead in the bath by Courson. Despite the absence of an official autopsy, the cause of death was listed as heart failure. He was buried in the &quot;Poets&#x27; Corner&quot; of Père Lachaise Cemetery on July 7.

Morrison died at age 27, the same age as several other famous rock stars in the 27 Club. In 1974, Morrison&#x27;s girlfriend Pamela Courson also died at the age of 27.

== After Morrison ==
=== &quot;Other Voices&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot; (July 1971 – January 1973) ===

&quot;L.A. Woman&quot;″s follow up album, &quot;Other Voices&quot;, was being planned while Morrison was in Paris. The band assumed he would return to help them finish the album. After Morrison died, the surviving members considered replacing him with several new people, such as Paul McCartney on bass, and Iggy Pop on vocals. But after neither of these worked out, Krieger and Manzarek took over lead vocal duties themselves. &quot;Other Voices&quot; was finally completed in August 1971, and released in October 1971. The record featured the single &quot;Tightrope Ride&quot;, which received some radio airplay. The trio began performing again with additional supporting members on November 12, 1971, at Pershing Municipal Auditorium in Lincoln, Nebraska, followed by shows at Carnegie Hall on November 23, and the Hollywood Palladium on November 26.

The recordings for &quot;Full Circle&quot; took place a year after &quot;Other Voices&quot; during the spring of 1972, and the album was released in August 1972. For the tours during this period, the Doors enlisted Jack Conrad on bass (who had played on several tracks on both &quot;Other Voices&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot;) as well as Bobby Ray Henson on rhythm guitar. They began a European tour covering France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, including an appearance on the German show &quot;Beat-Club&quot;. Like &quot;Other Voices&quot;, &quot;Full Circle&quot; did not perform as well commercially as their previous albums. While &quot;Full Circle&quot; was notable for adding elements of funk and jazz to the usual Doors sound, the band struggled with Manzarek and Krieger leading (neither of the post-Morrison albums had reached the Top 10 while all six of their albums with Morrison had). Once their contract with Elektra had lapsed, the Doors disbanded in 1973.

=== Reunions ===
The third post-Morrison album, &quot;An American Prayer&quot;, was released in 1978. It consisted of the band adding musical backing tracks to previously recorded spoken word performances of Morrison reciting his poetry. The record was a commercial success, acquiring a platinum certificate. Two years later, it was nominated for a Grammy Award in the &quot;Spoken Word Album&quot; category, but it ultimately lost to John Gielgud&#x27;s &quot;The Ages of Man&quot;. &quot;An American Prayer&quot; was re-mastered and re-released with bonus tracks in 1995.

In 1993, the Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the ceremony, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore reunited to perform &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, &quot;Break On Through&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Eddie Vedder filled in on lead vocals, while Don Was played bass. For the 1997 boxed set, the surviving members of the Doors reconvened to complete &quot;Orange County Suite&quot;. The track was based on one that Morrison had written and recorded in early 1969, providing both vocals and piano.

The Doors reunited at the turn of the century to record music for the &quot;Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors&quot; tribute album. Following the sessions, band members reunited in 2000 to perform on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;. For the live performance, the band was joined by Angelo Barbera and numerous guest vocalists, including Perry Farrell of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Pat Monahan, Ian Astbury of the Cult, Travis Meeks, Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots, and Scott Stapp of Creed. On May 29, 2007, Perry Farrell&#x27;s group the Satellite Party released its first album &quot;Ultra Payloaded&quot; on Columbia Records. It featured &quot;Woman in the Window&quot;, a new song with a pre-recorded vocal performance by Morrison.

Manzarek along with Krieger, Densmore and DJ/producer Skrillex (Sonny Moore) recorded a new song in 2012, of which Manzarek said, &quot;I like to say this is the first new Doors track of the 21st century&quot;. The recording session and song are part of a documentary film, &quot;Re:GENERATION&quot;, which recruited five popular DJs/producers to work with artists from five separate genres and had them record new music. Manzarek and Skrillex had an immediate musical connection: &quot;Sonny plays his beat, all he had to do was play the one thing. I listened to it and I said, &#x27;Holy shit, that&#x27;s strong&#x27;.&quot; Manzarek formulates, &quot;Basically, it&#x27;s a variation on &#x27;Milestones&#x27;, by Miles Davis, and if I do say so myself, sounds fucking great, hot as hell.&quot; The track, called &quot;Breakn&#x27; a Sweat&quot;, was recorded for Skrillex&#x27;s EP &quot;Bangarang&quot;.

In 2013, the remaining members of the Doors recorded with rapper Tech N9ne for the song &quot;Strange 2013&quot;, appearing on his album &quot;Something Else&quot;, which features new instrumentation by the band and samples of Morrison&#x27;s vocals from the song &quot;Strange Days&quot;. In their final collaboration before Manzarek&#x27;s death, the three surviving Doors provided backing for poet Michael C. Ford&#x27;s album &quot;Look Each Other in the Ears&quot;.

On February 12, 2016, at The Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, Densmore and Krieger reunited for the first time in 15 years to perform in tribute to Manzarek and benefit Stand Up to Cancer. That day would have been Manzarek&#x27;s 77th birthday. The night featured Exene Cervenka and John Doe of the band X, Rami Jaffee of the Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; Robert Deleo, Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s Stephen Perkins, Emily Armstrong of Dead Sara, Andrew Watt, among others.

== After the Doors ==
After Morrison died in 1971, Densmore and Krieger went to London looking for a new lead singer. They formed the Butts Band in 1973 there, signing with Blue Thumb Records. They released an album titled &quot;Butts Band&quot; the same year, then disbanded in 1975 after a second album with Phil Chen on bass.

Manzarek made three solo albums from 1974 to 1983 and formed a band called Nite City in 1975, which released two albums in 1977–1978. Krieger released six solo albums from 1977 to 2010. In 2002, the two together formed a new version of the Doors which they called the Doors of the 21st Century. Due to legal battles with Densmore and the Morrison estate over use of the Doors name, they changed their name several times and ultimately toured under the name &quot;Manzarek–Krieger&quot; or &quot;Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of the Doors&quot;. The group toured extensively throughout their career. In July 2007, Densmore announced he would not reunite with the Doors unless Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam was the lead singer.

On May 20, 2013, Manzarek died at a hospital in Rosenheim, Germany, at the age of 74 due to complications related to bile duct cancer. Krieger and Densmore came together on February 12, 2016, at a benefit concert memorial for Manzarek. All proceeds went to &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell argued that the Doors were &quot;not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days&quot;. The band presaged gothic rock due to the violence and the darkness present in their early work. As soon as 1967, critic John Stickney announced in the title of his article: &quot;Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing&quot;. Journalist Dave Marsh would also qualify a few years later the &quot;first couple of Doors albums&quot; as a prime example of &quot;gothic rock&quot;.

Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a sustained revival of interest in the Doors which created a new generation of fans. The origin of the revival is traced to the release of the album &quot;An American Prayer&quot; in late 1978 which contained a live version of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; that received considerable airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations. In 1979, the song &quot;The End&quot; was featured in dramatic fashion in the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, and the next year, the bestselling biography of Morrison &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot; was published. The Doors&#x27; first album, &quot;The Doors&quot;, re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in September 1980 and Elektra Records reported the Doors&#x27; albums were selling better than in any year since their original release. In response a new compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released in October 1980. The album peaked at No. 17 in &quot;Billboard&quot; and remained on the chart for nearly two years.
The revival continued in 1983 with &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot;, an album of previously unreleased live recordings. The track &quot;Gloria&quot; reached No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart and the video was in heavy rotation on MTV. Another compilation album, &quot;The Best of the Doors&quot; was released in 1985 and went on to be certified Diamond in 2007 by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 10 million certified units.

A second revival, attracting another generation of fans, occurred in 1991 following the release of the film &quot;The Doors&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Morrison. Stone created the script from over a hundred interviews of people who were in Morrison&#x27;s life. He designed the movie by picking the songs and then adding the appropriate storylines to them. The remaining band members did not like the film&#x27;s portrayal of the events. In the book &quot;The Doors&quot;, Manzarek states, &quot;That Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet.&quot; In addition, Manzarek claims that he wanted the movie to be about all four members of the band, not only Morrison. Densmore asserts, &quot;A third of it&#x27;s fiction.&quot; In the same volume, Krieger agrees with the other two, but also says, &quot;It could have been a lot worse.&quot; The film&#x27;s soundtrack album reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;The Best of the Doors&quot; re-entered the chart, with the latter reaching a new peak position of No. 32.

== Musical style and influences ==
The Doors initially started as a conventional electric blues band, but subsequently enriched their sound with jazz, psychedelic rock, raga, classical references, funk and flamenco. In live performances, they experimented with free improvisation based on dodecaphonic, cacophonic passages and delay/echo effects, in order to accompany spoken-word poetry sessions or to fill long instrumental jams. In the second album the group introduced elements of electronic music and musique concrète and incorporated unusual instruments such as the Moog synthesizer, the harpsichord and the marimba. The fourth album is also notable because it featured brass, wind and string instrumentation, touching upon big band and bluegrass styles. 

Music journalist and critic David Fricke observed that they were &quot;the first american rock ensemble to regularly blend reverb, echos, fuzz and other innovative sound effects with keyboards and organ, both on studio works and live shows. A pioneering approach to improvisation in psychedelic music that established some of its most defining characteristics. A lot of keyboard-based groups of the era should thank them&quot;, and praised their efficiency during concerts to &quot;alternate to intense, essential blues numbers jazz-rock instrumentals led by exceptionally dynamic drumming, masterfully calculated guitar insertions and challenging, explorative organ chords: giant rooms where an unlimited set of vocal improvisations has all the space to be delivered&quot;.

Manzarek cited a range of influences that include boogie-woogie, Chicago blues, the jazzers John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Bill Evans, and classical composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky. Krieger was heavily affected by his study of the sitar and the structures of indian classical music. He said Coltrane was &quot;my biggest music influence&quot;. He was familiar with modal scales and the traditional spanish flamenco, incorporating them all in his guitar style to create an original trademark of versatility that distinguished him from the other rock guitarists of the period. Densmore was shaped by Elvin Jones, the drummer of John Coltrane&#x27;s quartet, and by the stylistic features of Latin American percussions, especially the bossa nova rhythms of saxophonist Stan Getz.
