<text>Taoism or Daoism ( , ) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition indigenous to China, emphasizing harmony with the Tao (). With a range of meaning in Chinese philosophy, translations of Tao include &#x27;way&#x27;, &#x27;road&#x27;, &#x27;path&#x27;, or &#x27;technique&#x27;, generally understood in the Taoist sense as an enigmatic process of transformation ultimately underlying reality. Taoist thought has informed the development of various practices within the Taoist tradition and beyond, including forms of meditation, astrology, qigong, feng shui, and internal alchemy. A common goal of Taoist practice is self-cultivation, a deeper appreciation of the Tao, and more harmonious existence. Taoist ethics vary, but generally emphasize such virtues as &quot;effortless action&quot;, &quot;naturalness&quot;, &quot;simplicity&quot;, and the three treasures of compassion, frugality, and humility.

The core of Taoist thought crystallized during the early Warring States period (), during which the epigrammatic and the anecdotal —widely regarded as the fundamental texts of Taoist philosophy—were largely composed. They form the core of a body of Taoist writings accrued over the following centuries, which was assembled by monks into the canon starting in the 5th century CE. Early Taoism drew upon diverse influences, including the Shang and Zhou state religions, Naturalism, Mohism, Confucianism, various Legalist theories, as well as the and &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;.

Although Taoism and Confucianism developed significant differences, they are not seen as mutually incompatible or exclusive. The relationship between Taoism and Buddhism upon the latter&#x27;s introduction to China is characterized as one of mutual influence, with long-running discourses shared between Taoists and Buddhists; the distinct Mahayana tradition of Zen that emerged during the Tang dynasty (607–917) incorporates many ideas from Taoism.

Many Taoist denominations recognize deities, often ones shared with other traditions, which are venerated as superhuman figures exemplifying Taoist virtues. They can be roughly divided into two categories of &quot;gods&quot; and (or &quot;immortals&quot;). were immortal beings with vast supernatural powers, also describing a principled, moral person. Since Taoist thought is syncretic and deeply rooted in Chinese culture for millennia, it is often unclear which denominations should be considered &quot;Taoist&quot;. 

The status of , or &#x27;Taoist master&#x27;, is traditionally attributed only to clergy in Taoist organizations, who distinguish between their traditions and others in Chinese folk religion. Though generally lacking motivation for strong hierarchies, Taoist philosophy has often served as a theoretical foundation for politics, warfare, and Taoist organizations. Taoist secret societies precipitated the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the late Han dynasty, attempting to create what has been characterized as a Taoist theocracy.

Today, Taoism is one of five religious doctrines officially recognized by the Chinese government, also having official status in Hong Kong and Macau. It is considered a major religion in Taiwan, and also has significant populations of adherents throughout the Sinosphere and Southeast Asia. In the West, Taoism has taken on various forms, both those hewing to historical practice, as well as highly synthesized practices variously characterized as new religious movements.

==Terminology==
===Spelling===

&quot;Tao&quot; and &quot;Dao&quot; are different romanized spellings of the same Chinese word: 道.
* &quot;Tao&quot; is the romanized spelling in the Wade–Giles system, which was predominant in English-speaking countries until the late 20th century, and remains in use for certain terms with strongly established spellings.
* &quot;Dao&quot; is the romanized spelling in the Hanyu Pinyin system, officially adopted in China in the 1950s, which has largely replaced Wade–Giles romanization.

===Standard Chinese and English pronunciation===

The Standard Chinese pronunciation of 道 is .
* In Standard Chinese, the initial consonant, , is &quot;not&quot; voiced like the in the English word &quot;do&quot;.
* In Standard Chinese, the initial consonant, , is &quot;not&quot; aspirated like the in the English word &quot;to&quot;.
Neither an English pronunciation like (an English pronunciation of &quot;Dao&quot;) nor an English pronunciation like (an English pronunciation of &quot;Tao&quot;) is the same as the Standard Chinese pronunciation of 道.

These differences in the initial consonants used in English and Standard Chinese may contribute to there being different methods of romanizing Chinese, which consequently may confuse English speakers when encountering both &quot;Tao&quot; and &quot;Dao&quot; spellings for the same Chinese term.

One authority calls the pronunciation with a as in &quot;tie&quot; (with a ) to be a &quot;mispronunciation&quot; originally caused by the &quot;clumsy Wade–Giles system&quot;, which misled most readers. Standard Chinese phonology does not have the same sound inventory as English phonology; the Wade–Giles romanization system provides spellings in the Latin alphabet, but they are not meant to indicate an exact English pronunciation in the same way as though they were English words.

===Classification===

The word &quot;Taoism&quot; is used to translate two related but distinct Chinese terms.
# Firstly, a term encompassing a family of organized religious movements that share concepts and terminology from Taoist philosophy—what can be specifically translated as &#x27;the teachings of the Tao&#x27;, (), often interpreted as the Taoist &quot;religion proper&quot;, or the &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;liturgical&quot; aspects of Taoism. The Celestial Masters school is a well-known early example of this sense.
# The other, referring to the philosophical doctrines largely based on core Taoist texts themselves—a term that can be translated as &#x27;the philosophical school of the Tao&#x27; or &#x27;Taology&#x27; (, or sometimes ). This would go on to be considered one of the Hundred Schools of Thought from the Warring States period. The earliest recorded use of the word &#x27;Tao&#x27; to reference such a philosophical school is found in the works of Han-era historians: such as the &quot;Commentary of Zuo&quot; () by Zuo Qiuming, and in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. This particular usage precedes the emergence of the Celestial Masters and associated later religions. It is unlikely that Zhuang Zhou, author of the Zhuangzi, was familiar with the text of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, and Zhuangzi himself may have died before the term was in use.

The distinction between Taoism in &quot;philosophy&quot; and Taoist &quot;religion&quot; is an ancient, deeply-rooted one. Taoism as a positive philosophy aims for the holistic unification of an individual&#x27;s reality with everything that is not only real but also valuable, encompassing both the natural world and society. But the earliest references to &#x27;the Tao&#x27; per se are largely devoid of liturgical or explicitly supernatural character, used in contexts either of abstract metaphysics or of the ordinary conditions required for human flourishing. This distinction is still understood in everyday contexts among Chinese people, echoed by early modern scholars of Chinese history and philosophy such as Feng Youlan and Wing-tsit Chan. Use of the term &quot;daojia&quot; dates to the Western Han , referring to the purported authors of the emerging Taoist canon, such as Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou. 

Neither the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; themselves, or the early secondary sources written about them, put forward any particular supernatural ontology. Nonetheless, that religious Taoism emerged from a synthesis of folk religion with philosophical Taoist precepts is clear. The earlier, naturalistic was employed by pre-Han and Han thinkers, and continued to be used well into the Song, including among those who explicitly rejected cults, both private and state-sanctioned, that were often either labeled or self-identified as Taoist.

However, this distinction has been challenged or rejected by some scholars of religion, often those from a Western or Japanese background, who often use distinct interpretive models and techniques. This point of view characterizes the religious and philosophical characteristics of the Taoist tradition as being inseparable. Sinologists such as Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn state that &quot;Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations.&quot; The distinction is fraught with hermeneutic difficulties when attempting to categorize different schools, sects, and movements. Russell Kirkland writes that &quot;most scholars who have seriously studied Taoism, both in Asia and in the West&quot; have abandoned this &quot;simplistic dichotomy&quot;. Louis Komjathy writes that this is an untenable misconception because &quot;the association of &quot;daojia&quot; with &quot;thought&quot; (&quot;sixiang&quot;) and of &quot;daojiao&quot; with &quot;religion&quot; (&quot;zongjiao&quot;) is a modern Chinese construction largely rooted in earlier Chinese literati, European colonialist, and Protestant missionary interpretations. Contemporaneous Neo-Confucianists, for example, often self-identify as Taoist without partaking in any rituals.

In contrast, Komjathy characterizes Taoism as &quot;a unified religious tradition characterized by complexity and diversity&quot;, arguing that historically, none of these terms were understood according to a bifurcated &#x27;philosophy&#x27; versus &#x27;religion&#x27; model. &quot;Daojia&quot; was a taxonomical category for Taoist texts, that was eventually applied to Taoist movements and priests in the early medieval period. Meanwhile, &quot;daojiao&quot; was originally used to specifically distinguish Taoist tradition from Buddhism. Thus, &quot;daojiao&quot; included &quot;daojia&quot;. Komjathy notes that the earliest Taoist texts also &quot;reveal a religious community composed of master-disciple lineages&quot;, and therefore, that &quot;Taoism was a religious tradition from the beginning.&quot; Philosopher Chung-ying Cheng likewise views Taoism as a religion embedded into Chinese history and tradition, while also assuming many different &quot;forms of philosophy and practical wisdom&quot;. Chung-ying Cheng also noted that the Taoist view of &#x27;heaven&#x27; mainly from &quot;observation and meditation, [though] the teaching of [the Tao] can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature&quot;. Taoism is generally not understood as a variant of Chinese folk religion per se: while the two umbrella terms have considerable cultural overlap, core themes of both also diverge considerably from one another.

===Adherents===
Traditionally, the Chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to the doctrines or the practices of Taoism, who fall instead within the field of folk religion. Taoist, in Western sinology, is traditionally used to translate &quot;daoshi/taoshih&quot; (), thus strictly defining the priests of Taoism, ordained clergymen of a Taoist institution who &quot;represent Taoist culture on a professional basis&quot;, are experts of Taoist liturgy, and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skill for the benefit of a community.

This role of Taoist priests reflects the definition of Taoism as a &quot;liturgical framework for the development of local cults&quot;, in other words a scheme or structure for Chinese religion, proposed first by the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in &quot;The Taoist Body&quot; (1986). &quot;Taoshi&quot; are comparable to the non-Taoist ritual masters () of vernacular traditions (the so-called Faism) within Chinese religion.

The term (), with the meaning of &quot;Taoist&quot; as &quot;lay member or believer of Taoism&quot;, is a modern invention that goes back to the introduction of the Western category of &quot;organized religion&quot; in China in the 20th century, but it has no significance for most of Chinese society in which Taoism continues to be an &quot;order&quot; of the larger body of Chinese religion.

== History ==

=== Classical Taoism and its sources ===
Scholars like Harold Roth argue that early Taoism was a series of &quot;inner-cultivation lineages&quot; of master-disciple communities, emphasizing a contentless and nonconceptual apophatic meditation as a way of achieving union with the Tao. According to Louis Komjathy, their worldview &quot;emphasized the Dao as sacred, and the universe and each individual being as a manifestation of the Dao.&quot; These communities were also closely related to and intermixed with the fangshi (method master) communities. Other scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that before the Han dynasty, there were no real &quot;Taoists&quot; or &quot;Taoism&quot;. Instead, there were various sets of behaviors, practices, and interpretative frameworks (like the ideas of the &quot;Yijing&quot;, yin-yang thought, as well as Mohist, &quot;Legalist&quot;, and &quot;Confucian&quot; ideas), which were eventually synthesized into the first organized forms of &quot;Taoism&quot;.

Some of the main early Taoist sources include: the &quot;Neiye&quot;, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, and the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, attributed to Laozi, is dated by scholars to sometime between the 4th and 6th century BCE. A common tradition holds that Laozi founded Taoism. Laozi&#x27;s historicity is disputed, with many scholars seeing him as a legendary founding figure.

While Taoism is often regarded in the West as arising from Laozi, many Chinese Taoists claim that the Yellow Emperor formulated many of their precepts, including the quest for &quot;long life&quot;. Traditionally, the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s founding of Taoism was said to have been because he &quot;dreamed of an ideal kingdom whose tranquil inhabitants lived in harmonious accord with the natural law and possessed virtues remarkably like those espoused by early Taoism. On waking from his dream, Huangdi sought to&quot; bring about &quot;these virtues in his own kingdom, to ensure order and prosperity among the inhabitants&quot;.

Afterwards, Taoism developed and grew into two sects; One is Zhengyi Taoism, which mainly focuses on spells, and the other is Quanzhen Taoism, which mainly focuses on practicing inner alchemy. Overall, traditional Taoist thought, content, and sects are varied, reflecting the ideal of &quot;absorbing everything inside and mixing everything outside&quot;.

Early Taoism drew on the ideas found in the religion of the Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty, such as their use of divination, ancestor worship, and the idea of Heaven (Tian) and its relationship to humanity. According to modern scholars of Taoism, such as Kirkland and Livia Kohn, Taoist philosophy also developed by drawing on numerous schools of thought from the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BCE), including Mohism, Confucianism, Legalist theorists (like Shen Buhai and Han Fei, which speak of &quot;wu wei&quot;), the School of Naturalists (from which Taoism draws its main cosmological ideas, yin and yang and the five phases), and the Chinese classics, especially the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;.

Meanwhile, Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism: the teachings found in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; techniques for achieving ecstasy, practices for achieving longevity and becoming an immortal (xian), and practices for exorcism. Robinet states that some elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China. In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring States era phenomena of the &quot;wu&quot; (Chinese shamans) and the &quot;fangshi&quot; (&quot;method masters&quot;, which probably derived from the &quot;archivist-soothsayers of antiquity&quot;).

Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to &quot;magic, medicine, divination, ... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings&quot; as well as exorcism. The &quot;fangshi&quot; were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists and relied greatly on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities. Female shamans played an important role in the early Taoist tradition, which was particularly strong in the southern state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own tradition in contrast to shamanism while also absorbing shamanic elements.

During the early period, some Taoists lived as hermits or recluses who did not participate in political life, while others sought to establish a harmonious society based on Taoist principles. Zhuang Zhou (c. 370–290 BCE) was the most influential of the Taoist hermits. Some scholars hold that since he lived in the south, he may have been influenced by Chinese shamanism. Zhuang Zhou and his followers insisted they were the heirs of ancient traditions and the ways of life of by-then legendary kingdoms. Pre-Taoist philosophers and mystics whose activities may have influenced Taoism included shamans, naturalists skilled in understanding the properties of plants and geology, diviners, early environmentalists, tribal chieftains, court scribes and commoner members of governments, members of the nobility in Chinese states, and the descendants of refugee communities.

Significant movements in early Taoism disregarded the existence of gods, and many who believed in gods thought they were subject to the natural law of the Tao, in a similar nature to all other life. Roughly contemporaneously to the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, some believed the Tao was a force that was the &quot;basis of all existence&quot; and more powerful than the gods, while being a god-like being that was an ancestor and a mother goddess.

Early Taoists studied the natural world in attempts to find what they thought were supernatural laws that governed existence. Taoists created scientific principles that were the first of their kind in China, and the belief system has been known to merge scientific, philosophical, and religious conceits from close to its beginning.

=== Early organized Taoism ===

By the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), the various sources of Taoism had coalesced into a coherent tradition of ritualists in the state of Shu (modern Sichuan). One of the earliest forms of Taoism was the Han era (2nd century BCE) &quot;Huang–Lao&quot; movement, which was an influential school of thought at this time. The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; and the &quot;Taipingjing&quot; are important sources from this period. An unorganized form of Taoism was popular in the Han dynasty that syncretized many preexisting forms in multiple ways for different groups existed during a rough span of time throughout the 2nd century BCE. Also during the Han, the earliest extant commentaries on the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; were written: the Heshang Gong commentary and the Xiang&#x27;er commentary.

The first organized form of Taoism was the Way of the Celestial Masters, which developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE. The latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who was said to have had a vision of Laozi in 142 CE and claimed that the world was coming to an end. Zhang sought to teach people to repent and prepare for the coming cataclysm, after which they would become the seeds of a new era of great peace. It was a mass movement in which men and women could act as libationers and tend to the commoners. A related movement arose in Shandong called the &quot;Way of Great Peace&quot;, seeking to create a new world by replacing the Han dynasty. This movement led to the Yellow Turban Rebellion, and after years of bloody war, they were crushed.

The Celestial Masters movement survived this period and did not take part in attempting to replace the Han. As such, they grew and became an influential religion during the Three Kingdoms period, focusing on ritual confession and petition, as well as developing a well-organized religious structure. The Celestial Masters school was officially recognized by the warlord Cao Cao in 215 CE, legitimizing Cao Cao&#x27;s rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.

Another important early Taoist movement was Taiqing (Great Clarity), which was a tradition of external alchemy (weidan) that sought immortality through the concoction of elixirs, often using toxic elements like cinnabar, lead, mercury, and realgar, as well as ritual and purificatory practices.

After this point, Taoism did not have nearly as significant an effect on the passing of law as the syncretic Confucian–Legalist tradition.

=== Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties eras ===
The Three Kingdoms period saw the rise of the Xuanxue (Mysterious Learning or Deep Wisdom) tradition, which focused on philosophical inquiry and integrated Confucian teachings with Taoist thought. The movement included scholars like Wang Bi (226–249), He Yan (d. 249), Xiang Xiu (223?–300), Guo Xiang (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267–300). Another later influential figure was the 4th century alchemist Ge Hong, who wrote a key Taoist work on inner cultivation, the &quot;Baopuzi&quot; (&quot;Master Embracing Simplicity&quot;).

The Six Dynasties (316–589) era saw the rise of two new Taoist traditions, the Shangqing and Lingbao schools. Shangqing was based on a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi between 364 and 370. As Livia Kohn writes, these revelations included detailed descriptions of the heavens as well as &quot;specific methods of shamanic travels or ecstatic excursions, visualizations, and alchemical concoctions&quot;. The Shangqing revelations also introduced many new Taoist scriptures.

Similarly, between 397 and 402, Ge Chaofu compiled a series of scriptures that later served as the foundation of the Lingbao school, which was most influential during the later Song dynasty (960–1279) and focused on scriptural recitation and the use of talismans for harmony and longevity. The Lingbao school practiced purification rituals called &quot;purgations&quot; in which talismans were empowered. Lingbao also adopted Mahayana Buddhist elements. According to Kohn, they &quot;integrated aspects of Buddhist cosmology, worldview, scriptures, and practices, and created a vast new collection of Taoist texts in close imitation of Buddhist sutras&quot;. Louis Komjathy also notes that they adopted the Mahayana Buddhist universalism in its promotion of &quot;universal salvation&quot; (pudu).

During this period, Louguan, the first Taoist monastic institution (influenced by Buddhist monasticism) was established in the Zhongnan mountains by a local Taoist master named Yin Tong. This tradition was called the Northern Celestial masters, and their main scripture was the &quot;Xisheng jing&quot; (&quot;Scripture of Western Ascension&quot;).

During the sixth century, Taoists attempted to unify the various traditions into one integrated Taoism that could compete with Buddhism and Confucianism. To do this they adopted the schema known as the &quot;three caverns&quot;, first developed by the scholar Lu Xiujing (406–477) based on the &quot;three vehicles&quot; of Buddhism. The three caverns were: Perfection (Dongzhen), associated with the Three Sovereigns; Mystery (Dongxuan), associated with Lingbao; and Spirit (Dongshen), associated with the Supreme Clarity tradition. Lu Xiujing also used this schema to arrange the Taoist scriptures and Taoist deities. Lu Xiujing worked to compile the first edition of the &quot;Daozang&quot; (the Taoist Canon), which was published at the behest of the Chinese emperor. Thus, according to Russell Kirkland, &quot;in several important senses, it was really Lu Hsiu-ching who founded Taoism, for it was he who first gained community acceptance for a common canon of texts, which established the boundaries, and contents, of &#x27;the teachings of the Tao&#x27; (Tao-chiao). Lu also reconfigured the ritual activities of the tradition, and formulated a new set of liturgies, which continue to influence Taoist practice to the present day.&quot;

This period also saw the development of the Three Pure Ones, which merged the high deities from different Taoist traditions into a common trinity that has remained influential until today.

=== Later imperial dynasties ===
The new Integrated Taoism, now with a united Taoist identity, gained official status in China during the Tang dynasty. This tradition was termed &quot;daojiao&quot; (the teaching of the Tao). The Tang was the height of Taoist influence, during which Taoism, led by the Patriarch of Supreme Clarity, was the dominant religion in China. According to Russell Kirkland, this new Taoist synthesis had its main foundation in the Lingbao school&#x27;s teachings, which was appealing to all classes of society and drew on Mahayana Buddhism.

Perhaps the most important figure of the Tang was the court Taoist and writer Du Guangting (850–933). Du wrote numerous works about Taoist rituals, history, myth, and biography. He also reorganized and edited the &quot;Taotsang&quot; after a period of war and loss.

During the Tang, several emperors became patrons of Taoism, inviting priests to court to conduct rituals and enhance the prestige of the sovereign. The Gaozong Emperor even decreed that the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; was to be a topic in the imperial examinations. During the reign of the 7th century Emperor Taizong, the Five Dragons Temple (the first temple at the Wudang Mountains) was constructed. Wudang would eventually become a major center for Taoism and a home for Taoist martial arts (Wudang quan).

Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–755) was also a devoted Taoist who wrote various Taoist works, and according to Livia Kohn, &quot;had frequent meetings with senior masters, ritual specialists, Taoist poets, and official patriarchs, such as Sima Chengzhen.&quot; He reorganized imperial rituals based on Taoist forms, sponsored Taoist shrines and monasteries, and introduced a separate examination system based on Taoism. Another important Taoist figure of the Tang dynasty was Lu Dongbin, who is considered the founder of the jindan meditation tradition and an influential figure in the development of neidan (internal alchemy) practice.

Likewise, several Song dynasty emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts, and publishing updated editions of the &quot;Daozang&quot;. The Song era saw new scriptures and new movements of ritualists and Taoist rites, the most popular of which were the Thunder Rites (leifa). The Thunder rites were protection and exorcism rites that evoked the celestial department of thunder, and they became central to the new Heavenly Heart (Tianxin) tradition as well as for the Youthful Incipience (Tongchu) school.

In the 12th century, the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) School was founded in Shandong by the sage Wang Chongyang (1113–1170) to compete with religious Taoist traditions that worshipped &quot;ghosts and gods&quot; and largely displaced them. The school focused on inner transformation, mystical experience, monasticism, and asceticism. Quanzhen flourished during the 13th and 14th centuries and during the Yuan dynasty. The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism and Confucianism with Taoist tradition. According to Wang Chongyang, the &quot;three teachings&quot; (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), &quot;when investigated, prove to be but one school&quot;. Quanzhen became the largest and most important Taoist school in China when master Qiu Chuji met with Genghis Khan who ended up making him the leader of all Chinese religions as well as exempting Quanzhen institutions from taxation. Another important Quanzhen figure was Zhang Boduan, author of the &quot;Wuzhen pian&quot;, a classic of internal alchemy, and the founder of the southern branch of Quanzhen.

During the Song era, the Zhengyi Dao tradition properly developed in Southern China among Taoists of the Chang clan. This liturgically focused tradition would continue to be supported by later emperors and survives to this day.

In the Yuan dynasty, Taoism in Northern China took inspiration from Tibetan cultural practices, Chinese folk religion (often from the western parts of the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s land), and Tibetan Buddhism.

Under the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and East Asian Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes. Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like Wang Yangming and Zhan Ruoshui. During the Ming, the legends of the Eight Immortals (the most important of which is Lü Dongbin) rose to prominence, being part of local plays and folk culture. Ming emperors like the Hongwu Emperor continued to invite Taoists to court and hold Taoist rituals that were believed to enhance the power of the throne. The most important of these were connected with the Taoist deity Xuanwu (&quot;Perfect Warrior&quot;), which was the main dynastic protector deity of the Ming.

The Ming era saw the rise of the Jingming (&quot;Pure Illumination&quot;) school to prominence, which merged Taoism with Buddhist and Confucian teachings and focused on &quot;purity, clarity, loyalty and filial piety&quot;. The school derided internal and external alchemy, fasting (bigu), and breathwork. Instead, the school focused on using mental cultivation to return to the mind&#x27;s original purity and clarity (which could become obscured by desires and emotions). Key figures of this school include Xu Xun, Liu Yu, Huang Yuanji, Xu Yi, and Liu Yuanran. Some of these figures taught at the imperial capital and were awarded titles. Their emphasis on practical ethics and self-cultivation in everyday life (rather than ritual or monasticism) made it very popular among the literati class.

The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) mainly promoted Buddhism as well as Neo-Confucianism. Thus, during this period, the status and influence of Taoism declined. During the 18th century, the Qing imperial library excluded virtually all Taoist books.

The Qing era also saw the birth of the Longmen (&quot;Dragon Gate&quot; ) school of Wang Kunyang (1552–1641), a branch of Quanzhen from southern China that became established at the White Cloud Temple. Longmen authors like Liu Yiming (1734–1821) and Min Yide (1758–1836) worked to promote and preserve Taoist inner alchemy practices through books like &quot;The Secret of the Golden Flower&quot;. The Longmen school synthesized the Quanzhen and neidan teachings with the Chan Buddhist and Neo-Confucian elements that the Jingming tradition had developed, making it widely appealing to the literati class.

=== Early modern Taoism ===

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Taoism suffered much destruction as a result of religious persecution and numerous wars and conflicts that beset China in the so-called century of humiliation. This period of persecution was caused by numerous factors including Confucian prejudices, anti-traditional Chinese modernist ideologies, European and Japanese colonialism, and Christian missionary activity. By the 20th century, only one complete copy of the Tao Tsang survived intact, stored at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. A key Taoist figure during this period was Chen Yingning (1880–1969). He was a key member of the early Chinese Taoist Association and wrote numerous books promoting Taoist practice.

During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), many Taoist priests were laicized and sent to work camps, and many Taoist sites and temples were destroyed or converted to secular use. This period saw an exodus of Taoists out of China. They immigrated to Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and to Europe and North America. Thus, the communist repression had the consequence of making Taoism a world religion by disseminating Taoists throughout the world.

In the 1910s, Taoist doctrine about immortals and waiting until after death to live in &quot;the dwelling of the immortals&quot; was one of the faith&#x27;s most popular and influential beliefs.

The 20th century was also a creative period for Taoism despite its many setbacks. The Taoist influenced practice of tai chi developed during this time, led by figures like Yang Chengfu and Sun Lutang. Early proponents of tai chi, like Sun Lutang, claimed that it was a Taoist internal practice created by the Taoist immortal Zhang Sanfeng (though modern scholars note that this claim lacks credible historical evidence).

=== Late modern Taoism ===
Taoism began to recover during the reform and opening up period (beginning in 1979) during which mainland China experienced increased religious freedom. This led to the restoration of many temples and communities, the publishing of Taoist literature and the preservation of Taoist material culture. Several Chinese intellectuals, like Hu Fuchen (Chinese Academy of Social Studies) and Liu Xiaogan (Chinese University of Hong Kong) have worked to developed a &quot;New Daojia&quot; (&quot;xin daojia&quot;), which parallels the rise of New Confucianism.

During the 1980s and 1990s, China experienced the so-called Qigong fever, which saw a surge in the popularity of Qigong practice throughout China. During this period many new Taoist and Taoist influenced religions sprung up, the most popular being those associated with Qigong, such as Zangmigong (Tantric Qigong influenced by Tibetan Buddhism), Zhonggong (Central Qigong), and Falungong (which came to be outlawed and repressed by the Chinese Communist Party [CCP]).

Today, Taoism is one of five official recognized religions in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In mainland China, the government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association. Regarding the status of Taoism in mainland China, Livia Kohn writes:

The White Cloud Temple at Beijing remains the most important center for the training of Taoist monastics on the mainland, while the five sacred mountains of China also contain influential Taoist centers. Other key sites include: Wudangshan, Mount Longhu, Mount Qiyun, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Tai, Zhongnan mountains, Mount Mao, and Mount Lao. Meanwhile, Taoism is also practiced much more freely in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where it is a major religion and retains unique features and movements that differ from mainland Taoism. Taoism is also practiced throughout the wider East Asian cultural sphere.


Outside of China, many traditionally Taoist practices have spread, especially through Chinese emigration as well as conversion by non-Chinese. Taoist influenced practices, like tai chi and qigong, are also popular around the world. Its influence is ubiquitous, especially in divination and magical practices. As such, Taoism is now a religion with a global distribution.

Taoism has been traditionally associated with Northern China, Southern China, and Western China, and originated from Southern China.

During the late 20th century, Taoism began to spread to the Western world, leading to various forms of Taoist communities in the West, with Taoist publications, websites, meditation and Tai chi centers, and translations of Taoist texts by western scholars as well as non-specialists. Taoist classics like the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; have also become popular in the New Age movement and in &quot;popular Western Taoism&quot;, a kind of popularized hybrid spirituality. According to Louis Komjathy, this &quot;popular Western Taoism&quot; is associated with popular translations and interpretations of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and the work of popular figures like James Legge, Alan Watts, John Blofeld, Gia-fu Feng, and Bruce Lee. This popular spirituality also draws on Chinese martial arts (which are often unrelated to Taoism proper), American Transcendentalism, 1960s counterculture, New Age spirituality, the perennial philosophy, and alternative medicine.

On the other hand, traditionally minded Taoists in the West are often either ethnically Chinese or generally assume some level of sinicization, especially the adoption of Chinese language and culture. This is because, for most traditional Taoists, the religion is not seen as separate from Chinese ethnicity and culture. As such, most Western convert Taoist groups are led either by Chinese teachers or by teachers who studied with Chinese teachers. Some prominent Western Taoist associations include: , , British Daoist Association, Daoist Foundation (San Diego, California), American Taoist and Buddhist Association (New York), Ching Chung Taoist Association (San Francisco), Universal Society of the Integral Way (Ni Hua-Ching), and .

Particularly popular in the West are groups that focus on internal martial arts like tai chi, as well as qigong and meditation. A smaller set of groups also focus around internal alchemy, such as Mantak Chia&#x27;s Healing Tao. While traditional Taoism initially arrived in the West through Chinese immigrants, more recently, Western run Taoist temples have also appeared, such as the Taoist Sanctuary in San Diego and the Dayuan Circle in San Francisco. Kohn notes that all of these centers &quot;combine traditional ritual services with &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Yijing&quot; philosophy as well as with various health practices, such as breathing, diet, meditation, qigong, and soft martial arts&quot;.

==Teachings==
=== Tao ===
&quot;Tao&quot; (or &quot;Dao&quot;) can mean &quot;way&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, &quot;doctrine&quot;, or &quot;line&quot;. The Tao is a natural order that enables all things to exist and dominate every action, not so much through force as through a natural curvature of space and time. It is the origin and power of all creation - its essence is unknown, but it can be observed in its manifestation - this is behind the operation and change of nature. Livia Kohn describes the Tao as &quot;the underlying cosmic power which creates the universe, supports culture and the state, saves the good and punishes the wicked. Literally &#x27;the way&#x27;, Tao refers to the way things develop naturally, the way nature moves along, and living beings growing and declining in accordance with cosmic laws.&quot; The Tao is ultimately indescribable and transcends all analysis and definition. Thus, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; begins with: &quot;The Tao that can be told is not eternal Tao.&quot; Likewise, Louis Komjathy writes that Taoists have described the Tao as &quot;dark&quot; (&quot;xuan&quot;), &quot;indistinct&quot; (&quot;hu&quot;), &quot;obscure&quot; (&quot;huang&quot;), and &quot;silent&quot; (&quot;mo&quot;).

According to Komjathy, the Tao has four primary characteristics: &quot;(1) Source of all existence; (2) Unnamable mystery; (3) All-pervading sacred presence; and (4) Universe as cosmological process.&quot; As such, Taoist thought can be seen as monistic (the Tao is one reality), panenhenic (seeing nature as sacred), and panentheistic (the Tao is both the sacred world and what is beyond it, immanent and transcendent). Similarly, Wing-tsit Chan describes the Tao as an &quot;ontological ground&quot; and as &quot;the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course.&quot; The Tao is thus an &quot;organic order&quot;, which is not a willful or self-conscious creator, but an infinite and boundless natural pattern.

Furthermore, the Tao is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves and in natural and social patterns. Thus, the Tao is also the &quot;innate nature&quot; (&quot;xing&quot;) of all people, a nature which Taoists see as being ultimately good. In a naturalistic sense, the Tao is a visible pattern, &quot;the Tao that can be told&quot;, that is, the rhythmic processes and patterns of the natural world that can be observed and described. Thus, Kohn writes that Tao can be explained as twofold: the transcendent, ineffable, mysterious Tao and the natural, visible, and tangible Tao.

Dao is a process of reality itself, a way for things to gather together while still changing. All of these reflect the deep-rooted belief of the Chinese people that change is the most fundamental characteristic of things. In the &quot;Book of Changes&quot;, this pattern of change is symbolized by numbers representing 64 related force relationships, known as hexagrams. Dao is the change of these forces, usually simply referred to as yin and yang.

Throughout Taoist history, Taoists have developed different metaphysical views regarding the Tao. For example, while the Xuanxue thinker Wang Bi described Tao as wú (nothingness, negativity, not-being), Guo Xiang rejected wú as the source and held that instead the true source was spontaneous &quot;self-production&quot; (zìshēng 自生) and &quot;self-transformation&quot; (zìhuà 自化). Another school, the Chóngxuán (Twofold Mystery), developed a metaphysics influenced by Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy.

=== De ===

The active expression of Tao is called &quot;De&quot; (; also spelled &quot;Te&quot; or &quot;Teh&quot;; often translated with virtue or power), in a sense that &quot;De&quot; results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao. The term &quot;De&quot; can be used to refer to ethical virtue in the conventional Confucian sense, as well as to a higher spontaneous kind of sagely virtue or power that comes from following the Tao and practicing &quot;wu-wei&quot;. Thus, it is a natural expression of the Tao&#x27;s power and not anything like conventional morality. Louis Komjathy describes &quot;De&quot; as the manifestation of one&#x27;s connection to the Tao, which is a beneficial influence of one&#x27;s cosmological attunement.

=== Ziran ===
&quot;Ziran&quot; (; lit. &quot;self-so&quot;, &quot;self-organization&quot;) is regarded as a central concept and value in Taoism and as a way of flowing with the Tao. It describes the &quot;primordial state&quot; of all things as well as a basic character of the Tao, and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity. According to Kohn, in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;ziran&quot; refers to the fact that &quot;there is thus no ultimate cause to make things what they are. The universe exists by itself and of itself; it is existence just as it is. Nothing can be added or subtracted from it; it is entirely sufficient upon itself.&quot;

To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao and flow with its natural rhythms as expressed in oneself. This involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire and appreciating simplicity. It also consists of understanding one&#x27;s nature and living in accordance with it without trying to be something one is not or overthinking one&#x27;s experience. One way of cultivating &quot;ziran&quot; found in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; is to practice the &quot;fasting of the mind&quot;, a kind of Taoist meditation in which one empties the mind. It is held that this can also activate qi (vital energy). In some passages found in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; and in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, naturalness is also associated with rejection of the state (anarchism) and a desire to return to simpler pre-technological times (primitivism).

An often cited metaphor for naturalness is &quot;pu&quot; (), the &quot;uncarved log&quot;, which represents the &quot;original nature ... prior to the imprint of culture&quot; of an individual. It is usually referred to as a state one may return to.

=== &quot;Wu wei&quot; ===
The term &quot;wu wei&quot; constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism. &quot;Wei&quot; refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while &quot;wu&quot; carries the meaning of &quot;there is no ...&quot; or &quot;lacking, without&quot;. Standard translations are nonaction, effortless action, action without intent, noninterference, and nonintervention. The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression &quot;wei wu wei&quot;: an action without action. Kohn writes that &quot;wuwei&quot; refers to &quot;letting go of egoistic concerns&quot; and &quot;to abstain from forceful and interfering measures that cause tensions and disruption in favor of gentleness, adaptation, and ease.&quot;

In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature and the effortless way it flows around obstacles. Taoist philosophy, in accordance with the &quot;I Ching&quot;, proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony, and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. Thus, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; says: &quot;act of things and you will ruin them. Grasp for things and you will lose them. Therefore the sage acts with inaction and has no ruin, lets go of grasping and has no loss.&quot;

Taoism does not identify one&#x27;s will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural way of the universe. Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. &quot;By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction.&quot;

===Aspects of self (xing, xin, and ming)===
The Taoist view of the self is holistic and rejects the idea of a separate individualized self. As Russell Kirkland writes, Taoists &quot;generally assume that one&#x27;s &#x27;self&#x27; cannot be understood or fulfilled without reference to other persons, and to the broader set of realities in which all persons are naturally and properly embedded.&quot;

In Taoism, one&#x27;s innate or fundamental nature (xing) is ultimately the Tao expressing or manifesting itself as an embodied person. Innate nature is connected with one&#x27;s heartmind (xin), which refers to consciousness, the heart, and one&#x27;s spirit. The focus of Taoist psychology is the heartmind (xin), the intellectual and emotional center (zhong) of a person. It is associated with the chest cavity and the physical heart, as well as with emotions, thoughts, consciousness, and the storehouse of spirit (shen). When the heartmind is unstable and separated from the Tao, it is called the ordinary heartmind (suxin). On the other hand, the original heartmind (benxin) pervades Tao and is constant and peaceful.

The &quot;Neiye&quot; (ch.14) calls this pure original heart-mind the &quot;inner heartmind&quot;, &quot;an awareness that precedes language&quot;, and &quot;a lodging place of the numinous&quot;. Later Taoist sources also refer to it by other terms like &quot;awakened nature&quot; (wuxing), &quot;original nature&quot; (benxing), &quot;original spirit&quot; (yuanshen), and &quot;scarlet palace&quot;. This pure heartmind is seen as being characterized by clarity and stillness (qingjing), purity, pure yang, spiritual insight, and emptiness.

Taoists see life (sheng) as an expression of the Tao. The Tao is seen as granting each person a &quot;ming&quot; (life destiny), which is one&#x27;s corporeal existence, one&#x27;s body and vitality. Generally speaking, Taoist cultivation seeks a holistic psychosomatic form of training that is described as &quot;dual cultivation of innate nature and life-destiny&quot; (&quot;xingming shuanxiu&quot;). Taoism believes in a &quot;pervasive spirit world that is both interlocked with and separate from the world of humans.&quot;

The cultivation of innate nature is often associated with the practice of stillness (jinggong) or quiet meditation, while the cultivation of life-destiny generally revolves around movement based practices (dongong) like daoyin and health and longevity practices (yangsheng).

=== The Taoist body ===

Many Taoist practices work with ancient Chinese understandings of the body, its organs and parts, &quot;elixir fields&quot; (dantien), inner substances (such as &quot;essence&quot; or jing), animating forces (like the hun and po), and meridians (qi channels). The complex Taoist schema of the body and its subtle body components contains many parallels with Traditional Chinese medicine and is used for health practices as well as for somatic and spiritual transformation (through neidan – &quot;psychosomatic transmutation&quot; or &quot;internal alchemy&quot;). Taoist physical cultivation rely on purifying and transforming the body&#x27;s qi (vital breath, energy) in various ways such as dieting and meditation.

According to Livia Kohn, qi is &quot;the cosmic energy that pervades all. The concrete aspect of Tao, qi is the material force of the universe, the basic stuff of nature.&quot; According to the &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; &quot;human life is the accumulation of qi; death is its dispersal.&quot; Everyone has some amount of qi and can gain and lose qi in various ways. Therefore, Taoists hold that through various qi cultivation methods they can harmonize their qi, and thus improve health and longevity, and even attain magic powers, social harmony, and immortality. The &quot;Neiye&quot; (Inward Training) is one of the earliest texts that teach qi cultivation methods.

Qi is one of the Three Treasures, which is a specifically Taoist schema of the main elements in Taoist physical practices like qigong and neidan. The three are: jing (精, essence, the foundation for one&#x27;s vitality), qi and shén (神, spirit, subtle consciousness, a capacity to connect with the subtle spiritual reality).&quot;&quot; These three are further associated with the three &quot;elixir fields&quot; (dantien) and the organs in different ways.&quot;&quot;

The body in Taoist political philosophy was important and their differing views on it and humanity&#x27;s place in the universe were a point of distinction from Confucian politicians, writers, and political commentators. Some Taoists viewed ancestors as merely corpses that were improperly revered and respect for the dead as irrelevant and others within groups that followed these beliefs viewed almost all traditions as worthless.

===Ethics===
Daoist ethics tends to emphasize various themes from the Taoist classics, such as naturalness (&quot;pu&quot;), spontaneity (&quot;ziran&quot;), simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, &quot;wu wei&quot;. The classic Daoist view is that humans are originally and naturally aligned with Tao, thus their original nature is inherently good. It emphasizes doing things that are natural, following the Tao, which is a cosmic force that flows through all things and binds and releases them. However, one can fall away from this due to personal habits, desires, and social conditions. Returning to one&#x27;s nature requires active attunement through Daoist practice and ethical cultivation.

Some popular Daoist beliefs, such as the early Shangqing school, do not believe this and believe that some people are irredeemably evil and destined to be so. Many Taoist movements from around the time Buddhist elements started being syncretized with Daoism had an extremely negative view of foreigners, referring to them as &quot;yi&quot; or &quot;barbarians&quot;, and some of these thought of foreigners as people who do not feel &quot;human feelings&quot; and who never live out the correct norms of conduct until they became Taoist. At this time, China was widely viewed by Taoists as a holy land because of influence from the Chinese public that viewed being born in China as a privilege and that outsiders were enemies. Preserving a sense of &quot;Chineseness&quot; in the country and rewarding nativist policies such as the building of the Great Wall of China was important to many Taoist groups.

Foreigners who joined these Taoist sects were made to repent for their sins in another life that caused them to be born &quot;in the frontier wilds&quot; because of Buddhist ideas of reincarnation coming into their doctrines. Some Daoist movements viewed human nature neutrally. However, some of the movements that were dour or skeptical about human nature did not believe that evil is permanent and believed that evil people can become good. Korean Daoists tended to think extremely positively of human nature.

Some of the most important virtues in Taoism are the &quot;Three Treasures&quot; or &quot;Three Jewels&quot; (). These are: &quot;ci&quot; (, usually translated as &quot;compassion&quot;), &quot;jian&quot; (, usually translated as &quot;moderation&quot;), and &quot;bugan wei tianxia xian&quot; (, but usually translated as &quot;humility&quot;). Arthur Waley, applying them to the socio-political sphere, translated them as: &quot;abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment&quot;, &quot;absolute simplicity of living&quot;, and &quot;refusal to assert active authority&quot;.

Taoism also adopted the Buddhist doctrines of karma and reincarnation into its religious ethical system. Medieval Taoist thought developed the idea that ethics was overseen by a celestial administration that kept records of people&#x27;s actions and their fate, as well as handed out rewards and punishments through particular celestial administrators.

In its original form, the religion does not involve political affairs or complex rituals; on the contrary, it encourages the avoidance of public responsibility and the search for a vision of a spiritual transcendent world.

===Soteriology and religious goals===

Taoists have different religious goals that include Taoist conceptions of sagehood (&quot;zhenren&quot;), spiritual self-cultivation, a happy afterlife or longevity and some form of immortality (&quot;xian&quot;, variously understood as a kind of transcendent post-mortem state of the spirit).

Taoists&#x27; views about what happens in the afterlife tend to include the soul becoming a part of the cosmos (which was often thought of as an illusionary place where &quot;qi&quot; and physical matter were thought of as being the same in a way held together by the microcosm of the spirits of the human body and the macrocosm of the universe itself, represented and embodied by the Three Pure Ones), somehow aiding the spiritual functions of nature or &quot;Tian&quot; after death or being saved by either achieving spiritual immortality in an afterlife or becoming a &quot;xian&quot; who can appear in the human world at will, but normally lives in another plane. &quot;[S]acred forests and[/or] mountains&quot; or a yin-yang, yin, yang, or Tao realm inconceivable and incomprehensible by normal humans and even the virtuous Confucius and Confucianists, such as the mental realm sometimes called &quot;the Heavens&quot; where higher, spiritual versions of Daoists such as Laozi were thought to exist when they were alive and absorb &quot;the purest Yin and Yang&quot; were all possibilities for a potential &quot;xian&quot; to be reborn in. These spiritual versions were thought to be abstract beings that can manifest in that world as mythical beings such as &quot;xian&quot; dragons who eat yin and yang energy and ride clouds and their &quot;qi&quot;.

More specifically, possibilities for &quot;the spirit of the body&quot; include &quot;join[ing] the universe after death&quot;, exploring or serving various functions in parts of &quot;tiān&quot; or other spiritual worlds, or becoming a &quot;xian&quot; who can do one or more of those things.

Taoist &quot;xian&quot; are often seen as being eternally young because &quot;of their life being totally at one with the Tao of nature.&quot; They are also often seen as being made up of &quot;pure breath and light&quot; and as being able to shapeshift, and some Taoists believed their afterlife natural &quot;paradises&quot; were palaces of heaven.

Taoists who sought to become one of the many different types of immortals, such as &quot;xian&quot; or &quot;zhenren&quot;, wanted to &quot;ensure complete physical and spiritual immortality&quot;.

In the Quanzhen school of Wang Chongyang, the goal is to become a sage, which he equates with being a &quot;spiritual immortal&quot; (&quot;shen xien&quot;) and with the attainment of &quot;clarity and stillness&quot; (&quot;qingjing&quot;) through the integration of &quot;inner nature&quot; (xing) and &quot;worldly reality&quot; (ming).

Those who know the Tao, who flow with the natural way of the Tao and thus embody the patterns of the Tao are called sages or &quot;perfected persons&quot; (zhenren). This is what is often considered salvation in Taoist soteriology. They often are depicted as living simple lives, as craftsmen or hermits. In other cases, they are depicted as the ideal rulers which practice ruling through non-intervention and under which nations prosper peacefully. Sages are the highest humans, mediators between heaven and earth and the best guides on the Taoist path. They act naturally and simply, with a pure mind and with wuwei. They may have supernatural powers and bring good fortune and peace.

Some sages are also considered to have become one of the immortals (xian) through their mastery of the Tao. After shedding their mortal form, spiritual immortals may have many superhuman abilities like flight and are often said to live in heavenly realms.

The sages as thus because they have attained the primary goal of Taoism: a union with the Tao and harmonization or alignment with its patterns and flows. This experience is one of being attuned to the Tao and to our own original nature, which already has a natural capacity for resonance (ganying) with Tao. This is the main goal that all Daoist practices are aiming towards and can be felt in various ways, such as a sense of psychosomatic vitality and aliveness as well as stillness and a &quot;true joy&quot; (zhenle) or &quot;celestial joy&quot; that remains unaffected by mundane concerns like gain and loss.

The Taoist quest for immortality was inspired by Confucian emphasis on filial piety and how worshipped ancestors were thought to exist after death.

Becoming an immortal through the power of yin-yang and heaven, but also specifically Taoist interpretations of the Tao, was sometimes thought of as possible in Chinese folk religion, and Taoist thoughts on immortality were sometimes drawn from Confucian views on heaven and its status as an afterlife that permeates the mortal world as well.

=== Cosmology ===

Taoist cosmology is cyclic—the universe is seen as being in constant change, with various forces and energies (qi) affecting each other in different complex patterns. Taoist cosmology shares similar views with the School of Naturalists. Taoist cosmology focuses on the impersonal transformations (zaohua) of the universe, which are spontaneous and unguided.

Livia Kohn explains the basic Taoist cosmological theory as:

the root of creation Tao rested in deep chaos (ch. 42). Next, it evolved into the One, a concentrated state cosmic unity that is full of creative potential and often described in &quot;I Ching&quot; terms as the taiji. The One then brought forth &quot;the Two&quot;, the two energies yin and yang, which in turn merged in harmony to create the next level of existence, &quot;the Three&quot; (yin-yang combined), from which the myriad beings came forth. From original oneness, the world thus continued to move into ever greater states of distinction and differentiation.

The main distinction in Taoist cosmology is that between &quot;yin and yang&quot;, which applies to various sets of complementary ideas: bright – dark, light – heavy, soft – hard, strong – weak, above – below, ruler – minister, male – female, and so on. Cosmically, these two forces exist in mutual harmony and interdependence. Yin and yang are further divided into five phases (Wu Xing, or five materials): minor yang, major yang, yin/yang, minor yin, major yin. Each of these correlates with a specific substance: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water respectively. This schema is used in many different ways in Taoist thought and practice, from nourishing life (yangsheng) and medicine to astrology and divination.

Taoists also generally see all things as being animated and constituted by &quot;qi&quot; (vital air, subtle breath), which is seen as a force that circulates throughout the universe and throughout human bodies (as both air in the lungs and as a subtle breath throughout the body&#x27;s meridians and organs). Qi is in constant transformation between its condensed state (life) and diluted state (potential). These two different states of qi are embodiments of yin and yang, two complementary forces that constantly play against and with each other and where one cannot exist without the other.

Taoist texts present various creation stories and cosmogonies. Classic cosmogonies are nontheistic, presenting a natural undirected process in which an apophatic undifferentiated potentiality (called wuwuji, &quot;without non-differentiation&quot;) naturally unfolds into wuji (primordial oneness, &quot;non-differentiation&quot;), which then evolves into yin-yang (taiji) and then into the myriad beings, as in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. Later medieval models included the idea of a creator God (mainly seen as Lord Lao), representing order and creativity. Taoist cosmology influences Taoist soteriology, which holds that one can &quot;return to the root&quot; (guigen) of the universe (and of ourselves), which is also the Tao—the impersonal source (yuan) of all things.

In Taoism, human beings are seen as a microcosm of the universe, and thus the cosmological forces, like the five phases, are also present in the form of the zang-fu organs. Another common belief is that there are various gods that reside in human bodies. As a consequence, it is believed that a deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.

Another important element of Taoist cosmology is the use of Chinese astrology.

===Theology===


Taoist theology can be defined as apophatic, given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness and unknowable nature of the Tao, and the primacy of the &quot;Way&quot; rather than anthropomorphic concepts of God. Nearly all the sects share this core belief.

Arguments do exist the monotheistic concepts in Taoism. However, Taoism does include many deities and spirits and thus can also be considered animistic and polytheistic in a secondary sense (since they are considered to be emanations from the impersonal and nameless ultimate principle). Some Taoist theology presents the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities, which was a hierarchy emanating from the Tao. Laozi (Lao Tzu) is considered the incarnation of one of the three and worshiped as the ancestral founder of Taoism.

The gods and immortals () believed in by Taoism can be roughly divided into two categories, namely &quot;gods&quot; and &quot;xian&quot;. &quot;Gods&quot; refers to deities and there are many kinds: heaven gods/celestials (); earth spirits (); wuling (, animism, the spirit of all things); netherworld gods (); gods of the human body (); gods of the human ghost () etc. &quot;Xian&quot; are those who have acquired perfect cultivation of the Tao, persons with vast supernatural powers, unpredictable changes and immortality.

Different branches of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. Lesser deities also may be promoted or demoted for their activity. Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor (Yü-Huang or Yü-Di), one of the Three Pure Ones, as the highest God. Historical Taoist figures, and people who are considered to have become immortals (&quot;xian&quot;), are also venerated as well by both clergy and laypeople.

Despite these hierarchies of deities, most conceptions of Tao should not be confused with the Western sense of theism. Being one with the Tao does not necessarily indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu theistic sense.

== Practices ==
Some key elements of Taoist practice include a commitment to self-cultivation, wu wei, and attunement to the patterns of the Tao.The practice of Taoism seeks to develop the body back to its original level of energy and restore it to its original state of creation. The body is no longer just a means of living in harmony in the world, it is itself a universe. Most Taoists throughout history have agreed on the importance of self cultivation through various practices, which were seen as ways to transform oneself and integrate oneself to the deepest realities.

Communal rituals are important in most Taoist traditions, as are methods of self-cultivation. Taoist self-cultivation practices tend to focus on the transformation of the heartmind together with bodily substances and energies (like &quot;jing&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;) and their connection to natural and universal forces, patterns, and powers.

Despite the detachment from reality and dissent from Confucian humanism that the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; teaches, Taoists were and are generally not misanthropes or nihilists and see humans as an important class of things in the world. However, in most Taoist views humans were not held to be especially important in comparison to other aspects of the world and Taoist metaphysics that were seen as equally or more special. Similarly, some Taoists had similar views on their gods or the gods of other religions.

According to Louis Komjathy, Taoist practice is a diverse and complex subject that can include &quot;aesthetics, art, dietetics, ethics, health and longevity practice, meditation, ritual, seasonal attunement, scripture study, and so forth.&quot;

Throughout the history of Taoism, mountains have occupied a special place for Taoist practice. They are seen as sacred spaces and as the ideal places for Taoist cultivation and Taoist monastic or eremitic life, which may include &quot;cloud wandering&quot; (yunyou) in the mountains and dwelling in mountain hermitages (an) or grottoes (dong).

Tao can serve as a life energy instead of qi in some Taoist belief systems.

=== The nine practices ===
One of the earliest schemas for Taoist practice was the &quot;nine practices&quot; or &quot;nine virtues&quot; (jiǔxíng 九行), which were taught in the Celestial Masters school. These were drawn from classic Taoist sources, mainly the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, and are presented in the &quot;Laojun jinglu&quot; (&quot;Scriptural Statutes of Lord Lao&quot;; DZ 786).

The nine practices are:

#Nonaction (wúwéi 無為)
#Softness and weakness (róuruò 柔弱)
#Guarding the feminine (shǒucí 行守)
#Being nameless (wúmíng 無名)
#Clarity and stillness (qīngjìng 清靜)
#Being adept (zhūshàn 諸善)
#Being desireless (wúyù 無欲)
#Knowing how to stop and be content (zhī zhǐzú 知止足)
#Yielding and withdrawing (tuīràng 推讓)

=== Rituals ===
Ancient Chinese religion made much use of sacrifices to gods and ancestors, which could include slaughtered animals (such as pigs and ducks) or fruit. The Taoist Celestial Master Zhang Daoling rejected food and animal sacrifices to the gods. Today, many Taoist temples reject animal sacrifice. Sacrifices to the deities remains a key element of Taoist rituals however. There are various kinds of Taoist rituals, which may include presenting offerings, scripture reading, sacrifices, incantations, purification rites, confession, petitions and announcements to the gods, observing the ethical precepts, memorials, chanting, lectures, and communal feasts.

On particular holidays, such as the Qingming/Ching Ming festival, street parades take place. These are lively affairs that involve firecrackers, the burning of hell money, and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include lion dances and dragon dances, human-occupied puppets (often of the &quot;Seventh Lord&quot; and &quot;Eighth Lord&quot;), gongfu, and palanquins carrying images of deities. The various participants are not considered performers, but rather possessed by the gods and spirits in question.

=== Ethical precepts ===
Taking up and living by sets of ethical precepts is another important practice in Taoism. By the Tang dynasty, Taoism had created a system of lay discipleship in which one took a set of Ten precepts (Taoism).

The Five precepts (Taoism) are identical to the Buddhist five precepts (which are to avoid: killing [both human and non-human animals], theft, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants like alcohol.) The other five were a set of five injunctions: (6) I will maintain harmony with my ancestors and family and never disregard my kin; (7) When I see someone do good, I will support him with joy and delight; (8) When I see someone unfortunate, I will support him with dignity to recover good fortune; (9) When someone comes to do me harm, I will not harbor thoughts of revenge; (10) As long as all beings have not attained the Dao, I will not expect to do so myself.Apart from these common ethical precepts, Taoist traditions also have larger sets of precepts that are often reserved for ordained priests or monastics.

=== Divination and magic ===
A key part of many Taoist traditions is the practice of divination. There are many methods used by Chinese Taoists including I Ching divination, Chinese astrological divination, feng shui (geomantic divination), and the interpretation of various omens.

Mediumship and exorcism is a key element of some Taoist traditions. These can include &quot;tongji&quot; mediumship and the practice of planchette writing or spirit writing.

=== Longevity practices ===

Taoist longevity methods are closely related to ancient Chinese medicine. Many of these methods date back to Tang dynasty figures like alchemist Sun Simiao (582–683) and the Highest Clarity Patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647–735). The goal of these methods range from better health and longevity to immortality. Key elements of these &quot;nourishing life&quot; (yangsheng) methods include: moderation in all things (drink, food, etc.), adapting to the cycles of the seasons by following injunctions regarding healing exercises (daoyin), and breathwork.

A number of physical practices, like modern forms of qigong, as well as modern internal martial arts (neijia) like Taijiquan, Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, and Liuhebafa, are practiced by Taoists as methods of cultivating health and longevity as well as eliciting internal alchemical transformations. However, these methods are not specifically Taoist and are often practiced outside of Taoist contexts.

Another key longevity method is &quot;ingestion&quot;, which focuses on what one absorbs or consumes from one&#x27;s environment and is seen as affecting what one becomes. Diatectics, closely influenced by Chinese medicine, is a key element of ingestion practice, and there are numerous Taoist diet regimens for different effects (such as ascetic diets, monastic diets, therapeutic diets, and alchemical diets that use herbs and minerals). One common practice is the avoidance of grains (bigu). In certain cases, practices like vegetarianism and true fasting is also adopted (which may also be termed &quot;bigu&quot;).

Some Taoists thought of the human body as a spiritual nexus with thousands of &quot;shen&quot; (often 36,000), gods who were likely thought of as at least somewhat mental in nature because of the word&#x27;s other meaning of consciousness, that could be communed with by doing various methods to manipulate the yin and yang of the body, as well as its qi. These Taoists also thought of the human body as a metaphorical existence where three &quot;cinnabar fields&quot; that represented a higher level of reality or a spiritual kind of cinnabar that does not exist in normal reality. A method of meditation used by these Taoists was &quot;visualizing light&quot; that was thought to be &quot;qi&quot; or another kind of life energy a Taoist substituted for &quot;qi&quot; or believed in the existence of instead. The light was then channeled through the three cinnabar fields, forming a &quot;microcosmic orbit&quot; or through the hands and feet for a &quot;macrocosmic orbit&quot;.

The 36,000 &quot;shen&quot; regulated the body and bodily functions through a bureaucratic system &quot;modeled after the Chinese system of government&quot;. Death occurs only when these gods leave, but life can be extended by meditating while visualizing them, doing good deeds, and avoiding meat and wine.

=== Meditation ===

There are many methods of Taoist meditation (often referred to as &quot;stillness practice&quot;, &quot;jinggong&quot;), some of which were strongly influenced by Buddhist methods.

Some of the key forms of Taoist meditation are:
* Apophatic or quietistic meditation, which was the main method of classical Taoism and can be found in classic texts like the&quot; Zhuangzi&quot;, where it is termed &quot;fasting the heartmind&quot; (xinzhai). This practice is also variously termed &quot;embracing the one&quot; (baoyi), &quot;guarding the one&quot; (shouyi), &quot;quiet sitting&quot; (jingzuo), and &quot;sitting forgetfulness&quot; (zuowang). According to Louis Komjathy, this type of meditation &quot;emphasizes emptiness and stillness; it is contentless, non-conceptual, and non-dualistic. One simply empties the heart-mind of all emotional and intellectual content.&quot; The texts of classical Taoism state that this meditation leads to the dissolution of the self and any sense of separate dualistic identity. Sima Chengzhen&#x27;s &quot;Zuowang lun&quot; is a key text that outlines this method. The practice is also closely connected with the virtue of wuwei (inaction).
* Concentration meditation, focusing the mind on one theme, like the breath, a sound, a part of the body (like one of the dantiens), a diagram or mental image, a deity etc. A subset of this is called &quot;guarding the one&quot;, which is interpreted in different ways.
* Observation (guan)—according to Livia Kohn, this method &quot;encourages openness to all sorts of stimuli and leads to a sense of free-flowing awareness. It often begins with the recognition of physical sensations and subtle events in the body but may also involve paying attention to outside occurrences.&quot; Guan is associated with deep listening and energetic sensitivity. The term most often refers to &quot;inner observation&quot; (neiguan), a practice that developed through Buddhist influence (see: Vipaśyanā). Neiguan entails developing introspection of one&#x27;s body and mind, which includes being aware of the various parts of the body as well as the various deities residing in the body.
* Zhan zhuang (&quot;post standing&quot;)—standing meditation in various postures.
* Visualization (cunxiang) of various mental images, including deities, cosmic patterns, the lives of saints, various lights in the bodies organs, etc. This method is associated with the Supreme Clarity school, which first developed it.

=== Alchemy ===

A key element of many schools of Taoism are alchemical practices, which include rituals, meditations, exercises, and the creation of various alchemical substances. The goals of alchemy include physical and spiritual transformation, aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, improving physical health, extending one&#x27;s life, and even becoming an immortal (xian).

Taoist alchemy can be found in early Taoist scriptures like the &quot;Taiping Jing&quot; and the &quot;Baopuzi&quot;. There are two main kinds of alchemy, internal alchemy (neidan) and external alchemy (waidan). Internal alchemy (neidan, literally: &quot;internal elixir&quot;), which focuses on the transformation and increase of qi in the body, developed during the late imperial period (especially during the Tang) and is found in almost all Taoist schools today, though it is most closely associated with the Quanzhen School. There are many systems of internal alchemy with different methods such as visualization and breathwork. In the late Imperial period, neidan developed into complex systems that drew on numerous elements, including: classic Taoist texts and meditations, yangsheng, I Ching symbology, Taoist cosmology, external alchemy concepts and terms, Chinese medicine, and Buddhist influences. Neidan systems tend to be passed on through oral master-disciple lineages that are often to be secret.

Livia Kohn writes that the main goal of internal alchemy is generally understood as a set of three transformations: &quot;from essence (jing) to energy (qi), from energy to spirit (shen), and from spirit to Dao.&quot; Common methods for this include engaging the subtle body and activating the microcosmic orbit. Louis Komjathy adds that neidan seeks to create a transcendent spirit, usually called the &quot;immortal embryo&quot; (xiantai) or &quot;yang spirit&quot; (yangshen).

==Texts==
Some religious Taoist movements view traditional texts as scriptures that are considered sacred, authoritative, binding, and divinely inspired or revealed. However, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; was originally viewed as &quot;human wisdom&quot; and &quot;written by humans for humans.&quot; It and other important texts &quot;acquired authority...that caused them to be regarded...as sacred.&quot;

Perhaps the most influential texts are the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;.

===&quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;===

Throughout the history of Taoism, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; has been a central text, used for ritual, self-cultivation, and philosophical purposes.

According to legend, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; (also known as the &quot;Laozi&quot;) was written by Laozi. Authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate and will probably never be known with certainty. The earliest manuscripts of this work (written on bamboo tablets) date back to the late 4th century BCE, and these contain significant differences from the later received edition (of Wang Bi –249). Apart from the Guodian text and the Wang Bi edition, another alternative version exists, the Mawangdui Tao Te Chings.

Louis Komjathy writes that the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; is &quot;actually a multi-vocal anthology consisting of a variety of historical and textual layers; in certain respects, it is a collection of oral teachings of various members of the inner cultivation lineages.&quot; Meanwhile, Russell Kirkland argues that the text arose out of &quot;various traditions of oral wisdom&quot; from the state of Chu that were written, circulated, edited, and rewritten by different hands. He also suggests that authors from the Jixia academy may have been involved in the editing process.

The &quot;Tao Te Ching &quot;is not organized in any clear fashion and is a collection of different sayings on various themes. The leading themes of the Tao Te Ching revolve around the nature of Tao, how to attain it and De, the inner power of Tao, as well as the idea of wei wu-wei. Tao is said to be ineffable and accomplishes great things through small, lowly, effortless, and &quot;feminine&quot; (yin) ways (which are compared to the behavior of water).

Ancient commentaries on the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the &quot;Heshang Gong&quot; commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE. Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xiang&#x27;er commentary.

===&quot;Zhuangzi&quot;===

The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; (&quot;Book of Master Zhuang&quot;, ), named after its supposed author Zhuang Zhou, is a highly influential composite text of multi-vocal writings from various sources and historical periods. The commentator and editor Guo Xiang (c. CE 300) helped establish the text as an important source for Taoist thought. One traditional view is that a sage called Zhuang Zhou wrote the first seven chapters (the &quot;inner chapters&quot;), and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the outer and miscellaneous chapters). However, some modern scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that Guo Xiang is actually the creator of the 33-chapter Zhuangzi text and that there is no solid historical data for the existence of Zhuang Zhou himself (other than the sparse and unreliable mentions in Sima Qian). Zhuangzi also introduced seven versions of the meeting between Laozi and Confucius. Laozi is portrayed as growing old, and his Taoist teachings confuse his famous interlocutors. Zhuangzi also provides the only record of Laozi&#x27;s death.

The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; uses anecdotes, parables, and dialogues to express one of its main themes—avoiding cultural constructs and instead living in a spontaneous way aligned with the natural world. This way of living might be perceived as &quot;useless&quot; by most people who follow their own &quot;common sense&quot; and social and political rules, but this uselessness is actually a wiser alternative, since it is more in accord with reality.

===Chinese classics===

Taoism draws on numerous Chinese classics that are not themselves &quot;Taoist&quot; texts but that remain important sources for Taoists. Perhaps the most important of these is the ancient divination text called the &quot;Yijing&quot; (circa 1150 BCE). The divination method in the &quot;Yijing&quot; and its associated concepts of yin and yang mapped into 64 &quot;hexagrams&quot;—combinations of the 8 trigrams—has influenced Taoism from its inception until today.

Taoism also drew on other non-Taoist Chinese classic texts including:
* The &quot;Mozi&quot;, which was later adopted as a Taoist text by Taoists (who also saw master Mo – Mozi – as a Taoist immortal and included the &quot;Mozi&quot; into the Taoist canon).
* Confucian classics like the &quot;Analects&quot; and the &quot;Mengzi&quot;.
* &quot;Guanzi&quot;, which includes Taoistic ideas in several chapters.
* The &quot;Han Feizi&quot; (&quot;Writings of Master Han Fei&quot;), a Legalist work that also contains key Taoist themes, such as wu-wei.
* &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, which is widely quoted in early Taoist sources.
* &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; &quot;(The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor),&quot; an ancient Chinese medical text that was influential on Taoist inner cultivation theory.
* &quot;Huainanzi&quot; (), an ancient source that includes Taoist, Confucianist, and Legalist ideas.
* &quot;Guiguzi&quot;, which its ideas were integrated into Taoist writings
* &quot;Heguanzi&quot;, a collection also contain Taoist writings

=== Other important Taoist texts ===
There are many other important Taoist texts, including:
* &quot;Liezi&quot;, a 4th-century BCE classic Taoist work, which during the Tang was seen as the third great Taoist work alongside the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;.
* &quot;Neiye&quot;, a 4th-century BCE text that describes self-cultivation, meditation, how to work with qi&#x27;, and how to train one&#x27;s heart-mind (xin) as well as one&#x27;s body. The ideas found in this text influenced later Taoist conceptions of internal alchemy. 
* &quot;Wenzi&quot;; attributed to a Disciple of Laozi but which likely dates to the early Han dynasty. 
* &quot;Huahujing&quot; (&quot;Classic on converting the barbarians&quot;), an old text (5th–6th century BCE) that claims that Laozi traveled to India and is thus the source of Buddhism.
* The &quot;Taipingjing&quot; (&quot;Great Peace Scripture&quot;), a key source for Han dynasty Taoism.
* &quot;Liexian Zhuan (Biographies of Immortals),&quot; a Han dynasty text that is the earliest Taoist hagiography of Taoist immortals.
* &quot;Shenxian Zhuan&quot;, a Jin dynasty Taoist hagiography of immortals.
* The &quot;Baopuzi neipian&quot;, attributed to Ge Hong, also known as Baopu (&quot;Master who embraces simplicity&quot;). This text is a major source for the Shangqing School and its inner-cultivation practices.
*The &quot;Dadong zhenjing&quot; (&quot;Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern&quot;) and the &quot;Lingshu ziwen&quot; (&quot;Purple Texts Inscribed by the Spirits&quot;), the two most influential Supreme Clarity scriptures.
* &quot;Cāntóng qì&quot; (&quot;Kinship of the Three&quot;)—one of the earliest sources on Taoist internal alchemy (neidan).
* &quot;The Yellow Court Classic&quot; (&quot;Huang Ting Jing&quot;, ) is a work on Taoist meditation revealed by Lady Wei Huacun of the Shangqing school in the 288 CE. It remained an influential Shangqin text and was important for Lu Dongbin.
* &quot;Wupian zhenwen&quot; (&quot;Perfect Writings in Five Sections&quot;), the first of the Lingbao scriptures.
* &quot;Ling Bao Bi Fai&quot; (&quot;Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure&quot;), a manual of longevity practices and neidan.
* &quot;Zuowanglun&quot; (), a work on zuòwàng (&quot;sitting forgetting&quot;) meditation by Sima Chengzhen (647–735 CE), which is influenced by Buddhism. 
* &quot;Huángdì Yǐnfújīng&quot; (, c. 8th century CE), a text on internal alchemy and astrology.
* &quot;Huàshū&quot; (), a 10th-century CE classic on internal alchemy.
* &quot;Qīngjìng Jīng&quot; (, &quot;Classic of Clarity and Stillness&quot;), Taoist teachings from the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; with Mahayana Buddhist ideas. The text was adopted as one of the key scriptures of the Quanzhen school.
* &quot;Yinfu jing&quot; (&quot;Scripture on the Inner Talisman&quot;), a 6th-century CE text that was adopted by Quanzen school as one of their key scriptures.
* &quot;Wùzhēn piān&quot; (, &quot;Folios on Awakening to Reality&quot;) is a work on internal alchemy written by Zhang Boduan (; 987?–1082), a Song era scholar of the three teachings.
* The &quot;Lijiao shiwu lun&quot; (&quot;Fifteen discourses to Establish the Teachings&quot;) of Wang Chongyang, the founder of Quanzhen.

It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.
* &quot;The Secret of the Golden Flower&quot; (; &quot;Tàiyǐ Jīnhuá Zōngzhǐ&quot;), an influential neidan text from the late 17th century.
* The key texts of the Dragon Gate School (Longmen Pai), composed by the founder Wang Changyue (1622?–80), focus on Daoist monasticism: &quot;Chuzhen jie&quot; (&quot;Precepts for Novices&quot;), &quot;Zhongji jie&quot; (&quot;Precepts of the Central Pole&quot;), &quot;Tianxian jie&quot; (&quot;Precepts for Celestial Immortals&quot;), and &quot;Longmen xinfa&quot; (&quot;Central Teachings of Dragon Gate&quot;).

===&quot;The Taoist Canon&quot;===
The Taoist Canon (, &quot;Treasury of Tao&quot;) is also referred to as the &quot;Daozang&quot;. It was originally compiled during the Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties. The extant version was published during the Ming dynasty. The Ming &quot;Daozang&quot; includes almost 1,500 texts. Following the example of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka, it is divided into three &quot;dong&quot; (, &quot;caves&quot; or &quot;grottoes&quot;). They are arranged from &quot;highest&quot; to &quot;lowest&quot;:
# The &quot;Zhen&quot; (&quot;real&quot; or &quot;truth&quot; ) grotto, which includes the Shangqing texts.
# The &quot;Xuan&quot; (&quot;mystery&quot; ) grotto, which includes the Lingbao scriptures.
# The &quot;Shen&quot; (&quot;divine&quot; ) grotto, which includes texts predating the Maoshan () revelations.

&quot;Taoist&quot; generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose or inherit texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student.

The Shangqing School has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality.

==Symbols and images==

The &quot;taijitu&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;yin and yang symbol&quot; or simply the &quot;yin-yang&quot;, and the &quot;bagua&quot; are important symbols in Taoism because they represent key elements of Taoist cosmology (see above). Many Taoist (as well as non-Taoist) organizations make use of these symbols, and they may appear on flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. What has become the standardised yin-yang taijitu originated as a Taoist symbol in the 10th century CE during the early Song dynasty.

The tiger and dragon are more ancient symbols for yin and yang respectively, and these two animals are still widely used in Taoist art. Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature dragons, tigers, and phoenixes (with the phoenix also standing for yin) made from multicolored ceramic tiles. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.

Taoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. They typically feature mystical writing, talismans, or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.

Drawings of the Big Dipper (also called the Bushel) are also important symbols. In the Shang dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while, in later periods, it came to symbolize Taiji. A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which stands for the pole star and may be seen on such roofs between two dragons as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master.

Some Taoists saw the stars as &quot;knots in the &#x27;net of Heaven&#x27;&quot; that connected everything in &quot;heaven and earth&quot;.

Many Taoists saw the Tao as &quot;the [metaphorical] pearl of the sage&quot; and a &quot;conjunction between yin...[and] yang.&quot; Taoists also revered pearls more generally, seeing &quot;lung&quot; dragon celestials as emerging from the glint of light off of a pearl that existed &quot;in the mists of chaos&quot; and trapped in an endless cycle where they continually retrieve the pearl that makes them out of the mists. Some Internal Alchemy Taoists worshipped mercury as &quot;divine water&quot; and an embodiment of consciousness that was a &quot;flowing pearl&quot;.

In the later Qing dynasty, Taoists and intellectuals who leaned towards Taoism used the &quot;wuxing&quot; as symbols of leadership and good governance, using old religious texts and various historiographies made in prior dynasties to assign a phase from the five &quot;wuxing&quot; to different Chinese dynasties.

Symbols that represent longevity and immortality are particularly popular, and these include: cranes, pine trees, and the peaches of immortality (associated with the Queen Mother of the West). Natural symbols are also common, and include gourds, caves, clouds, mountains, and the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Other symbols used by Taoists include: the Yellow River Map, the Luoshu Square, I Ching coins, Taoist talismans (fulu), the Four Symbols (mythical creatures), and various Chinese characters (such as the character for Tao and the &quot;shou&quot; (&#x27;longevity&#x27;) character).

Taoist priests also wear distinctive robes, such as the Daojiao fushi and Taoist versions of the Daopao, which symbolize their status and school affiliation.

==Society==


Taoist communities can include a wide variety of people and groups, including daoshi, hermits, monastics, teachers, householders, ascetics, family lineages, teacher-disciple lineages, urban associations, temples, and monasteries.

According to Russell Kirkland, throughout most of its history, most Taoist traditions &quot;were founded and maintained by aristocrats or by members of the later well-to-do &#x27;gentry&#x27; class&quot;. The only real exception is the Celestial Masters movement, which had a strong basis in the lower classes (though even this movement had a hereditary leadership made up of figures of the Chang clan for generations).

===Adherents===
The number of Taoists is difficult to estimate, due to a variety of factors, including defining Taoism. According to a survey of religion in China in 2010, the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million, which is 70% of Chinese. Among these, 173 million (13%) claim an affiliation with Taoist practices. 12 million people stated that they were &quot;Taoists&quot;, a term traditionally used exclusively for initiates, priests, and experts of Taoist rituals and methods.

Since the creation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957.

It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong, but was reestablished in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the &quot;Baiyunguan&quot;, or White Cloud Temple of Beijing, belonging to the Longmen branch of the Quanzhen tradition. Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.

Taoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non-Chinese following until modern times. In Taiwan, 7.5 million people, 33% of the population, identify themselves as Taoists. Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong and Singapore show that, respectively, 14% and 11% of the people of these cities identify as Taoists.

Followers of Daoism are present in Chinese émigré communities outside Asia. It has attracted followers with no Chinese heritage. For example, in Brazil there are Daoist temples in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro that are affiliated with the Taoist Society of China. Membership of these temples is entirely of non-Chinese ancestry.

===Art and poetry===

Throughout Chinese history, there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoism. Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei, Huang Gongwang, Mi Fu, Muqi Fachang, Shitao, Ni Zan, Tang Mi, and Wang Zengzu. Taoist arts and belles-lettres represents the different regions, dialects, and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy; however, scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.

===Political aspects===
Taoism never had a unified political theory. While Huang–Lao positions justified a strong emperor as the legitimate ruler, the Taoist &quot;primitivists&quot; (of chapters 8–11 of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;) argued for a kind of anarchism. A more moderate position is presented in the Inner Chapters of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; in which the political life is presented with disdain and some kind of pluralism or perspectivism is preferred.

The syncretist position found in texts like the &quot;Huainanzi&quot; and some of the Outer Chapters of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; blend Taoist positions with Confucian views.

===Relations with other traditions===

Many scholars believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The philosophical terms &quot;Tao&quot; and &quot;De&quot; are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucian and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucian emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors &quot;naturalness&quot;, spontaneity, and individualism instead.

The entry of Buddhism into China was marked by significant interaction and syncretism with Taoism. Originally seen as a kind of &quot;foreign Taoism&quot;, Buddhism&#x27;s scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism, like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng, knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts.

Taoism especially shaped the development of Chan Buddhism, introducing elements like the concept of &quot;naturalness&quot;, distrust of scripture and text, and emphasis on embracing &quot;this life&quot; and living in the &quot;every-moment&quot;. Zhuangzi&#x27;s statements that the Tao was omnipresent and that creation escorts animals and humans to death influenced Chinese Buddhist practitioners and scholars, especially Chan Buddhists. On the other hand, Taoism also incorporated Buddhist elements during the Tang dynasty. Examples of such influence include monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in tripartite organization in certain sects.

Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism,Hinduism and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, one of the most influential philosophical commentators on &quot;Laozi&quot; (and the &quot;I Ching&quot;), was a Confucian. The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalized when aspects of the three schools were synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school.

Christian and Taoist contact often took place in the Tang dynasty, and some scholars believe that the Church of the East influenced Taoist thought on the Three Pure Ones. Emperor Taizong encouraged this, and Taoists who agreed with him and his laws incorporated elements of Christianity, Islam, Manichaeism, Judaism, Confucianism, and Buddhism into their faith.

=== Comparisons with other religions ===
Comparisons between Taoism and Epicureanism have focused on the absence of a creator or gods controlling the forces of nature in both. Lucretius&#x27; poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; describes a naturalist cosmology where there are only atoms and void (a primal duality which mirrors yin-yang in its dance of assertion/yielding), and where nature takes its course with no gods or masters. Other parallels include the similarities between Daoist &quot;wu wei&quot; (effortless action) and Epicurean &quot;lathe biosas&quot; (live in obscurity), focus on naturalness (&quot;ziran&quot;) as opposed to conventional virtues, and the prominence of the Epicurus-like Chinese sage Yang Chu in the foundational Taoist writings.

Some authors have undertaken comparative studies of Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of the history of religion such as J. J. M. de Groot, among others. A comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been made by several authors, such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov &amp; Hansen (2002), who believe that there are parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto, the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Daoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of the religions are similar. In neighboring Vietnam, Taoist values have been shown to adapt to social norms and formed emerging sociocultural beliefs together with Confucianism. It also imitates some Hinduism concept.

==Varieties==
Today, there are various living Taoist traditions, the largest and most influential are the Quanzhen School, particularly the Dragon Gate sect, and Zhengyi Dao. Quanzhen lineages are mainly monastic and ascetic tradition, based on meditation and internal cultivation, while the Orthodox Unity tradition is based on a lay priests (daoshi) who are expected to master an extensive ritual repertoire. These two traditions developed during the Song dynasty and grew to become recognized by the imperial government during late imperial China.

&quot;Some sects are concerned with the ritual control of spirits and the cosmic currents of yin and yang; others specialize in inner disciplines of meditation or breath control and mind-body exercise regimes.&quot;

There are also various smaller Taoist groups and traditions of practice. Eva Wong divides the major &quot;systems&quot; of Taoism into the following categories: Magical Taoism, Divinational Taoism, Ceremonial Taoism, Internal-Alchemical Taoism and Action and Karma Taoism.

=== Magical Taoism ===
Magical Taoism is one of the oldest systems of Taoism and its practices are similar to the shamans and sorcerers of ancient China. Magical Taoism believes there are various natural powers, deities and spirits (benevolent and malevolent) in the universe that can be made use of by specialists who know the right methods. Their magic can include rainmaking, protection, exorcism, healing, traveling to the underworld to help the dead and mediumship.

Protection magic can include the use of amulets and fulu, as well as specific rites. Protection rites often include ritual petitions to the celestial deities of the northern bushel. Divination is also a widespread practice. A commonly used method of divination in magical Taoism is sandwriting (planchette writing).

According to Eva Wong, the main sects of magical Taoism today are the Maoshan sect (a very secretive sect, not to be confused with Shangqing), the Celestial Masters and the Kun-Lun sect (which is strongly influenced by Tibetan magic and make use of Taoist and Buddhist deities).

=== Divinational Taoism ===

Divinational Taoism focuses on various divination techniques to help one predict the future and live accordingly. This practice can also carry deeper spiritual significance, since it can help one appreciate the flux of the Tao. This form of Taoism owes much to the ancient fang-shih, the Yin and yang school of thought and often relies on the classic Chinese divination text, the Yijing.

This tradition also relies on the cosmology of Wuji and Taiji, along with the teachings of yin and yang, the five elements and the Chinese calendar. There many forms of Daoist divination, they include: celestial divination (which include various systems of Chinese astrology, like Tzu-wei tu-su), terrestrial divination (feng shui), the casting of incense sticks with hexagrams on them and the interpretation of omens.

Contemporary divinational Taoism is practiced in temples and monasteries by various individuals and may not be sect specific (it is even practiced by non-daoists). This Taoist practice can be found in the Mao-shan sorcerers, the Celestial Masters sect and the Dragon Gate Taoism and Wudang Mountains sects. There are also many lay practitioners that are not affiliated with any specific sect. These lay Taoist practitioners are called &quot;kui-shih&quot;.

=== Ceremonial Taoism ===

Ceremonial Taoism focuses on ritual and devotion towards various celestial deities and spirits. The basic belief of ceremonial Taoism is that through various rites, human beings can honor the deities and these deities may then grant them with power, protection and blessings. Rituals and festivals can include chanting, offerings, and the reading of scripture. These rites are mostly performed by ritual masters who have trained extensively for this role and who may, through their mastery of ritual, intercede on behalf of laypersons.

There are various kinds of festivals in Ceremonial Taoism, including &quot;Great Services&quot; (chai-chiao) and Ritual Gatherings (fa-hui) that can last for days and can focus on repentance, rainmaking, disaster aversion or petitioning. There are feast days which honor specific deities. 164 Funerals and birthday blessings are a common service.

There is a complex and large pantheon in Taoism. It includes various deities classified into various ranks within an administrative structure, at the top of which are the celestial lords (t&#x27;ien-tsun). These include judges, heralds, officers, generals, clerks and messengers. The main division is between &quot;earlier heaven&quot; deities, who have existed since the beginning of time and &quot;later heaven&quot; deities, mortals who later became immortal.

146 Key earlier heaven deities include the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Queen Mother of the West, the Mother of the Bushel of Stars, the Seven Star Lords of the Northern Bushel and the Three Officials (Celestial, Earth, and Water). Some key later heaven deities include: Immortal Lu Tung-pin, and Emperor Kuan (Kuan-yu). Taoists may also honor local spirits and deities, as well Buddhist deities (like Guanyin, Amitabha, etc.).

The largest and most prominent sect of Ceremonial Taoism is the Way of the Celestial Masters, also known as Zhengyi Dao. The patriarch of this sect resides in Taiwan and this tradition performs numerous ceremonies which are often sponsored by the Taiwanese government. The training for Zhengyi priesthood, who are not celibate, focuses mainly on learning extensive rituals and liturgy, so that they can perform them flawlessly.

Ceremonies are practiced, to a lesser extent, in the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of the Quanzhen School and in the Xiantiandao sect, though these schools understand ritual as mainly a way to develop internal alchemy. During the Song dynasty, a popular form of ceremonial Taoism was the Thunder Rites (leifa), which focused on exorcism and protection.

=== Internal alchemy ===

Internal Alchemy Taoism or Transformation Taoism focuses on internal transformation through the use of various self-cultivation techniques like qigong, neidan (internal alchemy), Yangsheng and so forth.

The basic worldview of this Taoist tradition is that all beings are born with certain forms of energy (mainly the three treasures of jing, qi and shen), which become dissipated, weak and lost as we age. To prevent this and to increase our inner vital energies, one must practice various methods of &quot;internal alchemy&quot; (neidan) to harmonize the internal energy in one&#x27;s body and refine the &quot;golden elixir&quot; (jindan) inside the body. These meditative inner alchemical practices are believed to lead to greater longevity and even immortality (union with the Tao at death).

Another worldview is that beings must &quot;harmonize &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; forces internally to achieve immortality.&quot;
 A term used by some Taoists that sums up traditions that do not use these practices is &quot;singular path&quot;. Most traditions follow the &quot;singular path&quot;. These include the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of the Quanzhen School, the Xiantiandao (Earlier Heaven Way) sect, the Wuliupai sect, and the Wudang quan sect.

The Quanzhen School was founded by Wang Chongyang (1112–1170), a hermit in the Zhongnan mountains who was said in legends to have met and learned secret methods from two immortals: Lu Dongbin and Zhongli Quan. He then moved to Shandong and preached his teachings, founding various religious communities. His school popularized Internal Alchemy Taoism and the usage of the term.

One of his &quot;seven perfected&quot; disciples, Qiu Chuji (1148–1227), founded the Dragon Gate lineage. Chuji was also made the leader of all religions in China by Genghis Khan, making his tradition the most powerful in all of China, and contributing to Longmen&#x27;s lasting influence. Another important Quanzhen lineage is the Qingjing pai, founded by the nun Sun Bu&#x27;er (1119–1182), the only female member of the &quot;seven perfected&quot;. Today, Quanzhen is mainly made up of celibate monastics who practice vegetarianism, sobriety, internal alchemy and recite daily liturgies. The largest lineage is Dragon Gate Taoism.

Much like Taoists who see writings made by influential members of their faith as having a divine nature, some Taoists view self-cultivation as a way for emotions and self to partake in divinity, and a smaller subset of these view some mythological beings such as &quot;xian&quot; as being divine. Xian were viewed in many lights and as completely different types of beings over different times and in different places. They were sometimes viewed as deities, parts of the celestial hierarchy, metaphorical ideals that people should strive to be like, reclusive Taoist masters who know how to control and harness spiritual energies or shamans.

==== Hygiene Taoism ====
Hygiene Taoism is a Taoist tradition meant to increase life and &quot;physical and mental harmony&quot;. Some Taoists from the &quot;Hygiene School&quot; believed that they could survive only on their own breath and saliva to purify their bodies.

Much of Taoism in general is about cleanliness in some way and involves free thinking, as well as rejecting the gratification of the senses, in order to purify oneself to make the mind like &quot;the sky&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, and nature in general.

=== Karmic Taoism ===
Karmic Taoism, or &quot;Action and Karma Taoism&quot;, according to Wong, focuses on ethics and is grounded in the idea that the sacred celestial powers aid and reward those who do good and punish those who do evil. This tradition can be traced back to Song dynasty Taoist Li Ying-chang and his Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao (T&#x27;ai-shang kan-ying p&#x27;ien). Li sparked a popular movement which focused on the everyday life of ordinary persons instead of on temples, monasteries and sages. At the core of this tradition is living in harmony with the Tao and with the Way of Heaven, which means acting with benevolence, kindness and compassion. Doing evil is considered a transgression against the way and this evil will be punished by deities, celestial ministers and judges.

These ideas are quite ancient, the Taiping Jing (Scripture of Great Peace) states: &quot;accumulate good deeds, and prosperity will come to you from the Tao&quot;. Besides wealth and prosperity, Karmic Taoism also believes that doing good increases longevity, while doing evil decreases it. Another common idea in this group of Taoist traditions is that there deities, like the Kitchen Lord, who monitor our actions and report to Heaven and the Jade Emperor (who tallies them and metes out punishment and reward).

Karmic Taoism is a nonsectarian tradition adopted by many Taoist sects. The Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao is studied in Quanzhen Taoism, Hsien-t&#x27;ien Tao and in the Wu-Liu sect. All major schools of Taoism view ethics as the foundation for spirituality. Furthermore, there are those who are not affiliated with a Taoist sect who may still follow Karmic Taoism in daily life.

=== Other divisions of Taoism ===
Taoism has traditionally been divided into religious Taoism and philosophical Taoism (Dàojiào and Dàojiā), respectively.

==== Religious Taoism ====
Some Taoist sects are expressly religious in the Western sense. &quot;Lord Heaven&quot; and &quot;Jade Emperor&quot; were terms for a Taoist supreme deity also used in Confucianism and Chinese folk religion, and some conceptions of this deity thought of the two names as synonymous.

The Taoist Jade Emperor in the first millennium AD was a primary deity among polytheists who had a heaven that contained numerous ministries and officials and which was &quot;modelled on...the earthly emperor[&#x27;s rule]&quot;.

Polytheist Taoists venerated one or more of these kinds of spiritual entities: &quot;deified heroes...forces of nature&quot; and &quot;nature spirits&quot;, &quot;xian&quot;, spirits, gods, devas and other celestial beings from Chinese Buddhism, Indian Buddhism, and Chinese folk religion, various kinds of beings occupying heaven, members of the celestial bureaucracy, ghosts, &quot;mythical emperors&quot;, Laozi, a trinity of high gods that varied in how it was thought of, and the Three Pure Ones. Some Taoists chose not to worship beings they saw as gods, and only worshipped guardian spirits or &quot;celestials&quot;, such as devas, various kinds of beings occupying heaven, members of the celestial bureaucracy, and &quot;xian&quot;. In some Taoist sects, the Tao was the primary thing that was venerated and beings that would be gods in other sects were merely treated as supernatural beings similar to gods who could only act in accordance with the Tao&#x27;s wishes.

When the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; was written, many Taoists told stories and legends about heroes &quot;whose bodies had been rendered invulnerable&quot;. This could be achieved by making contact with &quot;dragon&#x27;s blood&quot; or a river in the afterlife, or drinking the &quot;waters of the &#x27;Well of Life&#x27; and eating the &#x27;fungus of immortality&#x27;&quot;.

Ordinary Chinese in the early Tang dynasty often worshipped local gods, Buddhist gods and devas, and Taoist gods simultaneously, and this population included a significant amount of the Taoists who have ever worshipped devas throughout history.

The trinity is thought by scholars to have evolved into the Three Pure Ones. It was thought of in the early Han dynasty as the three gods Tianyi, Diyi, and &quot;the Taiyi&quot;. These beings were varyingly interpreted as relatively simple heavenly, earthly, and all-purpose gods respectively, the &quot;supreme deity&quot; (an intangible god that represented the mind of the Tao), &quot;his disciple&quot;, the Lord Tao (a more physical god representing the Tao), and Lord Lao (Laozi &quot;deified&quot;), or an emanation of the Tao that was ultimately singular in nature.

An unrelated trinity was the Three Great Emperor-Officials, three of the highest &quot;shen&quot; in some branches of religious Taoism thought to be able to pardon sins.

The Tao was not worshipped alone, although gods do exist that anthropomorphize it in various ways. Laozi was sometimes thought to be a god or &quot;the image of the Tao&quot;.

&quot;Some Taoist adepts&quot; worshipped thousands of gods that were thought to exist in the body.

<text>The torr (symbol: Torr) is a unit of pressure based on an absolute scale, defined as exactly of a standard atmosphere (101325 Pa). Thus one torr is exactly (≈ ).

Historically, one torr was intended to be the same as one &quot;millimeter of mercury&quot;, but subsequent redefinitions of the two units made the torr marginally lower (by less than 0.000015%).

The torr is not part of the International System of Units (SI). Even so, it is often combined with the metric prefix milli to name one millitorr (mTorr), equal to 0.001 Torr.

The unit was named after Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and mathematician who discovered the principle of the barometer in 1644.

==Nomenclature and common errors==
The unit name &quot;torr&quot; is written in lower case, while its symbol (&quot;Torr&quot;) is always written with an uppercase initial; including in combinations with prefixes and other unit symbols, as in &quot;mTorr&quot; (millitorr) or &quot;Torr⋅L/s&quot; (torr-litres per second). The symbol (uppercase) should be used with prefix symbols (thus, mTorr and millitorr are correct, but mtorr and milliTorr are not).

The torr is sometimes incorrectly denoted by the symbol &quot;T&quot;, which is the SI symbol for the tesla, the unit measuring the strength of a magnetic field. Although frequently encountered, the alternative spelling &quot;Tor&quot; is incorrect.

==History==
Torricelli attracted considerable attention when he demonstrated the first mercury barometer to the general public. He is credited with giving the first modern explanation of atmospheric pressure. Scientists at the time were familiar with small fluctuations in height that occurred in barometers. When these fluctuations were explained as a manifestation of changes in atmospheric pressure, the science of meteorology was born.

Over time, 760 millimeters of mercury at 0 °C came to be regarded as the standard atmospheric pressure. In honour of Torricelli, the torr was defined as a unit of pressure equal to one millimeter of mercury at 0 °C. However, since the acceleration due to gravity – and thus the weight of a column of mercury – is a function of elevation and latitude (due to the rotation and non-sphericity of the Earth), this definition is imprecise and varies by location.

In 1954, the definition of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; was revised by the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures to the currently accepted definition: one atmosphere is equal to 101325 pascals. The torr was then redefined as of one atmosphere. This yields a precise definition that is unambiguous and independent of measurements of the density of mercury or the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.

==Manometric units of pressure==

&quot;Manometric units&quot; are units such as &quot;millimeters of mercury&quot; or &quot;centimeters of water&quot; that depend on an assumed density of a fluid and an assumed acceleration due to gravity. The use of these units is discouraged. Nevertheless, manometric units are routinely used in medicine and physiology, and they continue to be used in areas as diverse as weather reporting and scuba diving.

==Conversion factors==
The millimeter of mercury by definition is 133.322387415 Pa (13.5951 g/cm3 × 9.80665 m/s2 × 1 mm), which is approximated with known accuracies of density of mercury and standard gravity.

The torr is defined as of one standard atmosphere, while the atmosphere is defined as 101325 pascals. Therefore, 1 Torr is equal to  Pa. The decimal form of this fraction () is an infinitely long, periodically repeating decimal (repetend length: 18).

The relationship between the torr and the millimeter of mercury is:

*1 Torr = mmHg
*1 mmHg = Torr

The difference between one millimeter of mercury and one torr, as well as between one atmosphere (101.325 kPa) and 760 mmHg (101.3250144354 kPa), is less than one part in seven million (or less than 0.000015%). This small difference is negligible for all practical purposes.

In the European Union, the millimeter of mercury is defined as

:1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa

hence

*1 Torr = mmHg
*1 mmHg = Torr

Other units of pressure include:

* The bar (symbol: bar), defined as 100 kPa exactly.
* The atmosphere (symbol: atm), defined as 101.325 kPa exactly.

These four pressure units are used in different settings. For example, the bar is used in meteorology to report atmospheric pressures. The torr is used in high-vacuum physics and engineering.

<text>In mathematics, the trigonometric functions (also called circular functions, angle functions or goniometric functions) are real functions which relate an angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. They are widely used in all sciences that are related to geometry, such as navigation, solid mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others. They are among the simplest periodic functions, and as such are also widely used for studying periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.
The trigonometric functions most widely used in modern mathematics are the sine, the cosine, and the tangent functions. Their reciprocals are respectively the cosecant, the secant, and the cotangent functions, which are less used. Each of these six trigonometric functions has a corresponding inverse function, and an analog among the hyperbolic functions.

The oldest definitions of trigonometric functions, related to right-angle triangles, define them only for acute angles. To extend the sine and cosine functions to functions whose domain is the whole real line, geometrical definitions using the standard unit circle (i.e., a circle with radius 1 unit) are often used; then the domain of the other functions is the real line with some isolated points removed. Modern definitions express trigonometric functions as infinite series or as solutions of differential equations. This allows extending the domain of sine and cosine functions to the whole complex plane, and the domain of the other trigonometric functions to the complex plane with some isolated points removed.

== Notation ==
Conventionally, an abbreviation of each trigonometric function&#x27;s name is used as its symbol in formulas. Today, the most common versions of these abbreviations are &quot;sin&quot; for sine, &quot;cos&quot; for cosine, &quot;tan&quot; or &quot;tg&quot; for tangent, &quot;sec&quot; for secant, &quot;csc&quot; or &quot;cosec&quot; for cosecant, and &quot;cot&quot; or &quot;ctg&quot; for cotangent. Historically, these abbreviations were first used in prose sentences to indicate particular line segments or their lengths related to an arc of an arbitrary circle, and later to indicate ratios of lengths, but as the function concept developed in the 17th–18th century, they began to be considered as functions of real-number-valued angle measures, and written with functional notation, for example . Parentheses are still often omitted to reduce clutter, but are sometimes necessary; for example the expression formula_1 would typically be interpreted to mean formula_2 so parentheses are required to express formula_3

A positive integer appearing as a superscript after the symbol of the function denotes exponentiation, not function composition. For example formula_4 and formula_5 denote formula_6 not formula_7 This differs from the (historically later) general functional notation in which formula_8

However, the exponent formula_9 is commonly used to denote the inverse function, not the reciprocal. For example formula_10 and formula_11 denote the inverse trigonometric function alternatively written formula_12 The equation formula_13 implies formula_14 not formula_15 In this case, the superscript &quot;could&quot; be considered as denoting a composed or iterated function, but negative superscripts other than formula_9 are not in common use.

== Right-angled triangle definitions ==

If the acute angle is given, then any right triangles that have an angle of are similar to each other. This means that the ratio of any two side lengths depends only on . Thus these six ratios define six functions of , which are the trigonometric functions. In the following definitions, the hypotenuse is the length of the side opposite the right angle, &quot;opposite&quot; represents the side opposite the given angle , and &quot;adjacent&quot; represents the side between the angle and the right angle.

Various mnemonics can be used to remember these definitions.

In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the two acute angles is a right angle, that is, or . Therefore formula_17 and formula_18 represent the same ratio, and thus are equal. This identity and analogous relationships between the other trigonometric functions are summarized in the following table.

==Radians versus degrees==
In geometric applications, the argument of a trigonometric function is generally the measure of an angle. For this purpose, any angular unit is convenient. One common unit is degrees, in which a right angle is 90° and a complete turn is 360° (particularly in elementary mathematics).

However, in calculus and mathematical analysis, the trigonometric functions are generally regarded more abstractly as functions of real or complex numbers, rather than angles. In fact, the functions and can be defined for all complex numbers in terms of the exponential function, via power series, or as solutions to differential equations given particular initial values (&quot;see below&quot;), without reference to any geometric notions. The other four trigonometric functions (, , , ) can be defined as quotients and reciprocals of and , except where zero occurs in the denominator. It can be proved, for real arguments, that these definitions coincide with elementary geometric definitions if the argument is regarded as an angle in radians. Moreover, these definitions result in simple expressions for the derivatives and indefinite integrals for the trigonometric functions. Thus, in settings beyond elementary geometry, radians are regarded as the mathematically natural unit for describing angle measures.

When radians (rad) are employed, the angle is given as the length of the arc of the unit circle subtended by it: the angle that subtends an arc of length 1 on the unit circle is 1 rad (≈ 57.3°), and a complete turn (360°) is an angle of 2 (≈ 6.28) rad. For real number &quot;x&quot;, the notation , , etc. refers to the value of the trigonometric functions evaluated at an angle of &quot;x&quot; rad. If units of degrees are intended, the degree sign must be explicitly shown (, , etc.). Using this standard notation, the argument &quot;x&quot; for the trigonometric functions satisfies the relationship &quot;x&quot; = (180&quot;x&quot;/)°, so that, for example, when we take &quot;x&quot; = . In this way, the degree symbol can be regarded as a mathematical constant such that 1° = /180 ≈ 0.0175.

==Unit-circle definitions==

The six trigonometric functions can be defined as coordinate values of points on the Euclidean plane that are related to the unit circle, which is the circle of radius one centered at the origin of this coordinate system. While right-angled triangle definitions allow for the definition of the trigonometric functions for angles between and formula_19 radians the unit circle definitions allow the domain of trigonometric functions to be extended to all positive and negative real numbers.

Let formula_20 be the ray obtained by rotating by an angle the positive half of the -axis (counterclockwise rotation for formula_21 and clockwise rotation for formula_22). This ray intersects the unit circle at the point formula_23 The ray formula_24 extended to a line if necessary, intersects the line of equation formula_25 at point formula_26 and the line of equation formula_27 at point formula_28 The tangent line to the unit circle at the point , is perpendicular to formula_24 and intersects the - and -axes at points formula_30 and formula_31 The coordinates of these points give the values of all trigonometric functions for any arbitrary real value of in the following manner.

The trigonometric functions and are defined, respectively, as the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-coordinate values of point . That is,
:formula_32 and formula_33

In the range formula_34, this definition coincides with the right-angled triangle definition, by taking the right-angled triangle to have the unit radius as hypotenuse. And since the equation formula_35 holds for all points formula_36 on the unit circle, this definition of cosine and sine also satisfies the Pythagorean identity.
:formula_37

The other trigonometric functions can be found along the unit circle as 
:formula_38 and formula_39
:formula_40 and formula_41

By applying the Pythagorean identity and geometric proof methods, these definitions can readily be shown to coincide with the definitions of tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant in terms of sine and cosine, that is
: formula_42

Since a rotation of an angle of formula_43 does not change the position or size of a shape, the points , , , , and are the same for two angles whose difference is an integer multiple of formula_44. Thus trigonometric functions are periodic functions with period formula_44. That is, the equalities
: formula_46 and formula_47
hold for any angle and any integer . The same is true for the four other trigonometric functions. By observing the sign and the monotonicity of the functions sine, cosine, cosecant, and secant in the four quadrants, one can show that formula_44 is the smallest value for which they are periodic (i.e., formula_44 is the fundamental period of these functions). However, after a rotation by an angle formula_50, the points and already return to their original position, so that the tangent function and the cotangent function have a fundamental period of formula_50. That is, the equalities
: formula_52 and formula_53
hold for any angle and any integer .

==Algebraic values==

The algebraic expressions for the most important angles are as follows:

:formula_54 (zero angle)
:formula_55
:formula_56
:formula_57
:formula_58 (right angle)

Writing the numerators as square roots of consecutive non-negative integers, with a denominator of 2, provides an easy way to remember the values.

Such simple expressions generally do not exist for other angles which are rational multiples of a right angle.
*For an angle which, measured in degrees, is a multiple of three, the exact trigonometric values of the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of square roots. These values of the sine and the cosine may thus be constructed by ruler and compass.
*For an angle of an integer number of degrees, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of square roots and the cube root of a non-real complex number. Galois theory allows a proof that, if the angle is not a multiple of 3°, non-real cube roots are unavoidable.
*For an angle which, expressed in degrees, is a rational number, the sine and the cosine are algebraic numbers, which may be expressed in terms of th roots. This results from the fact that the Galois groups of the cyclotomic polynomials are cyclic.
*For an angle which, expressed in degrees, is not a rational number, then either the angle or both the sine and the cosine are transcendental numbers. This is a corollary of Baker&#x27;s theorem, proved in 1966.

===Simple algebraic values===
The following table lists the sines, cosines, and tangents of multiples of 15 degrees from 0 to 90 degrees.


==Definitions in analysis==

G. H. Hardy noted in his 1908 work &quot;A Course of Pure Mathematics&quot; that the definition of the trigonometric functions in terms of the unit circle is not satisfactory, because it depends implicitly on a notion of angle that can be measured by a real number. Thus in modern analysis, trigonometric functions are usually constructed without reference to geometry.

Various ways exist in the literature for defining the trigonometric functions in a manner suitable for analysis; they include:
* Using the &quot;geometry&quot; of the unit circle, which requires formulating the arc length of a circle (or area of a sector) analytically.
* By a power series, which is particularly well-suited to complex variables.
* By using an infinite product expansion.
* By inverting the inverse trigonometric functions, which can be defined as integrals of algebraic or rational functions.
* As solutions of a differential equation.

===Definition by differential equations===

Sine and cosine can be defined as the unique solution to the initial value problem:
:formula_59

Differentiating again, formula_60 and formula_61, so both sine and cosine are solutions of the same ordinary differential equation
:formula_62
Sine is the unique solution with and ; cosine is the unique solution with and .

One can then prove, as a theorem, that solutions formula_63 are periodic, having the same period. Writing this period as formula_44 is then a definition of the real number formula_50 which is independent of geometry.

Applying the quotient rule to the tangent formula_66, 
:formula_67
so the tangent function satisfies the ordinary differential equation
:formula_68
It is the unique solution with .

===Power series expansion===
The basic trigonometric functions can be defined by the following power series expansions. These series are also known as the Taylor series or Maclaurin series of these trigonometric functions:
:formula_69
The radius of convergence of these series is infinite. Therefore, the sine and the cosine can be extended to entire functions (also called &quot;sine&quot; and &quot;cosine&quot;), which are (by definition) complex-valued functions that are defined and holomorphic on the whole complex plane.

Term-by-term differentiation shows that the sine and cosine defined by the series obey the differential equation discussed previously, and conversely one can obtain these series from elementary recursion relations derived from the differential equation.

Being defined as fractions of entire functions, the other trigonometric functions may be extended to meromorphic functions, that is functions that are holomorphic in the whole complex plane, except some isolated points called poles. Here, the poles are the numbers of the form formula_70 for the tangent and the secant, or formula_71 for the cotangent and the cosecant, where is an arbitrary integer.

Recurrences relations may also be computed for the coefficients of the Taylor series of the other trigonometric functions. These series have a finite radius of convergence. Their coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation: they enumerate alternating permutations of finite sets.

More precisely, defining
: , the th up/down number,
: , the th Bernoulli number, and
: , is the th Euler number,
one has the following series expansions: 
: formula_72

: formula_73

: formula_74

: formula_75

===Continued fraction expansion===

The following continued fractions are valid in the whole complex plane:

:formula_76

:formula_77

:formula_78

The last one was used in the historically first proof that π is irrational.

===Partial fraction expansion===

There is a series representation as partial fraction expansion where just translated reciprocal functions are summed up, such that the poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match:
: formula_79
This identity can be proved with the Herglotz trick.
Combining the th with the th term lead to absolutely convergent series:
:formula_80
Similarly, one can find a partial fraction expansion for the secant, cosecant and tangent functions:
:formula_81
:formula_82
:formula_83
:formula_84

===Infinite product expansion===
The following infinite product for the sine is due to Leonhard Euler, and is of great importance in complex analysis:
:formula_85
This may be obtained from the partial fraction decomposition of formula_86 given above, which is the logarithmic derivative of formula_87. From this, it can be deduced also that
:formula_88

=== Euler&#x27;s formula and the exponential function ===
Euler&#x27;s formula relates sine and cosine to the exponential function:
:formula_89 
This formula is commonly considered for real values of , but it remains true for all complex values.

&quot;Proof&quot;: Let formula_90 and formula_91 One has formula_92 for . The quotient rule implies thus that formula_93. Therefore, formula_94 is a constant function, which equals , as formula_95 This proves the formula.

One has
:formula_96

Solving this linear system in sine and cosine, one can express them in terms of the exponential function:
: formula_97

When is real, this may be rewritten as 
: formula_98

Most trigonometric identities can be proved by expressing trigonometric functions in terms of the complex exponential function by using above formulas, and then using the identity formula_99 for simplifying the result.

Euler&#x27;s formula can also be used to define the basic trigonometric function directly, as follows, using the language of topological groups. The set formula_100 of complex numbers of unit modulus is a compact and connected topological group, which has a neighborhood of the identity that is homeomorphic to the real line. Therefore, it is isomorphic as a topological group to the one-dimensional torus group formula_101, via an isomorphism
formula_102
In pedestrian terms formula_103, and this isomorphism is unique up to taking complex conjugates.

For a nonzero real number formula_104 (the &quot;base&quot;), the function formula_105 defines an isomorphism of the group formula_106. The real and imaginary parts of formula_107 are the cosine and sine, where formula_104 is used as the base for measuring angles. For example, when formula_109, we get the measure in radians, and the usual trigonometric functions. When formula_110, we get the sine and cosine of angles measured in degrees.

Note that formula_109 is the unique value at which the derivative 
formula_112 
becomes a unit vector with positive imaginary part at formula_113. This fact can, in turn, be used to define the constant formula_44.

=== Definition via integration ===
Another way to define the trigonometric functions in analysis is using integration. For a real number formula_115, put
formula_116
where this defines this inverse tangent function. Also, formula_50 is defined by
formula_118
a definition that goes back to Karl Weierstrass.

On the interval formula_119, the trigonometric functions are defined by inverting the relation formula_120. Thus we define the trigonometric functions by
formula_121
where the point formula_122 is on the graph of formula_123 and the positive square root is taken.

This defines the trigonometric functions on formula_124. The definition can be extended to all real numbers by first observing that, as formula_125, formula_126, and so formula_127 and formula_128. Thus formula_129 and formula_130 are extended continuously so that formula_131. Now the conditions formula_132 and formula_133 define the sine and cosine as periodic functions with period formula_44, for all real numbers.

Proving the basic properties of sine and cosine, including the fact that sine and cosine are analytic, one may first establish the addition formulae. First,
formula_135
holds, provided formula_136, since
formula_137
after the substitution formula_138. In particular, the limiting case as formula_139 gives
formula_140
Thus we have
formula_141
and
formula_142
So the sine and cosine functions are related by translation over a quarter period formula_143.

===Definitions using functional equations===
One can also define the trigonometric functions using various functional equations.

For example, the sine and the cosine form the unique pair of continuous functions that satisfy the difference formula
: formula_144
and the added condition
: formula_145

===In the complex plane===
The sine and cosine of a complex number formula_146 can be expressed in terms of real sines, cosines, and hyperbolic functions as follows:
: formula_147

By taking advantage of domain coloring, it is possible to graph the trigonometric functions as complex-valued functions. Various features unique to the complex functions can be seen from the graph; for example, the sine and cosine functions can be seen to be unbounded as the imaginary part of formula_148 becomes larger (since the color white represents infinity), and the fact that the functions contain simple zeros or poles is apparent from the fact that the hue cycles around each zero or pole exactly once. Comparing these graphs with those of the corresponding Hyperbolic functions highlights the relationships between the two.

== Periodicity and asymptotes ==
The cosine and sine functions are periodic, with period formula_44, which is the smallest positive period:
formula_150
Consequently, the secant and cosecant also have formula_44 as their period. The functions sine and cosine also have semiperiods formula_50, and
formula_153
and consequently
formula_154
Also,
formula_155
The function formula_156 has a unique zero (at formula_157) in the strip formula_158. The function formula_159 has the pair of zeros formula_160 in the same strip. Because of the periodicity, the zeros of sine are 
formula_161
There zeros of cosine are
formula_162
All of the zeros are simple zeros, and both functions have derivative formula_163 at each of the zeros.

The tangent function formula_164 has a simple zero at formula_157 and vertical asymptotes at formula_160, where it has a simple pole of residue formula_167. Again, owing to the periodicity, the zeros are all the integer multiples of formula_50 and the poles are odd multiples of formula_143, all having the same residue. The poles correspond to vertical asymptotes
formula_170

The cotangent function formula_171 has a simple pole of residue 1 at the integer multiples of formula_50 and simple zeros at odd multiples of formula_143. The poles correspond to vertical asymptotes
formula_174

==Basic identities==
Many identities interrelate the trigonometric functions. This section contains the most basic ones; for more identities, see List of trigonometric identities. These identities may be proved geometrically from the unit-circle definitions or the right-angled-triangle definitions (although, for the latter definitions, care must be taken for angles that are not in the interval , see Proofs of trigonometric identities). For non-geometrical proofs using only tools of calculus, one may use directly the differential equations, in a way that is similar to that of the above proof of Euler&#x27;s identity. One can also use Euler&#x27;s identity for expressing all trigonometric functions in terms of complex exponentials and using properties of the exponential function.

===Parity===
The cosine and the secant are even functions; the other trigonometric functions are odd functions. That is:
:formula_175

===Periods===
All trigonometric functions are periodic functions of period . This is the smallest period, except for the tangent and the cotangent, which have as smallest period. This means that, for every integer , one has
:formula_176

===Pythagorean identity===

The Pythagorean identity, is the expression of the Pythagorean theorem in terms of trigonometric functions. It is 
:formula_177.
Dividing through by either formula_178 or formula_4 gives
:formula_180
and
:formula_181.

===Sum and difference formulas===

The sum and difference formulas allow expanding the sine, the cosine, and the tangent of a sum or a difference of two angles in terms of sines and cosines and tangents of the angles themselves. These can be derived geometrically, using arguments that date to Ptolemy. One can also produce them algebraically using Euler&#x27;s formula.
; Sum
:formula_182
; Difference
:formula_183

When the two angles are equal, the sum formulas reduce to simpler equations known as the double-angle formulae.

:formula_184

These identities can be used to derive the product-to-sum identities.

By setting formula_185 all trigonometric functions of formula_186 can be expressed as rational fractions of formula_115:
:formula_188
Together with 
:formula_189
this is the tangent half-angle substitution, which reduces the computation of integrals and antiderivatives of trigonometric functions to that of rational fractions.

===Derivatives and antiderivatives===
The derivatives of trigonometric functions result from those of sine and cosine by applying the quotient rule. The values given for the antiderivatives in the following table can be verified by differentiating them. The number  is a constant of integration.
Note: For formula_190 the integral of formula_191 can also be written as formula_192 and for the integral of formula_193 for formula_194 as formula_195 where formula_196 is the inverse hyperbolic sine.

Alternatively, the derivatives of the &#x27;co-functions&#x27; can be obtained using trigonometric identities and the chain rule:

:formula_197

==Inverse functions==

The trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence not injective, so strictly speaking, they do not have an inverse function. However, on each interval on which a trigonometric function is monotonic, one can define an inverse function, and this defines inverse trigonometric functions as multivalued functions. To define a true inverse function, one must restrict the domain to an interval where the function is monotonic, and is thus bijective from this interval to its image by the function. The common choice for this interval, called the set of principal values, is given in the following table. As usual, the inverse trigonometric functions are denoted with the prefix &quot;arc&quot; before the name or its abbreviation of the function.
The notations , , etc. are often used for and , etc. When this notation is used, inverse functions could be confused with multiplicative inverses. The notation with the &quot;arc&quot; prefix avoids such a confusion, though &quot;arcsec&quot; for arcsecant can be confused with &quot;arcsecond&quot;.

Just like the sine and cosine, the inverse trigonometric functions can also be expressed in terms of infinite series. They can also be expressed in terms of complex logarithms.

==Applications==
===Angles and sides of a triangle===
In this section , , denote the three (interior) angles of a triangle, and , , denote the lengths of the respective opposite edges. They are related by various formulas, which are named by the trigonometric functions they involve.

====Law of sines====

The law of sines states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides , , and and angles opposite those sides , and :
formula_198
where is the area of the triangle,
or, equivalently,
formula_199
where is the triangle&#x27;s circumradius.

It can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the above definition of sine. The law of sines is useful for computing the lengths of the unknown sides in a triangle if two angles and one side are known. This is a common situation occurring in &quot;triangulation&quot;, a technique to determine unknown distances by measuring two angles and an accessible enclosed distance.

====Law of cosines====

The law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem:
formula_200
or equivalently,
formula_201

In this formula the angle at is opposite to the side . This theorem can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the Pythagorean theorem.

The law of cosines can be used to determine a side of a triangle if two sides and the angle between them are known. It can also be used to find the cosines of an angle (and consequently the angles themselves) if the lengths of all the sides are known.

====Law of tangents====

The law of tangents says that:
:formula_202.

====Law of cotangents====

If &quot;s&quot; is the triangle&#x27;s semiperimeter, (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;)/2, and &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the triangle&#x27;s incircle, then &quot;rs&quot; is the triangle&#x27;s area. Therefore Heron&#x27;s formula implies that:

:formula_203.

The law of cotangents says that:
:formula_204
It follows that
:formula_205

===Periodic functions===


The trigonometric functions are also important in physics. The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe simple harmonic motion, which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of uniform circular motion.

Trigonometric functions also prove to be useful in the study of general periodic functions. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions are useful for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light waves.

Under rather general conditions, a periodic function can be expressed as a sum of sine waves or cosine waves in a Fourier series. Denoting the sine or cosine basis functions by , the expansion of the periodic function takes the form:
formula_206

For example, the square wave can be written as the Fourier series
formula_207

In the animation of a square wave at top right it can be seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a sawtooth wave are shown underneath.

==History==

While the early study of trigonometry can be traced to antiquity, the trigonometric functions as they are in use today were developed in the medieval period. The chord function was defined by Hipparchus of Nicaea (180–125 BCE) and Ptolemy of Roman Egypt (90–165 CE). The functions of sine and versine (1 – cosine) are closely related to the &quot;jyā&quot; and &quot;koti-jyā&quot; functions used in Gupta period Indian astronomy (&quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin. (See Aryabhata&#x27;s sine table.)

All six trigonometric functions in current use were known in Islamic mathematics by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in solving triangles. Al-Khwārizmī (c. 780–850) produced tables of sines and cosines. Circa 860, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi defined the tangent and the cotangent, and produced their tables. Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī (853–929) defined the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1° to 90°. The trigonometric functions were later studied by mathematicians including Omar Khayyám, Bhāskara II, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Jamshīd al-Kāshī (14th century), Ulugh Beg (14th century), Regiomontanus (1464), Rheticus, and Rheticus&#x27; student Valentinus Otho.

Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1400) made early strides in the analysis of trigonometric functions in terms of infinite series. (See Madhava series and Madhava&#x27;s sine table.)

The tangent function was brought to Europe by Giovanni Bianchini in 1467 in trigonometry tables he created to support the calculation of stellar coordinates. 

The terms &quot;tangent&quot; and &quot;secant&quot; were first introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fincke in his book &quot;Geometria rotundi&quot; (1583).

The 17th century French mathematician Albert Girard made the first published use of the abbreviations &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;cos&quot;, and &quot;tan&quot; in his book &quot;Trigonométrie&quot;.

In a paper published in 1682, Gottfried Leibniz proved that is not an algebraic function of . Though defined as ratios of sides of a right triangle, and thus appearing to be rational functions, Leibnitz result established that they are actually transcendental functions of their argument. The task of assimilating circular functions into algebraic expressions was accomplished by Euler in his &quot;Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite&quot; (1748). His method was to show that the sine and cosine functions are alternating series formed from the even and odd terms respectively of the exponential series. He presented &quot;Euler&#x27;s formula&quot;, as well as near-modern abbreviations (&quot;sin.&quot;, &quot;cos.&quot;, &quot;tang.&quot;, &quot;cot.&quot;, &quot;sec.&quot;, and &quot;cosec.&quot;).

A few functions were common historically, but are now seldom used, such as the chord, versine (which appeared in the earliest tables), haversine, coversine, half-tangent (tangent of half an angle), and exsecant. List of trigonometric identities shows more relations between these functions.

: formula_208

Historically, trigonometric functions were often combined with logarithms in compound functions like the logarithmic sine, logarithmic cosine, logarithmic secant, logarithmic cosecant, logarithmic tangent and logarithmic cotangent.

==Etymology==

The word derives from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;bend; bay&quot;, and more specifically &quot;the hanging fold of the upper part of a toga&quot;, &quot;the bosom of a garment&quot;, which was chosen as the translation of what was interpreted as the Arabic word &quot;jaib&quot;, meaning &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;fold&quot; in the twelfth-century translations of works by Al-Battani and al-Khwārizmī into Medieval Latin.
The choice was based on a misreading of the Arabic written form &quot;j-y-b&quot; (), which itself originated as a transliteration from Sanskrit &#x27;, which along with its synonym &#x27; (the standard Sanskrit term for the sine) translates to &quot;bowstring&quot;, being in turn adopted from Ancient Greek &quot;string&quot;.

The word &quot;tangent&quot; comes from Latin &quot;tangens&quot; meaning &quot;touching&quot;, since the line &quot;touches&quot; the circle of unit radius, whereas &quot;secant&quot; stems from Latin &quot;secans&quot;—&quot;cutting&quot;—since the line &quot;cuts&quot; the circle.

The prefix &quot;co-&quot; (in &quot;cosine&quot;, &quot;cotangent&quot;, &quot;cosecant&quot;) is found in Edmund Gunter&#x27;s &quot;Canon triangulorum&quot; (1620), which defines the &quot;cosinus&quot; as an abbreviation for the &quot;sinus complementi&quot; (sine of the complementary angle) and proceeds to define the &quot;cotangens&quot; similarly.

<text>Thermochemistry is the study of the heat energy which is associated with chemical reactions and/or phase changes such as melting and boiling. A reaction may release or absorb energy, and a phase change may do the same. Thermochemistry focuses on the energy exchange between a system and its surroundings in the form of heat. Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction. In combination with entropy determinations, it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable.

Endothermic reactions absorb heat, while exothermic reactions release heat. Thermochemistry coalesces the concepts of thermodynamics with the concept of energy in the form of chemical bonds. The subject commonly includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of formation, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy.
Thermochemistry is one part of the broader field of chemical thermodynamics, which deals with the exchange of all forms of energy between system and surroundings, including not only heat but also various forms of work, as well the exchange of matter. When all forms of energy are considered, the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions are generalized to exergonic reactions and endergonic reactions.

==History==
Thermochemistry rests on two generalizations. Stated in modern terms, they are as follows:

#Lavoisier and Laplace&#x27;s law (1780): The energy change accompanying any transformation is equal and opposite to energy change accompanying the reverse process.
#Hess&#x27; law of constant heat summation (1840): The energy change accompanying any transformation is the same whether the process occurs in one step or many.

These statements preceded the first law of thermodynamics (1845) and helped in its formulation.

Thermochemistry also involves the measurement of the latent heat of phase transitions. Joseph Black had already introduced the concept of latent heat in 1761, based on the observation that heating ice at its melting point did not raise the temperature but instead caused some ice to melt.

Gustav Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: dΔH / dT = ΔCp. Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.

==Calorimetry==
The measurement of heat changes is performed using calorimetry, usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs. The temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a thermometer or thermocouple, and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated. Modern calorimeters are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read-out of information, one example being the differential scanning calorimeter.

==Systems==
Several thermodynamic definitions are very useful in thermochemistry. A system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied. Everything outside the system is considered the surroundings or environment. A system may be:
* a (completely) isolated system which can exchange neither energy nor matter with the surroundings, such as an insulated bomb calorimeter
* a thermally isolated system which can exchange mechanical work but not heat or matter, such as an insulated closed piston or balloon
* a mechanically isolated system which can exchange heat but not mechanical work or matter, such as an uninsulated bomb calorimeter
* a closed system which can exchange energy but not matter, such as an uninsulated closed piston or balloon
* an open system which it can exchange both matter and energy with the surroundings, such as a pot of boiling water

==Processes==
A system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes. A process relates to the change of state. An isothermal (same-temperature) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant. An isobaric (same-pressure) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant. A process is adiabatic when no heat exchange occurs.

<text>The London Eye, or the Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe&#x27;s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually. It has been featured numerous times in popular culture.
The structure is tall and the wheel has a diameter of . When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world&#x27;s tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the Star of Nanchang in 2006, the Singapore Flyer in 2008, the High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014, and the Ain Dubai in 2021. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike these taller examples, the Eye is described by its operators as &quot;the world&#x27;s tallest cantilevered observation wheel&quot;. The Eye offered the highest public viewing point in London until it was superseded by the observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard in early 2013.

The London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth. The nearest tube station is Waterloo.

==History==

===Design and construction===
The London Eye was designed by the husband-and-wife team of Julia Barfield and David Marks of Marks Barfield Architects.

Mace was responsible for construction management, with Hollandia as the main steelwork contractor and Tilbury Douglas as the civil contractor. Consulting engineers Tony Gee &amp; Partners designed the foundation works while Beckett Rankine designed the marine works.

Nathaniel Lichfield and Partners assisted The Tussauds Group in obtaining planning and listed building consent to alter the wall on the South Bank of the Thames. They also examined and reported on the implications of a Section 106 agreement attached to the original contract, and also prepared planning and listed building consent applications for the permanent retention of the attraction, which involved the co-ordination of an Environmental Statement and the production of a planning supporting statement detailing the reasons for its retention.
The rim of the Eye is supported by tensioned steel cables and resembles a huge spoked bicycle wheel. The lighting was re-done with LED lighting from Color Kinetics in December 2006 to allow digital control of the lights as opposed to the manual replacement of gels over fluorescent tubes.

The wheel was constructed in sections which were floated up the Thames on barges and assembled lying flat on piled platforms in the river. Once the wheel was complete it was lifted into an upright position by a strand jack system made by Enerpac. It was first raised at 2 degrees per hour until it reached 65 degrees, then left in that position for a week while engineers prepared for the second phase of the lift. The project was European with major components coming from six countries: the steel was supplied from the UK and fabricated in The Netherlands by the Dutch company Hollandia, the cables came from Italy, the bearings came from Germany (FAG/Schaeffler Group), the spindle and hub were cast in the Czech Republic, the capsules were made by Poma in France (and the glass for these came from Italy), and the electrical components from the UK.

===Opening===
The London Eye was formally opened by the Prime Minister Tony Blair on 31 December 1999, but did not open to the paying public until 9 March 2000 because of a capsule clutch problem.

The London Eye was originally intended as a temporary attraction, with a five-year lease. In December 2001, operators submitted an application to Lambeth Council to give the London Eye permanent status, and the application was granted in July 2002.

On 5 June 2008, it was announced that 30 million people had ridden the London Eye since it opened.

==Passenger capsules==
The wheel&#x27;s 32 sealed and air-conditioned ovoidal passenger capsules, designed and supplied by Poma, are attached to the external circumference of the wheel and rotated by electric motors. The capsules are numbered from 1 to 33, excluding number 13 for superstitious reasons. Each of the capsules represents one of the London Boroughs, and holds up to 25 people, who are free to walk around inside the capsule, though seating is provided. The wheel rotates at per second (about 0.9 km/h or 0.6 mph) so that one revolution takes about 30 minutes, giving a theoretical capacity of 1,600 passengers per hour. It does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level. It is stopped to allow disabled or elderly passengers time to embark and disembark safely.

In 2009, the first stage of a £12.5 million capsule upgrade began. Each capsule was taken down and floated down the river to Tilbury Docks in Essex.

On 2 June 2013, a passenger capsule was named the Coronation Capsule to mark the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

In March 2020, the London Eye celebrated its 20th birthday by turning several of its pods into experiences themed around London. The experiences included a pub in a capsule, a west end theatre pod and a garden party with flower arrangements to represent the eight London Royal parks.

==Ownership and branding==
Marks Barfield (the lead architects), The Tussauds Group, and British Airways were the original owners of the London Eye. Tussauds bought out British Airways&#x27; stake in 2005 and then Marks Barfield&#x27;s stake in 2006 to become sole owner.

In May 2007, the Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group which was then the owner of the Eye; Tussauds was merged with Blackstone&#x27;s Merlin Entertainments and disappeared as an entity. British Airways continued its brand association, but from the beginning of 2008 the name British Airways was dropped from the logo.

On 12 August 2009, the London Eye saw another rebrand, this time being called &quot;The Merlin Entertainments London Eye&quot;. A refurbished ticket hall and 4D cinema experience were designed by architect Kay Elliott working with project designer Craig Sciba, and Simex-Iwerks as the 4D theatre hardware specialists. The film was written and directed by Julian Napier and produced by Phil Streather.

In January 2011, a lighting-up ceremony marked the start of a three-year deal between EDF Energy and Merlin Entertainments.

Coca-Cola began to sponsor the London Eye from January 2015. On the day the sponsorship was announced the London Eye was lit in red.

In February 2020, lastminute.com replaced Coca-Cola as the sponsor. Grammy Award-winning singer Meghan Trainor performed at the launch party on a boat overlooking the London Eye.

In March 2020, the wheel was illuminated blue every Thursday at 8pm in support of the National Health Service as part of the ‘Clap for our Carers’ campaign created during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Financial difficulties==

On 20 May 2005, there were reports of a leaked letter showing that the South Bank Centre (SBC)—owners of part of the land on which the struts of the Eye are located—had served a notice to quit on the attraction along with a demand for an increase in rent from £64,000 per year to £2.5 million, which the operators rejected as unaffordable.
On 25 May 2005, London mayor Ken Livingstone vowed that the landmark would remain in London. He also pledged that if the dispute was not resolved he would use his powers to ask the London Development Agency to issue a compulsory purchase order. The land in question is a small part of the Jubilee Gardens, which was given to the SBC for £1 when the Greater London Council was broken up.

The South Bank Centre and the British Airways London Eye agreed on a 25-year lease on 8 February 2006 after a judicial review over the rent dispute. The lease agreement meant that the South Bank Centre, a publicly funded charity, would receive at least £500,000 a year from the attraction, the status of which is secured for the foreseeable future.

Tussauds also announced the acquisition of the entire one-third interests of British Airways and Marks Barfield in the Eye as well as the outstanding debt to BA. These agreements gave Tussauds 100% ownership and resolved the debt from the Eye&#x27;s construction loan from British Airways, which stood at more than £150 million by mid-2005 and had been charging an interest rate of 25% per annum.

==Critical reception==
Sir Richard Rogers, winner of the 2007 Pritzker Architecture Prize, wrote of the London Eye in a book about the project:
==Transport links==
The nearest London Underground station is Waterloo, although Charing Cross, Embankment, and Westminster are also within easy walking distance.

Connection with National Rail services is made at London Waterloo station and London Waterloo East station.

London River Services operated by Thames Clippers and City Cruises stop at the London Eye Pier.

<text>Taekwondo (; ; ) is a Korean martial art and combat sport involving primarily kicking techniques and punching. &quot;Taekwondo&quot; can be translated as &quot;tae&quot; (&quot;strike with foot&quot;), &quot;kwon&quot; (&quot;strike with hand&quot;), and &quot;do&quot; (&quot;the art or way&quot;). In addition to its five tenets of courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control and indomitable spirit, the sport requires three physical skills: &quot;poomsae&quot; (, Form), &quot;kyorugi&quot; (, Sparring) and &quot;gyeokpa&quot; (, Breaking Technique).

Poomsae are patterns that demonstrate a range of kicking, punching and blocking techniques, kyorugi involves the kind of sparring seen in the Olympics, and gyeokpa is the art of breaking wooden boards. Taekwondo also sometimes involves the use of weapons such as swords and nunchucks (nunchaku). Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform known as a .

It is a combat sport which was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate and Chinese martial arts.

The oldest governing body for taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original &quot;kwans&quot;, or martial arts schools, in Korea. The main international organizational bodies for taekwondo today are various branches of the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), originally founded by Choi Hong-hi in 1966, and the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World Taekwondo Federation or WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo Association. Gyeorugi (), a type of full-contact sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000. In 2018, the South Korean government officially designated taekwondo as Korea&#x27;s national martial art. At the Olympic and Paralympic level, taekwondo is governed by World Taekwondo.

== History ==
===Emergence of various &quot;kwans&quot; ===
Beginning in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II and the Japanese occupation, new martial arts schools called &quot;kwans&quot; opened in Seoul. These schools were established by Korean martial artists with backgrounds in Japanese and Chinese martial arts.

Early progenitors of taekwondo—the founders of the nine original &quot;kwans&quot;—who were able to study in Japan were exposed to Japanese martial arts, including karate, judo, and kendo, while others were exposed to the martial arts of China and Manchuria.

Discussions around the historical influences of taekwondo have been controversial, with two main schools of thought: traditionalism and revisionism. Traditionalism holds that the origins of taekwondo are indigenous while revisionism, the prevailing theory, argues that taekwondo is rooted in karate. In later years, the Korean government has been a significant supporter of traditionalist views as to divorce taekwondo from its link to Japan and give Korea a &quot;legitimate cultural past&quot;.

=== Attempt to standardise taekwondo ===
In 1952, South Korean president Syngman Rhee witnessed a martial arts demonstration by South Korean Army officers Choi Hong-hi and Nam Tae-hi from the 29th Infantry Division. He misrecognized the technique on display as taekkyon, and urged martial arts to be introduced to the army under a single system. Beginning in 1955 the leaders of the &quot;kwans&quot; began discussing in earnest the possibility of creating a unified Korean martial art. Until then, &quot;Tang Soo Do&quot; was the term used for Korean karate, using the Korean hanja pronunciation of the Japanese kanji . The name &quot;Tae Soo Do&quot; () was also used to describe a unified style Korean martial arts. This name consists of the hanja &quot;to stomp, trample&quot;, &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;way, discipline&quot;.
Choi Hong-hi advocated the use of the name &quot;Tae Kwon Do&quot;, replacing &quot;su&quot; &quot;hand&quot; with (Revised Romanization: ; McCune–Reischauer: ) &quot;fist&quot;, the term also used for &quot;martial arts&quot; in Chinese (pinyin ). The name was also the closest to the pronunciation of &quot;taekkyon&quot;, The new name was initially slow to catch on among the leaders of the &quot;kwans&quot;. During this time taekwondo was also adopted for use by the South Korean military, which increased its popularity among civilian martial arts schools.

=== Development of multiple styles ===
In 1959, the Korea Tang Soo Do Association (later Korea Taekwondo Association or KTA) was established to facilitate the unification of Korean martial arts. Choi wanted all the other member &quot;kwans&quot; of the KTA to adopt his own Chan Hon-style of taekwondo, as a unified style. This was, however, met with resistance as the other &quot;kwans&quot; instead wanted a unified style to be created based on inputs from all the &quot;kwans&quot;, to serve as a way to bring on the heritage and characteristics of all of the styles, not just the style of a single &quot;kwan&quot;. As a response to this, along with political disagreements about teaching taekwondo in North Korea and unifying the whole Korean Peninsula, Choi broke with the (South Korea) KTA in 1966, in order to establish the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)— a separate governing body devoted to institutionalizing his Chan Hon-style of taekwondo in Canada.

Initially, the South Korean president gave Choi&#x27;s ITF limited support, due to their personal relationship. However, Choi and the government later split on the issue of whether to accept North Korean influence on the martial art. In 1972, South Korea withdrew its support for the ITF. The ITF continued to function as an independent federation, then headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Choi continued to develop the ITF-style, notably with the 1983 publication of his &quot;Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do&quot;. After his retirement, the ITF split in 2001 and then again in 2002 to create three separate ITF federations, each of which continues to operate today under the same name.

In 1972, the KTA and the South Korean government&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism established the Kukkiwon as the new national academy for taekwondo. Kukkiwon now serves many of the functions previously served by the KTA, in terms of defining a government-sponsored unified style of taekwondo. In 1973 the KTA and Kukkiwon supported the establishment of the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), which later changed its name to &quot;World Taekwondo&quot; (WT) in 2017 due to the previous initialism overlapping with an internet slang term. While the Kukkiwon focus on the martial art and self-defence aspects of Kukki-Taekwondo, the WT promoted the sportive side, and its competitions employ a subset of the techniqes present in the Kukkiwon-style taekwondo. For this reason, Kukkiwon-style Taekwondo is often referred to as WT-style Taekwondo, sport-style Taekwondo, or Olympic-style Taekwondo, though in reality the style is defined by the Kukkiwon, not the WT.

Since 2000, taekwondo has been one of three Asian martial arts (the others being judo and karate), and one of six total (the others being the previously mentioned, Greco-Roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and boxing) included in the Olympic Games. It started as a demonstration event at the 1988 games in Seoul, a year after becoming a medal event at the Pan Am Games, and became an official medal event at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In 2010, taekwondo was accepted as a Commonwealth Games sport.

== Features ==

Taekwondo is characterized by its emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping and spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques. In fact, WT sparring competitions award additional points for strikes that incorporate spinning kicks, kicks to the head, or both.

=== Typical curriculum ===

While organisations such as ITF or Kukkiwon define the general style of taekwondo, individual clubs and schools tend to tailor their taekwondo practices. Although each taekwondo club or school is different, a student typically takes part in most or all of the following:
* Forms ( or , also , and ): these serve the same function as in the study of karate
* Sparring ( or ): sparring includes variations such as freestyle sparring (in which competitors spar without interruption for several minutes); seven-, three-, two-, and one-step sparring (in which students practice pre-arranged sparring combinations); and point sparring (in which sparring is interrupted and then resumed after each point is scored)
* Breaking ( or ): the breaking of boards is used for testing, training, and martial arts demonstrations. Demonstrations often also incorporate bricks, tiles, and blocks of ice or other materials. These techniques can be separated into three types:
** Power breaking – using straightforward techniques to break as many boards as possible
** Speed breaking – boards are held loosely by one edge, putting special focus on the speed required to perform the break
** Special techniques – breaking fewer boards but by using jumping or flying techniques to attain greater height, distance, or to clear obstacles
* Self-defense techniques ()
* Throwing and/or falling techniques ( or )
* Both anaerobic and aerobic workout, including stretching
* Relaxation and meditation exercises, as well as breathing control
* A focus on mental and ethical discipline, etiquette, justice, respect, self-confidence, and leadership skills
* Examinations to progress to the next rank

Though weapons training is not a formal part of most taekwondo federation curriculum, individual schools will often incorporate additional training with weapons such as staffs, knives, and sticks.

== Styles and organizations ==

There are a number of major taekwondo styles as well as a few niche styles. Most styles are associated with a governing body or federation that defines the style. The major technical differences among taekwondo styles and organizations generally revolve around:
* The patterns practiced by each style (called , &quot;pumsae&quot; , or , depending on the style); these are sets of prescribed formal sequences of movements that demonstrate mastery of posture, positioning, and technique
* Differences in the sparring rules for competition.
* Martial arts philosophy.

=== 1946: Traditional Taekwondo ===
&quot;Traditional Taekwondo&quot; refers to the 1940s and 1950s martial arts by the nine original &quot;kwans&quot;. They used a number of different names such as Tang Soo Do (Chinese Hand Way), Kong Soo Do (Empty Hand Way) and Tae Soo Do (Foot Hand Way). Traditional Taekwondo is still practised today but generally under names like Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do. In 1959, the name &quot;taekwondo&quot; was agreed upon by the nine original &quot;kwans&quot; as a common term for their martial arts. As part of the unification process, The Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA) was formed through a collaborative effort by representatives from all the &quot;kwans&quot;, and the work began on a common curriculum, which eventually resulted in the Kukkiwon and the Kukki Style of Taekwondo. The original &quot;kwans&quot; that formed KTA continues to exist today, but as independent fraternal membership organizations that support the World Taekwondo and Kukkiwon. The &quot;kwans&quot; also function as a channel for the issuing of Kukkiwon dan and poom certification (black belt ranks) for their members. The official curriculum of those &quot;kwans&quot; that joined the unification is that of the Kukkiwon, with the notable exception of half the Oh Do Kwan which joined the ITF instead and therefore uses the Chan Hon curriculum.

=== 1966: ITF/Chang Hon-style Taekwondo ===
International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)-style Taekwondo, more accurately known as Chang Hon-style Taekwondo, is defined by Choi Hong-hi&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do&quot; published in 1983.

In 1990, the Global Taekwondo Federation (GTF) split from the ITF due to the political controversies surrounding the ITF; the GTF continues to practice ITF-style Taekwondo, however, with additional elements incorporated into the style. Likewise, the ITF itself split in 2001 and again in 2002 into three separate federations, headquartered in Austria, the United Kingdom, and Spain respectively.

The GTF and all three ITFs practice Choi&#x27;s ITF-style Taekwondo. In ITF-style Taekwondo, the word used for &quot;forms&quot; is &quot;tul&quot;; the specific set of tul used by the ITF is called &quot;Chang Hon&quot;. Choi defined 24 &quot;Chang Hon&quot; tul. The names and symbolism of the Chang Hon tul refer to elements of Korean history, culture and religious philosophy. The GTF-variant of ITF practices an additional six tul.

Within the ITF taekwondo tradition there are two sub-styles:
* The style of taekwondo practised by the ITF before its 1973 split with the KTA is sometimes called by ITF practitioners &quot;Traditional Taekwondo&quot;, though a more accurate term would be &quot;Traditional ITF Taekwondo&quot;.
* After the 1973 split, Choi Hong-hi continued to develop and refine the style, ultimately publishing his work in his 1983 &quot;Encyclopedia of Taekwondo&quot;. Among the refinements incorporated into this new sub-style is the &quot;sine wave&quot;; one of Choi Hong-hi&#x27;s later principles of taekwondo is that the body&#x27;s centre of gravity should be raised-and-lowered throughout a movement.

Some ITF schools adopt the sine wave style, while others do not. Essentially all ITF schools do, however, use the patterns (tul) defined in the Encyclopedia, with some exceptions related to the forms &quot;Juche&quot; and &quot;Ko-Dang&quot;.

=== 1969: ATA/Songahm-style Taekwondo ===
In 1969, Haeng Ung Lee, a former Taekwondo instructor in the South Korean military, relocated to Omaha, Nebraska and established a chain of martial arts schools in the United States under the banner of the American Taekwondo Association (ATA). Like Jhoon Rhee Taekwondo, ATA Taekwondo has its roots in traditional taekwondo. The style of Taekwondo practised by the ATA is called &quot;Songahm Taekwondo&quot;. The ATA went on to become one of the largest chains of Taekwondo schools in the United States.

The ATA established international spin-offs called the Songahm Taekwondo Federation (STF) and the World Traditional Taekwondo Union (WTTU) to promote the practice of Songahm Taekwondo internationally. In 2015, all the spin-offs were reunited under the umbrella of ATA International.

=== 1970s: Jhoon Rhee-style Taekwondo ===

In 1962 Jhoon Rhee, upon graduating from college in Texas, relocated to and established a chain of martial arts schools in the Washington, D.C. area that practiced Traditional Taekwondo. In the 1970s, at the urging of Choi Hong-hi, Rhee adopted ITF-style Taekwondo within his chain of schools, but like the GTF later departed from the ITF due to the political controversies surrounding Choi and the ITF. Rhee went on to develop his own style of taekwondo called Jhoon Rhee-style Taekwondo, incorporating elements of both traditional and ITF-style Taekwondo as well as original elements.

=== 1972: Kukki-style / WT-Taekwondo ===

In 1972 the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA) Central Dojang opened in Seoul; in 1973 the name was changed to Kukkiwon. Under the sponsorship of the South Korean government&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism the Kukkiwon became the new national academy for Taekwondo, thereby establishing a new &quot;unified&quot; style of Taekwondo. In 1973 the KTA established the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF, now called World Taekwondo, WT) to promote the sportive side of Kukki-Taekwondo. The International Olympic Committee recognized the WT and Taekwondo sparring in 1980. For this reason, the Kukkiwon-defined style of Taekwondo is sometimes referred to as &quot;Sport-style Taekwondo&quot;, &quot;Olympic-style Taekwondo&quot;, or &quot;WT-style Taekwondo&quot;, but the style itself is defined by the Kukkiwon, not by the WT, and the WT competition ruleset itself only allows the use of a very small number of the total number of techniques included in the style.

===Extreme Taekwondo===
Extreme Taekwondo is a hybrid style created in 2008, by Taekwondo practitioner Shin-Min Cheol, who also founded Mirme Korea in 2012, a production company that helped spreading his style. His company is based on promoting TKD tournaments, in a style which mixed other martial arts like Karate and Capoeira.

===Hup Kwon Do===
Hup Kwon Do is a hybrid style of Taekwondo created by a Malayan martial artist called Grandmaster Lee in 1989. He opened his first school in Penang, and originally developed this system as a self-defense technique, mixing Taekwondo with a multitude of other martial arts, such as Kendo, Bokken, Wado Shimpo, Kickboxing and Karate. It is mainly governed by the World Hupkwondo Council (WHC).

===Han Moo Do===
Han Moo Doo is a hybrid martial art created by Korean practitioner Yoon Sung Hwang in 1989, in Kauhava, Finland.
Like other variations of Taekwondo, it first started out as a method of self-defense before spreading across Northern countries such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark. It combines Taekwondo with other Korean martial arts like Hapkido and Hoi Jeon Moo Sool.
It mixes striking and grappling techniques, and some schools also incorporate weapons training into it.

===Han Mu Do===
Han Mu Do is a martial art developed by Korean practitioner Dr. Young Kimm, who founded the World Hanmudo Association to assure the preservation of his style.
Its ideals are mostly based on the Han philosophy, mainly about the mind balance of the practitioner.
Young Kimm studied Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Kuk Sul, Hapkido, Korean Judo and Kum Do, mixing all of their techniques together to create his own style.

===Teuk Gong Moo Sool===
Teukgong Moosool is a combat system developed in South Korea by the special forces units that is projected to stop the opponent as quickly as possible, although it was also used in sports competition.
It is a hybrid style that mixes Taekwondo, Judo, Hapkido, Sanda (and other Chinese wushu styles) and Korean Kickboxing and it follows the Yin-Yang and five elements philosophy.
Its origins date back to the 1960s–70s, but it was only introduced in special forces training in 1979.

=== Hoshin Moosool ===
Hoshin Moosool is a martial art and combat system founded by Taekwondo Grandmaster Kwan-Young Lee. Its techniques and method are inspired from Master Lee&#x27;s experience as a close combat instructor during the Vietnam war, instructor for the French Police Elite Unit (RAID) and time as a member of the Korean and French intelligence service.

== Equipment and facilities ==

A Taekwondo practitioner typically wears a () uniform with a belt tied around the waist.

When sparring, padded equipment is usually worn. In the ITF tradition, typically only the hands and feet are padded. In the Kukkiwon/WT tradition, full-contact sparring is facilitated by the employment of more extensive equipment: padded helmets called are always worn, as are padded torso protectors called ; feet, shins, groins, hands, and forearms protectors are also worn.

The school or place where instruction is given is called a ().

== Ranks, belts, and promotion ==
Taekwondo ranks vary from style to style and are not standardized. For junior ranks, ranks are indicated by a number and the term (, &quot;gup&quot;, or &quot;kup&quot;), which represents belt color. A belt color may have a stripe in it. Ranks typically count down from higher numbers to lower ones. For senior ranks (&quot;black belt&quot; ranks), each rank is called a  or &quot;degree&quot; and counts upwards.

Students must pass tests to advance ranks, and promotions happen at a progressive rate depending on the school.

Titles can also come with ranks. For example, in the International Taekwon-Do Federation, instructors holding 1st to 3rd are called (; &quot;assistant instructor&quot;), those holding 4th to 6th &quot;dan&quot; are called (; &quot;instructor&quot;), those holding 7th to 8th &quot;dan&quot; are called (; &quot;master&quot;), and those holding 9th &quot;dan&quot; are called (; &quot;grandmaster&quot;).

In WT/Kukki-Taekwondo, instructors holding 1st. to 3rd. &quot;dan&quot; are considered assistant instructors (), are not yet allowed to issue ranks, and are generally thought of as still having much to learn. Instructors who hold a 4th. to 6th. &quot;dan&quot; are considered master instructors (), and are allowed to grade students to ranks beneath their own. Those who hold a 7th–9th &quot;dan&quot; are considered Grandmasters. Kukkiwon-issued ranks also hold an age requirement, with grandmaster ranks requiring an age of over forty.

== Forms (patterns) ==
Three Korean terms may be used with reference to taekwondo forms or patterns. These forms are equivalent to &quot;kata&quot; in karate.
* &quot;Hyeong&quot; (sometimes &quot;hyung&quot;; ) is the term usually used in Traditional Taekwondo (i.e., 1950s–1960s styles of Korean martial arts).
* (sometimes or formerly &quot;poomse&quot;; ) is the term officially used by Kukkiwon/WT-style and ATA-style Taekwondo.
* &quot;Teul&quot; (officially romanized as &quot;tul&quot;; ) is the term usually used in ITF/Chang Hon-style Taekwondo.

A hyeong is a systematic, prearranged sequence of martial techniques that is performed either with or without the use of a weapon.

Different taekwondo styles and associations (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) use different taekwondo forms.

== Philosophy ==
Different styles of Taekwondo adopt different philosophical underpinnings. Many of these underpinnings however refer back to the Five Commandments of the Hwarang as a historical referent. For example, Choi Hong-hi expressed his philosophical basis for taekwondo as the Five Tenets of Taekwondo:
* Courtesy ()
* Integrity ()
* Perseverance ()
* Self-control ()
* Indomitable spirit ()

These tenets are further articulated in a taekwondo oath, also authored by Choi:
* I shall observe the tenets of taekwondo
* I shall respect the instructor and seniors
* I shall never misuse taekwondo
* I shall be a champion of freedom and justice
* I shall build a more peaceful world
Modern ITF organizations have continued to update and expand upon this philosophy.

The World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) also refers to the commandments of the Hwarang in the articulation of its taekwondo philosophy. Like the ITF philosophy, it centers on the development of a peaceful society as one of the overarching goals for the practice of taekwondo. The WT&#x27;s stated philosophy is that this goal can be furthered by adoption of the Hwarang spirit, by behaving rationally (&quot;education in accordance with the reason of heaven&quot;), and by recognition of the philosophies embodied in the (the yin and the yang, i.e., &quot;the unity of opposites&quot;) and the sam taegeuk (understanding change in the world as the interactions of the heavens, the Earth, and Man). The philosophical position articulated by the Kukkiwon is likewise based on the Hwarang tradition.

=== Theory of power ===
The emphasis on speed and agility is a defining characteristic of taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong-hi. The results of that analysis are known by ITF practitioners as Choi&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Power&quot;. Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed that the kinetic energy of a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.

Choi also advocated a &quot;relax/strike&quot; principle for taekwondo; in other words, between blocks, kicks, and strikes the practitioner should relax the body, then tense the muscles only while performing the technique. It is believed that the relax/strike principle increases the power of the technique, by conserving the body&#x27;s energy. He expanded on this principle with his advocacy of the &quot;sine wave&quot; technique. This involves raising one&#x27;s centre of gravity between techniques, then lowering it as the technique is performed, producing the up-and-down movement from which the term &quot;sine wave&quot; is derived.

The components of the Theory of Power include:

* Reaction Force: the principle that as the striking limb is brought forward, other parts of the body should be brought backwards in order to provide more power to the striking limb. As an example, if the right leg is brought forward in a roundhouse kick, the right arm is brought backwards to provide the reaction force.
* Concentration: the principle of bringing as many muscles as possible to bear on a strike, concentrating the area of impact into as small an area as possible.
* Equilibrium: maintaining a correct centre-of-balance throughout a technique.
* Breath Control: the idea that during a strike one should exhale, with the exhalation concluding at the moment of impact.
* Mass: the principle of bringing as much of the body to bear on a strike as possible; again using the turning kick as an example, the idea would be to rotate the hip as well as the leg during the kick in order to take advantage of the hip&#x27;s additional mass in terms of providing power to the kick.
* Speed: as previously noted, the speed of execution of a technique in taekwondo is deemed to be even more important than mass in terms of providing power.

== Competitions ==

Taekwondo competitions typically involve sparring, breaking, and patterns; some tournaments also include special events such as demonstration teams and self-defense (&quot;hosinsul&quot;). In Olympic taekwondo competitions, however, only sparring (using WT competition rules) is performed.

There are two kinds of competition sparring: point sparring, in which all strikes are light contact and the clock is stopped when a point is scored; and Olympic sparring, where all strikes are full contact and the clock continues when points are scored.

=== World Taekwondo ===

Under World Taekwondo (WT, formerly WTF) and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event, employing a continuous scoring system where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring each technique, taking place between two competitors in either an area measuring 8 meters square or an octagon of similar size. Competitors are matched within gender and weight division—eight divisions for World Championships that are condensed to four for the Olympics. A win can occur by points, or if one competitor is unable to continue (knockout). However, there are several decisions that can lead to a win, as well, including superiority, withdrawal, disqualification, or even a referee&#x27;s punitive declaration. Each match consists of three two-minute rounds, with one minute rest between rounds, though these are often abbreviated or shortened for some junior and regional tournaments. Competitors must wear a &quot;hogu&quot;, head protector, shin pads, foot socks, forearm guards, hand gloves, a mouthpiece, and a groin cup. Tournaments sanctioned by national governing bodies or the WT, including the Olympics and World Championship, use electronic &quot;hogus&quot;, electronic foot socks, and electronic head protectors to register and determine scoring techniques, with human judges used to assess and score technical (spinning) techniques and score punches.

Points are awarded for permitted techniques delivered to the legal scoring areas as determined by an electronic scoring system, which assesses the strength and location of the contact. The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle), punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist), and pushes. In some smaller tournaments, and in the past, points were awarded by three corner judges using electronic scoring tallies. All major national and international tournaments have moved fully (as of 2017) to electronic scoring, including the use of electronic headgear. This limits corner judges to scoring only technical points and punches. Some believe that the new electronic scoring system reduces controversy concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted. In particular, the move to electronic headgear has replaced controversy over judging with controversy over how the technology has changed the sport. Because the headgear is not able to determine if a kick was a correct taekwondo technique, and the pressure threshold for sensor activation for headgear is kept low for safety reasons, athletes who improvised ways of placing their foot on their opponents head were able to score points, regardless of how true to taekwondo those techniques were.

Techniques are divided into three categories: scoring techniques (such as a kick to the &quot;hogu&quot;), permitted but non-scoring techniques (such as a kick that strikes an arm), and not-permitted techniques (such as a kick below the waist).

* A punch that makes strong contact with the opponent&#x27;s &quot;hogu&quot; scores 1 point. The punch must be a straight punch with arm extended; jabs, hooks, uppercuts, etc. are permitted but do not score. Punches to the head are not allowed. 
* A regular kick (no turning or spinning) to the &quot;hogu&quot; scores 2 points. 
* A regular kick (no turning or spinning) to the head scores 3 points
* A technical kick (a kick that involves turning or spinning) to the &quot;hogu&quot; scores 4 points.
* A technical kick to the head scores 5 points. 
** As of October 2010, 4 points were awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack. As of June 2018, this was changed to 5 points.

The referee can give penalties at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, usually the legs or neck. Penalties, called &quot;Gam-jeom&quot; are counted as an addition of one point for the opposing contestant. Following 10 &quot;Gam-jeom&quot; a player is declared the loser by referee&#x27;s punitive declaration

At the end of three rounds, the competitor with most points wins the match. In the event of a tie, a fourth &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime round, sometimes called a &quot;Golden Point&quot;, is held to determine the winner after a one-minute rest period. In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match. If there is no score in the additional round, the winner is decided by superiority, as determined by the refereeing officials or number of fouls committed during that round. If a competitor has a 20-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 20-point lead at any point in the third round, then the match is over and that competitor is declared the winner.

In addition to sparring competition, World Taekwondo sanctions competition in &quot;poomsae&quot; or forms, although this is not an Olympic event. Single competitors perform a designated pattern of movements, and are assessed by judges for accuracy (accuracy of movements, balance, precision of details) and presentation (speed and power, rhythm, energy), both of which receive numerical scores, with deductions made for errors. Pair and team competition is also recognized, where two or more competitors perform the same form at the same time. In addition to competition with the traditional forms, there is experimentation with freestyle forms that allow more creativity.

=== International Taekwon-Do Federation ===
The International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) has sparring rules similar to the WT&#x27;s, but they differ in some ways:
* Hand attacks to the head are allowed.
* The competition is not full contact, and excessive contact is not allowed.
* Competitors are penalized with disqualification if they injure their opponent and he can no longer continue (knockout).
* The scoring system is:
** 1 point for Punch to the body or head.
** 2 points for Jumping kick to the body or kick to the head, or a jumping punch to the head
** 3 points for Jumping kick to the head
* The competition area is 9×9 meters for international events.

Competitors do not wear the &quot;hogu&quot; (although they are required to wear approved foot and hand protection equipment, as well as optional head guards). This scoring system varies between individual organisations within the ITF; for example, in the TAGB, punches to the head or body score 1 point, kicks to the body score 2 points, and kicks to the head score 3 points.

A continuous point system is utilized in ITF competition, where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring a technique. Excessive contact is generally not allowed according to the official ruleset, and judges penalize any competitor with disqualification if they injure their opponent and he can no longer continue (although these rules vary between ITF organizations). At the end of two minutes (or some other specified time), the competitor with more scoring techniques wins.

Fouls in ITF sparring include: attacking a fallen opponent, leg sweeping, holding/grabbing, or intentional attack to a target other than the opponent.

ITF competitions also feature performances of patterns, breaking, and &#x27;special techniques&#x27; (where competitors perform prescribed board breaks at great heights).

=== Multi-discipline competition ===
Some organizations deliver multi-discipline competitions, for example the British Student Taekwondo Federation&#x27;s inter-university competitions, which have included separate WT rules sparring, ITF rules sparring, Kukkiwon patterns and Chang-Hon patterns events run in parallel since 1992.

=== Other organizations ===
American Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competitions are very similar, except that different styles of pads and gear are allowed.

== List of competitions ==

=== World Taekwondo competitions ===
World Taekwondo (WT) directly sanctions the following competitions:
* World Taekwondo Poomsae Championships

=== Weight divisions ===
The following weight divisions are in effect due to the WT and ITF tournament rules and regulations:




== Taekwondo Korean terms ==
In taekwondo schools—even outside Korea—Korean language commands and vocabulary are often used. Korean numerals may be used as prompts for commands or for counting repetition exercises. Different schools and associations will use different vocabulary, however, and may even refer to entirely different techniques by the same name. As one example, in Kukkiwon/WT-style Taekwondo, the term &quot;ap seogi&quot; refers to an upright walking stance, while in ITF/Chang Hon-style Taekwondo &quot;ap seogi&quot; refers to a long, low, front stance. Korean vocabulary commonly used in taekwondo schools includes:

<text>A targum (, &quot;interpretation&quot;, &quot;translation&quot;, &quot;version&quot;; plural: targumim) was an originally spoken translation of the Hebrew Bible (also called the ) that a professional translator ( &quot;mǝṯurgǝmān&quot;) would give in the common language of the listeners when that was not Biblical Hebrew. This had become necessary near the end of the first century BCE, as the common language was Aramaic and Hebrew was used for little more than schooling and worship. The translator frequently expanded his translation with paraphrases, explanations and examples, so it became a kind of sermon.

Writing down the targum was initially prohibited; nevertheless, some targumitic writings appeared as early as the middle of the first century. They were not recognized as authoritative by the religious leaders. Some subsequent Jewish traditions, beginning with the Jews of Lower Mesopotamia, accepted the written targumim as authoritative translations of the Hebrew scriptures into Aramaic. Today, the common meaning of &quot;targum&quot; is a written Aramaic translation of the Bible. Only Yemenite Jews continue to use the targumim liturgically.

As translations, the targumim largely reflect midrashic interpretation of the Tanakh from the time they were written and are notable for favoring allegorical readings over anthropomorphisms. Maimonides, for one, notes this often in &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. That is true both for those targums that are fairly literal as well as for those that contain many midrashic expansions. In 1541, Elia Levita wrote and published the &quot;Sefer Meturgeman,&quot; explaining all the Aramaic words found in the Targums Onqelos, Jonathan, and pseudo-Jonathan.

Targumim are used today as sources in text-critical editions of the Bible (&quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot; refers to them with the abbreviation [[Fraktur|𝔗]]).

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;Targum&quot; is derived from the early semitic quadriliteral root (), and the Akkadian term &quot;targummanu&quot; refers to &quot;translator, interpreter&quot;. It occurs in Ezra 4:7 &quot;a letter written in Aramaic and translated.&quot; Besides denoting the translations of the Bible, &quot;targum&quot; also denoted the oral rendering of Bible lections in synagogue, while the translator of the Bible was simply called &quot;hammeturgem&quot; (he who translates). Other than the meaning &quot;translate&quot;, the verb &quot;tirgem&quot; also means &quot;to explain&quot;. Targum refers to &quot;translation&quot; and argumentation or &quot;explanation&quot;.

==Two major targumim==
The two most important targumim for liturgical purposes are:
* Targum Onkelos on the Torah
* Targum Jonathan on the Nevi&#x27;im
These two targumim are mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as &quot;targum dilan&quot; (&quot;our Targum&quot;), giving them official status. In the synagogues of Talmudic times, Targum Onkelos was read alternately with the Torah, verse by verse, and Targum Jonathan was read alternately with the selection from Nevi&#x27;im (i.e., the haftara), though in the case of Nevi&#x27;im it was permitted to translate in units of up to three verses. This custom continues today in Yemenite Jewish synagogues.

Besides its public function in the synagogue, the Babylonian Talmud also mentions targum in the context of a personal study requirement: &quot;A person should always review his portions of scripture along with the community, reading the scripture twice and the targum once&quot; (Berakhot 8a–b). This, too, refers to Targum Onkelos on the public Torah reading and to Targum Jonathan on the haftarot from Nevi&#x27;im.

Medieval biblical manuscripts of the Masoretic Text sometimes contain the Hebrew text interpolated, verse-by-verse, with the &quot;targumim&quot;. This scribal practice is rooted in the public reading of the Targum and the requirement for private study.In these manuscripts, and in rabbinic Bibles up to and including the second printed Venice edition, Targumim were written or printed with cantillation marks.

The two &quot;official&quot; targumim are considered eastern (Mesopotamian, called &quot;Babylonian&quot;). Nevertheless, scholars believe they, too, originated in Syria Palestina because of a strong linguistic substratum of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Though these targumim were later &quot;orientalised&quot;, the substratum belying their origins remains.

When most Jewish communities ceased speaking Aramaic in the 10th century, the public reading of Targum, along with the Torah and Haftarah, was abandoned in most communities, Yemen being a well-known exception.

The private study requirement to review the Targum was never entirely relaxed, even when Jewish communities had largely ceased speaking Aramaic, and the Targum never ceased to be a major source for Jewish exegesis. For instance, it serves as a major source in Shlomo Yitzhaki&#x27;s Torah commentary, &quot;Rashi,&quot; and has always been the standard fare for Ashkenazi Jews onward.

For these reasons, Jewish editions of the Tanakh which include commentaries still almost always print the Targum alongside the text, in all Jewish communities. Nevertheless, later halakhic authorities argued that the requirement to privately review the &quot;targum&quot; might also be met by reading a translation in the current vernacular in place of the official Targum, or else by studying an important commentary containing midrashic interpretation (especially that of Rashi).

==Targum Ketuvim==
The Talmud explicitly states that no official &quot;targumim&quot; were composed besides these two on Torah and Nevi&#x27;im alone, and that there is no official &quot;targum&quot; to Ketuvim (&quot;The Writings&quot;). The Talmud stories state:
Nevertheless, most books of Ketuvim (with the exceptions of Daniel and Ezra-Nehemiah, which both contain Aramaic portions) have &quot;targumim&quot;, whose origin is mostly Palestinian rather than Mesopotamian. But they were poorly preserved and less well known for lack of a fixed place in the liturgy. From Palestine, the tradition of targum to Ketuvim made its way to Italy, and from there to medieval Ashkenaz and Sepharad. The targumim of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job are generally treated as a unit, as are the targumim of the five scrolls (Esther has a longer &quot;Second Targum&quot; as well.) The targum of Chronicles is quite late, possibly medieval. It is traditionally attributed to &quot;Rav Yosef&quot; (meaning either Rav Yosef or Rav Yosef bar Hama). (The targum to Neviim is also sometimes referred to as the targum of Rav Yosef.)

==Other Targumim on the Torah==
There are also a variety of western &quot;targumim&quot; on the Torah, each of which was traditionally called &quot;Targum Yerushalmi&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem Targum&quot;), and written in Western Aramaic. An important one of these was mistakenly labeled &quot;Targum Jonathan&quot; in later printed versions (though all medieval authorities refer to it by its correct name). The error crept in because of an abbreviation: the printer interpreted the abbreviation &quot;TY&quot; (ת&quot;י) to stand for &quot;Targum Yonathan&quot; (תרגום יונתן) instead of the correct &quot;Targum Yerushalmi&quot; (תרגום ירושלמי). Scholars refer to this &quot;targum&quot; as Targum Pseudo-Jonathan. To attribute this targum to Jonathan ben Uzziel flatly contradicts the Talmudic tradition (Megillah 3a), which quite clearly attributes the targum to Nevi&#x27;im alone to him, while stating that there is no official targum to the Ketuvim. In the same printed versions, a similar fragment targum is correctly labeled as &quot;Targum Yerushalmi&quot;.

The Western Targumim on the Torah, or Palestinian Targumim as they are also called, consist of three manuscript groups: Targum Neofiti I, Fragment Targums, and Cairo Geniza Fragment Targums.

Of these Targum Neofiti I is the largest. It consist of 450 folios covering all books of the Pentateuch, with only a few damaged verses. The history of the manuscript begins 1587 when the censor Andrea de Monte (d. 1587) bequeathed it to Ugo Boncompagni—which presents an oddity, since Boncompagni, better known as Pope Gregory XIII, died in 1585. The transmission route may instead be by a certain &quot;Giovan Paolo Eustachio romano neophito.&quot; Before this de Monte had censored it by deleting most references to idolatry. In 1602 Boncompagni&#x27;s estate gave it to the College of the Neophytes, a college for converts from Judaism and Islam, until 1886, when the Holy See bought it along with other manuscripts when the Collegium closed (which is the reason for the manuscripts name and its designation). It was then mistitled as a manuscript of Targum Onkelos until 1949, when Alejandro Díez Macho noticed that it differed significantly from Targum Onkelos. It was translated and published during 1968–79, and has since been considered the most important of the Palestinian Targumim, as it is by far the most complete and, apparently, the earliest as well.

The Fragment Targums (formerly known as Targum Yerushalmi II) consist of fragments divided into ten manuscripts. Of these P, V and L were first published in 1899 by M Ginsburger, A, B, C, D, F and G in 1930 by P Kahle and E in 1955 by A Díez Macho. These manuscripts are all too fragmented to confirm what their purpose was, but they seem to be either the remains of a single complete targum or short variant readings of another targum. As a group, they often share theological views and with Targum Neofiti, which has led to the belief that they could be variant readings of that targum.

The Cairo Geniza Fragment Targums originate from the Ben Ezra Synagogue&#x27;s genizah in Cairo. They share similarities with the Fragment Targums in that they consist of many fragmented manuscripts that have been collected in one targum-group. The manuscripts A and E are the oldest among the Palestinian Targum and have been dated to around the seventh century. Manuscripts C, E, H and Z contain only passages from Genesis, A from Exodus while MS B contain verses from both as well as from Deuteronomium.

The Samaritan community has their own Targum to their text of the Torah. Other Targumim were also discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

==Peshitta==
The Peshitta is the traditional Bible of Syriac Christians, who speak several different dialects of Aramaic. The translation of the Peshitta is thought to be before the year 300.

<text>The Tosefta ( &quot;supplement, addition&quot;) is a compilation of Jewish Oral Law from the late second century, the period of the Mishnah and the Jewish sages known as the Tannaim.

== Background ==
Jewish teachings of the Tannaitic period were characteristically transmitted orally, and consisted of short sayings presented with or without attribution, which were memorized through repetition (&quot;Shanah&quot; in Hebrew) and recited in halls of study. These teachings were primarily concerned with laws and customs (Halacha), though they also included non-legal traditions (Aggada), as well as supplementary material (Tosefta) which was appended later to traditions which warranted clarification or addition of legal material. The Halacha, Aggada, and Tosefta collectively served as the foundation of the Oral Torah and the primary focus of study for the sages during the first two centuries CE. The oral traditions were no doubt transmitted as different collections by different scholars, though the Babylonian Talmud refers to a fixed work known as Tosefta, which was an integral part of a scholar&#x27;s education. Geonic sources attest to the existence of a single work named Tosefta which is identical to the Tosefta known today.

==Overview==
In many ways, the Tosefta acts as a supplement (&quot;Toseftā&quot;) to the Mishnah. Being nearly three times as long, it often complements the Mishna and expands upon it, and it served as the primary commentary on it for the Amoraim, creators of the Talmuds. The Mishnah () is the basic compilation of the Oral law of Judaism; according to the tradition, it was compiled in 189 CE. The Tosefta closely corresponds to the Mishnah, with the same divisions for &quot;sedarim&quot; (&quot;orders&quot;) and &quot;masekhtot&quot; (&quot;tractates&quot;), though there are three tractates in the Mishnah with no corresponding tractates in the Tosefta, those of Tamid, Middot and Kinnim, all at the end of the order of &#x27;Kodashim&#x27;. The tractate &#x27;Avot&#x27; from the order of &#x27;Nezikin&#x27; is also absent from the Tosefta, though &#x27;Avot de-Rabbi Natan&#x27; may be considered as filling its place. The number of chapters in each tractate does not necessarily correspond to that of the Mishnah, and the number of Halachot in a given chapter of the Tosefta is at times double that of the correspoding chapter in the Mishnah. Though the order of Halachot in the Tosefta largely paralells that of the Mishnah, it digresses so often that the reason for the digressions has drawn scholarly attention. Many scholars have suggested that the order in the Tosefta follows an earlier version of the Mishna. However, this is most likely inaccurate, as a close literary analysis will show that both texts follow the same order, and the digressions of the Tosefta are premeditated and pedagogical by nature. The Tosefta is mainly written in Mishnaic Hebrew, with some Aramaic.

At times, the text of the Tosefta agrees nearly verbatim with the Mishnah, in others, there are significant differences. The Tosefta often attributes laws that are anonymous in the Mishnah to named Tannaim, or attributes otherwise acreditted laws differently. At times it also contradicts the Mishnah in the ruling of Jewish law. 

The Tosefta often augments the Mishnah with additional glosses and discussions. It offers additional aggadic and midrashic material, though this is only because it is a larger corpus than the Mishnah and the proportion of this material is identical to both. In some ways the Tosefta continues the Mishnah, as it preserves the opinions and teachings of the later generations of Tanaim, namely that of Rabbi Judah HaNasi and the following generation, which were largely not recorded in the Mishna.

==Origins==
The question of dating the Tosefta is discussed extensively among scholars. The mention of sages from the generation after Rabbi Judah HaNasi implies that it would necessarily have been redacted after the Mishna. However, this fact cannot be taken as an indication of the date of the individual traditions included in it, each of which requires its own discussion. Suggestions for dating individual traditions in the Tosefta may be presented through a comparative study of all parallel Tannaitic sources. Another question revolves around the relationship between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, which often quote Tannanitic traditions, known as &quot;Baraitot&quot; (external traditions). These traditions are often similar in content and form to parallel traditions in the Mishna and Tosefta, and are at times identical to them. Baraitot are commonly mentioned within Talmudic discussions of Mishnaic passages, and collections of them are attributed to various Amoraic sages, thus their study would impact conclusions regarding the Tosefta as well.

=== Authorship ===
There is no explicit mention of an author of the Tosefta within the Tosefta itself. Various collections of Tannaitic traditions have been attributed to different sages, including Rabbi Hiyya, Rabbi Hoshaya, and Bar Kappara, all contemporaries of Rabbi Judah HaNasi, and it is possible that these collections played a role in the Tosefta&#x27;s compilation. A notable tradition in the Talmud, attributed to Rabbi Yochanan, stated that Rabbi Nehemia, a younger contemporary of Rabbi Akiva, was the author of the anonymous traditions in the Tosefta. According to another passage in the Talmud, the Tosefta was redacted by Ḥiya bar Abba and one of his students, Hoshaiah. The ambiguity in the Talmud ultimately led to disagreement between the Gaonim and Rishonim on the issue of authorship. The Majority, including Rabbi Nissim Ben Yaakov, Rabbi Sherira Gaon, the Maimonides, and Rashi, conclude that Rabbi Hiyya was the author, Menachem HaMeiri suggests Bar Kappara, and a letter from the Cairo Geniza mentions Rabbi Hoshaya as such. 

Whereas the Mishna was considered authoritative, the Tosefta was supplementary. The Talmud often utilizes the traditions found in the Tosefta to examine the text of the Mishnah. 

The traditional view is that the Tosefta should be dated to a period concurrent with or shortly after the redaction of the Mishnah. This view presupposes that the Tosefta was produced to record variant material not included in the Mishnah.

Modern scholarship can be roughly divided into two camps. Some, such as Jacob N. Epstein, theorize that the Tosefta as we have it developed from a proto-Tosefta recension that formed much of the basis for later Amoraic debate. Others, such as Hanokh Albeck, theorize that the Tosefta is a later compendium of several baraitot collections that were in use during the Amoraic period.

More recent scholarship, such as that of Yaakov Elman, concludes that since the Tosefta, as we know it, must be dated linguistically as an example of Middle Hebrew 1, it was most likely compiled in early Amoraic times from oral transmission of baraitot. Shamma Friedman has found that the Tosefta draws on relatively early Tannaitic source material and that parts of the Tosefta predate the Mishnah.

==Authority==
Sherira ben Hanina (987 CE), in his epistle written to the heads of the Jewish community in Kairouan (now in Tunisia), discusses the authority of the Tosefta in relation to the Mishnah. There, he writes:
Sherira then brings down the reverse of this example: &quot;Or, let us suppose that Rebbe [Yehuda Ha-Nassi] in the Mishnah records a dispute between R. Meir and R. Yosi. However, R. Ḥiya prefers R. Meir&#x27;s argument and records it in a Baraita without mentioning R. Yosi&#x27;s opposing view. In such a case, we do not accept [R. Ḥiya&#x27;s] decision.&quot;

== Character ==
At times the commentary character of the Tosefta is explicit, as it will address the reasons for various statements of the Mishna in the form of questions and answers. In other instances the Tosefta will provide a commentary which is interwoven with the words of the Mishna, or attached to the end of a Mishnaic passage as an appendix. Occasionally the Tosefta will quote a Mishna from a different chapter or tractate in order to illuminate the Mishna under discussion. When the Mishna discusses a prohibition in any given topic, the Tosefta will often supplement it with what may be permitted, and conversely when a permitted action is discussed, the Tosefta may supplement it with the prohibitions related to it. In certain cases the Mishna will provide the Halachic decree regarding the result of a certain sequence of actions, and the Tosefta will give the decree regarding the result of an opposite sequence. The Tosefta may also provide opinions differing from those mentioned in the Mishna, as well as reasoning, background and scriptural proofs for Mishnaic decrees. Finally, the Tosefta may use the Mishna as a point of departure for topics almost entirely absent from the Mishna.

The main two layers in the Tosefta consist of the teachings of the students of Rabbi Akiva and those of the following generation, the latter being a layer largely not documented in the Mishna. Accordingly, certain topics discussed generally in the Mishna will be expanded and will receive a detailed elaboration, and previously undiscussed cases will be covered. 

==Manuscripts, editions commentaries, and translations==

===Manuscripts===
Three manuscripts exist of the Tosefta:
* &#x27;Vienna&#x27; (late 13th century; Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek Cod hebr. 20; the only complete manuscript)
* &#x27;Erfurt&#x27; (12th century; Berlin – Staatsbibliothek (Preußischer Kulturbesitz) Or. fol. 1220)
* &#x27;London&#x27; (15th century; London – British Library Add. 27296; contains Seder Mo&#x27;ed only)

The &quot;Editio Princeps&quot; was printed in Venice in 1521 as an addendum to Isaac Alfasi&#x27;s &quot;Halakhot&quot;.

All four of these sources, together with many Cairo Geniza fragments, have been published online by Bar Ilan University in the form of a searchable database.

===Editions===
Two critical editions have been published. The first was that of Moses Samuel Zuckermandl in 1882, which relied heavily on the Erfurt manuscript of the Tosefta. Zuckermandl&#x27;s work has been characterized as &quot;a great step forward&quot; for its time. This edition was reprinted in 1970 by Rabbi Saul Lieberman, with additional notes and corrections.

In 1955, Saul Lieberman first began publishing his monumental &quot;Tosefta ki-Feshutah&quot;. Between 1955 and 1973, ten volumes of the new edition were published, representing the text and the commentaries on the entire orders of Zera&#x27;im, Mo&#x27;ed and Nashim. In 1988, three volumes were published posthumously on the order of Nezikin, including tractates Bava Kama, Bava Metzia, and Bava Batra. Lieberman&#x27;s work has been called the &quot;pinnacle of modern Tosefta studies.&quot;

===Commentaries===
Major commentaries on the Tosefta include those by:
* David Pardo: &quot;Chasdei David&quot;; Originally published in Livorno (1776), and printed in editions of the Vilna Shas.
* Yehezkel Abramsky: &quot;Hazon Yehezkel&quot; (24 volumes, 1925–1975 in Hebrew).
* Saul Lieberman: &quot;Tosefet Rishonim&quot;, Jerusalem 1937.
* Jacob Neusner and his pupils (in a series called &quot;A History of the Mishnaic Law&quot;, 1978–87).

===Translations===
The Tosefta has been translated into English by Jacob Neusner and his students in the commentary cited above and was also published separately as &quot;The Tosefta: translated from the Hebrew&quot; (6 vols, 1977–86).

Translations of the tosefta are in various stages of progress at www.sefaria.org. Other attempts such as by Eli Gurevich&#x27;s English translation are also being made. .

<doc id="30384" wikidata="Q915809" url="?curid=30384" title="The Evolution of Cooperation">
<text>The Evolution of Cooperation is a 1984 book written by political scientist Robert Axelrod that expands upon a paper of the same name written by Axelrod and evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton. The article&#x27;s summary addresses the issue in terms of &quot;cooperation in organisms, whether bacteria or primates&quot;.

The book details a theory on the emergence of cooperation between individuals, drawing from game theory and evolutionary biology. Since 2006, reprints of the book have included a foreword by Richard Dawkins and have been marketed as a revised edition.

The book provides an investigation into how cooperation can emerge and persist as explained by the application of game theory. The book provides a detailed explanation of the evolution of cooperation, beyond traditional game theory. Academic literature regarding forms of cooperation that are not easily explained in traditional game theory, especially when considering evolutionary biology, largely took its modern form as a result of Axelrod&#x27;s and Hamilton&#x27;s influential 1981 paper and the subsequent book.

== Background: Axelrod&#x27;s tournaments ==

Axelrod initially solicited strategies from other game theorists to compete in the first tournament. Each strategy was paired with each other strategy for 200 iterations of a Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma game and scored on the total points accumulated through the tournament. The winner was a very simple strategy submitted by Anatol Rapoport called &quot;tit for tat&quot; (TFT) that cooperates on the first move, and subsequently echoes (reciprocates) what the other player did on the previous move. The results of the first tournament were analyzed and published, and a second tournament was held to see if anyone could find a better strategy. TFT won again. Axelrod analyzed the results and made some interesting discoveries about the nature of cooperation, which he describes in his book.

In both actual tournaments and various replays, the best-performing strategies were nice: that is, they were never the first to defect. Many of the competitors went to great lengths to gain an advantage over the &quot;nice&quot; (and usually simpler) strategies, but to no avail: tricky strategies fighting for a few points generally could not do as well as nice strategies working together. TFT (and other &quot;nice&quot; strategies generally) &quot;won, not by doing better than the other player, but by eliciting cooperation [and] by promoting the mutual interest rather than by exploiting the other&#x27;s weakness.&quot;

Being &quot;nice&quot; can be beneficial, but it can also lead to being suckered. To obtain the benefit – or avoid exploitation – it is necessary to be provocable and forgiving. When the other player defects, a nice strategy must immediately be provoked into retaliatory defection. The same goes for forgiveness: return to cooperation as soon as the other player does. Overdoing the punishment risks escalation, and can lead to an &quot;unending echo of alternating defections&quot; that depresses the scores of both players.

Most of the games that game theory had heretofore investigated are &quot;zero-sum&quot; – that is, the total rewards are fixed, and a player does well only at the expense of other players. But real life is not zero-sum. Our best prospects are usually in cooperative efforts. In fact, TFT &quot;cannot&quot; score higher than its partner; at best it can only do &quot;as good as&quot;. Yet it won the tournaments by consistently scoring a strong second-place with a variety of partners. Axelrod summarizes this as &quot;don&#x27;t be envious&quot;; in other words, don&#x27;t strive for a payoff &quot;greater&quot; than the other player&#x27;s.

In any IPD game, there is a certain maximum score each player can get by always cooperating. But some strategies try to find ways of getting a little more with an occasional defection (exploitation). This can work against some strategies that are less provocable or more forgiving than TFT, but generally, they do poorly. &quot;A common problem with these rules is that they used complex methods of making inferences about the other player [strategy] – and these inferences were wrong.&quot; Against TFT one can do no better than to simply cooperate. Axelrod calls this &quot;clarity&quot;. Or: &quot;don&#x27;t be too clever&quot;.

The success of any strategy depends on the nature of the particular strategies it encounters, which depends on the composition of the overall population. To better model the effects of reproductive success Axelrod also did an &quot;ecological&quot; tournament, where the prevalence of each type of strategy in each round was determined by that strategy&#x27;s success in the previous round. The competition in each round becomes stronger as weaker performers are reduced and eliminated. The results were amazing: a handful of strategies – all &quot;nice&quot; – came to dominate the field. In a sea of non-nice strategies the &quot;nice&quot; strategies – provided they were also provocable – did well enough with each other to offset the occasional exploitation. As cooperation became general the non-provocable strategies were exploited and eventually eliminated, whereupon the exploitive (non-cooperating) strategies were out-performed by the cooperative strategies.

In summary, success in an evolutionary &quot;game&quot; correlated with the following characteristics:

* Be nice: cooperate, never be the first to defect.
* Be provocable: return defection for defection, cooperation for cooperation.
* Don&#x27;t be envious: focus on maximizing your own &#x27;score&#x27;, as opposed to ensuring your score is higher than your &#x27;partner&#x27;s&#x27;.
* Don&#x27;t be too clever: or, don&#x27;t try to be tricky. Clarity is essential for others to cooperate with you.

== Foundation of reciprocal cooperation ==

The lessons described above apply in environments that support cooperation, but whether cooperation is supported at all, depends crucially on the probability (called ω [omega]) that the players will meet again, also called the discount parameter or, figuratively, the shadow of the future. When ω is low – that is, the players have a negligible chance of meeting again – each interaction is effectively a single-shot Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma game, and one might as well defect in all cases (a strategy called &quot;ALL D&quot;), because even if one cooperates there is no way to keep the other player from exploiting that. But in the iterated PD the value of repeated cooperative interactions can become greater than the benefit/risk of single exploitation (which is all that a strategy like TFT will tolerate).

Curiously, rationality and deliberate choice are not necessary, nor trust nor even consciousness, as long as there is a pattern that benefits both players (e.g., increases fitness), and some probability of future interaction. Often the initial mutual cooperation is not even intentional, but having &quot;discovered&quot; a beneficial pattern both parties respond to it by continuing the conditions that maintain it.

This implies two requirements for the players, aside from whatever strategy they may adopt. First, they must be able to recognize other players, to avoid exploitation by cheaters. Second, they must be able to track their previous history with any given player, in order to be responsive to that player&#x27;s strategy.

Even when the discount parameter ω is high enough to permit reciprocal cooperation there is still a question of whether and how cooperation might start. One of Axelrod&#x27;s findings is that when the existing population never offers cooperation nor reciprocates it – the case of ALL D – then no nice strategy can get established by isolated individuals; cooperation is strictly a sucker bet. (The &quot;futility of isolated revolt&quot;.) But another finding of great significance is that clusters of nice strategies can get established. Even a small group of individuals with nice strategies with infrequent interactions can yet do so well on those interactions to make up for the low level of exploitation from non-nice strategies.

Cooperation becomes more complicated, however, as soon as more realistic models are assumed 
that for instance offer more than two choices of action, 
provide the possibility of gradual cooperation, 
make actions constrain future actions (path dependence),
or in which 
interpret the associate&#x27;s actions are is non-trivial (e.g. recognizing the degree 
of cooperation shown)

== Subsequent work ==

In 1984 Axelrod estimated that there were &quot;hundreds of articles on the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma cited in &quot;Psychological Abstracts&quot;&quot;, and estimated that citations to &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot; alone were &quot;growing at the rate of over 300 per year&quot;.
To fully review this literature is infeasible. What follows are therefore only a few selected highlights.

Axelrod considers his subsequent book, &quot;The Complexity of Cooperation&quot;,
to be a sequel to &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;. Other work on the evolution of cooperation has expanded to cover prosocial behavior generally,
and in religion,

other mechanisms for generating cooperation,
the IPD under different conditions and assumptions,
and the use of other games such as the Public Goods and Ultimatum games to explore deep-seated notions of fairness and fair play.
It has also been used to challenge the rational and self-regarding &quot;economic man&quot; model of economics,
and as a basis for replacing Darwinian sexual selection theory with a theory of social selection.

Nice strategies are better able to invade if they have social structures or other means of increasing their interactions. Axelrod discusses this in chapter 8; in a later paper he and Rick Riolo and Michael Cohen
use computer simulations to show cooperation rising among agents who have negligible chance of future encounters but can recognize similarity of an arbitrary characteristic (such as a green beard); whereas other studies have shown that the only Iterated Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma strategies that resist invasion in a well-mixed evolving population are generous strategies.

When an IPD tournament introduces noise (errors or misunderstandings), TFT strategies can get trapped into a long string of retaliatory defections, thereby depressing their score. TFT also tolerates &quot;ALL C&quot; (always cooperate) strategies, which then give an opening to exploiters.
In 1992 Martin Nowak and Karl Sigmund demonstrated a strategy called Pavlov (or &quot;win–stay, lose–shift&quot;) that does better in these circumstances.
Pavlov looks at its own prior move as well as the other player&#x27;s move. If the payoff was R or P (see &quot;Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, above) it cooperates; if S or T it defects.

In a 2006 paper Nowak listed five mechanisms by which natural selection can lead to cooperation.
In addition to kin selection and direct reciprocity, he shows that:

* Indirect reciprocity is based on knowing the other player&#x27;s reputation, which is the player&#x27;s history with other players. Cooperation depends on a reliable history being projected from past partners to future partners.
* Network reciprocity relies on geographical or social factors to increase the interactions with nearer neighbors; it is essentially a virtual group.
* Group selection assumes that groups with cooperators (even altruists) will be more successful as a whole, and this will tend to benefit all members.

The payoffs in the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma game are fixed, but in real life defectors are often punished by cooperators. Where punishment is costly there is a second-order dilemma amongst cooperators between those who pay the cost of enforcement and those who do not.
Other work has shown that while individuals given a choice between joining a group that punishes free-riders and one that does not initially prefer the sanction-free group, yet after several rounds they will join the sanctioning group, seeing that sanctions secure a better payoff.

In small populations or groups there is the possibility that indirect reciprocity (reputation) can interact with direct reciprocity (e.g. tit for tat) with neither strategy dominating the other. The interactions between these strategies can give rise to dynamic social networks which exhibit some of the properties observed in empirical networks If network structure and choices in the Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma co-evolve, then cooperation can survive. In the resulting networks cooperators will be more centrally located than defectors who will tend to be in the periphery of the network.

In &quot;The Coevolution of Parochial Altruism and War&quot; by Jung-Kyoo Choi and Samuel Bowles. From their summary:

Altruism—benefiting fellow group members at a cost to oneself —and parochialism—hostility towards individuals not of one&#x27;s own ethnic, racial, or other group—are common human behaviors. The intersection of the two—which we term &quot;parochial altruism&quot;—is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one&#x27;s payoffs by comparison to what one would gain from eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts... [Neither] would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict they could have evolved jointly.
Consideration of the mechanisms through which learning from the social environment occurs is pivotal in studies of evolution. In the context of this discussion, learning rules, specifically conformism and payoff-dependent imitation, are not arbitrarily predetermined but are biologically selected. Behavioral strategies, which include cooperation, defection, and cooperation coupled with punishment, are chosen in alignment with the agent&#x27;s prevailing learning rule. Simulations of the model under conditions approximating those experienced by early hominids reveal that conformism can evolve even when individuals are solely faced with a cooperative dilemma, contrary to previous assertions. Moreover, the incorporation of conformists significantly amplifies the group size within which cooperation can be sustained. These model results demonstrate robustness, maintaining validity even under conditions of high migration rates and infrequent intergroup conflicts.

Neither Choi &amp; Bowles nor Guzmán, Rodriguez-Sicket and Rowthorn claim that humans have actually evolved in this way, but that computer simulations show how war could be promoted by the interaction of these behaviors. A crucial open research question, thus, is how realistic the assumptions are on which these simulation models are based.

== Software ==

Several software packages have been created to run prisoner&#x27;s dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.

* The source code for the second tournament run by Robert Axelrod (written by Axelrod and many contributors in Fortran) is available online.

<text>The Machinery of Freedom is a nonfiction book by David D. Friedman that advocates an anarcho-capitalist society from a consequentialist perspective.

The book was published in 1973, with a second edition in 1989 and a third edition in 2014.

== Overview ==

The book aims to show that law and its enforcement do not require a state, but can be sustained by non-coercive private enterprise and charity. It explores the consequences of libertarian thought, describes examples of stateless societies (such as the Icelandic Commonwealth) and offers the author&#x27;s personal statement about why he became a libertarian. Topics addressed in the book include polycentric law and the provision of public goods such as military defense in a stateless society. Friedman argues that a stateless legal system would be beneficial for society as a whole, including the poor.

While some books supporting similar libertarian and anarcho-capitalist views offer support in terms of morality or natural rights, Friedman (although he explicitly denies being a utilitarian) here argues largely in terms of the effects of his proposed policies.

Friedman conjectures that anything done by government costs at least twice as much as a privately provided equivalent, which has been labeled as his eponymous law: &quot;It costs any government at least twice as much to do something as it costs anyone else.&quot; He offers examples as evidence such as a comparison of the cost of the United States Postal Service&#x27;s costs for package delivery with the costs of private carriers and the cost of the Soviet government versus market based services in the West.

== Reception ==

The Institute of Public Affairs, a libertarian think tank located in Australia, included &quot;The Machinery of Freedom&quot; in a list of the &quot;Top 20 books you must read before you die&quot; in 2006.

&quot;Liberty&quot; magazine named the book among &quot;The Top Ten Best Libertarian Books&quot;, praising Friedman for tackling the problems related to private national defense systems and attempting to solve them.

<doc id="30387" wikidata="Q294773" url="?curid=30387" title="Tom Stoppard">
<text>Sir Tom Stoppard (born , 3 July 1937) is a Czech-born British playwright and screenwriter. He has written for film, radio, stage, and television, finding prominence with plays. His work covers the themes of human rights, censorship, and political freedom, often delving into the deeper philosophical bases of society. Stoppard has been a playwright of the National Theatre and is one of the most internationally performed dramatists of his generation. He was knighted for his contribution to theatre by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997.

Born in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard left as a child refugee, fleeing imminent Nazi occupation. He settled with his family in Britain after the war, in 1946, having spent the previous three years (1943–1946) in a boarding school in Darjeeling in the Indian Himalayas. After being educated at schools in Nottingham and Yorkshire, Stoppard became a journalist, a drama critic and then, in 1960, a playwright.

Stoppard&#x27;s most prominent plays include &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (1966), &quot;Jumpers&quot; (1972), &quot;Travesties&quot; (1974), &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1978), &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993), &quot;The Invention of Love&quot; (1997), &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; (2002), &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (2006) and &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; (2020). He wrote the screenplays for &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987), &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990), &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; (1991), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), &quot;Enigma&quot; (2001), and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (2012), as well as the HBO limited series &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; (2013). He directed the film &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (1990), an adaptation of his own 1966 play, with Gary Oldman and Tim Roth as the leads.

He has received numerous awards and honours including an Academy Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, and five Tony Awards. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him number 11 in their list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;. It was announced in June 2019 that Stoppard had written a new play, &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot;, set in the Jewish community of early 20th-century Vienna. The play premiered in January 2020 at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. The play went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play and later the 2022 Tony Award for Best Play.

==Early life and education ==
Stoppard was born Tomáš Sträussler, in Zlín, a city dominated by the shoe manufacturing industry, in the Moravia region of Czechoslovakia. He is the son of Martha Becková and Eugen Sträussler, a doctor employed by the Bata shoe company. His parents were non-observant Jews. Just before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the town&#x27;s patron, Jan Antonín Baťa, transferred his Jewish employees, mostly physicians, to branches of his firm outside Europe. On 15 March 1939, the day the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the Sträussler family fled to Singapore, where Bata had a factory.

Before the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Stoppard, his brother, and their mother fled to India. Stoppard&#x27;s father remained in Singapore as a British army volunteer, knowing that as a doctor, he would be needed in its defence. When Stoppard was four years old, his father died. The writer long understood that Sträussler had perished in Japanese captivity, as a prisoner of war. The book &quot;Tom Stoppard in Conversation&quot; describes this, but the author later revealed the subsequent discovery that his father had been reported drowned on board a ship, bombed by Japanese forces, as he tried to flee Singapore in 1942.

In 1941, when Tomáš was five, he, his brother Petr, and their mother had been evacuated to Darjeeling, India. The boys attended Mount Hermon School, an American multi-racial school, where the brothers became Tom and Peter.

In 1945, his mother, Martha, married British army major Kenneth Stoppard, who gave the boys his English surname and moved the family to England in 1946. Stoppard&#x27;s stepfather believed strongly that &quot;to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life&quot;—a quote from Cecil Rhodes—telling his 9-year-old stepson: &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize that I made you British?&quot; setting up Stoppard&#x27;s desire as a child to become &quot;an honorary Englishman&quot;. He has said, &quot;I fairly often find I&#x27;m with people who forget I don&#x27;t quite belong in the world we&#x27;re in. I find I put a foot wrong—it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history—and suddenly I&#x27;m there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket&quot;. This is reflected in his characters, he observes, who are &quot;constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails to do with the confusion of having two names&quot;. Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at Pocklington School in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which he hated.

Stoppard left school at 17 and began work as a journalist for the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; in Bristol, without attending university. Years later, he came to regret the decision to forgo a university education, but at the time, he loved his work as a journalist and was passionate about his career. He worked at the paper from 1954 until 1958, when the &quot;Bristol Evening World&quot; offered Stoppard the position of feature writer, humour columnist, and secondary drama critic, which took him into the world of theatre. At the Bristol Old Vic, at the time a well-regarded regional repertory company, Stoppard formed friendships with director John Boorman and actor Peter O&#x27;Toole early in their careers. In Bristol, he became known more for his strained attempts at humour and unstylish clothes than for his writing.

==Career==
=== Early work ===
Stoppard wrote short radio plays in 1953–54 and by 1960 he had completed his first stage play, &quot;A Walk on the Water&quot;, which was later re-titled &quot;Enter a Free Man&quot; (1968).
He has said the work owed much to Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;Flowering Cherry&quot; and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. Within a week after sending &quot;A Walk on the Water&quot; to an agent, Stoppard received his version of the &quot;Hollywood-style telegrams that change struggling young artists&#x27; lives.&quot; His first play was optioned, staged in Hamburg, then broadcast on British Independent Television in 1963. From September 1962 until April 1963, Stoppard worked in London as a drama critic for &quot;Scene&quot; magazine, writing reviews and interviews both under his name and the pseudonym William Boot (taken from Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Scoop&quot;). In 1964, a Ford Foundation grant enabled Stoppard to spend 5 months writing in a Berlin mansion, emerging with a one-act play titled &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Meet King Lear&quot;, which later evolved into his Tony-winning play &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;.

In the following years, Stoppard produced several works for radio, television and the theatre, including &quot;&quot;M&quot; is for Moon Among Other Things&quot; (1964), &quot;A Separate Peace&quot; (1966) and &quot;If You&#x27;re Glad I&#x27;ll Be Frank&quot; (1966). On 11 April 1967 – following acclaim at the 1966 Edinburgh Festival – the opening of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; in a National Theatre production at the Old Vic made Stoppard an overnight success. &quot;Jumpers&quot; (1972) places a professor of moral philosophy in a murder mystery thriller alongside a slew of radical gymnasts. &quot;Travesties&quot; (1974) explored the &#x27;Wildean&#x27; possibilities arising from the fact that Vladimir Lenin, James Joyce, and Tristan Tzara had all been in Zürich during the First World War.
Stoppard has written one novel, &quot;Lord Malquist and Mr Moon&quot; (1966), set in contemporary London. Its cast includes the 18th-century figure of the dandified Malquist and his ineffectual Boswell, Moon, and also cowboys, a lion (banned from the Ritz) and a donkey-borne Irishman claiming to be the Risen Christ.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, in addition to writing his own works, Stoppard translated many plays into English, including works by Sławomir Mrożek, Johann Nestroy, Arthur Schnitzler, and Václav Havel. It was at this time that Stoppard became influenced by the works of Polish and Czech absurdists. He has been co-opted into the Outrapo group, a far-from-serious French movement to improve actors&#x27; stage technique through science.

In 1982 Stoppard premiered his play &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. The story revolves around a male-female relationship and the struggle between the actress and the member of a group fighting to free a Scottish soldier imprisoned for burning a memorial wreath during a protest. The leading roles were originated by Roger Rees, and Felicity Kendal. The story examines various constructs of honesty including a play within a play, to explore the theme of reality versus appearance. It has been described as one of Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;most popular, enduring and autobiographical plays.&quot;

The play made its Broadway transfer in 1984 which was directed by Mike Nichols starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close in the leading roles with a supporting role by Christine Baranski. The transfer was a critical success with &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Frank Rich declaring, &quot;The Broadway version of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; - a substantial revision of the original London production - is not only Mr. Stoppard&#x27;s most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.&quot; The production went on to earn seven Tony Award nominations, winning five awards for Best Play as well for Nichols, Irons, Close, and Baranski. This would be Stoppard&#x27;s third Tony Award for Best Play, following &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; in 1968 and &quot;Travesties&quot; in 1976.

In 1985, Stoppard co-wrote with Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown a feature film, the satirical science-fiction dark comedy &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). 
The film received near universal acclaim. Pauline Kael critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; declared, &quot;Visually, it’s an original, bravura piece of moviemaking...Gilliam’s vision is an organic thing on the screen—and that’s a considerable achievement&quot;. 
Stoppard along with Gilliam and McKeown were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, losing to &quot;Witness&quot;. He went on to write the scripts for Steven Spielberg, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). Spielberg later stated that though Stoppard was uncredited for the latter of the two, &quot;he was responsible for almost every line of dialogue in the film&quot;.

For his 1985 appearance on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Desert Island Discs Stoppard chose &quot;Careless Love&quot; by Bessie Smith as his favourite track; he also selected Inferno in two languages by Dante Alighieri as his chosen book and a plastic football as his luxury item.

=== 1990s ===
In 1993, Stoppard wrote &quot;Arcadia&quot;, a play in which he explores the interaction between two modern academics and the residents of a Derbyshire country house in the early 19th century, including aristocrats, tutors and the fleeting presence, unseen on stage, of Lord Byron. The themes of the play include the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics, Romantic literature, and the English picturesque style of garden design.

The first production premiered at the Royal National Theatre directed by Trevor Nunn starring Rufus Sewell, Felicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, Harriet Walter and Emma Fielding. It won the 1993 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. A year later the play made its transfer on Broadway starring Billy Crudup, Blair Brown, Victor Garber and Robert Sean Leonard. The production was well received with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, that while &quot;There are real difficulties with this production...[there are] also great pleasures, not the least of which are Mark Thompson&#x27;s sets and costumes. Mostly, though, there are Mr. Stoppard&#x27;s grandly eclectic obsessions and his singular gifts as a playwright. Attend to them.&quot; The production received three Tony Award nominations including Best Play losing to Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot;.

Stoppard gained acclaim with the feature film &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), which he wrote. The film, a romantic comedy, focuses on a fictional story involving William Shakespeare and his romance with a young woman who is an inspiration for the play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The film starred an ensemble cast including Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Judi Dench. The film was a critical and financial success and went on to earn seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Stoppard received his second career Oscar nomination and first win for Best Original Screenplay. He also received the BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award for his screenplay.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; (2002) was a trilogy of plays Stoppard wrote about the philosophical arguments among Russian revolutionary figures in the late 19th century. The trilogy comprises &quot;Voyage&quot;, &quot;Shipwreck&quot;, and &quot;Salvage&quot;. Major figures in the play include Michael Bakunin, Ivan Turgenev, and Alexander Herzen. The title comes from a chapter in Avrahm Yarmolinsky&#x27;s book &quot;Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism&quot; (1959). The play premiered in 2002 at the National Theatre directed by Trevor Nunn in total spanning nine hours. The play received three Laurence Olivier Award nominations including Best New Play, ultimately losing in all its categories. In 2006 it made its Broadway premiere in a production starring Billy Crudup, Jennifer Ehle, and Ethan Hawke. The play received 10 nominations winning seven awards including for Best Play, Stoppard&#x27;s fourth win in the category.

&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (2006) was set in both Cambridge, England, and Prague. The play explored the culture of 1960s rock music, especially the persona of Syd Barrett and the political challenge of the Czech band The Plastic People of the Universe, mirroring the contrast between liberal society in England and the repressive Czech state after the Warsaw Pact intervention in the Prague Spring.

Stoppard served on the advisory board of the magazine &quot;Standpoint&quot;, and was instrumental in its foundation, giving the opening speech at its launch. He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. Stoppard was appointed president of the London Library in 2002 and vice-president in 2017 following the election of Sir Tim Rice as president.

=== 2010s ===
For Joe Wright, Stoppard adapted Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; into the 2012 film adaptation starring Keira Knightley. Film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the film and Stoppard writing, &quot;Stoppard — himself a master of puzzle-like construction in fine plays including Arcadia — supplies an excellently clean, delicately balanced script.&quot;

In 2012, Stoppard wrote a five part limited series for television, &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot;, which revolves around a love triangle between a conservative English aristocrat, his mean socialite wife and a young suffragette. The series premiered on BBC Two, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall. The series has received widespread acclaim from critics with &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Grace Dent proclaiming it &quot;one of the finest things the BBC has ever made&quot;. &quot;IndieWire&quot; declared, &quot;&quot;Parade’s End&quot; is wonderful accomplishment, smart, adult television&quot;. Stoppard received a British Academy Television Award and Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the series.

It was announced in June 2019 that Stoppard had written a new play, &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot;, set in the Jewish community of early 20th-century Vienna. The play premiered in January 2020 at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. The play went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The play then transferred to Broadway, opening on 2 October 2022. It was nominated for six Tony Awards and won four, including Best Play.

== Screenwriting ==
Stoppard has also co-written screenplays including &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998) and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989). Stoppard also worked on &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, though again Stoppard received no official or formal credit in this role. He worked in a similar capacity with Tim Burton on his film &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. His radio production, &quot;Darkside&quot; (2013), was written for BBC Radio 2 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

==Themes==
=== Existentialism ===
&quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; (1966–67) was Stoppard&#x27;s first major play to gain recognition. The story of &quot;Hamlet&quot; as told from the viewpoint of two courtiers echoes Beckett in its double act repartee, existential themes and language play. &quot;Stoppardian&quot; became a term describing works using wit and comedy while addressing philosophical concepts. Critic Dennis Kennedy commented:It established several characteristics of Stoppard&#x27;s dramaturgy: his word-playing intellectuality, audacious, paradoxical, and self-conscious theatricality, and preference for reworking pre-existing narratives... Stoppard&#x27;s plays have been sometimes dismissed as pieces of clever showmanship, lacking in substance, social commitment, or emotional weight. His theatrical surfaces serve to conceal rather than reveal their author&#x27;s views, and his fondness for towers of paradox spirals away from social comment. This is seen most clearly in his comedies &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot; (1968) and &quot;After Magritte&quot; (1970), which create their humour through highly formal devices of reframing and juxtaposition.Stoppard himself went so far as to declare &quot;I must stop compromising my plays with this whiff of social application. They must be entirely untouched by any suspicion of usefulness.&quot; He acknowledges that he started off &quot;as a language nerd&quot;, primarily enjoying linguistic and ideological playfulness, feeling early in his career that journalism was far better suited for presaging political change, than playwriting.

=== Intellectuality ===
The accusations of favouring intellectuality over political commitment or commentary were met with a change of tack, as Stoppard produced increasingly socially engaged work. From 1977, he became personally involved with human-rights issues, in particular with the situation of political dissidents in Central and Eastern Europe. In February 1977, he visited the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries with a member of Amnesty International. In June, Stoppard met Vladimir Bukovsky in London and travelled to Czechoslovakia (then under communist control), where he met dissident playwright and future president Václav Havel, whose writing he greatly admires. Stoppard became involved with &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, Amnesty International, and the Committee Against Psychiatric Abuse and wrote various newspaper articles and letters about human rights. He was instrumental in translating Havel&#x27;s works into English. &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; (1977), &quot;a play for actors and orchestra&quot; was based on a request by conductor/composer André Previn and was inspired by a meeting with a Russian exile. This play, as well as &quot;Dogg&#x27;s Hamlet, Cahoot&#x27;s Macbeth&quot; (1979), &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; (2002), &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (2006), and two works for television &quot;Professional Foul&quot; (1977) and &quot;Squaring the Circle&quot; (1984), all concern themes of censorship, rights abuses, and state repression.

Stoppard&#x27;s later works have sought greater interpersonal depths, whilst maintaining their intellectual playfulness. Stoppard acknowledges that around 1982 he moved away from the &quot;argumentative&quot; works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became &quot;less shy&quot; about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented &quot;I think I was too concerned when I set off, to have a firework go off every few seconds... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and I seem to be able to entertain through manipulating language... [but] it&#x27;s really about human beings, it&#x27;s not really about language at all.&quot; &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1982) uses a meta-theatrical structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and &quot;The Invention of Love&quot; (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993) explores the meeting of chaos theory, historiography, and landscape gardening. He was inspired by a Trevor Nunn production of Gorky&#x27;s &quot;Summerfolk&quot; to write a trilogy of &quot;human&quot; plays: &quot;The Coast of Utopia&quot; (&quot;Voyage&quot;, &quot;Shipwreck&quot;, and &quot;Salvage&quot;, 2002).

Stoppard has commented that he loves the medium of theatre for how &quot;adjustable&quot; it is at every point, how unfrozen it is, continuously growing and developing through each rehearsal, free from the text. His experience of writing for film is similar, offering the liberating opportunity to &quot;play God&quot;, in control of creative reality. It often takes four to five years from the first idea of a play to staging, taking pains to be as profoundly accurate in his research as he can be.

==Personal life==
=== Family and relationships ===
Stoppard has been married three times. His first marriage was to Josie Ingle (1965–1972), a nurse. His second marriage was to Miriam Stern (1972–92); they separated when he began a relationship with actress Felicity Kendal. He also had a relationship with actress Sinéad Cusack, but she made it clear she wished to remain married to Jeremy Irons and stay close to their two sons. Also, after she was reunited with a son she had given up for adoption, she wished to spend time with him in Dublin rather than with Stoppard in the house they shared in France. He has two sons from each of his first two marriages: Oliver Stoppard, Barnaby Stoppard, the actor Ed Stoppard, and Will Stoppard, who is married to violinist Linzi Stoppard. In 2014 he married Sabrina Guinness.

Stoppard&#x27;s mother died in 1996. The family had not talked about their history and neither brother knew what had happened to the family left behind in Czechoslovakia. In the early 1990s, with the fall of communism, Stoppard found out that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz, and other camps, along with three of his mother&#x27;s sisters.

In 1998, following the deaths of his parents, he returned to Zlín for the first time in over 50 years. He has expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove. &quot;I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It&#x27;s a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life.&quot;

In 2013, Stoppard asked Hermione Lee to write his biography. The book was published in 2020.

===Political views===
In 1979, the year of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s election, Stoppard noted to Paul Delaney: &quot;I&#x27;m a conservative with a small c. I am a conservative in politics, literature, education and theatre.&quot; In 2007, Stoppard described himself as a &quot;timid libertarian&quot;.

The Tom Stoppard Prize () was created in 1983 under the Charter 77 Foundation and is awarded to authors of Czech origin.

In 2014, Stoppard publicly backed &quot;Hacked Off&quot; and its campaign towards press self-regulation by &quot;safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.&quot;

== Legacy and honours ==
=== Awards ===

In July 2013 Stoppard was awarded the PEN Pinter Prize for &quot;determination to tell things as they are.&quot;

In July 2017, Stoppard was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Stoppard was appointed Cameron Mackintosh Visiting of Contemporary Theatre, St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, for the academic year 2017–2018.

Stoppard has been represented in various forms of art. He sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill, and a bronze head is now in public collection, situated with the Stoppard papers in the reading room of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The terracotta remains in the collection of the artist in London. The correspondence file relating to the Stoppard bust is held in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation&#x27;s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds.

Stoppard also sat for the sculptor and friend Angela Conner, and his bronze portrait bust is on display in the grounds of Chatsworth House.

===Archive===

The papers of Stoppard are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The archive was first established by Stoppard in 1991 and continues to grow. The collection consists of typescript and handwritten drafts, revision pages, outlines, and notes; production material, including cast lists, set drawings, schedules, and photographs; theatre programs; posters; advertisements; clippings; page and galley proofs; dust jackets; correspondence; legal documents and financial papers, including passports, contracts, and royalty and account statements; itineraries; appointment books and diary sheets; photographs; sheet music; sound recordings; a scrapbook; artwork; minutes of meetings; and publications.

<text>The thylacine (; binomial name Thylacinus cynocephalus), also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, is an extinct carnivorous marsupial that was native to the Australian mainland and the islands of Tasmania and New Guinea. The thylacine died out in New Guinea and mainland Australia around 3,600–3,200 years ago, prior to the arrival of Europeans, possibly because of the introduction of the dingo, whose earliest record dates to around the same time, but which never reached Tasmania. Prior to European settlement, around 5,000 remained in the wild on Tasmania. Beginning in the nineteenth century, they were perceived as a threat to the livestock of farmers and bounty hunting was introduced. The last known of its species died in 1936 at Hobart Zoo in Tasmania. The thylacine is widespread in popular culture and is a cultural icon in Australia.

The thylacine was known as the Tasmanian tiger because of the dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, and it was called the Tasmanian wolf because it resembled a medium- to large-sized canid. The name thylacine is derived from &quot;thýlakos&quot; meaning &quot;pouch&quot; and &quot;ine&quot; meaning &quot;pertaining to&quot;, and refers to the marsupial pouch. Both sexes had a pouch. The females used theirs for rearing young, and the males used theirs as a protective sheath, covering the external reproductive organs. The animal had a stiff tail and could open its jaws to an unusual extent. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence on its predatory behaviour suggest that the thylacine was a solitary ambush predator specialised in hunting small- to medium-sized prey. Accounts suggest that, in the wild, it fed on small birds and mammals. It was the only member of the genus &quot;Thylacinus&quot; and family Thylacinidae to have survived until modern times. Its closest living relatives are the other members of Dasyuromorphia, including the Tasmanian devil, from which it is estimated to have split 42–36 million years ago.

Intensive hunting on Tasmania is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors were disease, the introduction of and competition with dingoes, human encroachment into its habitat and climate change. The remains of the last known thylacine were discovered at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2022. Since extinction there have been numerous searches and reported sightings of live animals, none of which have been confirmed.

The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official coat of arms of Tasmania. Since 1996, National Threatened Species Day has been commemorated in Australia on 7 September, the date on which the last known thylacine died in 1936. Universities, museums and other institutions across the world research the animal. Its whole genome sequence has been mapped, and there are efforts to clone and bring it back to life.

==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==

Numerous examples of thylacine engravings and rock art have been found, dating back to at least 1000 BC. Petroglyph images of the thylacine can be found at the Dampier Rock Art Precinct, on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia.

By the time the first European explorers arrived, the animal was already extinct in mainland Australia and New Guinea and rare in Tasmania. Europeans may have encountered it in Tasmania as far back as 1642, when Abel Tasman first arrived in Tasmania. His shore party reported seeing the footprints of &quot;wild beasts having claws like a &quot;Tyger&quot;&quot;. Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, arriving with the &quot;Mascarin&quot; in 1772, reported seeing a &quot;tiger cat&quot;.

The first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May 1792, as noted by the naturalist Jacques Labillardière, in his journal from the expedition led by d&#x27;Entrecasteaux. In 1805, William Paterson, the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, sent a detailed description for publication in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot;. He also sent a description of the thylacine in a letter to Joseph Banks, dated 30 March 1805.

The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania&#x27;s Deputy Surveyor-General, George Harris, in 1808, five years after first European settlement of the island. Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus &quot;Didelphis&quot;, which had been created by Linnaeus for the American opossums, describing it as &quot;Didelphis cynocephala&quot;, the &quot;dog-headed opossum&quot;. Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme, and in 1796, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created the genus &quot;Dasyurus&quot;, where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To maintain gender agreement with the genus name, the species name was altered to &quot;cynocephalus&quot;. In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, &quot;Thylacinus&quot;, by Temminck. The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek (), meaning &quot;pouch&quot; or &quot;sack&quot; and &quot;ine&quot; meaning &quot;pertaining to&quot;. The name is pronounced or .

=== Evolution ===
The earliest records of the modern thylacine are from the Early Pleistocene, with the oldest known fossil record in southeastern Australia from the Calabrian age around 1.77–0.78 million years ago. Specimens from the Pliocene-aged Chinchilla Fauna, described as &quot;Thylacinus rostralis&quot; by Charles De Vis in 1894, have in the past been suggested to represent &quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;, but have been shown to either have been curatorial errors, or ambiguous in their specific attribution. The family Thylacinidae includes at least 12 species in eight genera. Thylacinids are estimated to have split from other members of Dasyuromorphia around 42–36 million years ago. The earliest representative of the family is &quot;Badjcinus turnbulli&quot; from the Late Oligocene of Riversleigh in Queensland, around 25 million years ago. Early thylacinids were quoll-sized, well under . It probably ate insects and small reptiles and mammals, although signs of an increasingly-carnivorous diet can be seen as early as the early Miocene in &quot;Wabulacinus&quot;. Members of the genus &quot;Thylacinus&quot; are notable for a dramatic increase in both the expression of carnivorous dental traits and in size, with the largest species, &quot;Thylacinus potens&quot; and &quot;Thylacinus megiriani&quot;, both approaching the size of a wolf. In late Pleistocene and early Holocene times, the modern thylacine was widespread (although never numerous) throughout Australia and New Guinea.
A classic example of convergent evolution, the thylacine showed many similarities to the members of the dog family, Canidae, of the Northern Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, raised heels, and the same general body form. Since the thylacine filled the same ecological niche in Australia and New Guinea as canids did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, as a marsupial, it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere placental mammal predators.

The thylacine is a basal member of the Dasyuromorphia, along with numbats, dunnarts, wambengers, and quolls. The cladogram follows:

Phylogeny of Thylacinidae after Rovinsky et al. (2019)

== Description ==

The only recorded species of &quot;Thylacinus&quot;, a genus that superficially resembles the dogs and foxes of the family Canidae, the animal was a predatory marsupial that existed on mainland Australia during the Holocene epoch and was observed by Europeans on the island of Tasmania; the species is known as the Tasmanian tiger for the striped markings of the pelage. Descriptions of the thylacine come from preserved specimens, fossil records, skins and skeletal remains, and black and white photographs and film of the animal both in captivity and from the field. The thylacine resembled a large, short-haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from the body in a way similar to that of a kangaroo. The mature thylacine measured about in shoulder height and in body length, excluding the tail which measured around . Because the recorded body mass estimates are scant, it has been suggested that they may have weighed anywhere from , but a 2020 study that examined 93 adult specimens, with 40 of the specimens&#x27; sexes being known, argued that their average body mass would be with a range of based on volumetric analysis. There was slight sexual dimorphism, with the males being larger than females on average. Males weighed on average , and females on average weighed . The skull is noted to be highly convergent on those of canids, most closely resembling that of the red fox.

Thylacines, uniquely for marsupials, had largely cartilaginous epipubic bones with a highly reduced osseous element. This was once considered a synapomorphy with sparassodonts, though it is now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently. Its yellow-brown coat featured 15 to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back, rump and the base of its tail, which earned the animal the nickname &quot;tiger&quot;. The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens, fading as the animal got older. One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh. Its body hair was dense and soft, up to in length. Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown; the belly was cream-coloured.

Its rounded, erect ears were about long and covered with short fur. The early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey, but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its olfactory bulbs were not well developed. It is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead. In 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative cortical maps of thylacine and Tasmanian devil brains, showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularised basal ganglion. The authors associated these differences with the thylacine&#x27;s more predatory lifestyle. Analysis of the forebrain published in 2023 suggested that it was similar in morphology to other dasyuromorph marsupials and dissimilar to that of canids.
The thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees. This capability can be seen in part in David Fleay&#x27;s short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The jaws were muscular, and had 46 teeth, but studies show the thylacine jaw was too weak to kill sheep. The tail vertebrae were fused to a degree, with resulting restriction of full tail movement. Fusion may have occurred as the animal reached full maturity. The tail tapered towards the tip. In juveniles, the tip of the tail had a ridge. The female thylacine had a pouch with four teats, but unlike many other marsupials, the pouch opened to the rear of its body. Males had a scrotal pouch, unique amongst the Australian marsupials, into which they could withdraw their scrotal sac for protection.

Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, wombats, or Tasmanian devils, thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight line. The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five. Their claws were non-retractable. The plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes.

The thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward gait, making it unable to run at high speed. It could also perform a bipedal hop, in a fashion similar to a kangaroo—demonstrated at various times by captive specimens. Guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed. The animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods.

Observers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated, often accompanied by a threat-yawn. During hunting, it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough-like barks (described as &quot;yip-yap&quot;, &quot;cay-yip&quot; or &quot;hop-hop-hop&quot;), probably for communication between the family pack members. It also had a long whining cry, probably for identification at distance, and a low snuffling noise used for communication between family members. Some observers described it as having a strong and distinctive smell, others described a faint, clean, animal odour, and some no odour at all. It is possible that the thylacine, like its relative, the Tasmanian devil, gave off an odour when agitated.

==Distribution and habitat==
The thylacine most likely preferred the dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands of mainland Australia. Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland Australia and New Guinea. Proof of the animal&#x27;s existence in mainland Australia came from a desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia in 1990; carbon dating revealed it to be around 3,300 years old. Recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical distribution of the species on Kangaroo Island. The northernmost record of the species is from the Kiowa rock shelter in Chimbu Province in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, dating to the Early Holocene, around 10,000–8,500 years Before Present. In 2017, White, Mitchell and Austin published a large-scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes, showing that they had split into eastern and western populations on the mainland prior to the Last Glacial Maximum and that Tasmanian thylacines had a low genetic diversity by the time of European arrival.

In Tasmania, they preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal heath, which eventually became the primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock. The striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions, but it may have also served for identification purposes. The species had a typical home range of between . It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

===Reproduction===
There is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring. They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size. Early pouch young were hairless and blind, but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by the time they left the pouch. The young also had their own pouches that were not visible until they were 9.5 weeks old. After leaving the pouch, and until they were developed enough to assist, the juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted. Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity, in Melbourne Zoo in 1899. Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years, although captive specimens survived up to 9 years.

In 2018, Newton et al. collected and CT-scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to digitally reconstruct their development throughout their entire window of growth in their mother&#x27;s pouch. This study revealed new information on the biology of the thylacine, including the growth of its limbs and when it developed its &#x27;dog-like&#x27; appearance. It was found that two of the thylacine young in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) were misidentified and of another species, reducing the number of known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide. One of four specimens kept at Museum Victoria has been serially sectioned, allowing an in-depth investigation of its internal tissues and providing some insights into thylacine pouch young development, biology, immunology and ecology.

=== Feeding and diet ===

The thylacine was an apex predator, though exactly how large its prey animals could be is disputed. It was a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark, or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, although it occasionally showed inquisitive traits. At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its &quot;fierce&quot; nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture.

Historical accounts suggest that in the wild, the thylacine preyed on small mammals and birds, with waterbirds being the most commonly recorded bird prey, with historical accounts of thylacines predating on black ducks and teals with coots, Tasmanian nativehens, swamphens, herons (&quot;Ardea&quot;) and black swans also being likely items of prey. The thylacine may also have preyed upon the now extinct Tasmanian emu. The most commonly recorded mammalian prey was the red-necked wallaby, with other recorded prey including the Tasmanian pademelon and the short-beaked echidna. Other probable native mammalian prey includes other marsupials like bandicoots and brushtail possums, as well as native rodents like water rats. Following their introduction to Tasmania, European rabbits rapidly multiplied and became abundant across the island, with a number of accounts reporting the predation of rabbits by thylacines. Some accounts also suggest that the thylacine may have preyed on lizards, frogs and fish. 

European settlers believed the thylacine to prey regularly upon farmers&#x27; sheep and poultry. However, analysis by Robert Paddle suggests that there is little evidence that thylacines were significant predators of sheep or poultry (though some accounts suggest that they may have attacked them on occasion), with many sheep deaths likely caused by feral dog attacks instead. Throughout the 20th century, the thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker; according to Robert Paddle, the story&#x27;s popularity seems to have originated from a single second-hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith (1881–1916) in a shepherd&#x27;s hut.
Recent studies suggest that the thylacine was probably not suited for hunting large prey. A 2007 study argued that, while it could open its jaws wide like modern mammalian predators that consume large prey, the canine of the thylacine was not suited for slashing bites like that of large canids, indicating, based on the assumption that the bite was largely derived by its skull, that it hunted small to medium-sized prey as a solitary hunter. A 2011 study by the University of New South Wales using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws; animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than , suggesting that the thylacine only ate smaller animals such as bandicoots, pademelons and possums, and that it may have directly competed with the Tasmanian devil and the tiger quoll. Another study in 2020 produced similar results, after estimating the average body mass of thylacine as about rather than , suggesting that the animal did indeed hunt much smaller prey. The cranial and facial morphology also indicate that the thylacine would have hunted prey less than 45% of its own body mass, consistent with modern carnivores weighing under which is about the average size of a thylacine.

A 2005 study showed that the thylacine had a high bite force quotient of 166, which was similar to that of most quolls, indicating that it may have been able to hunt larger prey relative to its body size. A 2007 study also suggested that it would have had a much stronger bite force than a dingo of similar size, though this particular study argued that the thylacine would have hunted smaller prey. A biomechanical analysis of the 3D skull model suggested that the thylacine would have likely consumed smaller prey, with its skull displaying high levels of stress that are not suited to withstand forces, and with its bite forces being estimated at a smaller value than that of Tasmanian devils. A 2014 study compared the skull of a thylacine with that of modern dasyurids and an earlier thylacinid taxon &quot;Nimbacinus&quot; based on biomechanical analysis of their 3D skull models; the authors suggested that while &quot;Nimbacinus&quot; was suited to hunt large prey with a maximum muscle force of which are similar to that of large Tasmanian devils, the thylacine skull displayed a much higher stress in all areas compared to its relatives due to its longer snout. If the thylacine were indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.

It has been suggested on the basis of the canine teeth and limb bones that the thylacine was a solitary pounce-pursuit predator that hunted smaller prey with trophic niches similar to relatively smaller canids like the coyote, and that it was not as specialised as large canids, hyaenids and felids of today: its canine lacked the adaptation for producing slashing or deep penetrating bites, and its anatomy was not suited for running fast in high speed. However, the trappers reported it as an ambush predator hunting alone or in pairs mainly at night. The elbow joint morphology and the forelimb anatomy of the thylacine also suggest that the animal was most likely an ambush predator.

The stomach of a thylacine was very muscular, capable of distending to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. In captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef, mutton, horse and, occasionally, poultry. There is a report of a captive thylacine that refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but &quot;ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed wallaby put before its nose.&quot;

==Extinction==
=== Dying out on the Australian mainland ===

Australia lost more than 90% of its megafauna around 50–40,000 years ago as part of the Quaternary extinction event, with the notable exceptions of several kangaroo and wombat species, emus, cassowaries, large goannas, and the thylacine. The extinctions included the even larger carnivore &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; (sometimes called the marsupial lion) which was only distantly related to the thylacine. A 2010 paper examining this issue showed that humans were likely to be one of the major factors in the extinction of many species in Australia although the authors of the research warned that one-factor explanations might be over-simplistic. The youngest radiocarbon dates of the thylacine in mainland Australia are around 3,500 years old, with an estimated extinction date around 3,200 years ago, synchronous with that of Tasmanian devil, and closely co-inciding with the earliest records of the dingo, as well as an intensification of human activity.

A study proposes that the dingo may have led to the extinction of the thylacine in mainland Australia because the dingo outcompeted the thylacine in preying on the Tasmanian nativehen. The dingo is also more likely to hunt in packs than the more solitary thylacine. Examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite, its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine. Because it was a hypercarnivore, the thylacine was less versatile in its diet than the omnivorous dingo. Their ranges appear to have overlapped because thylacine subfossil remains have been discovered near those of dingoes. Aside from wild dingoes, the adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased pressure.

A 2013 study suggested that, while dingoes were a contributing factor to the thylacine&#x27;s demise on the mainland, larger factors were the intense human population growth, technological advances, and the abrupt change in the climate during the period. A report published in the &quot;Journal of Biogeography&quot; detailed an investigation into the mitochondrial DNA and radio-carbon dating of thylacine bones. It concluded that the thylacine died out on mainland Australia in a relatively short time span.

Ken Mulvaney has suggested, based on the high number of rock carvings of the thylacine on the Burrup Peninsula, Aboriginal Australians were aware of, and concerned about the thylacine’s dwindling numbers around that time.

===Dying out on Tasmania===

Although the thylacine had died out on mainland Australia, it survived into the 1930s on the island of Tasmania. At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast, northwest and north-midland regions of the state. There were an estimated 5,000 at the time. They were rarely sighted but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers. The Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909, the Tasmanian government paid £1 per head for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups. In all, they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and bounty hunters. 

Aside from persecution, it is likely that multiple factors rapidly compounded its decline and eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, erosion of its habitat, already-low genetic diversity, the concurrent extinction or decline of prey species, and a distemper-like disease that affected many captive specimens at the time. A study from 2012 suggested that the disease was likely introduced by humans, and that it was also present in the wild population. The marsupi-carnivore disease, as it became known, dramatically reduced the lifespan of the animal and greatly increased pup mortality.
A 1921 photo by Henry Burrell of a thylacine with a chicken was widely distributed and may have helped secure the animal&#x27;s reputation as a poultry thief. The image had been cropped to hide the fact that the animal was in captivity, and analysis by one researcher has concluded that this thylacine was a dead specimen, posed for the camera. The photograph may even have involved photo manipulation.

The animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s. Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep, in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve similar to the Savage River National Park to protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur-Pieman area of western Tasmania.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive specimens by zoos around the world, placing yet more pressure on an already small population. Despite the export of breeding pairs, attempts at rearing thylacines in captivity were unsuccessful, and the last thylacine outside Australia died at the London Zoo in 1931.

The last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty, a farmer from Mawbanna in the state&#x27;s northwest. The animal, believed to have been a male, had been seen around Batty&#x27;s house for several weeks.

Work in 2012 examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the thylacines in Tasmania had limited genetic diversity due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia. Further investigations in 2017 showed evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before the arrival of humans in Australia, possibly starting as early as 70–120 thousand years ago.

The thylacine held the status of endangered species until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine&#x27;s existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2013.

===Last of the species===

The last captive thylacine, lived as an endling (the known last of its species) at Hobart Zoo until its death on the night of 7 September 1936. The animal, a female, was captured by Elias Churchill with a snare trap and was sold to the zoo in May 1936. The sale was not publicly announced because the use of traps was illegal and Churchill could have been fined. After its death, the remains of the endling were transferred to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The remains were not properly recorded by the museum because the animal had been caught illegally. It lay undiscovered for decades until a taxidermist record dated from 1936 or 1937 mentioning the animal was noticed. This led to a full audit of all thylacine remains at the museum and the endling&#x27;s successful identification at the end of 2022.

In 1968, Frank Darby invented a myth that the endling was called Benjamin. The myth was widely circulated in the media, with Wikipedia itself repeating the invention. The thylacine that Darby was referring to was a female at Hobart Zoo. This animal is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. This thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 45 seconds of black-and-white footage showing the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist David Fleay. In the film footage, the thylacine is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning, sniffing the air, scratching itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down. Fleay was bitten on the buttock whilst shooting the film. In 2021, a digitally colourised 80-second clip of Fleay&#x27;s footage of the thylacine was released by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, to mark National Threatened Species Day. The digital colourisation process was based on historic primary and secondary descriptions to ensure an accurate colour match.

Although there had been a conservation movement pressing for the thylacine&#x27;s protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government came all too late; it was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.

=== Searches and unconfirmed sightings ===
Between 1967 and 1973, zoologist Jeremy Griffith and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is regarded as the most intensive search for thylacines ever carried out, including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania&#x27;s west coast, installation of automatic camera stations, prompt investigations of claimed sightings, and in 1972 the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. Bob Brown, which concluded without finding any evidence of the thylacine&#x27;s existence.

The Department of Conservation and Land Management recorded 203 reports of sightings of the thylacine in Western Australia from 1936 to 1998. On the mainland, sightings are most frequently reported in Southern Victoria.

According to the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, there have been eight unconfirmed thylacine sighting reports between 2016 and 2019, with the latest unconfirmed visual sighting on 25 February 2018.

Since the disappearance and effective extinction of the thylacine, speculation and searches for a living specimen have become a topic of interest to some members of the cryptozoology subculture. The search for the animal has been the subject of books and articles, with many reported sightings that are largely regarded as dubious.

A 2023 study published by Brook et al. compiles many of the alleged sightings of thylacines in Tasmania throughout the 20th century and claims that, contrary to beliefs that the thylacine went extinct in the 1930s, the Tasmanian thylacine may have actually lasted throughout the 20th century, with a window of extinction between the 1980s and the present day and the likely extinction date being between the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In 1983, the American media mogul Ted Turner offered a $100,000 reward for proof of the continued existence of the thylacine. In March 2005, Australian news magazine &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25 million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005, no one had produced any evidence of the animal&#x27;s existence. An offer of $1.75 million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator, Stewart Malcolm.

== Research ==
Research into thylacines relies heavily on specimens held in museums and other institutions across the world. The number and distribution of these specimens has been recorded in the International Thylacine Specimen Database. As of 2022, 756 specimens are held in 115 museums and university collections in 23 countries. In 2017, a reference library of 159 micrographic images of thylacine hair was jointly produced by CSIRO and Where Light Meets Dark.

===Possible revival===
The Australian Museum in Sydney began a cloning project in 1999. The goal was to use genetic material from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to clone new individuals and restore the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists dismissed the project as a public relations stunt. In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable DNA from the specimens. On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project. In May 2005, the project was restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute.

In August 2022, it was announced that the University of Melbourne would partner with Texas-based biotechnology company Colossal Biosciences to attempt to re-create the thylacine using its closest living relative, the fat-tailed dunnart, and return it to Tasmania. The university had recently sequenced the genome of a juvenile thylacine specimen and was establishing a thylacine genetic restoration laboratory. The research from the University of Melbourne was led by Andrew Pask. The project was regarded with scepticism by other, uninvolved scientists.

===DNA sequencing===

A draft whole genome sequencing of the thylacine was produced by Feigin et al. (2017) using the DNA extracted from an ethanol-preserved pouch of a young specimen provided by Museums Victoria. The neonatal development of the thylacine was also reconstructed from preserved pouch young specimens from several museum collections. Researchers used the genome to study aspects of the thylacine&#x27;s evolution and natural history, including the genetic basis of its convergence with canids, clarifying its evolutionary relationships with other marsupials and examining changes in its population size over time.

The genomic basis of the convergent evolution between the thylacine and grey wolf was further investigated in 2019, with researchers identifying many non-coding genomic regions displaying accelerated rates of evolution, a test for genetic regions evolving under positive selection. In 2021, researchers further identified a link between the convergent skull shapes of the thylacine and wolf, and the previously identified genetic candidates. It was reported that specific groups of skull bones, which develop from a common population of stem cells called neural crest cells, showed strong similarity between the thylacine and wolf and corresponded with the underlying convergent genetic candidates which influence these cells during development. In 2023, RNA was extracted from a 130-year-old thylacine specimen in Sweden; this represented the first time RNA has been extracted from an extinct species. In October 2024, a 99.9% thylacine genome was sequenced from a well-preserved skull that is estimated to be 110-year-old, allowing for the full genome of the species to be sequenced three months later.

===Official usage===
The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official Tasmanian coat of arms. It is used in the official logos for the Tasmanian government and the City of Launceston. It is also used on the University of Tasmania&#x27;s ceremonial mace and the badge of the submarine . Since 1998, it has been prominently displayed on Tasmanian vehicle number plates. The thylacine has appeared in postage stamps from Australia, Equatorial Guinea, and Micronesia.

Since 1996, 7 September (the date in 1936 on which the last known thylacine died) has been commemorated in Australia as National Threatened Species Day.

===In popular culture===

The thylacine has become a cultural icon in Australia. The best known illustrations of &quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot; were those in John Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot; (1845–1863), often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced, and given further exposure by Cascade Brewery&#x27;s appropriation for its label in 1987. The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934, the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for &quot;Tasmanian Friends and Foes&quot; (1881). The thylacine is the mascot for the Tasmanian cricket team. A series of postage stamps that feature Mickey Mouse characters with Australian animals features a thylacine stamp in the collection.

In video games, boomerang-wielding &quot;Ty the Tasmanian Tiger&quot; is the star of his own trilogy during the 2000s. Tiny Tiger, a villain in the popular &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; video game series, is a mutated thylacine. In &quot;Valorant&quot;, agent Skye has the ability to use a Tasmanian tiger to scout enemies and clear bomb-planting sites.

The animal has made appearance in film and television. Characters in the early 1990s&#x27; cartoon &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; included the neurotic Wendell T. Wolf, the last surviving Tasmanian wolf. &quot;The Hunter&quot; is a 2011 Australian drama film, based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Julia Leigh. It stars Willem Dafoe, who plays a man hired to track down the Tasmanian tiger. In the 2021 film, &quot;Extinct&quot;, a thylacine named Burnie, along with a group of other extinct animals, help the movie&#x27;s main characters travel through time to rescue their species from extinction. In the 2022 science-fiction show &quot;The Peripheral&quot; the Tasmanian tiger is brought back into existence from DNA extracts. An animated web series titled &quot;De-extincting Tasie&quot; meant to explain the revival of the species by Colossal Biosciences and University of Melbourne features a thylacine named Tasie, a satire of the Mr. DNA character from the Jurassic Park media franchise.

===In Aboriginal tradition===

Rock art featuring Thylacine-like animals are found throughout Northern Australia, particularly in the Kimberley region.

Various Aboriginal Tasmanian names for the thylacine have been recorded, such as &quot;coorinna&quot;, &quot;kanunnah&quot;, &quot;cab-berr-one-nen-er&quot;, &quot;loarinna&quot;, &quot;laoonana&quot;, &quot;can-nen-ner&quot; and &quot;lagunta&quot;, while &quot;kaparunina&quot; is used in Palawa kani.

One Nuenonne myth recorded by Jackson Cotton tells of a thylacine pup saving Palana, a spirit boy, from an attack by a giant kangaroo. Palana marked the pup&#x27;s back with ochre as a mark of its bravery, giving thylacines their stripes. A constellation, &quot;Wurrawana Corinna&quot; (identified as within or near Gemini), was also created as a commemoration of this mythic act of bravery.

An early European record tells how Aboriginals believed bad weather was caused by a Thylacine carcass being left exposed on the ground, instead of being covered by a small shelter.

<doc id="30391" wikidata="Q152388" url="?curid=30391" title="Theodor W. Adorno">
<text>Theodor W. Adorno ( ; ; born Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund; 11 September 1903 – 6 August 1969) was a German philosopher, musicologist, and social theorist.

He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and G. W. F. Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947), &quot;Minima Moralia&quot; (1951), and &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot; (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.

Amidst the vogue enjoyed by existentialism and positivism in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of ontology and empiricism through studies of Søren Kierkegaard and Edmund Husserl. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg resulted in his studying composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, Adorno&#x27;s commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1947), while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War. Working for the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism, and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the institute carried out in post-war Germany.

Upon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with Karl Popper on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of Martin Heidegger&#x27;s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for the Holocaust, and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Kraus, Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Aesthetic Theory&quot; (1970), which he planned to dedicate to Samuel Beckett, is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art, which attempts to revoke the &quot;fatal separation&quot; of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy, and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion. Adorno was nominated for the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature by Helmut Viebrock.

==Life and career==
===Early years: Frankfurt===
Theodor W. Adorno (alias: Theodor Adorno-Wiesengrund) was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in Frankfurt on 11 September 1903, the only child of Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865–1952) and Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946). His mother, a Catholic from Corsica, was once a professional singer, while his father, an assimilated Jew who had converted to Protestantism, ran a successful wine-export business. Proud of her origins, Maria wanted her son&#x27;s paternal surname to be supplemented by the addition of her name, Adorno. Thus his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno. Upon his application for US citizenship, his name was modified to Theodor W. Adorno.

His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt. Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist. He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by Beethoven on the piano by the time he was twelve.

At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren Middle School, before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gymnasium, where he studied from 1913 to 1921. Before his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of György Lukács&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of the Novel&quot; that year, as well as by his fascination with Ernst Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Utopia&quot;, of which he would later write:
Adorno&#x27;s intellectual nonconformism was also shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism that swept through the Reich during the First World War. Along with future collaborators Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, and Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany&#x27;s intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them Max Weber, Max Scheler, Georg Simmel, as well as his friend Siegfried Kracauer—came out in support of the war. The younger generation&#x27;s distrust for traditional knowledge arose from how this tradition had discredited itself. Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund&#x27;s firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin. The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved into the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she became acquainted with Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, and Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s. After fourteen years, Gretel Karplus and Adorno were married in 1937.

At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, Schreker, Stravinsky, Bartók, Busoni, Delius, and Hindemith—but also began studying music composition at the Hoch Conservatory while taking private lessons with well-respected composers Bernhard Sekles and Eduard Jung. At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;″s literary editor, of whom he would later write:
Leaving grammar school to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to Hegel and Kierkegaard, and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the &quot;Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, the &quot;Neue Blätter für Kunst und Literatur&quot; and later for the &quot;&quot;. In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which in 1923 he called a &quot;dismal Bohemian prank&quot;. In these early writings he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances that either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence that Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible. &quot;No cathedral&quot;, he wrote, &quot;can be built if no community desires one.&quot; In the summer of 1924 Adorno received his doctorate with a study of Edmund Husserl under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius. Before his graduation, Adorno had already met his most important intellectual collaborators, Horkheimer and Benjamin. It was through Cornelius&#x27;s seminars that Adorno met Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to Friedrich Pollock.

===Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin===

During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer Alban Berg&#x27;s Three Fragments from &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg, and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna. Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture that had grown up around Schoenberg. In addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with Eduard Steuermann and befriended the violinist Rudolf Kolisch. In Vienna he and Berg attended public lectures by the satirist Karl Kraus, and he met Lukács, who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Berg, whom Adorno called &quot;my master and teacher&quot;, was among the most prescient of his young pupil&#x27;s early friends:
After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist Alfred Sohn-Rethel, with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt. In December 1926 Adorno&#x27;s Two Pieces for string quartet, Op. 2, was performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the habilitation. After writing the Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique, as well as songs later integrated into the Six Bagatelles for voice and piano, Op. 6, Adorno presented his habilitation manuscript, &quot;The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche&quot; (&quot;Der Begriff des Unbewußten in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre&quot;), to Cornelius in November 1927. Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application because the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking. In the manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the unconscious as it emerged from Freud&#x27;s early writings. Against the function of the unconscious in both Nietzsche and Spengler, Adorno argued that Freud&#x27;s notion of the unconscious serves as a &quot;sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature.&quot; Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition. In addition to publishing numerous reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno&#x27;s Four Songs for medium voice and piano, Op. 3, was performed in Berlin in January 1929. Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the &quot;Musikblätter des Anbruch&quot;. In a proposal for transforming the journal, he sought to use &quot;Anbruch&quot; to champion radical modern music against what he called the &quot;stabilized music&quot; of Pfitzner, the later Richard Strauss, as well as the neoclassicism of Stravinsky and Hindemith. During this period he published the essays &quot;Night Music&quot;, &quot;On Twelve-Tone Technique&quot; and &quot;Reaction and Progress&quot;. Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced. According to Adorno, twelve-tone technique&#x27;s use of atonality can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can tonality be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.

At this time Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer Ernst Krenek, discussing problems of atonality and the twelve-tone technique. In a 1934 letter, he sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:
At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929, he accepted Paul Tillich&#x27;s offer to present a habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title &quot;The Construction of the Aesthetic&quot;. At the time, Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel&#x27;s philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;inwardness&quot;, and &quot;leap&quot;—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard&#x27;s overcoming of Hegel&#x27;s idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favorable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the university conferred on Adorno the &quot;venia legendi&quot; in February 1931. On the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.

Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the Institute for Social Research, an independent organization that had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar Leo Löwenthal, social psychologist Erich Fromm, and philosopher Herbert Marcuse, sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture &quot;The Actuality of Philosophy&quot; created a scandal. In it Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier but challenged philosophy&#x27;s very capacity for comprehending reality as such: &quot;For the mind&quot;, Adorno announced, &quot;is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality.&quot; In line with Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of German Tragic Drama&quot; and preliminary sketches of the Arcades Project, Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments that should be conducted &quot;until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish.&quot; Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might &quot;construct keys before which reality springs open.&quot;

Following Horkheimer&#x27;s taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot;, was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not an Institute member, the journal published many of his essays, including &quot;The Social Situation of Music&quot; (1932), &quot;On Jazz&quot; (1936), &quot;On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening&quot; (1938), and &quot;Fragments on Wagner&quot; (1938). In his new role as a social theorist, Adorno&#x27;s philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of historical materialism, as concepts like reification, false consciousness, and ideology came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the institute, Karl Mannheim, as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like &quot;musical material&quot;—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of &quot;value-free&quot; sociology in favor of a form of ideology critique that held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in the autumn of 1934, Adorno began work on a &quot;Singspiel&quot; based on Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; titled &quot;The Treasure of Indian Joe&quot;, which he never completed. By the time he fled Hitler&#x27;s Germany Adorno had already written over 100 opera or concert reviews and 50 critiques of music composition.

As the Nazi party became the largest party in the Reichstag, Horkheimer&#x27;s 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: &quot;Only one thing is certain&quot;, he wrote, &quot;the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility.&quot; In September Adorno&#x27;s right to teach was revoked. In March, as the swastika was run up the flagpole of the town hall, the Frankfurt criminal police searched the Institute&#x27;s offices. Adorno&#x27;s house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to &quot;persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood. As a &quot;non-Aryan&quot;, he was informed, &quot;you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation.&quot; Soon afterward Adorno was forced into 15 years of exile.

===Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles===
After the possibility of transferring his habilitation to the University of Vienna came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father&#x27;s suggestion. With the help of the Academic Assistance Council, Adorno registered as an advanced student at Merton College, Oxford, in June 1934. During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin. Under the direction of Gilbert Ryle, Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of Husserl&#x27;s epistemology. By this time, the Institute for Social Research had relocated to New York City and begun making overtures to Adorno. After months of strained relations, Horkheimer and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris. Adorno continued writing on music, publishing, &quot;The Form of the Phonograph Record&quot; and &quot;Crisis of Music Criticism&quot; in the Viennese musical journal &quot;23&quot;, &quot;On Jazz&quot; in the institute&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;, &quot;Farewell to Jazz&quot; in &quot;Europäische Revue&quot;. But Adorno&#x27;s attempts to break out of the sociology of music were twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;. Impressed by Horkheimer&#x27;s book of aphorisms, &quot;Dawn and Decline&quot;, Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, which later became &quot;Minima Moralia&quot;. While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, and Berg died in December of the same year. To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing Berg&#x27;s unfinished opera Lulu.

At this time Adorno was in intense correspondence with Walter Benjamin about the latter&#x27;s &quot;Arcades Project&quot;. After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on 9 June 1937 and stayed for two weeks. While he was in New York, Horkheimer&#x27;s essays &quot;The Latest Attack on Metaphysics&quot; and &quot;Traditional and Critical Theory&quot;, which would soon become instructive for the institute&#x27;s self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion. Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on 8 September 1937. A little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take with the Princeton Radio Project, then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld. Yet Adorno&#x27;s work continued with studies of Beethoven and Richard Wagner (published in 1939 as &quot;Fragments on Wagner&quot;), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera. According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for &quot;the precision of their materialist deciphering&quot; as well as the way in which &quot;musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me.&quot; In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;—man&#x27;s domination of nature—first emerges. Adorno sailed for New York on 16 February 1938. Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in Newark, New Jersey, to discuss the Project&#x27;s plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.

Although he was expected to embed the Project&#x27;s research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with data collection to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment: &quot;I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it.&quot; Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project&#x27;s topic, &quot;Music in Radio.&quot; Adorno was primarily interested in how musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. &quot;The meaning of a Beethoven symphony&quot;, he wrote, &quot;heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert hall where people sit as if they were in church.&quot; In essays published by the institute&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;, Adorno dealt with the atrophy of musical culture that had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—toward conformism, trivialization, and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno&#x27;s studies found little resonance among members of the Project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was prolific, publishing &quot;The Radio Symphony&quot;, &quot;A Social Critique of Radio Music&quot;, and &quot;On Popular Music&quot;, texts that, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are found in Robert Hullot-Kentor&#x27;s translation, &quot;Current of Music&quot;. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.

In addition to helping with the &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;, Adorno was expected to be the institute&#x27;s liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of Charles Baudelaire he hoped would serve as a model of the larger &quot;Arcades Project&quot;. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks that had become manifest through Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility&quot;. At around the same time, Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on &quot;dialectical logic&quot;, which would later become &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno&#x27;s parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in Colombes, they entertained few delusions about their work&#x27;s practical effects. &quot;In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe&quot;, Horkheimer wrote, &quot;our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle.&quot; As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Kierkegaard&#x27;s doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported Franz Leopold Neumann&#x27;s thesis according to which National Socialism was a form of &quot;monopoly capitalism&quot;; on the other were those who supported Friedrich Pollock&#x27;s &quot;state capitalist theory.&quot; Horkheimer&#x27;s contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays &quot;The Authoritarian State&quot;, &quot;The End of Reason&quot;, and &quot;The Jews and Europe&quot;, served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.

In November 1941 Adorno followed Horkheimer to what Thomas Mann called &quot;German California&quot;, setting up house in a Pacific Palisades neighborhood of German émigrés that included Bertolt Brecht and Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with a draft of his &quot;Philosophy of New Music&quot;, a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music that Adorno felt, while writing it, was a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer&#x27;s reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: &quot;If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion&quot;, he wrote after reading the manuscript. The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as &quot;Philosophical Fragments&quot;, the text waited another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;, by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This &quot;reflection on the destructive aspect of progress&quot; proceeded through the chapters that treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the Marquis de Sade, as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.

With their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the Nevitt Sanford-led Public Opinion Study Group and the American Jewish Committee. In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas. Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, &quot;simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today&#x27;s standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity&quot;. The result of these labors, the 1950 study &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot;, was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the F-scale personality test.

After the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the émigrés, now classed &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, became increasingly restricted. Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and from going more than five miles from their houses, émigrés like Adorno, who was not naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements.

In addition to the aphorisms that conclude &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;, Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer&#x27;s 50th birthday that was later published as &quot;Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life&quot;. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling, and the impossibility of love. In California Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, films&#x27; visual aspects. Adorno also assisted Thomas Mann with his novel &quot;Doktor Faustus&quot; after the latter asked for his help. &quot;Would you be willing&quot;, Mann wrote, &quot;to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn&#x27;s work—might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?&quot;

At the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot; was being published. Before his return, Adorno had reached an agreement with a Tübingen publisher to print an expanded version of &quot;Philosophy of New Music&quot; and completed two compositions: &quot;Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op.7&quot;, and &quot;Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor Däubler, op. 8&quot;.

===Postwar Europe===
====Return to Frankfurt University====
Upon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at Frankfurt University, critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival, with seminars on &quot;Kant&#x27;s Transcendental Dialectic&quot;, aesthetics, Hegel, &quot;Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge&quot;, and &quot;The Concept of Knowledge&quot;. Adorno&#x27;s surprise at his students&#x27; passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler&#x27;s rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened, holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno&#x27;s students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of Max Frisch, culture had become an &quot;alibi&quot; for the absence of political consciousness. Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as &quot;The Frankfurt School&quot; were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.

====Essays on fascism====
Starting with his 1947 essay &quot;Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler&quot;, Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits. One of these works was &quot;The Authoritarian Personality&quot; (1950), published as a contribution to the &quot;Studies in Prejudice&quot; performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of &#x27;qualitative interpretations&#x27; that uncovered the authoritarian character of test persons through indirect questions. The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated. In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay &quot;Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda&quot;, in which he said that &quot;Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest.&quot;

In 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans. He then published two influential essays, &quot;The Meaning of Working Through the Past&quot; (1959) and &quot;Education after Auschwitz&quot; (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated National Socialism in the mindsets and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could rise again. Later on, however, Jean Améry—who had been tortured at Auschwitz—would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom &quot;absolute negativity&quot; (&quot;absolute Negativität&quot;), using a language intoxicated by itself (&quot;von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entzückte Sprache&quot;).

====Public events====
In September 1951 Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met Leo Löwenthal and Herbert Marcuse in New York, and saw his mother for the last time. After stopping in Paris, where he met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Michel Leiris, and René Leibowitz, Adorno delivered a lecture entitled &quot;The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany&quot; at a conference on opinion research. Here he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would &quot;raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness.&quot;

With Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the institute&#x27;s work fell upon Adorno. At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of Ernst Krenek&#x27;s opera &quot;Leben des Orest&quot;, and a seminar on &quot;Criteria of New Music&quot; at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein. Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of Peter Suhrkamp, inducing the latter to publish Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Childhood Around 1900&quot;, Kracauer&#x27;s writings and a two-volume edition of Benjamin&#x27;s writings. Adorno&#x27;s own recently published &quot;Minima Moralia&quot; was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:

Yet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of Heinrich Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Professor Unrat&quot; with its film title, &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting; and, penning a defense of prostitutes.

====More essays on mass culture and literature====
Because Adorno&#x27;s American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to Santa Monica to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation. While there he wrote a content analysis of newspaper horoscopes (now collected in &quot;The Stars Down to Earth&quot;), and the essays &quot;Television as Ideology&quot; and &quot;Prologue to Television&quot;; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute.

Back in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed three essays: &quot;Notes on Kafka&quot;, &quot;Valéry Proust Museum&quot;, and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer&#x27;s death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection &quot;Prisms&quot;. In response to the publication of Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal &quot;Akzente&quot;. A second collection of essays, &quot;Notes to Literature&quot;, appeared in 1958. After meeting Samuel Beckett while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on &quot;Trying to Understand Endgame&quot;, which, along with studies of Proust, Valéry, and Balzac, formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his &quot;Notes to Literature&quot;. Adorno&#x27;s entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the Hölderlin Society. At the Philosophers&#x27; Conference of October 1962 in Münster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was &quot;A writer among bureaucrats&quot;, Adorno presented &quot;Progress&quot;.

Although the &quot;Zeitschrift&quot; was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including &quot;Sociologica&quot; (1955), a collection of essays, &quot;Gruppenexperiment&quot; (1955), &quot;Betriebsklima&quot;, a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann, and &quot;Soziologische Exkurse&quot;, a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.

====Public figure====
Throughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a public figure, not simply through his books and essays, but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers. In talks, interviews, and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio, and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as &quot;The Administered World&quot; (September 1950), &quot;What is the Meaning of &#x27;Working Through the Past?&quot;&#x27; (February 1960), and &quot;The Teaching Profession and its Taboos&quot; (August 1965). Additionally, he frequently wrote for &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot;, and the weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot;.

At the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called Darmstadt school, which included composers like Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Karel Goeyvaerts, Luciano Berio, and Gottfried Michael Koenig, soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno&#x27;s 1954 lecture, &quot;The Aging of the New Music&quot;, where he argued that atonality&#x27;s freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend Eduard Steuermann, Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published &quot;Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy&quot; in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a &quot;musique informelle&quot;, which would possess the ability &quot;really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end.&quot;

====Post-war German culture====
At the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. Adorno&#x27;s 1949 dictum—&quot;To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric&quot;—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;, for example, he wrote that &quot;Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream&quot;; while in &quot;Commitment&quot;, he wrote in 1962 that the dictum &quot;expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature&quot;—was part of post-war Germany&#x27;s struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger as well as the film-maker Alexander Kluge.

In 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on &quot;Max Weber and Sociology&quot; and, in 1968, on &quot;Late Capitalism or Industrial Society&quot;. A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and Karl Popper, later published as the &quot;Positivist Dispute in German Sociology&quot;, arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin.

Adorno&#x27;s critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like Karl Jaspers and Otto Friedrich Bollnow, and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse. His 1964 publication of &quot;The Jargon of Authenticity&quot; took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like &quot;angst&quot;, &quot;decision&quot;, and &quot;leap&quot;. After seven years of work, Adorno completed &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot; in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967–68, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter. Among the students at these seminars were the Americans Angela Davis and Irving Wohlfarth. One objection, which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned &quot;with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself.&quot;

====Confrontations with students====
At the time of &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;″ publication, student protests fragilized West German democracy. Trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran&#x27;s 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam, and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the emergency laws, as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the &quot;world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz&quot;. The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of Benno Ohnesorg at a protest against the Shah&#x27;s visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno&#x27;s lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute&#x27;s relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students&#x27; ire. At the invitation of Péter Szondi, Adorno was invited to the Free University of Berlin to give a lecture on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Iphigenie in Tauris&quot;. After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read &quot;Berlin&#x27;s left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist&quot;, a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favor of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (SDS) and discussed &quot;Student Unrest&quot; with Szondi on West German Radio. But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students&#x27; disruptions to university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine &quot;alternative&quot;, which, following the lead of Hannah Arendt&#x27;s articles in &quot;Merkur&quot;, claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Writings&quot; and &quot;Letters&quot; with a great deal of bias. In response, Benjamin&#x27;s longtime friend Gershom Scholem, wrote to the editor of &quot;Merkur&quot; to express his disapproval of the &quot;in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful&quot; remarks by Arendt.

Relations between students and the West German state continued deteriorating. In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, Rudi Dutschke, was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the Springer Press, which had led a campaign to vilify the students. An open appeal published in &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press&#x27; manipulation of public opinion. At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician. Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students&#x27; actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation. The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is &quot;ridiculous against those who administer the bomb.&quot; Adorno would refer to the radical students as &quot;stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung) in jeans.&quot;

In September 1968 Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of &quot;Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link&quot;. Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: &quot;Valid student claims and dubious actions&quot;, he wrote to Marcuse, &quot;are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more.&quot; After striking students threatened to strip the Institute&#x27;s sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building.

====Later years====
Adorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled &quot;Charmed Language&quot;, delivered in Zürich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again. Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on &quot;Aesthetic Theory&quot;. In June 1969 he completed &quot;Catchwords: Critical Models&quot;. During the winter semester of 1968–69 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics.

For the summer semester Adorno planned a lecture course entitled &quot;An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking&quot;, as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object. But at the first lecture, Adorno&#x27;s attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled. After a student wrote on the blackboard &quot;If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease&quot;, three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head. Yet Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement which would have only strengthened the conservative thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno&#x27;s teaching. After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno cancelled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar. In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to Zermatt, Switzerland, at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength. On 6 August he died of a heart attack.

==Intellectual influences==
Like most theorists of the Frankfurt School, Adorno was influenced by the works of Hegel, Marx, and Freud. Their major theories fascinated many left-wing intellectuals in the first half of the 20th century. Lorenz Jäger speaks critically of Adorno&#x27;s &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; in his political biography: that Adorno placed &quot;almost unlimited trust in finished teachings, in Marxism, psychoanalysis, and the teachings of the Second Viennese School.&quot;

===Hegel===
Adorno&#x27;s adoption of Hegelian philosophy can be traced back to his inaugural lecture in 1931, in which he postulated, &quot;only dialectically does philosophical interpretation seem possible to me&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; 1: 338). Hegel rejected the idea of separating methods and content, because thinking is always thinking of something; dialectics for him is &quot;the comprehended movement of the object itself.&quot; Like , Adorno adopted this claim as his own, and based his thinking on one of the Hegelian basic categories, determinate negation, according to which something is not abstractly negated and dissolved into zero, but is preserved in a new, richer concept through its opposite.

Adorno understood his &quot;Three Studies of Hegel&quot; as &quot;preparation of a changed definition of dialectics&quot; and that they stop &quot;where the start should be&quot; (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; 5: 249 f.). Adorno dedicated himself to this task in one of his later major works, the &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot; (1966). The title expresses &quot;tradition and rebellion in equal measure.&quot; Drawing from Hegelian reason&#x27;s speculative dialectic, Adorno developed his own &quot;negative&quot; dialectic of the &quot;non-identical&quot;.

=== Karl Marx ===
Marx&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Political Economy&quot; clearly shaped Adorno&#x27;s thinking. As described by Jürgen Habermas, Marxist critique is, for Adorno, a &quot;silent orthodoxy, whose categories [are revealed] in Adorno&#x27;s cultural critique, although their influence is not explicitly named.&quot; Marx&#x27;s influence on Adorno first came by way of György Lukács&#x27;s &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot; (&quot;Geschichte und Klassenbewußtsein&quot;). From this text, Adorno took the Marxist categories of commodity fetishism and reification. These are closely related to Adorno&#x27;s concept of trade, which stands in the center of his philosophy, not exclusively restricted to economic theory. Adorno&#x27;s &quot;exchange society&quot; (), with its &quot;insatiable and destructive appetite for expansion&quot;, is easily decoded as a description of capitalism. Furthermore, the Marxist concept of ideology is central for Adorno.

Class theory, which appears less frequently in Adorno&#x27;s work, also has its origins in Marxist thinking. Adorno made explicit reference to class in two of his texts: the first, the subchapter &quot;Classes and Strata&quot; (&quot;Klassen und Schichten&quot;), from his &quot;Introduction to the Sociology of Music&quot;; the second, an unpublished 1942 essay, &quot;Reflections on Class Theory&quot;, published postmortem in his &quot;Collected Works&quot;.

=== Sigmund Freud ===
Psychoanalysis is a constitutive element of critical theory. Adorno read Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work early on, although, unlike Horkheimer, he never underwent analysis. He first read Freud while working on his initial (withdrawn) habilitation thesis, &quot;The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of Mind&quot; (1927). In it Adorno argued that &quot;the healing of all neuroses is synonymous with the complete understanding of the meaning of their symptoms by the patient&quot;. In his essay &quot;On the Relationship between Sociology and Psychology&quot; (1955), he justified the need to &quot;supplement the theory of society with psychology, especially analytically oriented social psychology&quot; in the face of fascism. Adorno emphasized the necessity of researching prevailing psychological drives in order to explain the cohesion of a repressive society acting against fundamental human interests.

Adorno always remained a supporter and defender of Freudian orthodox doctrine, &quot;psychoanalysis in its strict form&quot;. From this position, he attacked Erich Fromm and later Karen Horney because of their revisionism. He expressed reservations about sociologized psychoanalysis as well as about its reduction to a therapeutic procedure.

==Theory==
Adorno&#x27;s work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither Picasso&#x27;s fascination with African sculpture nor Mondrian&#x27;s reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with primitivism, which Adorno shared with the century&#x27;s most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation, and accelerating commodification, sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society&#x27;s self-preservation had become indistinguishable from socially sanctioned self-sacrifice: of &quot;primitive&quot; peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno&#x27;s theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality that seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno&#x27;s writings on politics, philosophy, music, and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno&#x27;s translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno&#x27;s work thus consists in determining &quot;how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation&quot;. In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;, is nothing but &quot;the law of doom thus far obeyed by history.&quot; At its most basic, Adorno&#x27;s thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.

Adorno was chiefly influenced by Max Weber&#x27;s critique of disenchantment, György Lukács&#x27;s Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, and Walter Benjamin&#x27;s philosophy of history. Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed. As he put it at the beginning of his &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot; (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realize it was missed. Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness. Adorno, as well as Horkheimer, critiqued all forms of positivism as responsible for technocracy and disenchantment and sought to produce a theory that both rejected positivism and avoided reinstating traditional metaphysics. Adorno and Horkheimer have been criticized for over-applying the term &quot;positivism&quot;, especially in their interpretations of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper as positivists.

===Music and the Culture Industry===
Adorno criticized jazz and popular music, viewing it as part of the culture industry, that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; and &quot;agreeable&quot;.

In his early essays for the Vienna-based journal &quot;Anbruch&quot;, Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer&#x27;s ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what he called the &quot;musical material&quot;. For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition. The objective validity of composition, according to him, rests with neither the composer&#x27;s genius nor the work&#x27;s conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material. In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material&#x27;s liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony. Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who &quot;submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads.&quot; Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn. In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique that dictated the rules of composition.

Adorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. &quot;Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them.&quot; The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that &quot;the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods&quot;, but this is concealed under &quot;the manipulation of taste and the official culture&#x27;s pretense of individualism&quot;. By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual&#x27;s personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive &quot;add-ons&quot; in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as &quot;pseudo-individualisation&quot; and the &quot;always-the-same&quot;.

Adorno&#x27;s analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left that balanced the critique of popular culture from the right. From both perspectives—left and right—the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture. However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem, not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, for instance, as a form of reverse psychology. Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today&#x27;s society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past (Auschwitz), morals, or the Culture Industry. The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in cultural studies. Many of Adorno&#x27;s reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated. A collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as &quot;Essays on Music&quot;.

Adorno&#x27;s work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of &quot;negative dialectics&quot;, set out especially in his book of that title. A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, that is, of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. Adorno&#x27;s &quot;negative dialectics&quot; was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject&#x27;s concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticize arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection.

Adorno&#x27;s reputation as a musicologist remains controversial. His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favor. The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be &quot;preposterously over-rated.&quot; The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno&#x27;s book &quot;The Philosophy of New Music&quot; as &quot;largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study.&quot; Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno&#x27;s writings as containing &quot;some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz&quot;. The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing &quot;reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a &#x27;fetishized&#x27; commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.&quot; Irritation with Adorno&#x27;s tunnel vision started even while he was alive. He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: &quot;I have never been able to bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky.&quot; Another composer, Luciano Berio said, in interview, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to completely refute anything that Adorno writes – he was, after all, one of the most acute, and also one of the most negative intellects to excavate the creativity of the past 150 years... He forgets that one of the most cunning and interesting aspects of consumer music, the mass media, and indeed of capitalism itself, is their fluidity, their unending capacity for adaptation and assimilation.&quot;

On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Wagner&quot;, in which Žižek attributes an &quot;emancipatory impulse&quot; to the same book—although Žižek also suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands &quot;a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno&#x27;s Wagner study&quot;.

Writing in the New Yorker in 2014, music critic Alex Ross, argued that Adorno&#x27;s work has a renewed importance in the digital age: &quot;The pop hegemony is all but complete, its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons ... Culture appears more monolithic than ever, with a few gigantic corporations—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon—presiding over unprecedented monopolies&quot;.

Adorno&#x27;s critique of commercial media capitalism continues to be influential. There is much scholarship influenced by Adorno on how Western entertainment industries strengthen transnational capitalism and reinforce a Western cultural dominance. Adornean critique can be found in works such as Tanner Mirrlees&#x27; &quot;The US Empire&#x27;s Culture Industry&quot; which focus upon how Western commercial entertainment is artificially reinforced by transnational media corporations rather than being a local culture.

==== The five components of recognition ====
Adorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognition into its different components. All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality. Adorno&#x27;s scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recognition:
# Vague remembrance 
# Actual identification 
# Subsumption by label 
# Self-reflection and act of recognition 
# Psychological transfer of recognition-authority to the object

===Marxist criticisms===
Adorno posits social totality as an automatic system. According to Horst Müller&#x27;s &quot;Kritik der kritischen Theorie&quot; (&quot;Critique of Critical Theory&quot;), this assumption is consistent with Adorno&#x27;s idea of society as a self-regulating system, from which one must escape (but from which nobody &quot;can&quot; escape). For him it was existent, but inhuman. Müller argues against the existence of such a system and claims that critical theory provides no practical solution for societal change. He concludes that Jürgen Habermas, in particular, and the Frankfurt School in general, misconstrue Marx.

==Standardization==
The phenomenon of standardization is &quot;a concept used to characterize the formulaic products of capitalist-driven mass media and mass culture that appeal to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of maximum profit&quot;. According to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society which has product consumption as one of its main characteristics. Mass media is employed to deliver messages about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising. Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible.

They do this by individualizing products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them. Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today&#x27;s chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another. He makes a distinction between &quot;Apologetic music&quot; and &quot;Critical music&quot;. Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the &quot;pop music&quot; industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs. &quot;The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement&quot; &quot;to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures.&quot;

Serious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The example he gives is that of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies: &quot;[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole.&quot;

Standardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well. Many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising. Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by a media system that takes advantage of musical hooks mass produced via electronic media. The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization far more widespread. Not recognizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm: &quot;During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves.&quot;

Tony Waters and David Philhour have tested Adorno&#x27;s ideas and used musical intros from pop songs, and asked students in the United States, Germany, and Thailand what they recognize. They found that indeed, as Adorno hypothesized, the song intro recognition has spread around the world for some specific commercial pop songs. But they also demonstrate that there are still national differences in recognition. 

===Adorno&#x27;s responses to his critics===
As a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured Bourdieu&#x27;s ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.

==Adorno&#x27;s sociological methods==
Adorno believed that the language the sociologist uses, like the language of the ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures. He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the &quot;facts&quot; discovered ... including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno&#x27;s return from the US, and reprinted in the &quot;Critical Models&quot; essays collection, Adorno praised the egalitarianism and openness of US society based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: &quot;Characteristic for the life in America [...] is a moment of peacefulness, kindness and generosity&quot;.

One example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno&#x27;s methods can be found in Paul Lazarsfeld, the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler. As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in &quot;The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance&quot; (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of RCA), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their &quot;taste&quot;, so that RCA could profitably air more classical music. Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno&#x27;s &quot;lack of discipline in ... presentation&quot;.

Adorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:

==Adorno translated into English==
While even German readers can find Adorno&#x27;s work difficult to understand, an additional problem for English readers is that his German idiom is particularly difficult to translate into English. A similar difficulty of translation is true of Hegel, Heidegger, and a number of other German philosophers and poets. As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness. In recent years, Edmund Jephcott and Stanford University Press have published new translations of some of Adorno&#x27;s lectures and books, including &quot;Introduction to Sociology&quot;, &quot;Problems of Moral Philosophy&quot;, his transcribed lectures on Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, and a new translation of the &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;. Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno&#x27;s works such as &quot;The Meaning of Working Through the Past.&quot; A new translation has also appeared of &quot;Aesthetic Theory&quot; and the &quot;Philosophy of New Music&quot; by Robert Hullot-Kentor, from the University of Minnesota Press. Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;. Adorno&#x27;s correspondence with Alban Berg, &quot;Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction&quot;, and the letters to Adorno&#x27;s parents, have been translated by Wieland Hoban and published by Polity Press. These fresh translations are slightly less literal in their rendering of German sentences and words, and are more accessible to English readers. The Group Experiment, which had been unavailable to English readers, is now available in an accessible translation by Jeffrey K. Olick and Andrew J. Perrin on Harvard University Press, along with introductory material explaining its relation to the rest of Adorno&#x27;s work and 20th-century public opinion research.

<doc id="30393" wikidata="Q834023" url="?curid=30393" title="Thermophile">
<text>A thermophile is a type of extremophile that thrives at relatively high temperatures, between . Many thermophiles are archaea, though some of them are bacteria and fungi. Thermophilic eubacteria are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.

Thermophiles are found in geothermally heated regions of the Earth, such as hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park and deep sea hydrothermal vents, as well as decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost. They can survive at high temperatures, whereas other bacteria or archaea would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures.

The enzymes in thermophiles function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in molecular biology, for example the &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase used in PCR. &quot;Thermophile&quot; is derived from the (&quot;thermotita&quot;), meaning heat, and (&quot;philia&quot;), love.

Comparative surveys suggest that thermophile diversity is principally driven by pH, not temperature.

==Classification==
Thermophiles can be classified in various ways. One classification sorts these organisms according to their optimal growth temperatures:
# Simple thermophiles: 
# Extreme thermophiles 
# Hyperthermophiles and beyond, but not below 

In a related classification, thermophiles are sorted as follows:
# Facultative thermophiles (also called moderate thermophiles) can thrive at high temperatures, but also at lower temperatures (below ), whereas
# Obligate thermophiles (also called extreme thermophiles) require such high temperatures for growth.
# Hyperthermophiles are particularly extreme thermophiles for which the optimal temperatures are above .

Many hyperthermophilic Archaea require elemental sulfur for growth. Some are anaerobes that use the sulfur instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor during anaerobic cellular respiration. Some are lithotrophs that oxidize sulphur to create sulfuric acid as an energy source, thus requiring the microorganism to be adapted to very low pH (i.e., it is an acidophile as well as thermophile). These organisms are inhabitants of hot, sulfur-rich environments usually associated with volcanism, such as hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles. In these places, especially in Yellowstone National Park, of microorganisms according to their temperature optima occurs. These organisms are often colored, due to the presence of photosynthetic pigments.

==Thermophile versus mesophile==
Thermophiles can be discriminated from mesophiles from genomic features. For example, the GC-content levels in the coding regions of some signature genes were consistently identified as correlated with the temperature range condition when the association analysis was applied to mesophilic and thermophilic organisms regardless of their phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity, or habitat conditions.

== Fungal thermophiles ==
Fungi are the only group of organisms in the Eukaryota domain that can survive at temperature ranges of 50–60 °C. Thermophilic fungi have been reported from a number of habitats, with most of them belonging to the fungal order Sordariales. Thermophilic fungi have great biotechnological potential due to their ability to produce industrial-relevant thermostable enzymes, in particular for the degradation of plant biomass.

== Gene transfer and genetic exchange ==

&quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot; and &quot;Sulfolobus acidocaldarius&quot; are hyperthermophilic Archaea. When these organisms are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. In &quot;S. acidocaldarius&quot;, UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency. Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al.(2011) hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. Van Wolferen et al., in discussing DNA exchange in the hyperthermophiles under extreme conditions, noted that DNA exchange likely plays a role in repair of DNA via homologous recombination. They suggested that this process is crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperature. Also it has been suggested that DNA transfer in &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are associated with species-specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.

<doc id="30395" wikidata="Q1509" url="?curid=30395" title="Tennessee">
<text>Tennessee (, ) is a landlocked state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Kentucky to the north, Virginia to the northeast, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, Arkansas to the southwest, and Missouri to the northwest. Tennessee is the 36th-largest by area and the 15th-most populous of the 50 states. According to the United States Census Bureau, the state&#x27;s estimated population as of 2024 is 7.22 million.

Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions of East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Nashville is the state&#x27;s capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. Tennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of Appalachia, the Upland South, and the Deep South. The Blue Ridge Mountains along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the Cumberland Plateau contains many scenic valleys and waterfalls. The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. The state is twice bisected by the Tennessee River, and the Mississippi River forms its western border. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the nation&#x27;s most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.

Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association, a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachian Mountains. Its name derives from (), a Cherokee town preceding the first European American settlement. Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the Southwest Territory, before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. It earned the nickname &quot;The Volunteer State&quot; due to a strong tradition of military service. A slave state until the American Civil War, Tennessee was politically divided, with most of its western and middle parts supporting the Confederacy, and most of the eastern region harboring pro-Union sentiment. As a result, Tennessee was the last state to officially secede from the Union and join the Confederacy, and the first former Confederate state readmitted to the Union after the war had ended during the Reconstruction era.

During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the city of Oak Ridge, which was established during World War II to house the Manhattan Project&#x27;s uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the world&#x27;s first atomic bombs. After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became a key center of scientific research. The state&#x27;s economy is dominated by the health care, music, finance, automotive, chemical, electronics, and tourism sectors, and cattle, soybeans, poultry, corn, and cotton are its primary agricultural products. Tennessee has played a major role in the development of many forms of popular music, including country, blues, rock and roll, soul, and gospel.

==Etymology==

Tennessee derives its name most directly from the Cherokee town of Tanasi (or &quot;Tanase&quot;, in syllabary: ᏔᎾᏏ) in present-day Monroe County, Tennessee, on the Tanasi River, now known as the Little Tennessee River. In 1567, Spanish explorer Captain Juan Pardo and his party encountered a Native American village named &quot;Tanasqui&quot; in the area while traveling inland from modern-day South Carolina; however, it is unknown if this was the same settlement as Tanasi. The town appeared on British maps as early as 1725. Recent research suggests that the Cherokees adapted the name from the Yuchi word &quot;Tana-tsee-dgee&quot;, meaning &quot;brother-waters-place&quot; or &quot;where-the-waters-meet&quot;. The modern spelling, &quot;Tennessee&quot;, is attributed to Governor James Glen of South Carolina, who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s. In 1788, North Carolina created &quot;Tennessee County&quot;, and in 1796, a constitutional convention, organizing the new state out of the Southwest Territory, adopted &quot;Tennessee&quot; as the state&#x27;s name.

==History==
===Pre-European era===
The first inhabitants of Tennessee were Paleo-Indians who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Last Glacial Period. Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age hunter-gatherers, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with game animals such as mastodons. The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the Archaic (8000–1000 BC), Woodland (1000 BC–1000 AD), and Mississippian (1000–1600 AD) periods. The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as squash, corn, gourds, and sunflowers were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period. Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds. Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized chiefdoms and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state.

Spanish conquistadors who explored the region in the 16th century encountered some of the Mississippian peoples, including the Muscogee Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee. By the early 18th century, most Natives in Tennessee had disappeared, most likely wiped out by diseases introduced by the Spaniards. The Cherokee began migrating into what is now eastern Tennessee from what is now Virginia in the latter 17th century, possibly to escape expanding European settlement and diseases in the north. They forced the Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee out of the state in the early 18th century. The Chickasaw remained confined to West Tennessee, and the middle part of the state contained few Native Americans, although both the Cherokee and the Shawnee claimed the region as their hunting ground. Cherokee peoples in Tennessee were known by European settlers as the Overhill Cherokee because they lived west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Overhill settlements grew along the rivers in East Tennessee in the early 18th century.

===Exploration and colonization===

The first recorded European expeditions into what is now Tennessee were led by Spanish explorers Hernando de Soto in 1540–1541, Tristan de Luna in 1559, and Juan Pardo in 1566–1567. In 1673, English fur trader Abraham Wood sent an expedition from the Colony of Virginia into Overhill Cherokee territory in modern-day northeastern Tennessee. That same year, a French expedition led by missionary Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Mississippi River and became the first Europeans to map the Mississippi Valley. In 1682, an expedition led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle constructed Fort Prudhomme on the Chickasaw Bluffs in West Tennessee. By the late 17th century, French traders began to explore the Cumberland River valley, and in 1714, under Charles Charleville&#x27;s command, established French Lick, a fur trading settlement at the present location of Nashville near the Cumberland River. In 1739, the French constructed Fort Assumption under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville on the Mississippi River at the present location of Memphis, which they used as a base against the Chickasaw during the 1739 Campaign of the Chickasaw Wars.
In the 1750s and 1760s, longhunters from Virginia explored much of East and Middle Tennessee. Settlers from the Colony of South Carolina built Fort Loudoun on the Little Tennessee River in 1756, the first British settlement in what is now Tennessee and the westernmost British outpost to that date. Hostilities erupted between the British and the Cherokees into an armed conflict, and a siege of the fort ended with its surrender in 1760. After the French and Indian War, Britain issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains in an effort to mitigate conflicts with the Natives. But migration across the mountains continued, and the first permanent European settlers began arriving in northeastern Tennessee in the late 1760s. Most of them were English, but nearly 20% were Scotch-Irish. They formed the Watauga Association in 1772, a semi-autonomous representative government, and three years later reorganized themselves into the Washington District to support the cause of the American Revolutionary War. The next year, after an unsuccessful petition to Virginia, North Carolina agreed to annex the Washington District to provide protection from Native American attacks.

In 1775, Richard Henderson negotiated a series of treaties with the Cherokee to sell the lands of the Watauga settlements at Sycamore Shoals on the banks of the Watauga River. An agreement to sell land for the Transylvania Colony, which included the territory in Tennessee north of the Cumberland River, was also signed. Later that year, Daniel Boone, under Henderson&#x27;s employment, blazed a trail from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap, which became part of the Wilderness Road, a major thoroughfare into Tennessee and Kentucky. The Chickamauga, a Cherokee faction loyal to the British led by Dragging Canoe, opposed the settling of the Washington District and Transylvania Colony, and in 1776 attacked Fort Watauga at Sycamore Shoals. The warnings of Dragging Canoe&#x27;s cousin Nancy Ward spared many settlers&#x27; lives from the initial attacks. In 1779, James Robertson and John Donelson led two groups of settlers from the Washington District to the French Lick. These settlers constructed Fort Nashborough, which they named for Francis Nash, a brigadier general of the Continental Army. The next year, the settlers signed the Cumberland Compact, which established a representative government for the colony called the Cumberland Association. This settlement later grew into the city of Nashville. That same year John Sevier led a group of Overmountain Men from Fort Watauga to the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina, where they defeated the British.
Three counties of the Washington District broke off from North Carolina in 1784 and formed the State of Franklin. Efforts to obtain admission to the Union failed, and the counties, now numbering eight, rejoined North Carolina by 1788. North Carolina ceded the area to the federal government in 1790, after which it was organized into the Southwest Territory on May 26 of that year. The act allowed the territory to petition for statehood once the population reached 60,000. Administration of the territory was divided between the Washington District and the Mero District, the latter of which consisted of the Cumberland Association and was named for Spanish territorial governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró. President George Washington appointed William Blount as territorial governor. The Southwest Territory recorded a population of 35,691 in the first United States census that year, including 3,417 slaves.

===Statehood and antebellum era===
As support for statehood grew among the settlers, Governor Blount called for elections, which were held in December 1793. The 13-member territorial House of Representatives first convened in Knoxville on February 24, 1794, to select ten members for the legislature&#x27;s upper house, the council. The full legislature convened on August 25, 1794. In June 1795, the legislature conducted a census of the territory, which recorded a population of 77,263, including 10,613 slaves, and a poll that showed 6,504 in favor of statehood and 2,562 opposed. Elections for a constitutional convention were held in December 1795, and the delegates convened in Knoxville on January 17, 1796, to begin drafting a state constitution. During this convention, the name Tennessee was chosen for the new state. The constitution was completed on February 6, which authorized elections for the state&#x27;s new legislature, the Tennessee General Assembly. The legislature convened on March 28, 1796, and the next day, John Sevier was announced as the state&#x27;s first governor. Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796, as the 16th state and the first created from federal territory.

Tennessee reportedly earned the nickname &quot;The Volunteer State&quot; during the War of 1812, when 3,500 Tennesseans answered a recruitment call by the General Assembly for the war effort. These soldiers, under Andrew Jackson&#x27;s command, played a major role in the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, the last major battle of the war. Several Tennesseans took part in the Texas Revolution of 1835–36, including Governor Sam Houston and Congressman and frontiersman Davy Crockett, who was killed at the Battle of the Alamo. The state&#x27;s nickname was solidified during the Mexican–American War when President James K. Polk of Tennessee issued a call for 2,800 soldiers from the state, and more than 30,000 volunteered.
Between the 1790s and 1820s, additional land cessions were negotiated with the Cherokee, who had established a national government modeled on the U.S. Constitution. In 1818, Jackson and Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby reached an agreement with the Chickasaw to sell the land between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers to the United States, which included all of West Tennessee and became known as the &quot;Jackson Purchase&quot;. The Cherokee moved their capital from Georgia to the Red Clay Council Grounds in southeastern Tennessee in 1832, due to new laws forcing them from their previous capital at New Echota. In 1838 and 1839, U.S. troops forcibly removed thousands of Cherokees and their black slaves from their homes in southeastern Tennessee and forced them to march to Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma. This event is known as the Trail of Tears, and an estimated 4,000 died along the way.
As settlers pushed west of the Cumberland Plateau, a slavery-based agrarian economy took hold in these regions. Cotton planters used extensive slave labor on large plantation complexes in West Tennessee&#x27;s fertile and flat terrain after the Jackson Purchase. Cotton also took hold in the Nashville Basin during this time. Entrepreneurs such as Montgomery Bell used slaves in the production of iron in the Western Highland Rim, and slaves also cultivated such crops as tobacco and corn throughout the Highland Rim. East Tennessee&#x27;s geography did not allow for large plantations as in the middle and western parts of the state, and as a result, slavery became increasingly rare in the region. A strong abolition movement developed in East Tennessee, beginning as early as 1797, and in 1819, Elihu Embree of Jonesborough began publishing the &quot;Manumission Intelligencier&quot; (later &quot;The Emancipator&quot;), the nation&#x27;s first exclusively anti-slavery newspaper.
===Civil War===
At the onset of the American Civil War, most Middle and West Tennesseans favored efforts to preserve their slavery-based economies, but many Middle Tennesseans were initially skeptical of secession. In East Tennessee, most people favored remaining in the Union. In 1860, slaves composed about 25% of Tennessee&#x27;s population, the lowest share among the states that joined the Confederacy. Tennessee provided more Union troops than any other Confederate state, and the second-highest number of Confederate troops, behind Virginia. Due to its central location, Tennessee was a crucial state during the war and saw more military engagements than any state except Virginia.

After Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, secessionists in the state government led by Governor Isham Harris sought voter approval to sever ties with the United States, which was rejected in a referendum by a 54–46% margin in February 1861. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April and Lincoln&#x27;s call for troops in response, the legislature ratified an agreement to enter a military league with the Confederacy on May 7, 1861. On June 8, with Middle Tennesseans having significantly changed their position, voters approved a second referendum on secession by a 69–31% margin, becoming the last state to secede. In response, East Tennessee Unionists organized a convention in Knoxville with the goal of splitting the region to form a new state loyal to the Union. In the fall of 1861, Unionist guerrillas in East Tennessee burned bridges and attacked Confederate sympathizers, leading the Confederacy to invoke martial law in parts of the region. Because of this, many southern unionists were sent fleeing to nearby Union states, particularly the border state of Kentucky. Other southern unionists, who stayed in Tennessee after the state&#x27;s secession, either resisted the Confederate cause or eventually joined it. In March 1862, Lincoln appointed native Tennessean and War Democrat Andrew Johnson as military governor of the state.
General Ulysses S. Grant and the U.S. Navy captured the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers in February 1862 at the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. Grant then proceeded south to Pittsburg Landing and held off a Confederate counterattack at Shiloh in April in what was at the time the bloodiest battle of the war. Memphis fell to the Union in June after a naval battle on the Mississippi River. Union strength in Middle Tennessee was tested in a series of Confederate offensives beginning in the summer of 1862, which culminated in General William Rosecrans&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland routing General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee at Stones River, another one of the war&#x27;s costliest engagements. The next summer, Rosecrans&#x27;s Tullahoma campaign forced Bragg&#x27;s remaining troops in Middle Tennessee to retreat to Chattanooga with little fighting.

During the Chattanooga campaign, Confederates attempted to besiege the Army of the Cumberland into surrendering, but reinforcements from the Army of the Tennessee under the command of Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Joseph Hooker arrived. The Confederates were driven from the city at the battles of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge in November 1863. Despite Unionist sentiment in East Tennessee, Confederates held the area for most of the war. A few days after the fall of Chattanooga, Confederates led by James Longstreet unsuccessfully campaigned to take control of Knoxville by attacking Union General Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s Fort Sanders. The capture of Chattanooga allowed Sherman to launch the Atlanta campaign from the city in May 1864. The last major battles in the state came when Army of Tennessee regiments under John Bell Hood invaded Middle Tennessee in the fall of 1864 in an effort to draw Sherman back. They were checked by John Schofield at Franklin in November and completely dispersed by George Thomas at Nashville in December. On April 27, 1865, the worst maritime disaster in American history occurred when the &quot;Sultana&quot; steamboat, which was transporting freed Union prisoners, exploded in the Mississippi River north of Memphis, killing 1,168 people.

When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was largely held by Union forces and thus not among the states enumerated, so it freed no slaves there. Andrew Johnson declared all slaves in Tennessee free on October 24, 1864. On February 22, 1865, the legislature approved an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting slavery, which was approved by voters the following month, and would go into effect later on in the year. This made Tennessee the only Southern state to abolish slavery at the time. Tennessee ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery in every state, on April 7, 1865, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to former slaves, on July 18, 1866. Both amendments went into effect after Tennessee&#x27;s readmission to the union due to the fact that other states had not yet ratified it. Johnson became vice president when Lincoln was reelected, and president after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in May 1865. On July 24, 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to have its elected members readmitted to Congress.

===Reconstruction and late 19th century===
The years after the Civil War were characterized by tension and unrest between blacks and former Confederates, the worst of which occurred in Memphis in 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment before its readmission to the Union, it was the only former secessionist state that did not have a military governor during Reconstruction. The Radical Republicans seized control of the state government toward the end of the war, and appointed William G. &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow governor. Under Brownlow&#x27;s administration from 1865 to 1869, the legislature allowed African American men to vote, disenfranchised former Confederates, and with martial law, took action against the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in December 1865 in Pulaski as a vigilante group to advance former Confederates&#x27; interests. In 1870, Southern Democrats regained control of the state legislature, and over the next two decades, passed Jim Crow laws to enforce racial segregation. A total of 251 lynchings, predominately of Black people, took place in Tennessee.
A number of epidemics swept through Tennessee in the years after the Civil War, including cholera in 1873, which devastated the Nashville area, and yellow fever in 1878, which killed more than one-tenth of Memphis&#x27;s residents. Reformers worked to modernize Tennessee into a &quot;New South&quot; economy during this time. With the help of Northern investors, Chattanooga became one of the first industrialized cities in the South. Memphis became known as the &quot;Cotton Capital of the World&quot; during the late 19th century, and Nashville, Knoxville, and several smaller cities saw modest industrialization. Northerners also began exploiting the coalfields and mineral resources in the Appalachian Mountains. To pay off debts and alleviate overcrowded prisons, the state turned to convict leasing, providing prisoners to mining companies as strikebreakers, which was protested by miners forced to compete with the system. An armed uprising in the Cumberland Mountains known as the Coal Creek War in 1891 and 1892 resulted in the state ending convict leasing.

Despite New South promoters&#x27; efforts, agriculture continued to dominate Tennessee&#x27;s economy. The majority of freed slaves were forced into sharecropping during the latter 19th century, and many others worked as agricultural wage laborers. In 1897, Tennessee celebrated its statehood centennial one year late with the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition in Nashville. A full-scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens was designed by architect William Crawford Smith and constructed for the celebration, owing to the city&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Athens of the South&quot;.

===Early 20th century===
Due to increasing racial segregation and poor standards of living, many black Tennesseans fled to industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest as part of the first wave of the Great Migration between 1915 and 1930. Many residents of rural parts of Tennessee relocated to larger cities during this time for more lucrative employment opportunities. As part of the Temperance movement, Tennessee became the first state in the nation to effectively ban the sale, transportation, and production of alcohol in a series of laws passed between 1907 and 1917. During Prohibition, illicit production of moonshine became extremely common in East Tennessee, particularly in the mountains, and continued for many decades afterward.

Sgt. Alvin C. York of Fentress County became one of the most famous and honored American soldiers of World War I. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor for single-handedly capturing an entire German machine gun regiment during the Meuse–Argonne offensive. On July 9, 1918, Tennessee suffered the worst rail accident in U.S. history when two passenger trains collided head on in Nashville, killing 101 and injuring 171. On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th and final state necessary to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gave women the right to vote. In 1925, John T. Scopes, a high school teacher in Dayton, was tried and convicted for teaching evolution in violation of the state&#x27;s recently passed Butler Act. Scopes was prosecuted by former Secretary of State and presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and defended by attorney Clarence Darrow. The case was intentionally publicized, and highlighted the creationism-evolution controversy among religious groups. In 1926, Congress authorized the establishment of a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains, which was officially established in 1934 and dedicated in 1940.

When the Great Depression struck in 1929, much of Tennessee was severely impoverished even by national standards. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to provide electricity, jobs, flood control, improved waterway navigation, agricultural development, and economic modernization to the Tennessee River Valley. The TVA built several hydroelectric dams in the state in the 1930s and 1940s, which inundated communities and thousands of farmland acreage, and forcibly displaced families via eminent domain. The agency quickly grew into the country&#x27;s largest electric utility and initiated a period of dramatic economic growth and transformation that brought many new industries and employment opportunities to the state.
During World War II, East Tennessee was chosen for the production of weapons-grade fissile enriched uranium as part of the Manhattan Project, a research and development undertaking led by the U.S. to produce the world&#x27;s first atomic bombs. The planned community of Oak Ridge was built to provide accommodations for the facilities and workers; the site was chosen due to the abundance of TVA electric power, its low population density, and its inland geography and topography, which allowed for the natural separation of the facilities and a low vulnerability to attack. The Clinton Engineer Works was established as the production arm of the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, which enriched uranium at three major facilities for use in atomic bombs. The first of the bombs was detonated in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in a test code-named Trinity, and the second, nicknamed &quot;Little Boy&quot;, was dropped on Imperial Japan at the end of World War II. After the war, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory became an institution for scientific and technological research.

===Mid-20th century to present===
After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954, Oak Ridge High School in 1955 became the first school in Tennessee to be integrated. The next year, nearby Clinton High School was integrated, and Tennessee National Guard troops were sent in after pro-segregationists threatened violence. Between February and May 1960, a series of sit-ins at segregated lunch counters in Nashville organized by the Nashville Student Movement resulted in the desegregation of facilities in the city. On April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. King had traveled there to support striking African American sanitation workers.
The 1962 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; arose out of a challenge to the longstanding rural bias of apportionment of seats in the Tennessee legislature and established the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. The construction of Interstate 40 through Memphis became a national talking point on the issue of eminent domain and grassroots lobbying when the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) attempted to construct the highway through the city&#x27;s Overton Park. A local activist group spent many years contesting the project, and in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the group and established the framework for judicial review of government agencies in the landmark case of &quot;Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe&quot;. TVA&#x27;s construction of the Tellico Dam in Loudon County became the subject of national controversy in the 1970s when the endangered snail darter fish was reported to be affected by the project. After lawsuits by environmental groups, the debate was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill&quot; in 1978, leading to amendments of the Endangered Species Act.
The 1982 World&#x27;s Fair was held in Knoxville. Also known as the Knoxville International Energy Exposition, the fair&#x27;s theme was &quot;Energy Turns the World&quot;. The exposition was one of the most successful, and the most recent world&#x27;s fair to be held in the U.S. In 1986, Tennessee held a yearlong celebration of the state&#x27;s heritage and culture called &quot;Homecoming &#x27;86&quot;. Tennessee celebrated its bicentennial in 1996 with a yearlong celebration called &quot;Tennessee 200&quot;. A new state park that traces the state&#x27;s history, Bicentennial Mall, was opened at the foot of Capitol Hill in Nashville. The same year, the whitewater slalom events at the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games were held on the Ocoee River in Polk County.

In 2002, Tennessee amended its constitution to establish a lottery. In 2006, the state constitution was amended to outlaw same-sex marriage. This amendment was invalidated by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. On December 23, 2008, the largest industrial waste spill in United States history occurred at TVA&#x27;s Kingston Fossil Plant when more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry was accidentally released into the Emory and Clinch Rivers. The cleanup cost more than $1 billion and lasted until 2015.

==Geography==


Tennessee is in the Southeastern United States. Culturally, most of the state is considered part of the Upland South, and the eastern third is part of Appalachia. Tennessee covers roughly , of which , or 2.2%, is water. It is the 16th smallest state in land area. The state is about long from east to west and wide from north to south. Tennessee is geographically, culturally, economically, and legally divided into three Grand Divisions: East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee. It borders eight other states: Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi on the south, and Arkansas and Missouri on the west. It is tied with Missouri as the state bordering the most other states. Tennessee is trisected by the Tennessee River, and its geographical center is in Murfreesboro. Nearly three–fourths of the state is in the Central Time Zone, with most of East Tennessee on Eastern Time. The Tennessee River forms most of the division between Middle and West Tennessee.

Tennessee&#x27;s eastern boundary roughly follows the highest crests of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the Mississippi River forms its western boundary. Due to flooding of the Mississippi that has changed its path, the state&#x27;s western boundary deviates from the river in some places. The northern border was originally defined as 36°30′ north latitude and the Royal Colonial Boundary of 1665, but due to faulty surveys, begins north of this line in the east, and to the west, gradually veers north before shifting south onto the actual 36°30′ parallel at the Tennessee River in West Tennessee. Uncertainties in the latter 19th century over the location of the state&#x27;s border with Virginia culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court settling the matter in 1893, which resulted in the division of Bristol between the two states. An 1818 survey erroneously placed Tennessee&#x27;s southern border south of the 35th parallel; Georgia legislators continue to dispute this placement, as it prevents Georgia from accessing the Tennessee River.

Marked by a diversity of landforms and topographies, Tennessee features six principal physiographic provinces, from east to west, which are part of three larger regions: the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, and Cumberland Plateau, part of the Appalachian Mountains; the Highland Rim and Nashville Basin, part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the Interior Plains; and the East Gulf Coastal Plain, part of the Atlantic Plains. Other regions include the southern tip of the Cumberland Mountains, the Western Tennessee Valley, and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain. The state&#x27;s highest point, which is also the third-highest peak in eastern North America, is Kuwohi, at above sea level. Its lowest point, , is on the Mississippi River at the Mississippi state line in Memphis. Tennessee has the most caves in the United States, with more than 10,000 documented.

Geological formations in Tennessee largely correspond with the state&#x27;s topographic features, and, in general, decrease in age from east to west. The state&#x27;s oldest rocks are igneous strata more than 1 billion years old found in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the youngest deposits in Tennessee are sands and silts in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain and river valleys that drain into the Mississippi River. Tennessee is considered seismically active and contains two major seismic zones, although destructive earthquakes rarely occur there. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone spans the entirety of East Tennessee from northwestern Alabama to southwestern Virginia, and is considered one of the most active zones in the Southeastern United States, frequently producing low-magnitude earthquakes. The New Madrid seismic zone in the northwestern part of the state produced a series of devastating earthquakes between December 1811 and February 1812 that formed Reelfoot Lake near Tiptonville.

===Topography===
The southwestern Blue Ridge Mountains lie within Tennessee&#x27;s eastern edge, and are divided into several subranges, namely the Great Smoky Mountains, Bald Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, Unaka Mountains, and Iron Mountains. These mountains, which average above sea level in Tennessee, contain some of the highest elevations in eastern North America. The state&#x27;s border with North Carolina roughly follows the highest peaks of this range, including Kuwohi. Most of the Blue Ridge area is protected by the Cherokee National Forest, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and several federal wilderness areas and state parks. The Appalachian Trail roughly follows the North Carolina state line before shifting westward into Tennessee.

Stretching west from the Blue Ridge Mountains for about are the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also known as the Tennessee Valley or Great Valley of East Tennessee. This area consists of linear parallel ridges separated by valleys that trend northeast to southwest, the general direction of the entire Appalachian range. Most of these ridges are low, but some of the higher ones are commonly called mountains. Numerous tributaries join to form the Tennessee River in the Ridge and Valley region.
The Cumberland Plateau rises to the west of the Tennessee Valley, with an average elevation of . This landform is part of the larger Appalachian Plateau and consists mostly of flat-topped tablelands. The plateau&#x27;s eastern edge is relatively distinct, but the western escarpment is irregular, containing several long, crooked stream valleys separated by rocky cliffs with numerous waterfalls. The Cumberland Mountains, with peaks above , comprise the northeastern part of the Appalachian Plateau in Tennessee, and the southeastern part of the Cumberland Plateau is divided by the Sequatchie Valley. The Cumberland Trail traverses the eastern escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains.
West of the Cumberland Plateau is the Highland Rim, an elevated plain that surrounds the Nashville Basin, a geological dome. Both of these physiographic provinces are part of the Interior Low Plateaus of the larger Interior Plains. The Highland Rim is Tennessee&#x27;s largest geographic region, and is often split into eastern and western halves. The Eastern Highland Rim is characterized by relatively level plains dotted by rolling hills, and the Western Highland Rim and western Nashville Basin are covered with uneven rounded knobs with steep ravines separated by meandering streams. The Nashville Basin has rich, fertile farmland, and porous limestone bedrock very close to the surface underlies both the Nashville Basin and Eastern Highland Rim. This results in karst that forms numerous caves, sinkholes, depressions, and underground streams.

West of the Highland Rim is the Western Tennessee Valley, which consists of about in width of hilly land along the banks of the Tennessee River. West of this is the Gulf Coastal Plain, a broad feature that begins at the Gulf of Mexico and extends northward into southern Illinois. The plain begins in the east with low rolling hills and wide stream valleys, known as the West Tennessee Highlands, and gradually levels out to the west. It ends at steep loess bluffs overlooking the Mississippi embayment, the westernmost physiographic division of Tennessee, which is part of the larger Mississippi Alluvial Plain. This flat wide strip is commonly known as the Mississippi Bottoms, and contains lowlands, floodplains, and swamps.

===Hydrology===
Tennessee is drained by three major rivers, the Tennessee, Cumberland, and Mississippi. The Tennessee River begins at the juncture of the Holston and French Broad rivers in Knoxville, flows southwest to Chattanooga, and exits into Alabama before reemerging in the western part of the state and flowing north into Kentucky. Its major tributaries include the Clinch, Little Tennessee, Hiwassee, Sequatchie, Elk, Beech, Buffalo, Duck, and Big Sandy rivers. The Cumberland River flows through the north-central part of the state, emerging in the northeastern Highland Rim, passing through Nashville, turning northwest to Clarksville, and entering Kentucky east of the Tennessee River. Its principal branches in Tennessee are the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, Harpeth, and Red rivers. The Mississippi River drains nearly all of West Tennessee. Its tributaries are the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, Loosahatchie, and Wolf rivers. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operate many hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers and their tributaries, which form large reservoirs throughout the state.

About half the state&#x27;s land area is in the Tennessee Valley drainage basin of the Tennessee River. The Cumberland River basin covers the northern half of Middle Tennessee and a small portion of East Tennessee. A small part of north-central Tennessee is in the Green River watershed. All three of these basins are tributaries of the Ohio River watershed. Most of West Tennessee is in the Lower Mississippi River watershed. The entirety of the state is in the Mississippi River watershed, except for a small sliver near the southeastern corner traversed by the Conasauga River, which is part of the Mobile Bay watershed.

=== Ecology ===
Tennessee is within a temperate deciduous forest biome commonly known as the Eastern Deciduous Forest. It has eight ecoregions: the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, Central Appalachian, Southwestern Appalachian, Interior Low Plateaus, Southeastern Plains, Mississippi Valley Loess Plains, and Mississippi Alluvial Plain regions. Tennessee is the most biodiverse inland state, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most biodiverse national park, and the Duck River is the most biologically diverse waterway in North America. The Nashville Basin is renowned for its diversity of flora and fauna. Tennessee is home to 340 species of birds, 325 freshwater fish species, 89 mammals, 77 amphibians, and 61 reptiles.

Forests cover about 52% of Tennessee&#x27;s land area, with oak–hickory the dominant type. Appalachian oak–pine and cove hardwood forests are found in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Cumberland Plateau, and bottomland hardwood forests are common throughout the Gulf Coastal Plain. Pine forests are also found throughout the state. The Southern Appalachian spruce–fir forest in the highest elevations of the Blue Ridge Mountains is considered the second-most endangered ecosystem in the country. Some of the last remaining large American chestnut trees grow in the Nashville Basin and are being used to help breed blight-resistant trees. Middle Tennessee is home to many unusual and rare ecosystems known as cedar glades, which occur in areas with shallow limestone bedrock that is largely barren of overlying soil and contain many endemic plant species.

Common mammals found throughout Tennessee include white-tailed deer, red and gray foxes, coyotes, raccoons, opossums, wild turkeys, rabbits, and squirrels. Black bears are found in the Blue Ridge Mountains and on the Cumberland Plateau. Tennessee has the third-highest number of amphibian species, with the Great Smoky Mountains home to the most salamander species in the world. The state ranks second in the nation for the diversity of its freshwater fish species.

===Climate===

Most of Tennessee has a humid subtropical climate, with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians, which are classified as a cooler mountain temperate or humid continental climate. The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in Tennessee&#x27;s climate, with winds from the south responsible for most of the state&#x27;s annual precipitation. Generally, the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year. The highest average monthly precipitation usually occurs between December and April. The driest months, on average, are August to October. The state receives an average of of precipitation annually. Snowfall ranges from in West Tennessee to over in East Tennessee&#x27;s highest mountains.

Summers are generally hot and humid, with most of the state averaging a high of around . Winters tend to be mild to cool, decreasing in temperature at higher elevations. For areas outside the highest mountains, the average overnight lows are generally near freezing. The highest recorded temperature was at Perryville on August 9, 1930, while the lowest recorded temperature was at Mountain City on December 30, 1917.

While Tennessee is far enough from the coast to avoid any direct impact from a hurricane, its location makes it susceptible to the remnants of tropical cyclones, which weaken over land and can cause significant rainfall.

Tennessee is a right-to-work state, like most of its Southern neighbors. Unionization has historically been low and continues to decline, as in most of the U.S.

===Taxation===

Tennessee has a reputation as a low-tax state and is usually ranked as one of the five states with the lowest tax burden on residents. Despite being low-tax, it is ranked third among U.S. states for fiscal health. It is one of nine states that do not have a general income tax; the sales tax is the primary means of funding the government. The Hall income tax was imposed on most dividends and interest at a rate of 6% but was completely phased out by 2021.

Beef cattle is the state&#x27;s largest agricultural commodity, followed by broilers and poultry. Tennessee ranks 12th in the nation for the number of cattle, with more than half of its farmland dedicated to cattle grazing. Soybeans and corn are the state&#x27;s first and second-most common crops, respectively, and are most heavily grown in West and Middle Tennessee, especially the northwestern corner of the state. Tennessee ranks seventh in the nation in cotton production, most of which is grown in the fertile soils of central West Tennessee.

The state ranks fourth nationwide in the production of tobacco, which is predominantly grown in the Ridge-and-Valley region of East Tennessee. Tennessee farmers are also known worldwide for their cultivation of tomatoes and horticultural plants. Other important cash crops in the state include hay, wheat, eggs, and snap beans. The Nashville Basin is a top equestrian region, due to soils that produce grass favored by horses. The Tennessee Walking Horse, first bred in the region in the late 18th century, is one of the world&#x27;s most recognized horse breeds. Tennessee also ranks second nationwide for mule breeding and the production of goat meat. The state&#x27;s timber industry is largely concentrated on the Cumberland Plateau and ranks as one of the top producers of hardwood nationwide.

===Industry===
Until World War II, Tennessee, like most Southern states, remained predominantly agrarian. Chattanooga became one of the first industrial cities in the south in the decades after the Civil War, when many factories, including iron foundries, steel mills, and textile mills were constructed there. But most of Tennessee&#x27;s industrial growth began with the federal investments in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Manhattan Project in the 1930s and 1940s. The state&#x27;s industrial and manufacturing sector continued to expand in the succeeding decades, and Tennessee is now home to more than 2,400 advanced manufacturing establishments, which produce a total of more than $29 billion worth of goods annually.

The automotive industry is Tennessee&#x27;s largest manufacturing sector and one of the nation&#x27;s largest. Nissan&#x27;s assembly plant in Smyrna is the largest automotive assembly plant in North America. Two other automakers have assembly plants in Tennessee: General Motors in Spring Hill and Volkswagen in Chattanooga. Ford is constructing an assembly plant in Stanton that is expected to be operational in 2025. In addition, the state contains more than 900 automotive suppliers. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors have their North American corporate headquarters in Franklin. The state is also one of the top producers of food and drink products, its second-largest manufacturing sector. A number of well-known brands originated in Tennessee, and even more are produced there. Tennessee also ranks as one of the largest producers of chemicals. Chemical products manufactured in Tennessee include industrial chemicals, paints, pharmaceuticals, plastic resins, and soaps and hygiene products. Additional important products manufactured in Tennessee include fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, consumer electronics and electrical appliances, and nonelectrical machinery.

===Business===
Tennessee&#x27;s commercial sector is dominated by a wide variety of companies, but its largest service industries include health care, transportation, music and entertainment, banking, and finance.

Since the 1990s, the geographical area between Oak Ridge and Knoxville has been known as the Tennessee Technology Corridor, with more than 500 high-tech firms in the region. The research and development industry in Tennessee is also one of the largest employment sectors, mainly due to the prominence of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Y-12 National Security Complex in the city of Oak Ridge. ORNL conducts scientific research in materials science, nuclear physics, energy, high-performance computing, systems biology, and national security, and is the largest national laboratory in the Department of Energy (DOE) system by size. The technology sector is also a rapidly growing industry in Middle Tennessee, particularly in the Nashville metropolitan area.

===Energy and mineral production===

Tennessee&#x27;s electric utilities are regulated monopolies, as in many other states. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) owns over 90% of the state&#x27;s generating capacity. Nuclear power is Tennessee&#x27;s largest source of electricity generation, producing about 43.4% of its power in 2021. The same year, 22.4% of the power was produced from coal, 17.8% from natural gas, 15.8% from hydroelectricity, and 1.3% from other renewables. About 59.7% of the electricity generated in Tennessee produces no greenhouse gas emissions. Tennessee is home to the first nuclear power reactor in the U.S. to begin operation in the 21st century, which is at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Rhea County. Tennessee was also an early leader in hydroelectric power, and today is the third-largest hydroelectric power-producing state east of the Rocky Mountains. Tennessee is a net consumer of electricity, receiving power from other TVA facilities in neighboring states.

Tennessee has very little petroleum and natural gas reserves, but is home to one oil refinery, in Memphis. Bituminous coal is mined in small quantities in the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains. There are sizable reserves of lignite coal in West Tennessee that remain untapped. Coal production in Tennessee peaked in 1972, and today less than 0.1% of coal in the U.S. comes from Tennessee. Tennessee is the nation&#x27;s leading producer of ball clay. Other major mineral products produced in Tennessee include sand, gravel, crushed stone, Portland cement, marble, sandstone, common clay, lime, and zinc. The Copper Basin, in Tennessee&#x27;s southeastern corner in Polk County, was one of the nation&#x27;s most productive copper mining districts between the 1840s and 1980s, and supplied about 90% of the copper the Confederacy used during the Civil War. Mining activities in the basin resulted in a major environmental disaster, which left the surrounding landscape barren for more than a century. Iron ore was another major mineral mined in Tennessee until the early 20th century. Tennessee was also a top producer of phosphate until the early 1990s.

===Tourism===
Tennessee is the 11th-most visited state in the nation, receiving a record of 126 million tourists in 2019. Its top tourist attraction is the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the U.S., with more than 14 million visitors annually. The park anchors a large tourism industry based primarily in nearby Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, which includes Dollywood, the most visited ticketed attraction in Tennessee. Attractions related to Tennessee&#x27;s musical heritage are spread throughout the state. Other top attractions include the Tennessee State Museum and Parthenon in Nashville; the National Civil Rights Museum and Graceland in Memphis; Lookout Mountain, the Chattanooga Choo-Choo Hotel, Ruby Falls, and the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga; the American Museum of Science and Energy in Oak Ridge, the Bristol Motor Speedway, Jack Daniel&#x27;s Distillery in Lynchburg, and the Hiwassee and Ocoee rivers in Polk County.

The National Park Service preserves four Civil War battlefields in Tennessee: Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Stones River National Battlefield, Shiloh National Military Park, and Fort Donelson National Battlefield. The NPS also operates Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, Andrew Johnson National Historic Site, and the Manhattan Project National Historical Park. Tennessee is home to eight National Scenic Byways, including the Natchez Trace Parkway, the East Tennessee Crossing Byway, the Great River Road, the Norris Freeway, Cumberland National Scenic Byway, Sequatchie Valley Scenic Byway, The Trace, and the Cherohala Skyway. Tennessee maintains 56 state parks, covering . Many reservoirs created by TVA dams have also generated water-based tourist attractions.

==Culture==

Tennessee blends southern Appalachian and Southern flavors, which originate from its English, Scotch-Irish, and African roots, and has evolved as it has grown. Its Grand Divisions also manifest into distinct cultural regions, with East Tennessee commonly associated with Southern Appalachia, and Middle and West Tennessee commonly associated with Upland Southern culture and sometimes even Deep Southern culture. Parts of West Tennessee, especially Memphis, are sometimes considered part of the Deep South. The Tennessee State Museum in Nashville chronicles the state&#x27;s history and culture.

Tennessee is perhaps best known culturally for its musical heritage and contributions to the development of many forms of popular music, particularly in the country genre. Notable authors with ties to Tennessee include Cormac McCarthy, Peter Taylor, James Agee, Francis Hodgson Burnett, Thomas S. Stribling, Ida B. Wells, Nikki Giovanni, Shelby Foote, Ann Patchett, Ishmael Reed, and Randall Jarrell. The state&#x27;s well-known contributions to Southern cuisine include Memphis-style barbecue, Nashville hot chicken, and Tennessee whiskey.

===Music===

Tennessee has played a critical role in the development of many forms of American popular music, including blues, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, soul, bluegrass, Contemporary Christian, and gospel. Many consider Memphis&#x27;s Beale Street the epicenter of the blues, with musicians such as W. C. Handy performing in its clubs as early as 1909. Memphis was historically home to Sun Records, where musicians such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Charlie Rich began their recording careers, and where rock and roll took shape in the 1950s. Stax Records in Memphis became one of the most important labels for soul artists in the late 1950s and 1960s, and a subgenre known as Memphis soul emerged. The 1927 Victor recording sessions in Bristol generally mark the beginning of the country music genre and the rise of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in the 1930s helped make Nashville the center of the country music recording industry. Nashville became known as &quot;Music City&quot;, and the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; remains the nation&#x27;s longest-running radio show.

Many museums and historic sites recognize Tennessee&#x27;s role in nurturing various forms of popular music, including Sun Studio, Memphis Rock N&#x27; Soul Museum, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, and Blues Hall of Fame in Memphis, the Ryman Auditorium, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, National Museum of African American Music, and Music Row in Nashville, the International Rock-A-Billy Museum in Jackson, the Mountain Music Museum in Kingsport, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol. The Rockabilly Hall of Fame, an online site recognizing the development of rockabilly, is also based in Nashville.

The state also has many private schools.

The state enrolls approximately 1 million K–12 students in 137 districts. In 2021, the four-year high school graduation rate was 88.7%, a decrease of 1.2% from the previous year. According to the most recent data, Tennessee spends $9,544 per student, the 8th lowest in the nation.

===Colleges and universities===

Public higher education is overseen by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), which provides guidance to the state&#x27;s two public university systems. The University of Tennessee system operates four primary campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Martin, and Pulaski; a Health Sciences Center in Memphis; and an aerospace research facility in Tullahoma. The Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR), also known as The College System of Tennessee, operates 13 community colleges and 27 campuses of the Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology (TCAT). Until 2017, the TBR also operated six public universities in the state; it now only gives them administrative support.

In 2014, the Tennessee General Assembly created the Tennessee Promise, which allows in-state high school graduates to enroll in two-year post-secondary education programs such as associate degrees and certificates at community colleges and trade schools in Tennessee tuition-free, funded by the state lottery, if they meet certain requirements. The Tennessee Promise was created as part of then-governor Bill Haslam&#x27;s &quot;Drive to 55&quot; program, which set a goal of increasing the number of college-educated residents to at least 55% of the state&#x27;s population. The program has also received national attention, with multiple states having since created similar programs modeled on the Tennessee Promise.

Tennessee has 107 private institutions. Vanderbilt University in Nashville is consistently ranked as one of the nation&#x27;s leading research institutions. Nashville is often called the &quot;Athens of the South&quot; due to its many colleges and universities. Tennessee is also home to six historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

==Law and government==

The Constitution of Tennessee was adopted in 1870. The state had two previous constitutions. The first was adopted in 1796, the year Tennessee was admitted to the union, and the second in 1834. Since 1826, Nashville has been the capital of Tennessee. The capital was previously in three other cities. Knoxville was the capital from statehood in 1796 until 1812, except for September 21, 1807, when the legislature met in Kingston for a day. The capital was relocated to Nashville in 1812, where it remained until it was relocated back to Knoxville in 1817. The next year, the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, where it remained until 1826. Nashville was officially named Tennessee&#x27;s permanent capital in 1843.

===Executive and legislative branches===

Like the federal government, Tennessee&#x27;s government has three branches. The executive branch is led by the governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The governor is the only official elected statewide. The current governor is Bill Lee, a Republican. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner the governor appoints. The executive branch also includes several agencies, boards, and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments.

The bicameral legislative branch, the Tennessee General Assembly, consists of the 33-member Senate and the 99-member House of Representatives. Senators serve four-year terms and House members serve two-year terms. Each chamber chooses a Speaker, who is elected by a joint session of the legislature. The Speaker of the Senate also serves as the lieutenant governor, a practice found only in one other state, and the House Speaker is third in line for the governorship. The legislature can override a veto by a simple majority, and the state has no &quot;pocket veto&quot;. The legislature convenes at noon on the second Tuesday in January and meets for a total of 90 days over two sessions, usually adjourning in late April or early May. Special sessions may be called by the governor or by two-thirds of the members of both chambers.

===Judicial system===

Tennessee&#x27;s highest court is the state Supreme Court. It has a chief justice and four associate justices. No more than two justices can be from the same Grand Division. The Supreme Court of Tennessee appoints the state&#x27;s Attorney General, a practice only found in Tennessee. Both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals have 12 judges, who are evenly from each Grand Division. Under the Tennessee Plan, the governor appoints justices on all three courts to eight-year terms; they must be retained by the voters during the first general election after appointment and at the end of their term. Tennessee is divided into 31 judicial districts, each with a circuit and chancery court, and a district attorney and judges elected to eight-year terms. Separate criminal courts serve 13 of the 31 judicial districts; circuit courts handle criminal cases in the remaining districts. Local courts include general sessions, juvenile and domestic, and municipal courts.

Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement agencies: the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP), the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The Highway Patrol is the primary entity that enforces highway safety regulations and general non-wildlife state laws. It is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Safety. The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fishery regulations outside of state parks. TDEC enforces state environmental laws and regulations. The TBI is the primary state-level criminal investigative department. State park rangers are responsible for all activities and law enforcement inside the Tennessee State Parks system. Tennessee, like many other southern states, has a strong reputation for harsh criminal punishment. Capital punishment is legal in Tennessee and has existed at various times since statehood. Lethal injection is the primary means of execution, but electrocution is also allowed.

===Local===
Tennessee is divided into 95 counties, with 92 county governments that use a county commission legislative body and a separately elected county executive. The governments of Davidson (Nashville), Moore (Lynchburg), and Trousdale (Hartsville) are consolidated with their county seats. Each county elects a sheriff, property assessor, trustee, register of deeds, and county clerk. Tennessee has more than 340 municipalities. Most cities and towns use the weak mayor-council (mayor-aldermen), strong-mayor council, city commission, or council–manager forms of government. Local law enforcement is divided between county sheriff&#x27;s offices and municipal police departments. In every county except Davidson, the sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer.

Between the end of the Civil War and the mid-20th century, Tennessee was part of the Democratic Solid South, but had the largest Republican minority of any former Confederate state. During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free blacks were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. However, the Democratic Party regained control of the state in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed Jim Crow laws, one of which imposed a poll tax requirement for voter registration. These served to disenfranchise most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced. After the disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party became a primarily white sectional party supported mostly in East Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved legislation allowing cities to adopt a commission form of government based on at-large voting as a means to limit African American political participation. Not until after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were African Americans able to regain their full voting rights.
Between the end of Reconstruction and the mid-20th century, Tennessee voted consistently Democratic in Presidential elections, except in two nationwide Republican landslides in the 1920s. Tennesseans narrowly supported Warren G. Harding over Ohio Governor James Cox in 1920, and more decisively voted for Herbert Hoover over New York Governor Al Smith in 1928. During the first half of the 20th century, state politics were dominated by the Democratic Crump machine in Memphis. For most of the second half of the 20th century, Tennessee was a swing state in presidential elections. During this time, Democratic presidential nominees from Southern states, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, tended to fare better in Tennessee than their Northern counterparts, especially among split-ticket voters outside the metropolitan areas. In the 1950s, Tennessee twice voted for Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Allied Commander of the Armed Forces during World War II. Howard Baker, first elected in 1966, became the first Republican U.S. Senator from Tennessee since Reconstruction. The Republican Southern strategy did not have as much of an effect in Tennessee as in most Southern states, but the elections of Winfield Dunn as governor and Bill Brock to the U.S. Senate in 1970 further helped make the GOP competitive among Whites in statewide elections. In the 2000 presidential election, Vice President Al Gore, who had previously served as a Democratic U.S. Senator from Tennessee, failed to carry his home state, an unusual occurrence but indicative of strengthening Republican support.

Beginning in the early 21st century, Tennessee transitioned into a solid Republican state, primarily due to rural white voters who have rejected the increasing liberalism of the Democratic Party. In 2004, Republican President George W. Bush increased his margin of victory in the state from a 4% to a 14% margin in 2000. In 2007, Ron Ramsey became the first Republican Speaker of the State Senate since Reconstruction, and the following year the Republicans gained control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Voters, however, continued to elect moderate Republicans, such as centrists Bill Haslam and Lamar Alexander, until the late 2010s with the rise of Trumpism in the GOP at a nationwide scale. Since 2016, Tennessee has been the most populous state to vote Republican by more than 60% in presidential elections, and in 2020 voted Republican by the largest margin of any state in terms of number of votes.

==Sports==
Tennessee is home to four major professional sports franchises: the Tennessee Titans have played in the National Football League (NFL) since 1997, the Nashville Predators have played in the National Hockey League (NHL) since 1998, the Memphis Grizzlies have played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) since 2001, and Nashville SC has played in Major League Soccer (MLS) since 2020.

The state is also home to seven minor league teams. Four of these are Minor League Baseball clubs. The Nashville Sounds, which began play in 1978, and Memphis Redbirds, which began in 1998, each compete in the International League at the Triple-A level, the highest before Major League Baseball. The Knoxville Smokies, which have played continuously since 1972, and Chattanooga Lookouts, which have played continuously since 1976, are members of the Double-A classification Southern League. Tennessee has two minor league soccer teams. Chattanooga Red Wolves SC has been a member of the third-tier USL League One since 2019. Founded in 2009, Chattanooga FC began playing in the third-tier National Independent Soccer Association in 2020. The state has one minor league ice hockey team: the Knoxville Ice Bears, which began play in 2002 and are members of the Southern Professional Hockey League.
The state is home to 12 NCAA Division I programs. Four of these participate in the top level of college football, the Football Bowl Subdivision. In Knoxville, the Tennessee Volunteers college teams play in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In Nashville, the Vanderbilt Commodores are also members of the SEC. The Memphis Tigers are members of the American Athletic Conference, and Murfreesboro&#x27;s Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders play in Conference USA. Nashville is also home to the Belmont Bruins, members of the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) but moving to the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) in July 2022; Tennessee State Tigers, OVC members with no plans to change conferences; and the Lipscomb Bisons, members of the ASUN Conference. Tennessee State plays football in Division I&#x27;s second level, the Football Championship Subdivision, while Belmont and Lipscomb do not have football teams. Through the 2021–22 school year, the OVC also includes the Austin Peay Governors from Clarksville, the UT Martin Skyhawks from Martin, and the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles from Cookeville. UT Martin and Tennessee Tech will remain in the OVC, while Peay will move to the ASUN. The Chattanooga Mocs and Johnson City&#x27;s East Tennessee State Buccaneers are full members, including football, of the Southern Conference.

Tennessee is also home to the Bristol Motor Speedway, which features NASCAR Cup Series racing two weekends a year, routinely selling out more than 160,000 seats on each date. The Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon, which previously held Nationwide and IndyCar races until it was shut down in 2011, reopened to host the NASCAR Cup Series in 2021. Tennessee&#x27;s only graded stakes horserace, the Iroquois Steeplechase, is held in Nashville each May. The WGC Invitational is a PGA Tour golf tournament that has been held in Memphis since 1958.

<text>In physics and mechanics, torque is the rotational analogue of linear force. It is also referred to as the moment of force (also abbreviated to moment). The symbol for torque is typically formula_1, the lowercase Greek letter &quot;tau&quot;. When being referred to as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by . Just as a linear force is a push or a pull applied to a body, a torque can be thought of as a twist applied to an object with respect to a chosen point; for example, driving a screw uses torque to force it into an object, which is applied by the screwdriver rotating around its axis to the drives on the head.

== History ==

The term &quot;torque&quot; (from Latin , &#x27;to twist&#x27;) is said to have been suggested by James Thomson and appeared in print in April, 1884. Usage is attested the same year by Silvanus P. Thompson in the first edition of &quot;Dynamo-Electric Machinery&quot;. Thompson motivates the term as follows:

Today, torque is referred to using different vocabulary depending on geographical location and field of study. This article follows the definition used in US physics in its usage of the word &quot;torque&quot;.

In the UK and in US mechanical engineering, torque is referred to as &quot;moment of force&quot;, usually shortened to &quot;moment&quot;. This terminology can be traced back to at least 1811 in Siméon Denis Poisson&#x27;s . An English translation of Poisson&#x27;s work appears in 1842.

== Definition and relation to other physical quantities ==
A force applied perpendicularly to a lever multiplied by its distance from the lever&#x27;s fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. Therefore, torque is defined as the product of the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the force and the distance of the line of action of a force from the point around which it is being determined. In three dimensions, the torque is a pseudovector; for point particles, it is given by the cross product of the displacement vector and the force vector. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque. It follows that the &quot;torque vector&quot; is perpendicular to both the &quot;position&quot; and &quot;force&quot; vectors and defines the plane in which the two vectors lie. The resulting &quot;torque vector&quot; direction is determined by the right-hand rule. Therefore any force directed parallel to the particle&#x27;s position vector does not produce a torque. The magnitude of torque applied to a rigid body depends on three quantities: the force applied, the &quot;lever arm vector&quot; connecting the point about which the torque is being measured to the point of force application, and the angle between the force and lever arm vectors. In symbols:

formula_2

where
* formula_1 is the torque vector and formula_4 is the magnitude of the torque,
* formula_5 is the position vector (a vector from the point about which the torque is being measured to the point where the force is applied), and &quot;r&quot; is the magnitude of the position vector,

The SI unit for torque is the newton-metre (N⋅m). For more on the units of torque, see .

=== Relationship with the angular momentum ===
The net torque on a body determines the rate of change of the body&#x27;s angular momentum,

formula_9

where L is the angular momentum vector and &quot;t&quot; is time. For the motion of a point particle,

formula_10

where formula_11 is the moment of inertia and ω is the orbital angular velocity pseudovector. It follows that

formula_12

using the derivative of a vector isformula_13This equation is the rotational analogue of Newton&#x27;s second law for point particles, and is valid for any type of trajectory. In some simple cases like a rotating disc, where only the moment of inertia on rotating axis is, the rotational Newton&#x27;s second law can beformula_14where formula_15. 

==== Proof of the equivalence of definitions ====
The definition of angular momentum for a single point particle is:
formula_16
where p is the particle&#x27;s linear momentum and r is the position vector from the origin. The time-derivative of this is:

formula_17

This result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and applying the product rule. But because the rate of change of linear momentum is force formula_18 and the rate of change of position is velocity formula_19,

formula_20

The cross product of momentum formula_21 with its associated velocity formula_22 is zero because velocity and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes. Therefore, torque on a particle is &quot;equal&quot; to the first derivative of its angular momentum with respect to time. If multiple forces are applied, according Newton&#x27;s second law it follows thatformula_23

This is a general proof for point particles, but it can be generalized to a system of point particles by applying the above proof to each of the point particles and then summing over all the point particles. Similarly, the proof can be generalized to a continuous mass by applying the above proof to each point within the mass, and then integrating over the entire mass.

=== Derivatives of torque ===
In physics, rotatum is the derivative of torque with respect to timeformula_24where τ is torque.

This word is derived from the Latin word meaning &#x27;to rotate&#x27;, but the term &quot;rotatum&quot; is not universally recognized but is commonly used. There is not a universally accepted lexicon to indicate the successive derivatives of rotatum, even if sometimes various proposals have been made.

Using the cross product definition of torque, an alternative expression for rotatum is:

formula_25

Because the rate of change of force is yank formula_26 and the rate of change of position is velocity formula_19, the expression can be further simplified to:

formula_28

=== Relationship with power and energy ===
The law of conservation of energy can also be used to understand torque. If a force is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing mechanical work. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through an angular displacement, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the center of mass, the work &quot;W&quot; can be expressed as

formula_29

where &quot;τ&quot; is torque, and &quot;θ&quot;1 and &quot;θ&quot;2 represent (respectively) the initial and final angular positions of the body.

It follows from the work–energy principle that &quot;W&quot; also represents the change in the rotational kinetic energy &quot;E&quot;r of the body, given by

formula_30

where &quot;I&quot; is the moment of inertia of the body and &quot;ω&quot; is its angular speed.

Power is the work per unit time, given by

formula_31

where &quot;P&quot; is power, τ is torque, ω is the angular velocity, and formula_32 represents the scalar product.

Algebraically, the equation may be rearranged to compute torque for a given angular speed and power output. The power injected by the torque depends only on the instantaneous angular speed – not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the instantaneous speed – not on the resulting acceleration, if any).

==== Proof ====
The work done by a variable force acting over a finite linear displacement formula_33 is given by integrating the force with respect to an elemental linear displacement formula_34

formula_35

However, the infinitesimal linear displacement formula_34 is related to a corresponding angular displacement formula_37 and the radius vector formula_38 as 

formula_39

Substitution in the above expression for work, , gives
formula_40

The expression inside the integral is a scalar triple product formula_41, but as per the definition of torque, and since the parameter of integration has been changed from linear displacement to angular displacement, the equation becomes

formula_42

If the torque and the angular displacement are in the same direction, then the scalar product reduces to a product of magnitudes; i.e., formula_43 giving

formula_44

== Principle of moments ==
The principle of moments, also known as Varignon&#x27;s theorem (not to be confused with the geometrical theorem of the same name) states that the resultant torques due to several forces applied to about a point is equal to the sum of the contributing torques:

formula_45

From this it follows that the torques resulting from N number of forces acting around a pivot on an object are balanced when

formula_46

== Units ==
Torque has the dimension of force times distance, symbolically and those fundamental dimensions are the same as that for energy or work. Official SI literature indicates &quot;newton-metre&quot;, is properly denoted N⋅m, as the unit for torque; although this is dimensionally equivalent to the joule, which is not used for torque. In the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a vector, whereas for energy, it is assigned to a scalar. This means that the dimensional equivalence of the newton-metre and the joule may be applied in the former but not in the latter case. This problem is addressed in orientational analysis, which treats the radian as a base unit rather than as a dimensionless unit.

The traditional imperial units for torque are the pound foot (lbf-ft), or, for small values, the pound inch (lbf-in). In the US, torque is most commonly referred to as the foot-pound (denoted as either lb-ft or ft-lb) and the inch-pound (denoted as in-lb). Practitioners depend on context and the hyphen in the abbreviation to know that these refer to torque and not to energy or moment of mass (as the symbolism ft-lb would properly imply).

=== Conversion to other units ===
A conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power or torque. For example, if rotational speed (unit: revolution per minute or second) is used in place of angular speed (unit: radian per second), we must multiply by 2 radians per revolution. In the following formulas, &quot;P&quot; is power, &quot;τ&quot; is torque, and &quot;ν&quot; (Greek letter nu) is rotational speed.

formula_47

Showing units:

formula_48

Dividing by 60 seconds per minute gives us the following.

formula_49

where rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (rpm, rev/min).

Some people (e.g., American automotive engineers) use horsepower (mechanical) for power, foot-pounds (lbf⋅ft) for torque and rpm for rotational speed. This results in the formula changing to:

formula_50

The constant below (in foot-pounds per minute) changes with the definition of the horsepower; for example, using metric horsepower, it becomes approximately 32,550.

The use of other units (e.g., BTU per hour for power) would require a different custom conversion factor.

==== Derivation ====
For a rotating object, the &quot;linear distance&quot; covered at the circumference of rotation is the product of the radius with the angle covered. That is: linear distance = radius × angular distance. And by definition, linear distance = linear speed × time = radius × angular speed × time.

By the definition of torque: torque = radius × force. We can rearrange this to determine force = torque ÷ radius. These two values can be substituted into the definition of power:

formula_51

The radius &quot;r&quot; and time &quot;t&quot; have dropped out of the equation. However, angular speed must be in radians per unit of time, by the assumed direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the beginning of the derivation. If the rotational speed is measured in revolutions per unit of time, the linear speed and distance are increased proportionately by 2 in the above derivation to give:

formula_52

If torque is in newton-metres and rotational speed in revolutions per second, the above equation gives power in newton-metres per second or watts. If Imperial units are used, and if torque is in pounds-force feet and rotational speed in revolutions per minute, the above equation gives power in foot pounds-force per minute. The horsepower form of the equation is then derived by applying the conversion factor 33,000 ft⋅lbf/min per horsepower:

formula_53

because formula_54

== Special cases and other facts ==
=== Moment arm formula ===

A very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields other than physics, is as follows:

formula_55

The construction of the &quot;moment arm&quot; is shown in the figure to the right, along with the vectors r and F mentioned above. The problem with this definition is that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement vector r, the moment arm will be equal to the distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:

formula_56

For example, if a person places a force of 10 N at the terminal end of a wrench that is 0.5 m long (or a force of 10 N acting 0.5 m from the twist point of a wrench of any length), the torque will be 5 N⋅m – assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench.

=== Static equilibrium ===
For an object to be in static equilibrium, not only must the sum of the forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: and , and the torque a third equation: . That is, to solve statically determinate equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.

=== Net force versus torque ===
When the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of the point of reference. If the net force formula_57 is not zero, and formula_58 is the torque measured from formula_59, then the torque measured from formula_60 is
formula_61

=== Machine torque ===
Torque forms part of the basic specification of an engine: the power output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by the angular speed of the drive shaft. Internal-combustion engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000–6,000 rpm for a small car). One can measure the varying torque output over that range with a dynamometer, and show it as a torque curve. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam-engines and electric motors can start heavy loads from zero rpm without a clutch.

In practice, the relationship between power and torque can be observed in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle&#x27;s transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of angular speed (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute times 2&quot;π&quot;) and the torque at the spindle of the bicycle&#x27;s crankset. The bicycle&#x27;s drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, angular speed)input pair is converted to a (torque, angular speed)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.

=== Torque multiplier ===

Torque can be multiplied via three methods: by locating the fulcrum such that the length of a lever is increased; by using a longer lever; or by the use of a speed-reducing gearset or gear box. Such a mechanism multiplies torque, as rotation rate is reduced.

<text>In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus precise ones). The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: &quot;&quot;What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?&quot;.&quot;

In order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible &quot;reasonable&quot; model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a finite amount of memory.

The theory of computation can be considered the creation of models of all kinds in the field of computer science. Therefore, mathematics and logic are used. In the last century, it separated from mathematics and became an independent academic discipline with its own conferences such as FOCS in 1960 and STOC in 1969, and its own awards such as the IMU Abacus Medal (established in 1981 as the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize), the Gödel Prize, established in 1993, and the Knuth Prize, established in 1996.

Some pioneers of the theory of computation were Ramon Llull, Alonzo Church, Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, Rózsa Péter, John von Neumann and Claude Shannon.

== Branches ==

=== Automata theory ===

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines (or more appropriately, abstract &#x27;mathematical&#x27; machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. These abstract machines are called automata. Automata comes from the Greek word (Αυτόματα) which means that something is doing something by itself.
Automata theory is also closely related to formal language theory, as the automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they are able to recognize. An automaton can be a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set. Automata are used as theoretical models for computing machines, and are used for proofs about computability.

==== Formal language theory ====
Formal language theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with describing languages as a set of operations over an alphabet. It is closely linked with automata theory, as automata are used to generate and recognize formal languages. There are several classes of formal languages, each allowing more complex language specification than the one before it, i.e. Chomsky hierarchy, and each corresponding to a class of automata which recognizes it. Because automata are used as models for computation, formal languages are the preferred mode of specification for any problem that must be computed.

=== Computability theory ===

Computability theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. The statement that the halting problem cannot be solved by a Turing machine is one of the most important results in computability theory, as it is an example of a concrete problem that is both easy to formulate and impossible to solve using a Turing machine. Much of computability theory builds on the halting problem result.

Another important step in computability theory was Rice&#x27;s theorem, which states that for all non-trivial properties of partial functions, it is undecidable whether a Turing machine computes a partial function with that property.

Computability theory is closely related to the branch of mathematical logic called recursion theory, which removes the restriction of studying only models of computation which are reducible to the Turing model. Many mathematicians and computational theorists who study recursion theory will refer to it as computability theory.

=== Computational complexity theory ===
Computational complexity theory considers not only whether a problem can be solved at all on a computer, but also how efficiently the problem can be solved. Two major aspects are considered: time complexity and space complexity, which are respectively how many steps it takes to perform a computation, and how much memory is required to perform that computation.

In order to analyze how much time and space a given algorithm requires, computer scientists express the time or space required to solve the problem as a function of the size of the input problem. For example, finding a particular number in a long list of numbers becomes harder as the list of numbers grows larger. If we say there are &quot;n&quot; numbers in the list, then if the list is not sorted or indexed in any way we may have to look at every number in order to find the number we&#x27;re seeking. We thus say that in order to solve this problem, the computer needs to perform a number of steps that grow linearly in the size of the problem.

To simplify this problem, computer scientists have adopted big &quot;O&quot; notation, which allows functions to be compared in a way that ensures that particular aspects of a machine&#x27;s construction do not need to be considered, but rather only the asymptotic behavior as problems become large. So in our previous example, we might say that the problem requires formula_1 steps to solve.

Perhaps the most important open problem in all of computer science is the question of whether a certain broad class of problems denoted NP can be solved efficiently. This is discussed further at Complexity classes P and NP, and P versus NP problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000. The Official Problem Description was given by Turing Award winner Stephen Cook.

== Models of computation ==
Aside from a Turing machine, other equivalent (see Church–Turing thesis) models of computation are in use.

;Lambda calculus: A computation consists of an initial lambda expression (or two if you want to separate the function and its input) plus a finite sequence of lambda terms, each deduced from the preceding term by one application of Beta reduction.
;Combinatory logic
:is a concept which has many similarities to formula_2-calculus, but also important differences exist (e.g. fixed point combinator Y has normal form in combinatory logic but not in formula_2-calculus). Combinatory logic was developed with great ambitions: understanding the nature of paradoxes, making foundations of mathematics more economic (conceptually), eliminating the notion of variables (thus clarifying their role in mathematics).
;μ-recursive functions: a computation consists of a mu-recursive function, &quot;i.e.&quot; its defining sequence, any input value(s) and a sequence of recursive functions appearing in the defining sequence with inputs and outputs. Thus, if in the defining sequence of a recursive function formula_4 the functions formula_5 and formula_6 appear, then terms of the form &#x27;g(5)=7&#x27; or &#x27;h(3,2)=10&#x27; might appear. Each entry in this sequence needs to be an application of a basic function or follow from the entries above by using composition, primitive recursion or μ recursion. For instance if formula_7, then for &#x27;f(5)=3&#x27; to appear, terms like &#x27;g(5)=6&#x27; and &#x27;h(5,6)=3&#x27; must occur above. The computation terminates only if the final term gives the value of the recursive function applied to the inputs.
;Markov algorithm: a string rewriting system that uses grammar-like rules to operate on strings of symbols.
;Register machine
:is a theoretically interesting idealization of a computer. There are several variants. In most of them, each register can hold a natural number (of unlimited size), and the instructions are simple (and few in number), e.g. only decrementation (combined with conditional jump) and incrementation exist (and halting). The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) external store (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriately huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.

In addition to the general computational models, some simpler computational models are useful for special, restricted applications. Regular expressions, for example, specify string patterns in many contexts, from office productivity software to programming languages. Another formalism mathematically equivalent to regular expressions, finite automata are used in circuit design and in some kinds of problem-solving. Context-free grammars specify programming language syntax. Non-deterministic pushdown automata are another formalism equivalent to context-free grammars. Primitive recursive functions are a defined subclass of the recursive functions.

Different models of computation have the ability to do different tasks. One way to measure the power of a computational model is to study the class of formal languages that the model can generate; in such a way to the Chomsky hierarchy of languages is obtained.

<text>A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model&#x27;s simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm.

The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete cells, each of which can hold a single symbol drawn from a finite set of symbols called the alphabet of the machine. It has a &quot;head&quot; that, at any point in the machine&#x27;s operation, is positioned over one of these cells, and a &quot;state&quot; selected from a finite set of states. At each step of its operation, the head reads the symbol in its cell. Then, based on the symbol and the machine&#x27;s own present state, the machine writes a symbol into the same cell, and moves the head one step to the left or the right, or halts the computation. The choice of which replacement symbol to write, which direction to move the head, and whether to halt is based on a finite table that specifies what to do for each combination of the current state and the symbol that is read. 
As with a real computer program, it is possible for a Turing machine to go into an infinite loop which will never halt.

The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an &quot;a-machine&quot; (automatic machine). It was Turing&#x27;s doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church, who later coined the term &quot;Turing machine&quot; in a review. With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative:
* Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is &quot;circular&quot; (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task)?
* Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol?
Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the uncomputability of the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot;, or &#x27;decision problem&#x27; (whether every mathematical statement is provable or disprovable).

Turing machines proved the existence of fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation. 

While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalist design makes them too slow for computation in practice: real-world computers are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines, use random-access memory.

Turing completeness is the ability for a computational model or a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.

==Overview==
A Turing machine is an idealised model of a central processing unit (CPU) that controls all data manipulation done by a computer, with the canonical machine using sequential memory to store data. Typically, the sequential memory is represented as a tape of infinite length on which the machine can perform read and write operations.

In the context of formal language theory, a Turing machine (automaton) is capable of enumerating some arbitrary subset of valid strings of an alphabet. A set of strings which can be enumerated in this manner is called a recursively enumerable language. The Turing machine can equivalently be defined as a model that recognises valid input strings, rather than enumerating output strings.

Given a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; and an arbitrary string &quot;s&quot;, it is generally not possible to decide whether &quot;M&quot; will eventually produce &quot;s&quot;. This is due to the fact that the halting problem is unsolvable, which has major implications for the theoretical limits of computing.

The Turing machine is capable of processing an unrestricted grammar, which further implies that it is capable of robustly evaluating first-order logic in an infinite number of ways. This is famously demonstrated through lambda calculus.

A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a universal Turing machine (UTM, or simply a universal machine). Another mathematical formalism, lambda calculus, with a similar &quot;universal&quot; nature was introduced by Alonzo Church. Church&#x27;s work intertwined with Turing&#x27;s to form the basis for the Church–Turing thesis. This thesis states that Turing machines, lambda calculus, and other similar formalisms of computation do indeed capture the informal notion of effective methods in logic and mathematics and thus provide a model through which one can reason about an algorithm or &quot;mechanical procedure&quot; in a mathematically precise way without being tied to any particular formalism. Studying the abstract properties of Turing machines has yielded many insights into computer science, computability theory, and complexity theory.

===Physical description===
In his 1948 essay, &quot;Intelligent Machinery&quot;, Turing wrote that his machine consists of:

==Description==
The Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape. On this tape are symbols, which the machine can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as &quot;in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6;&quot; etc. In the original article (&quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;, see also references below), Turing imagines not a mechanism, but a person whom he calls the &quot;computer&quot;, who executes these deterministic mechanical rules slavishly (or as Turing puts it, &quot;in a desultory manner&quot;).

More explicitly, a Turing machine consists of:
* A &quot;tape&quot; divided into cells, one next to the other. Each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet. The alphabet contains a special blank symbol (here written as &#x27;0&#x27;) and one or more other symbols. The tape is assumed to be arbitrarily extendable to the left and to the right, so that the Turing machine is always supplied with as much tape as it needs for its computation. Cells that have not been written before are assumed to be filled with the blank symbol. In some models the tape has a left end marked with a special symbol; the tape extends or is indefinitely extensible to the right.
* A &quot;head&quot; that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one (and only one) cell at a time. In some models the head moves and the tape is stationary.
* A &quot;state register&quot; that stores the state of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. Among these is the special &quot;start state&quot; with which the state register is initialised. These states, writes Turing, replace the &quot;state of mind&quot; a person performing computations would ordinarily be in.
* A finite &quot;table&quot; of instructions that, given the &quot;state&quot;(qi) the machine is currently in &quot;and&quot; the &quot;symbol&quot;(aj) it is reading on the tape (the symbol currently under the head), tells the machine to do the following &quot;in sequence&quot; (for the 5-tuple models):
# Either erase or write a symbol (replacing aj with aj1).
# Move the head (which is described by dk and can have values: &#x27;L&#x27; for one step left &quot;or&quot; &#x27;R&#x27; for one step right &quot;or&quot; &#x27;N&#x27; for staying in the same place).
# Assume the same or a &quot;new state&quot; as prescribed (go to state qi1).
In the 4-tuple models, erasing or writing a symbol (aj1) and moving the head left or right (dk) are specified as separate instructions. The table tells the machine to (ia) erase or write a symbol &quot;or&quot; (ib) move the head left or right, &quot;and then&quot; (ii) assume the same or a new state as prescribed, but not both actions (ia) and (ib) in the same instruction. In some models, if there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state, then the machine will halt; other models require all entries to be filled.

Every part of the machine (i.e. its state, symbol-collections, and used tape at any given time) and its actions (such as printing, erasing and tape motion) is &quot;finite&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot; and &quot;distinguishable&quot;; it is the unlimited amount of tape and runtime that gives it an unbounded amount of storage space.

==Formal definition==
Following , a (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-tuple formula_1 where
* formula_2 is a finite, non-empty set of &quot;tape alphabet symbols&quot;;
* formula_3 is the &quot;blank symbol&quot; (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
* formula_4 is the set of &quot;input symbols&quot;, that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
* formula_5 is a finite, non-empty set of &quot;states&quot;;
* formula_6 is the &quot;initial state&quot;;
* formula_7 is the set of &quot;final states&quot; or &quot;accepting states&quot;. The initial tape contents is said to be &quot;accepted&quot; by formula_8 if it eventually halts in a state from formula_9.
* formula_10 is a partial function called the &quot;transition function&quot;, where L is left shift, R is right shift. If formula_11 is not defined on the current state and the current tape symbol, then the machine halts; intuitively, the transition function specifies the next state transited from the current state, which symbol to overwrite the current symbol pointed by the head, and the next head movement.

A variant allows &quot;no shift&quot;, say N, as a third element of the set of directions formula_12.

The 7-tuple for the 3-state busy beaver looks like this (see more about this busy beaver at Turing machine examples):
* formula_13 (states);
* formula_14 (tape alphabet symbols);
* formula_15 (blank symbol);
* formula_16 (input symbols);
* formula_17 (initial state);
* formula_18 (final states);
* formula_19 see state-table below (transition function).

Initially all tape cells are marked with formula_20.

In the words of van Emde Boas (1990), p. 6: &quot;The set-theoretical object [his formal seven-tuple description similar to the above] provides only partial information on how the machine will behave and what its computations will look like.&quot;

For instance,
* There will need to be many decisions on what the symbols actually look like, and a failproof way of reading and writing symbols indefinitely.
* The shift left and shift right operations may shift the tape head across the tape, but when actually building a Turing machine it is more practical to make the tape slide back and forth under the head instead.
* The tape can be finite, and automatically extended with blanks as needed (which is closest to the mathematical definition), but it is more common to think of it as stretching infinitely at one or both ends and being pre-filled with blanks except on the explicitly given finite fragment the tape head is on (this is, of course, not implementable in practice). The tape &quot;cannot&quot; be fixed in length, since that would not correspond to the given definition and would seriously limit the range of computations the machine can perform to those of a linear bounded automaton if the tape was proportional to the input size, or finite-state machine if it was strictly fixed-length.

===Alternative definitions===
Definitions in literature sometimes differ slightly, to make arguments or proofs easier or clearer, but this is always done in such a way that the resulting machine has the same computational power. For example, the set could be changed from formula_12 to formula_22, where &quot;N&quot; (&quot;None&quot; or &quot;No-operation&quot;) would allow the machine to stay on the same tape cell instead of moving left or right. This would not increase the machine&#x27;s computational power.

The most common convention represents each &quot;Turing instruction&quot; in a &quot;Turing table&quot; by one of nine 5-tuples, per the convention of Turing/Davis (Turing (1936) in &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 126–127 and Davis (2000) p. 152):

: (definition 1): (qi, Sj, Sk/E/N, L/R/N, qm)
:: ( current state qi , symbol scanned Sj , print symbol Sk/erase E/none N , move_tape_one_square left L/right R/none N , new state qm )

Other authors (Minsky (1967) p. 119, Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) p. 158, Stone (1972) p. 9) adopt a different convention, with new state qm listed immediately after the scanned symbol Sj:
: (definition 2): (qi, Sj, qm, Sk/E/N, L/R/N)
:: ( current state qi , symbol scanned Sj , new state qm , print symbol Sk/erase E/none N , move_tape_one_square left L/right R/none N )

For the remainder of this article &quot;definition 1&quot; (the Turing/Davis convention) will be used.

In the following table, Turing&#x27;s original model allowed only the first three lines that he called N1, N2, N3 (cf. Turing in &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 126). He allowed for erasure of the &quot;scanned square&quot; by naming a 0th symbol S0 = &quot;erase&quot; or &quot;blank&quot;, etc. However, he did not allow for non-printing, so every instruction-line includes &quot;print symbol Sk&quot; or &quot;erase&quot; (cf. footnote 12 in Post (1947), &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 300). The abbreviations are Turing&#x27;s (&quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 119). Subsequent to Turing&#x27;s original paper in 1936–1937, machine-models have allowed all nine possible types of five-tuples:

Any Turing table (list of instructions) can be constructed from the above nine 5-tuples. For technical reasons, the three non-printing or &quot;N&quot; instructions (4, 5, 6) can usually be dispensed with. For examples see Turing machine examples.

Less frequently the use of 4-tuples are encountered: these represent a further atomization of the Turing instructions (cf. Post (1947), Boolos &amp; Jeffrey (1974, 1999), Davis-Sigal-Weyuker (1994)); also see more at Post–Turing machine.

===The &quot;state&quot;===
The word &quot;state&quot; used in context of Turing machines can be a source of confusion, as it can mean two things. Most commentators after Turing have used &quot;state&quot; to mean the name/designator of the current instruction to be performed—i.e. the contents of the state register. But Turing (1936) made a strong distinction between a record of what he called the machine&#x27;s &quot;m-configuration&quot;, and the machine&#x27;s (or person&#x27;s) &quot;state of progress&quot; through the computation—the current state of the total system. What Turing called &quot;the state formula&quot; includes both the current instruction and &quot;all&quot; the symbols on the tape:

Earlier in his paper Turing carried this even further: he gives an example where he placed a symbol of the current &quot;m-configuration&quot;—the instruction&#x27;s label—beneath the scanned square, together with all the symbols on the tape (&quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 121); this he calls &quot;the &quot;complete configuration&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 118). To print the &quot;complete configuration&quot; on one line, he places the state-label/m-configuration to the &quot;left&quot; of the scanned symbol.

A variant of this is seen in Kleene (1952) where Kleene shows how to write the Gödel number of a machine&#x27;s &quot;situation&quot;: he places the &quot;m-configuration&quot; symbol q4 over the scanned square in roughly the center of the 6 non-blank squares on the tape (see the Turing-tape figure in this article) and puts it to the &quot;right&quot; of the scanned square. But Kleene refers to &quot;q4&quot; itself as &quot;the machine state&quot; (Kleene, p. 374–375). Hopcroft and Ullman call this composite the &quot;instantaneous description&quot; and follow the Turing convention of putting the &quot;current state&quot; (instruction-label, m-configuration) to the &quot;left&quot; of the scanned symbol (p. 149), that is, the instantaneous description is the composite of non-blank symbols to the left, state of the machine, the current symbol scanned by the head, and the non-blank symbols to the right.

&quot;Example: total state of 3-state 2-symbol busy beaver after 3 &quot;moves&quot;&quot; (taken from example &quot;run&quot; in the figure below):
:: 1A1
This means: after three moves the tape has ... 000110000 ... on it, the head is scanning the right-most 1, and the state is &quot;A&quot;. Blanks (in this case represented by &quot;0&quot;s) can be part of the total state as shown here: &quot;B&quot;01; the tape has a single 1 on it, but the head is scanning the 0 (&quot;blank&quot;) to its left and the state is &quot;B&quot;.

&quot;State&quot; in the context of Turing machines should be clarified as to which is being described: the current instruction, or the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction, or the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction placed to the left of the scanned symbol or to the right of the scanned symbol.

Turing&#x27;s biographer Andrew Hodges (1983: 107) has noted and discussed this confusion.

===&quot;State&quot; diagrams===

To the right: the above table as expressed as a &quot;state transition&quot; diagram.

Usually large tables are better left as tables (Booth, p. 74). They are more readily simulated by computer in tabular form (Booth, p. 74). However, certain concepts—e.g. machines with &quot;reset&quot; states and machines with repeating patterns (cf. Hill and Peterson p. 244ff)—can be more readily seen when viewed as a drawing.

Whether a drawing represents an improvement on its table must be decided by the reader for the particular context.

The reader should again be cautioned that such diagrams represent a snapshot of their table frozen in time, &quot;not&quot; the course (&quot;trajectory&quot;) of a computation &quot;through&quot; time and space. While every time the busy beaver machine &quot;runs&quot; it will always follow the same state-trajectory, this is not true for the &quot;copy&quot; machine that can be provided with variable input &quot;parameters&quot;.

The diagram &quot;progress of the computation&quot; shows the three-state busy beaver&#x27;s &quot;state&quot; (instruction) progress through its computation from start to finish. On the far right is the Turing &quot;complete configuration&quot; (Kleene &quot;situation&quot;, Hopcroft–Ullman &quot;instantaneous description&quot;) at each step. If the machine were to be stopped and cleared to blank both the &quot;state register&quot; and entire tape, these &quot;configurations&quot; could be used to rekindle a computation anywhere in its progress (cf. Turing (1936) &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, pp. 139–140).

==Equivalent models==
Many machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power (Hopcroft and Ullman p. 159, cf. Minsky (1967)). They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (The Church–Turing thesis &quot;hypothesises&quot; this to be true for any kind of machine: that anything that can be &quot;computed&quot; can be computed by some Turing machine.)

A Turing machine is equivalent to a single-stack pushdown automaton (PDA) that has been made more flexible and concise by relaxing the last-in-first-out (LIFO) requirement of its stack. In addition, a Turing machine is also equivalent to a two-stack PDA with standard LIFO semantics, by using one stack to model the tape left of the head and the other stack for the tape to the right.

At the other extreme, some very simple models turn out to be Turing-equivalent, i.e. to have the same computational power as the Turing machine model.

Common equivalent models are the multi-tape Turing machine, multi-track Turing machine, machines with input and output, and the &quot;non-deterministic&quot; Turing machine (NDTM) as opposed to the &quot;deterministic&quot; Turing machine (DTM) for which the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state.

Read-only, right-moving Turing machines are equivalent to DFAs (as well as NFAs by conversion using the NFA to DFA conversion algorithm).

For practical and didactic intentions, the equivalent register machine can be used as a usual assembly programming language.

A relevant question is whether or not the computation model represented by concrete programming languages is Turing equivalent. While the computation of a real computer is based on finite states and thus not capable to simulate a Turing machine, programming languages themselves do not necessarily have this limitation. Kirner et al., 2009 have shown that among the general-purpose programming languages some are Turing complete while others are not. For example, ANSI C is not Turing complete, as all instantiations of ANSI C (different instantiations are possible as the standard deliberately leaves certain behaviour undefined for legacy reasons) imply a finite-space memory. This is because the size of memory reference data types, called &quot;pointers&quot;, is accessible inside the language. However, other programming languages like Pascal do not have this feature, which allows them to be Turing complete in principle.
It is just Turing complete in principle, as memory allocation in a programming language is allowed to fail, which means the programming language can be Turing complete when ignoring failed memory allocations, but the compiled programs executable on a real computer cannot.

==Choice c-machines, oracle o-machines==
Early in his paper (1936) Turing makes a distinction between an &quot;automatic machine&quot;—its &quot;motion ... completely determined by the configuration&quot; and a &quot;choice machine&quot;:

Turing (1936) does not elaborate further except in a footnote in which he describes how to use an a-machine to &quot;find all the provable formulae of the [Hilbert] calculus&quot; rather than use a choice machine. He &quot;suppose[s] that the choices are always between two possibilities 0 and 1. Each proof will then be determined by a sequence of choices i1, i2, ..., in (i1 = 0 or 1, i2 = 0 or 1, ..., in = 0 or 1), and hence the number 2n + i12n-1 + i22n-2 + ... +in completely determines the proof. The automatic machine carries out successively proof 1, proof 2, proof 3, ...&quot; (Footnote ‡, &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 138)

This is indeed the technique by which a deterministic (i.e., a-) Turing machine can be used to mimic the action of a nondeterministic Turing machine; Turing solved the matter in a footnote and appears to dismiss it from further consideration.

An oracle machine or o-machine is a Turing a-machine that pauses its computation at state &quot;o&quot; while, to complete its calculation, it &quot;awaits the decision&quot; of &quot;the oracle&quot;—an entity unspecified by Turing &quot;apart from saying that it cannot be a machine&quot; (Turing (1939), &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 166–168).

==Universal Turing machines==

As Turing wrote in &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, p. 128 (italics added):
This finding is now taken for granted, but at the time (1936) it was considered astonishing. The model of computation that Turing called his &quot;universal machine&quot;—&quot;U&quot; for short—is considered by some (cf. Davis (2000)) to have been the fundamental theoretical breakthrough that led to the notion of the stored-program computer.

In terms of computational complexity, a multi-tape universal Turing machine need only be slower by logarithmic factor compared to the machines it simulates. This result was obtained in 1966 by F. C. Hennie and R. E. Stearns. (Arora and Barak, 2009, theorem 1.9)

==Comparison with real machines==

Turing machines are more powerful than some other kinds of automata, such as finite-state machines and pushdown automata. According to the Church–Turing thesis, they are as powerful as real machines, and are able to execute any operation that a real program can. What is neglected in this statement is that, because a real machine can only have a finite number of &quot;configurations&quot;, it is nothing but a finite-state machine, whereas a Turing machine has an unlimited amount of storage space available for its computations.

There are a number of ways to explain why Turing machines are useful models of real computers:

* Anything a real computer can compute, a Turing machine can also compute. For example: &quot;A Turing machine can simulate any type of subroutine found in programming languages, including recursive procedures and any of the known parameter-passing mechanisms&quot; (Hopcroft and Ullman p. 157). A large enough FSA can also model any real computer, disregarding IO. Thus, a statement about the limitations of Turing machines will also apply to real computers.
* The difference lies only with the ability of a Turing machine to manipulate an unbounded amount of data. However, given a finite amount of time, a Turing machine (like a real machine) can only manipulate a finite amount of data.
* Like a Turing machine, a real machine can have its storage space enlarged as needed, by acquiring more disks or other storage media.
* Descriptions of real machine programs using simpler abstract models are often much more complex than descriptions using Turing machines. For example, a Turing machine describing an algorithm may have a few hundred states, while the equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) on a given real machine has quadrillions. This makes the DFA representation infeasible to analyze.
* Turing machines describe algorithms independent of how much memory they use. There is a limit to the memory possessed by any current machine, but this limit can rise arbitrarily in time. Turing machines allow us to make statements about algorithms which will (theoretically) hold forever, regardless of advances in &quot;conventional&quot; computing machine architecture.
* Algorithms running on Turing-equivalent abstract machines can have arbitrary-precision data types available and never have to deal with unexpected conditions (including, but not limited to, running out of memory).

===Limitations===

====Computational complexity theory====
A limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model the strengths of a particular arrangement well. For instance, modern stored-program computers are actually instances of a more specific form of abstract machine known as the random-access stored-program machine or RASP machine model. Like the universal Turing machine, the RASP stores its &quot;program&quot; in &quot;memory&quot; external to its finite-state machine&#x27;s &quot;instructions&quot;. Unlike the universal Turing machine, the RASP has an infinite number of distinguishable, numbered but unbounded &quot;registers&quot;—memory &quot;cells&quot; that can contain any integer (cf. Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), and in particular Cook-Rechow (1973); references at random-access machine). The RASP&#x27;s finite-state machine is equipped with the capability for indirect addressing (e.g., the contents of one register can be used as an address to specify another register); thus the RASP&#x27;s &quot;program&quot; can address any register in the register-sequence. The upshot of this distinction is that there are computational optimizations that can be performed based on the memory indices, which are not possible in a general Turing machine; thus when Turing machines are used as the basis for bounding running times, a &quot;false lower bound&quot; can be proven on certain algorithms&#x27; running times (due to the false simplifying assumption of a Turing machine). An example of this is binary search, an algorithm that can be shown to perform more quickly when using the RASP model of computation rather than the Turing machine model.

====Interaction====
In the early days of computing, computer use was typically limited to batch processing, i.e., non-interactive tasks, each producing output data from given input data. Computability theory, which studies computability of functions from inputs to outputs, and for which Turing machines were invented, reflects this practice.

Since the 1970s, interactive use of computers became much more common. In principle, it is possible to model this by having an external agent read from the tape and write to it at the same time as a Turing machine, but this rarely matches how interaction actually happens; therefore, when describing interactivity, alternatives such as I/O automata are usually preferred.

== Comparison with the arithmetic model of computation ==
The arithmetic model of computation differs from the Turing model in two aspects:

* In the arithmetic model, every real number requires a single memory cell, whereas in the Turing model the storage size of a real number depends on the number of bits required to represent it. 
* In the arithmetic model, every basic arithmetic operation on real numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) can be done in a single step, whereas in the Turing model the run-time of each arithmetic operation depends on the length of the operands.

Some algorithms run in polynomial time in one model but not in the other one. For example:

* The Euclidean algorithm runs in polynomial time in the Turing model, but not in the arithmetic model.
* The algorithm that reads &quot;n&quot; numbers and then computes formula_23 by repeated squaring runs in polynomial time in the Arithmetic model, but not in the Turing model. This is because the number of bits required to represent the outcome is exponential in the input size.

However, if an algorithm runs in polynomial time in the arithmetic model, and in addition, the binary length of all involved numbers is polynomial in the length of the input, then it is always polynomial-time in the Turing model. Such an algorithm is said to run in strongly polynomial time.

==History==
===Historical background: computational machinery===
Robin Gandy (1919–1995)—a student of Alan Turing (1912–1954), and his lifelong friend—traces the lineage of the notion of &quot;calculating machine&quot; back to Charles Babbage (circa 1834) and actually proposes &quot;Babbage&#x27;s Thesis&quot;:

Gandy&#x27;s analysis of Babbage&#x27;s analytical engine describes the following five operations (cf. p. 52–53):
# The arithmetic functions +, −, ×, where − indicates &quot;proper&quot; subtraction: if .
# Any sequence of operations is an operation.
# Iteration of an operation (repeating n times an operation P).
# Conditional iteration (repeating n times an operation P conditional on the &quot;success&quot; of test T).
# Conditional transfer (i.e., conditional &quot;goto&quot;).

Gandy states that &quot;the functions which can be calculated by (1), (2), and (4) are precisely those which are Turing computable.&quot; (p. 53). He cites other proposals for &quot;universal calculating machines&quot; including those of Percy Ludgate (1909), Leonardo Torres Quevedo (1914), Maurice d&#x27;Ocagne (1922), Louis Couffignal (1933), Vannevar Bush (1936), Howard Aiken (1937). However:

===The Entscheidungsproblem (the &quot;decision problem&quot;): Hilbert&#x27;s tenth question of 1900===
With regard to Hilbert&#x27;s problems posed by the famous mathematician David Hilbert in 1900, an aspect of problem #10 had been floating about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely. Hilbert&#x27;s original expression for No. 10 is as follows:

By 1922, this notion of &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; had developed a bit, and H. Behmann stated that

By the 1928 international congress of mathematicians, Hilbert &quot;made his questions quite precise. First, was mathematics &quot;complete&quot; ... Second, was mathematics &quot;consistent&quot; ... And thirdly, was mathematics &quot;decidable&quot;?&quot; (Hodges p. 91, Hawking p. 1121). The first two questions were answered in 1930 by Kurt Gödel at the very same meeting where Hilbert delivered his retirement speech (much to the chagrin of Hilbert); the third—the Entscheidungsproblem—had to wait until the mid-1930s.

The problem was that an answer first required a precise definition of &quot;definite general applicable prescription&quot;, which Princeton professor Alonzo Church would come to call &quot;effective calculability&quot;, and in 1928 no such definition existed. But over the next 6–7 years Emil Post developed his definition of a worker moving from room to room writing and erasing marks per a list of instructions (Post 1936), as did Church and his two students Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser by use of Church&#x27;s lambda-calculus and Gödel&#x27;s recursion theory (1934). Church&#x27;s paper (published 15 April 1936) showed that the Entscheidungsproblem was indeed &quot;undecidable&quot; and beat Turing to the punch by almost a year (Turing&#x27;s paper submitted 28 May 1936, published January 1937). In the meantime, Emil Post submitted a brief paper in the fall of 1936, so Turing at least had priority over Post. While Church refereed Turing&#x27;s paper, Turing had time to study Church&#x27;s paper and add an Appendix where he sketched a proof that Church&#x27;s lambda-calculus and his machines would compute the same functions.

And Post had only proposed a definition of calculability and criticised Church&#x27;s &quot;definition&quot;, but had proved nothing.

===Alan Turing&#x27;s a-machine===
In the spring of 1935, Turing as a young Master&#x27;s student at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, took on the challenge; he had been stimulated by the lectures of the logician M. H. A. Newman &quot;and learned from them of Gödel&#x27;s work and the Entscheidungsproblem ... Newman used the word &#x27;mechanical&#x27; ... In his obituary of Turing 1955 Newman writes:

Gandy states that:

While Gandy believed that Newman&#x27;s statement above is &quot;misleading&quot;, this opinion is not shared by all. Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: &quot;Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter &#x27;mechanical&#x27;&quot; (Hodges p. 96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier (see below). His PhD thesis, titled &quot;Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals&quot;, contains the following definition of &quot;a computable function&quot;:

Alan Turing invented the &quot;a-machine&quot; (automatic machine) in 1936. Turing submitted his paper on 31 May 1936 to the London Mathematical Society for its &quot;Proceedings&quot; (cf. Hodges 1983:112), but it was published in early 1937 and offprints were available in February 1937 (cf. Hodges 1983:129) It was Turing&#x27;s doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church, who later coined the term &quot;Turing machine&quot; in a review. With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative:
* Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is &quot;circular&quot; (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task)? 
* Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol?
Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the uncomputability of the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (&#x27;decision problem&#x27;).

When Turing returned to the UK he ultimately became jointly responsible for breaking the German secret codes created by encryption machines called &quot;The Enigma&quot;; he also became involved in the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), &quot;[Turing&#x27;s] ACE proposal was effectively self-contained, and its roots lay not in the EDVAC [the USA&#x27;s initiative], but in his own universal machine&quot; (Hodges p. 318). Arguments still continue concerning the origin and nature of what has been named by Kleene (1952) Turing&#x27;s Thesis. But what Turing &quot;did prove&quot; with his computational-machine model appears in his paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot; (1937):

Turing&#x27;s example (his second proof): If one is to ask for a general procedure to tell us: &quot;Does this machine ever print 0&quot;, the question is &quot;undecidable&quot;.

===1937–1970: The &quot;digital computer&quot;, the birth of &quot;computer science&quot;===
In 1937, while at Princeton working on his PhD thesis, Turing built a digital (Boolean-logic) multiplier from scratch, making his own electromechanical relays (Hodges p. 138). &quot;Alan&#x27;s task was to embody the logical design of a Turing machine in a network of relay-operated switches ...&quot; (Hodges p. 138). While Turing might have been just initially curious and experimenting, quite-earnest work in the same direction was going in Germany (Konrad Zuse (1938)), and in the United States (Howard Aiken) and George Stibitz (1937); the fruits of their labors were used by both the Axis and Allied militaries in World War II (cf. Hodges p. 298–299). In the early to mid-1950s Hao Wang and Marvin Minsky reduced the Turing machine to a simpler form (a precursor to the Post–Turing machine of Martin Davis); simultaneously European researchers were reducing the new-fangled electronic computer to a computer-like theoretical object equivalent to what was now being called a &quot;Turing machine&quot;. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the coincidentally parallel developments of Melzak and Lambek (1961), Minsky (1961), and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1961) carried the European work further and reduced the Turing machine to a more friendly, computer-like abstract model called the counter machine; Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), Cook and Reckhow (1973) carried this work even further with the register machine and random-access machine models—but basically all are just multi-tape Turing machines with an arithmetic-like instruction set.

===1970–present: as a model of computation===
Today, the counter, register and random-access machines and their sire the Turing machine continue to be the models of choice for theorists investigating questions in the theory of computation. In particular, computational complexity theory makes use of the Turing machine:

<text>Trail riding is riding outdoors on trails, bridle paths, and forest roads, but not on roads regularly used by motorised traffic. A trail ride can be of any length, including a long distance, multi-day trip. It originated with horse riding, and in North America, the equestrian form is usually called &quot;trail riding,&quot; or, less often &quot;hacking.&quot; In the UK and Europe, the practice is usually called horse or pony trekking.

The modern term also encompasses mountain biking, mixed terrain cycle-touring, and the use of motorcycles and other motorized all-terrain vehicles. It may be informal activities of an individual or small group, or larger events organized by a club. Some equestrian trail rides in the USA are directed by professional guides or outfitters, particularly at guest ranches, while many equestrians who own horses trail ride on their own in local, state, and national trail systems. In some parts of the world, trail riding (of whatever kind) is limited by law to recognized, and sometimes function-specific, trails that are waymarked. in other towns, trails may be less maintained and more natural. Certain trails are limited by trail use types. Trail riding can be combined with other activities, such as camping, hunting, fishing, orienteering and backpacking.

==Types and uses of trails==
Often, horses under saddle are subject to the same regulations as pedestrians or hikers where those requirements differ from those for cyclists. In most states, are not classified livestock and thus restricted from areas such as the right of way of the interstate highway system, though generally permitted to travel along the side of other roadways, especially in rural areas.

Rail trails, which are redeveloped disused railways converted into multi-use trails, often provide invaluable trail riding areas in many parts of the world. A bridle path, also called a bridleway, equestrian trail, horse riding path, bridle road, or horse trail, is a trail or a thoroughfare that is used by people riding on horses, though such trails often now serve a wider range of users, including equestrians, hikers, and cyclists. Such paths are either impassable for motorized vehicles, or vehicles are banned. The laws relating to allowable uses vary from country to country.

In England and Wales a bridle path now refers to a route which can be legally used by horse riders in addition to walkers, and since 1968, by cyclists but not motor-cyclists. In the US, the term bridle path is used colloquially for trails or paths used primarily for people making day treks on horses, and used primarily on the east coast, whereas out west the equivalent term is simply trail. The United States has few if any formal designations for bridle paths, though horses are generally allowed on most state and federal trails, roads and public routes except where specifically restricted, although rules differ among locations.

There is some criticism of trail riding when excess or improper use of trails may lead to erosion, the spread of invasive plants, conflict with hikers, or harassment of wildlife. Off-road or trail activity is usually not permitted, as such activity may also raise the risk of soil erosion, spread weeds, and cause other damage. However, many responsible equestrians, mountain bikers, and off-road motorcyclists, especially those who get involved in these sports by joining an organized club, perform hours of trail maintenance every year. Many organizations also sponsor educational events to teach newcomers about safety, responsible land stewardship and how to improve riding techniques.

==Equestrian use==
Many long-distance trails throughout the world have sections suitable for horse riding, some suitable throughout their length, and some have been developed primarily for horse riding. Within the United States National Trail Classification System, equestrian trails include simple day-use bridle paths and others built to accommodate long strings of pack animals on journeys lasting many days. Some trails managed by the U. S. Forest Service and other governmental entities may restrict access of horses, or restrict access during certain times of the year. Access to trails and pathways on private land is generally left to the discretion of the landowner, subject to the general trespass laws of each of the 50 states.

===Pleasure riding===
The term pleasure riding may encompass trail riding. This refers to a form of equestrianism that encompasses many forms of recreational riding for personal enjoyment, without any element of competition. Pleasure riding is called &quot;hacking&quot; in United Kingdom, and in parts of the eastern United States and Canada. In other parts of the United States, particularly the American west, the term trail riding is used interchangeably with pleasure riding when on natural trails or public lands. Many horses are suitable for pleasure riding, including grade horses and other animals of ordinary quality and good disposition. Such horses are sometimes called hacks, particularly in those areas where pleasure riding is known as hacking. In recreational trail riding, having fun and enjoying time spent in natures rather than speed and form are the goals.

===Equestrian competition===
There are competitive events that occur on natural trails to test the endurance or trail riding ability of a horse. The level of difficulty varies by distance, trail, and terrain. Endurance riding encompasses races of varying lengths, usually from to , where the first horse to cross the finish line and be deemed &quot;fit to continue&quot; by passing a veterinary examination is the winner. Competitive trail riding is another distance competition that differs from endurance races, as the first horse to cross the line does not necessarily win, but rather the competitors are required to finish within a minimum and a maximum time with their horse in the best condition and with additional scoring for horsemanship and care of the animal.

There are competitive events at horse shows, called trail classes, which test the horse and rider&#x27;s ability to handle obstacles resembling those commonly found on trails, such as opening and closing gates, crossing logs, and navigating forward, backward and to the side. There are also judged trail rides, which occur on a natural trail, but assess trail-class-style points based on the ability of the horse and rider to navigate specific natural and man-made obstacles encountered along the trail.

==Mountain biking==
Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, fire roads, logging roads, and other unpaved trails. These types of terrain commonly include rocks, washouts, ruts, loose sand, loose gravel, roots, and steep slopes. Mountain bikes are built to handle this terrain and the obstacles that are found in it, like logs, vertical drop offs, and small boulders. Mountain bikes, therefore, are more sturdily constructed than regular bicycles, have larger knobby tires, more powerful brakes, and the lower gear ratios needed for steep grades with poor traction.

Trail riding on a mountain bike can be: 
* On steep, highly technical, constructed trails.
* On longer trails, like bridle paths, rail trails, farm and forest roads and towpaths. The South Downs Way in England and the Ohio to Erie Trail, in the USA would be examples. 
* On hiking trails that can include steep mountain trails and high passes. These rides can last for days.

Off-road bicycle trails are generally function-specific and most commonly waymarked along their route. They may take the form of single routes or form part of larger complexes, known as trail centres. Off-road trails often incorporate a mix of challenging terrain, singletrack, smooth fireroads, and even paved paths. Trails with an easy or moderate technical complexity are generally deemed cross-country trails, while trails difficult even to experienced riders are more often dubbed all-mountain, freeride, or downhill. Downhilling is particularly popular at ski resorts such as Mammoth Mountain in California, USA or Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia, Canada, where ski lifts are used to get bikes and riders to the top of the mountain.

Long rides on hiking and mountain paths have some resemblance to cycle touring but the latter usually take place on tarmac. However, Mixed Terrain Cycle-Touring, nicknamed &quot;rough riding&quot; in Canada and the US and &quot;rough stuff&quot; in Europe, is a form of trail riding, because it involves cycling over a variety of surfaces and topography, on a single route, either using a mountain bike or hybrid bike. A new style of travel called adventure cycle-touring or expedition touring involves exploring remote regions of the world on sturdy bicycles carrying lightweight gear. This type of trail riding is in fact a form of backpacking.
Mount Tamalpais, California, USA, and the surrounding areas in Marin County, California are recognized as the birthplace of mountain biking. In the 1970s, mountain biking pioneers such as Gary Fisher, Otis Guy, Charlie Kelly and Joe Breeze were active. The 2006 film chronicled their story, solidifying Mount Tamalpais&#x27; legendary status as a trail riding destination.

There has been considerable controversy around trail access for mountain bikes, both in terms of environmental impact and the safety of other trail users. As a result, bicycles are generally restricted from narrow, single-track trails, though bicycles are allowed on most fire roads. However, mountain bikers in the United States generally have access to multi-use trails.
In England and Wales, bridle paths and some other rights of way, such as byways and &#x27;Roads used as paths&#x27; (RUPP), are open to cyclists, but footpaths are not. However, in Scotland there is no legal distinction between footpaths and bridleways, and it is generally accepted that cyclists and horseriders may follow rights of way with suitable surfaces. Public rights of way are somewhat limited in Northern Ireland.

There are long-distance routes throughout Europe, including some through the Swiss Alps that involve crossing high Alpine passes. There are also extensive routes through France that include both steep, rocky, alpine terrain and minor country roads or off-road on a variety of surfaces, from wide forest roads to narrow, muddy woodland tracks.

Extreme trail riding, such as Megavalanche are mountainbike downhill marathon style events combining gravity-assisted sections with those that emphasize the riders&#x27; levels of fitness, endurance, and nerve.

<text>Terrence Vance Gilliam ( ; born 22 November 1940) is an American-British filmmaker, comedian, collage animator, and actor. He gained stardom as a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe alongside John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Graham Chapman. Together they collaborated on the sketch series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–1974) and the films &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975, which Gilliam co-directed as well), &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983). In 1988, they received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 2009, Gilliam received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement.

Gilliam transitioned to directing serious films with themes exploring imagination and oppositions to bureaucracy and authoritarianism. His films are sometimes set in dystopian worlds and involve black comedy and tragicomedic elements. He has directed 13 feature films, gaining acclaim for &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), and &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998). He later directed &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; (2005), &quot;Tideland&quot; (2005), &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009), &quot;The Zero Theorem&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot; (2018). 

Gilliam was born in Minnesota, but spent his high school and college years in Los Angeles. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. The only Monty Python member not born in Britain, Gilliam became a naturalised British citizen in 1968 and formally renounced his American citizenship in 2006.

== Early life and education ==
Terry Gilliam was born on 22 November 1940 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. In 1952, the family moved to the Los Angeles neighborhood of Panorama City. Gilliam attended Birmingham High School. During high school, he began to avidly read &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, then edited by Harvey Kurtzman, which would later influence Gilliam&#x27;s work.

Gilliam graduated from Occidental College in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.

== Career ==

=== 1965–1969: Animation and move to England ===
Gilliam began his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. One of his early photographic strips for the US magazine &quot;Help!&quot; featured future Python cast member John Cleese. When &quot;Help!&quot; folded, Gilliam went to Europe. Moving to England, he animated sequences for the children&#x27;s series &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; which he worked on from 1968 to 1969, and which also featured Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.

=== 1969–1974: Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus ===

Gilliam was a member of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; from its outset, credited at first as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits) and later as a full member. His cartoons linked the show&#x27;s sketches together and defined the group&#x27;s visual language in other media, such as LP and book covers and the title sequences of their films. His animations mix his own art, characterised by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the Victorian era.

He also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. Gilliam did, however, have some notable sketch roles, such as Cardinal Fang of the Spanish Inquisition; the bespectacled commenter who said, &quot;I can&#x27;t add anything to that!&quot; in the sketch &quot;Election Night Special&quot;; Kevin Garibaldi, the brat on the couch shouting &quot;I want more beans!&quot; in the sketch &quot;Most Awful Family in Britain 1974&quot; (episode 45); the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask in &quot;The Visitors&quot;; and Percy Bysshe Shelley in &quot;Ant Poetry Reading&quot;. More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of makeup or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who ended sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken. He also designed the covers of most of the Monty Python albums, including &quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot;, &quot;The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot;, &quot;Monty Python Live at Drury Lane&quot;, and all of their later film soundtrack albums. 

=== 1975–1983: Transitional years ===

In 1975, Gilliam began his career as a director by co-directing &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; with Terry Jones. Gilliam was responsible for photography and also appeared as both Patsy and the Old Man from Scene 24, while Jones guided the actors&#x27; performances. It was the only Python film directed by Gilliam, though he continued to act in their subsequent projects.

As Python started to take longer breaks between projects following &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, Gilliam became a solo filmmaker, building upon the experience he had acquired. In 1977, he directed his first film outside the group, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, also a comedy set in the Middle Ages. It featured Python member Michael Palin in the lead role, and was based on the poem of the same name. In 1978, he published &quot;Animations of Mortality&quot;, an illustrated, tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to guide to his animation techniques and the visual language in them.

Gilliam served as art director on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, Terry Jones having taken on sole directing duties. Gilliam made &quot;Time Bandits&quot; in 1981. Following directing the short film &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;, which opened showings of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;, Python effectively ceased working together, and Gilliam pursued his career as a filmmaker.

=== 1984–1998: Trilogies and critical success ===
The &quot;Trilogy of Imagination&quot;, written by Gilliam, about &quot;the ages of man&quot;, consisted of &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988). All are about the &quot;craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.&quot; All three films focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination: &quot;Time Bandits&quot; through the eyes of a child, &quot;Brazil&quot; through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and &quot;Munchausen&quot; through the eyes of an elderly man. In the summer of 1986, he cut ties with Arnon Milchan and 20th Century Fox and started directing &quot;Munchausen&quot; through his own new Prominent Films banner independently.

In the 1990s, Gilliam directed a trilogy of Americana: &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995), and &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998), which took place on North American soil and, while still surreal, had fewer fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.

=== 1999–2009 ===

In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, which was budgeted at US$32.1 million, making it among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing Don Quixote (Jean Rochefort) suffered a herniated disc, and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15 million. Despite the cancellation, the aborted project did yield the 2002 documentary &quot;Lost in La Mancha&quot;, produced from film from a second crew that had been hired by Gilliam to document the making of &quot;Quixote&quot;. After the cancellation, both Gilliam and the film&#x27;s co-lead, Johnny Depp, wanted to revive the project. The insurance company involved in the failed first attempt withheld the rights to the screenplay for several years with the production on hold until 2008.

Following the failure of &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, J. K. Rowling, the author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and a fan of Gilliam&#x27;s work, advocated for him to direct &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; in 2000, but Warner Bros. ultimately chose Chris Columbus for the job. 

In 2002, Gilliam directed a series of television advertisements called &quot;Secret Tournament&quot;. Part of Nike&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign, the advertisements feature a secret three-on-three tournament between the world&#x27;s best football players, including Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry, who are inside a huge tanker ship. The advertisements are accompanied with a remixed version of the Elvis Presley song &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot;.

In 2005, Gilliam released &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot;, followed later in the year by &quot;Tideland&quot;. In 2006, Gilliam made his debut as theatre director by directing the stage show &quot;Slava&#x27;s Diabolo&quot;, created and staged by the Russian clown artist Slava Polunin. The show combined Polunin&#x27;s clown style, characterised by deep nonverbal expression and interaction with the audience, with Gilliam&#x27;s rich visuals and surrealistic imagery. The show premiered at the Noga Hall of the Gesher Theatre in Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Israel.

In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with his writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite &quot;Dreams&quot; reported that the new project was titled &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot;; the following October, &quot;Dreams&quot; confirmed that this would be Gilliam&#x27;s next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits. Production began in December 2007 in London. On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Ledger&#x27;s involvement had been a &quot;key factor&quot; in the film&#x27;s financing. Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January, but in February the actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledger&#x27;s role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the &quot;magical&quot; world of the film. Thanks to this arrangement the principal photography was completed on 15 April 2008, on schedule. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and suffered a broken back. The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009, but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this $30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than $60 million in worldwide theatrical release and received two Academy Award nominations. The film&#x27;s end credit states that the film is dedicated to the memories of Ledger and William Vince. Depp, Farrell, and Law donated their proceeds from the film to Ledger&#x27;s daughter.

=== 2010–present ===
Gilliam made his opera debut at London&#x27;s English National Opera (ENO) in May 2011, directing &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;, by Hector Berlioz. On 16 September 2012, the production opened at the Vlaamse Opera in Ghent, Belgium, in the opera&#x27;s original French-language version and received praise from critics and audiences alike. After a number of performances in Ghent, the production moved to the opera house in Antwerp for a sold-out run of performances.

In July 2012, Gilliam revealed plans for a film which would be shot in Bucharest, Romania. He denied that it would be &quot;Don Quixote&quot; but refused to give any further details. On 13 August 2012, this project was announced to be &quot;The Zero Theorem&quot;, set to start shooting in Bucharest on 22 October, produced by Dean Zanuck (son of the late Richard D. Zanuck, who was originally to produce the film in 2009), with worldwide sales handled by Voltage Pictures, Toronto, and starring the Academy Award–winner Christoph Waltz in the lead (replacing Billy Bob Thornton, who had been attached to the project in 2009). &quot;The Zero Theorem&quot; premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2013.

In June 2014, Gilliam followed up on his success with &quot;Faust&quot; with a new ENO production of another opera by Berlioz, the rarely performed &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;.

After regaining the rights to the screenplay of &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot;, Gilliam restarted preproduction in 2008, with Johnny Depp still attached to the project. The film was to be reshot completely, with Rochefort&#x27;s role recast. Michael Palin reportedly entered into talks with Gilliam about stepping in for Rochefort and playing Don Quixote. However, Gilliam revealed on the Canadian talk show &quot;The Hour&quot; on 17 December 2009 that Robert Duvall had been cast to play Quixote, before the film was postponed once again. In January 2014, Gilliam wrote on Facebook that &quot;Dreams of Don Quixote have begun again&quot;. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was confirmed that &quot;The Man Who Killed Don Quixote&quot; was going to be made, with Michael Palin and Adam Driver in starring roles. In March 2017, filming finally began, with Driver and Jonathan Pryce starring. On 4 June 2017, Gilliam announced that the shooting of the film was complete. The film premiered on 19 May 2018, as the closing film of the 2018 Cannes Film Festival (where it received a standing ovation), and was released in French theatres the same day.

His production of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, which he co-directed with Leah Hausman, premiered at the Theatre Royal, Bath in August 2022 to positive reviews.

In June 2024, Gilliam announced the making of a new film called &quot;Carnival: At the End of Days&quot;. It will star Depp, reuniting with Gilliam, along with Bridges, Driver, and Jason Momoa. The production of the film is expected to begin in April 2025 according to Gilliam. Johnny Depp will play Satan, and Jeff Bridges will play God in the film.

==== Other projects ====

In addition to film projects as director, Gilliam has been involved with developing projects for other artists and mediums. On 16 December 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Gilliam was to &quot;godfather&quot; a film called &quot;1884&quot;, described as an animated steampunk parody of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, with several former Pythons lending their voices to the project; Gilliam was to be credited as &quot;creative advisor&quot;. On 15 May 2013, Gilliam was signed on to executive produce &quot;The White Circus&quot;, a &quot;dark fairy tale&quot; adventure-romance that was to star Chloë Grace Moretz, Asa Butterfield, Andrea Riseborough and Christian Friedel.

Fifteen years after the publication of Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Animations of Mortality&quot;, between the release of the CD-ROM game &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Complete Waste of Time&quot; in 1994, which used many of Gilliam&#x27;s animation templates, and the making of Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with Enteractive, a software company, to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as licence-free clip arts for people to create their own flash animations, but the project hovered in limbo for years, probably because Enteractive was about to downsize greatly in mid-1996 and changed its focus from CD-ROM multimedia presentations to internet business solutions and web hosting in 1997 (in the introduction to their 2004 book &quot;Terry Gilliam: Interviews&quot;, David Sterrit and Lucille Rhodes claimed that the internet had overwhelmed the &quot;computer-communications market&quot; and gave this as the reason that the &quot;Animations of Mortality&quot; CD-ROM never materialised). Around the time of Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a licence-free download of Adobe After Effects or similar files.

=== Commercial success ===
Gilliam&#x27;s first successful feature, &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone. &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), although commercially unsuccessful, was nominated for four Oscars and won three BAFTA Awards, among several other Prizes in Europe. &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991), his first film not to feature a member of the Monty Python troupe, had a budget of $24 million and grossed more than $41 million at United States box office. &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; grossed more than US$168 million worldwide, making it his most commercially successful film. &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot;, despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105 million worldwide. &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot;, with a budget of $30 million, has been an international commercial success, grossing over $60 million in worldwide theatrical release.
According to Box Office Mojo, Gilliam&#x27;s films have grossed an average of $21,602,510.

== Personal life ==
Gilliam has been married to British makeup artist Maggie Weston since 1973. She worked on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, many of the Python films, and Gilliam&#x27;s films up to &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;. They have three children: Amy Rainbow (born 1978), Holly Dubois (born October 1980), and Harry Thunder (born 3 April 1988), all of whom have also appeared in or worked on several of his films.

In 1968, Gilliam obtained British citizenship. He held dual American and British citizenship for the next 38 years, until he renounced his American citizenship in January 2006. In an interview with &quot;Der Tagesspiegel&quot;, he described the action as a protest against then-President George W. Bush, and in an earlier interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, he also indicated that it was related to concerns about future tax liability for his wife and children. As a result of renouncing his citizenship, Gilliam was permitted to spend 30 days each year in the United States over the next ten years, &quot;less than any European&quot;. Holly followed suit, renouncing her American citizenship in 2017.

He maintains a residence in Italy near the Umbria–Tuscany border. He has been instrumental in establishing the annual Umbria Film Festival, held in the nearby town of Montone. Gilliam also resides in Highgate, London.

=== Charitable activities ===
Gilliam has been involved with a number of charitable and humanitarian causes. In 2009, he became a board member of Videre Est Credere (Latin for &quot;to see is to believe&quot;), a UK human rights charity. Videre describes itself as giving &quot;local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations. This captured footage is verified, analysed and then distributed to those who can create change.&quot; He participates alongside movie producer Uri Fruchtmann, music producer Brian Eno and executive director of Greenpeace UK John Sauven.
