<text>The Cardinal of the Kremlin is an espionage thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on May 20, 1988. A direct sequel to &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984), it features CIA analyst Jack Ryan as he extracts CARDINAL, the agency&#x27;s highest placed agent in the Soviet government who is being pursued by the KGB, as well as the Soviet intelligence agency&#x27;s director. The novel also features the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a real-life missile-defense system developed by the United States during that time, and its Russian counterpart. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list.

==Plot==
For thirty years, Colonel Mikhail Semyonovich &quot;Misha&quot; Filitov, a personal aide to the Soviet Minister of Defense and war hero, has been passing military, technical, and political intelligence to the CIA as their highest agent-in-place, codenamed CARDINAL. His latest mission concerns a Soviet anti-ballistic missile research project codenamed &quot;Bright Star&quot;, based at a secret defense installation located 50 km southeast of Dushanbe, Tajik SSR.

Colonel Filitov sends Gennady Bondarenko, a Soviet colonel skilled with lasers, to Dushanbe to evaluate the facility and unwittingly procure information that Misha will then send to his CIA contacts. Unfortunately, a minor slip-up in passing Filitov&#x27;s intelligence alerts the KGB, which then aggressively pursues the couriers involved. They later become suspicious of Filitov and place him under surveillance. The courier chain having been quickly shut down by the CIA station chief in Moscow, Edward Foley, Filitov&#x27;s more important intelligence on Bright Star is delayed; however, he reveals the presence of a KGB agent infiltrating Bright Star&#x27;s counterpart, Tea Clipper, which alarms the CIA.

The CIA then tasks Foley with extracting CARDINAL out of the country. However, when his wife Mary Pat, also a CIA agent, attempts to make a brush pass to Filitov, the two are arrested by the KGB. The Foleys are then declared &quot;persona non grata&quot;, while Filitov is imprisoned and psychologically tortured until he eventually confesses to his crimes. In an effort to salvage the mission, CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who had now learned of CARDINAL&#x27;s identity, concocts a plan to secure the return of Filitov and at the same time force the defection of KGB chairman Nikolay Gerasimov, who has been vying for the position of General Secretary since Filitov&#x27;s arrest; Ryan tries to prevent his ascension to power due to his anti-American ideology.

Ryan, who is part of the American arms negotiation team, travels to Moscow for the arms reduction talks. There he meets Gerasimov, and blackmails him into releasing Filitov and betraying his country; if his demands are not met, he will reveal what actually happened to the Soviet ballistic missile submarine &quot;Red October&quot;, which would disgrace the KGB chairman, who had used the incident to consolidate the KGB&#x27;s control over the military. As counter-leverage should he refuse to defect, Gerasimov arranges for the kidnapping of Tea Clipper&#x27;s top SDI researcher, Major Alan Gregory.

Gregory&#x27;s kidnapping was undertaken by KGB agent Tania Bisyarina, who has been handling a mole inside Tea Clipper. The mole, a lesbian named Dr. Beatrice Taussig who unluckily falls in love with Gregory&#x27;s fiancée, eventually gives up Bisyarina to the FBI out of guilt, and the Hostage Rescue Team later saves Gregory from his Soviet captors in a shabby desert safe house in New Mexico. Ryan later informs Gerasimov, who finally caves into his demands. The KGB chairman&#x27;s wife and daughter are later extracted by CIA operative John Clark from Estonia into the submarine . Meanwhile, the secret ABM facility in Dushanbe finds itself under attack by the Afghan mudjahedin, whose leader was known as &quot;the Archer&quot; due to his expertise in using surface-to-air missiles to bring down Soviet ground support aircraft. Colonel Bondarenko, who was there for a second round of evaluations, manages to repel the attackers, protecting Bright Star&#x27;s scientific and engineering personnel and eventually killing the Archer.

On the last day of the arms negotiation talks, Gerasimov releases Filitov so that they can both proceed to Sheremetyevo Airport, joining Ryan and the American negotiation team in returning to the United States. They successfully board the American delegation&#x27;s aircraft, but Ryan allows himself to be captured by KGB officer Sergey Golovko, who is his counterpart in the arms talks and had become aware of their planned departure. He is then led to the private dacha of General Secretary Narmonov, where they discuss the CIA&#x27;s interest in his political position and interference in the Soviet Union&#x27;s internal security. Meanwhile, a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 attempts to force the American delegation&#x27;s plane to return to Russia, but the delagation plane successfully evades. 

Filitov, who was extensively debriefed by the CIA, later dies due to heart disease. He was buried at Camp David, within twenty miles of the Antietam battlefield. His funeral was attended by Ryan and the Gregorys, among others, as well as a Soviet military attaché who questions why Filitov would be buried close to American soldiers. Ryan, always working to keep the peace, explains to him, &quot;One way or another, we all fight for what we believe in. Doesn&#x27;t that give us some common ground?&quot;

==Themes==
&quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; is considered to be Clancy&#x27;s primary example of a traditional espionage novel until &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; (2002). It included “a near fetishist attention to the details of the tradecraft of spying and an exploration of the individuals who take up this dangerous vocation”. In addition, the book was written during the time of Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev’s rule, which was considered by historians as a crucial point in world history where Communism in the Soviet Union began its decline. Clancy affirms his opinion that with reformers in the Soviet government like Gorbachev, the country will be more likely to establish a shift in its relations between the United States, which was later made possible by the dissolution of the country three years later.

The book was also written at the time of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, as well as the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons. They were both featured in the novel. It also continues elements set forth in previous novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984), including Filitov and Ramius’s similarities in motivation for committing treason against their own country.

==Reception==
The book became the bestselling novel of the year, selling 1,277,000 hardcover copies. It received positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised the book as &quot;less reliant on technoblather than previous Clancy works, and awash in subplots, most of them entertaining. Plenty of action; no mushy stuff.&quot; In Robert Lekachman&#x27;s review of the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he hailed it as &quot;by far the best of the Jack Ryan series&quot;, adding: &quot;While his prose is no better than workmanlike (the genre does not, after all, attract many budding Flauberts), the unmasking of the title&#x27;s secret agent, the Cardinal, is as sophisticated an exercise in the craft of espionage as I have yet to encounter.&quot; Bob Woodward, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, regarded the book as &quot;a great spy novel&quot; which &quot;rivals Clancy&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, surpasses his &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and runs circles around his &quot;Patriot Games&quot;&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Video game===
&quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; is also the title of a 1991 video game based on the novel, which is a global management simulation developed for Amiga.

===Film===
After the release of &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), a film based on the book was planned. Writers such as John Milius, and Lee and Janet Scott Batchler were considered to write the screenplay adaptation, but it was deemed too difficult to adapt, resulting in producer Mace Neufeld purchasing the rights to &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;. Harrison Ford was set to reprise his role as Jack Ryan, co-starring with William Shatner.

<text>Debt of Honor is a techno-thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on August 17, 1994. A direct sequel to &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (1991), Jack Ryan becomes the National Security Advisor when a secret cabal of Japanese industrialists seize control of their country&#x27;s government and wage war on the United States. The book debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list. The novel was later noted as containing plot elements which were similar to the circumstances of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93.

==Plot ==
Japanese industrialist Raizo Yamata has been plotting to bring back his country to a position of greatness for years, partly as revenge for the death of his family at the hands of American forces invading the island of Saipan during World War II. His opportunity comes when a car accident in East Tennessee, caused by faulty gas tanks made in Japan, results in the deaths of six Americans. The incident leads to the swift passage of a law allowing the U.S. to mirror trade practices of the countries from which it imports goods, cutting off the American export markets upon which the Japanese economy depends. Facing an economic crisis, Japan&#x27;s ruling zaibatsu, led by Yamata, decides to take economic and military action against the United States. Along with covert support from China and India, they plot to curtail the U.S. presence in the Pacific and re-establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After the Japanese Prime Minister Mogataru Koga resigns in disgrace due to the economic situation, the zaibatsu installs Hiroshi Goto, an aggressive nationalist and critic of the U.S., to succeed him. Meanwhile, Japan has covertly developed nuclear weapons, and with SS-19 designs bought from the former Soviet Union, has fabricated and deployed several ICBMs.

Japan launches the first phase of its assault, sending Self-Defense Force units to occupy the Mariana Islands, specifically Saipan and Guam, without casualties. Also, during a joint military exercise, Japanese ships &quot;accidentally&quot; launch torpedoes at the U.S. Pacific Fleet, destroying two submarines and crippling two aircraft carriers. An immediate retaliation is forestalled by the second phase of the Japanese offensive: an economic attack, where Japan engineers the collapse of the U.S. stock market by hiring a programmer who is a consultant for an exchange firm to insert a logic bomb into the system, which when triggered blocks the storage of all trade records made after noon on Friday. They also assassinate the President of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Japanese government then immediately sue for peace, offering international talks and seemingly free elections in the Marianas to delay a U.S. response.

Meanwhile, Jack Ryan is pulled out of retirement from government service by U.S. President Roger Durling, who appoints him as National Security Advisor. Despite his typical focus on military issues, he advises the president to deal with the economic crisis first, realizing that Japan&#x27;s deletion of trade records could be an advantage in responding to the economic threat. He engineers a &quot;do-over&quot;, where all of the transactions that were deleted on the day of the mass deletion are ignored and all trade information is restored to its condition at noon of that day. The U.S. stock market is successfully restored with only minor disruption, and a group of U.S. investment banks start a massive economic unloading of Japanese investment products, effectively eliminating any gains made by the zaibatsu.

The United States military then proceeds to launch a counterattack on their Japanese counterparts using whatever resources they have. In a staged accident, CIA operatives John Clark and Domingo Chavez blind two incoming Japanese E-767 pilots with a Dazzler that causes them to crash upon landing. The U.S. Air Force then proceeds to eliminate the rest of Japan&#x27;s AWACS system through low-profile military attacks using widely dispersed U.S. assets, allowing B-2 bombers to destroy the hidden ICBM silos. They later use an attack by stealthy F-22 fighters to further damage Japan&#x27;s air defenses. An Army special operations team is airdropped into Japan to support covertly inserted Comanche helicopters. One helicopter is used to attack another AWACS plane with air-to-air missiles while several others use Hellfire missiles to kill members of Yamata&#x27;s cabal. Meanwhile, Admiral Robby Jackson liberates the Marianas with few casualties by using a combination of cruise missiles and carrier air attacks to severely damage the Japanese aircraft stationed on the islands, which forces the Japanese commander to surrender his troops.

Outmaneuvered and cornered by the United States&#x27; military and economic response, Goto resigns, ceding power to his predecessor Koga, who was rescued earlier by Clark and Chavez from Yamata. Yamata and his surviving conspirators are arrested for treason, and the new Japanese government accepts the generous U.S. offer of &quot;status quo ante&quot;.

Throughout the book, President Durling faces another political crisis: Vice President Ed Kealty is forced to resign after being accused of rape. With the crisis over, President Durling nominates Ryan as vice president for successfully handling the crisis. However, an embittered Japan Air Lines pilot, driven mad by the deaths of his son and brother during the conflict, flies his Boeing 747 directly into the U.S. Capitol during a special joint session of Congress. The president, as well as nearly the entire Congress, the Supreme Court, and many other members of the federal government, are all killed in the attack. Ryan, who was on his way to be sworn as vice president after being confirmed, narrowly escapes the explosion. He becomes the President of the United States and takes his oath of office before a district judge in the CNN studios in Washington.

==Themes==
&quot;Debt of Honor&quot; was released during a time of American resentment towards the Japanese, which was further popularized by the publication of Michael Crichton&#x27;s crime thriller novel &quot;Rising Sun&quot; in 1992.

The novel also reinforces Clancy&#x27;s belief that the recent downsizing of the military establishment after the Cold War &quot;has so depleted our military resources that the country is vulnerable to aggression that can arise anywhere, anytime&quot;, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s review of the book.

==Reception==
The novel received mixed reviews. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised Clancy, who &quot;spins out story threads in a rich but bewildering tangle of plot and setting, then vigorously weaves them together. Here, the heart-stopping climax is unexpected, but oddly appropriate.&quot; However, Christopher Buckley, in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the book a &quot;herniating experience&quot;, criticized its &quot;racist&quot; depictions of Japanese characters and judged that it was &quot;as subtle as a World War II anti-Japanese poster showing a mustachioed Tojo bayoneting Caucasian babies&quot;.

==Legacy==
In later years, the novel was noted for its similarity to the circumstances surrounding United Airlines Flight 93, especially regarding its climax, where an embittered Japanese pilot crashes his 747 on a joint session of Congress in the Capitol. While researching for the novel&#x27;s ending, Clancy consulted an Air Force officer and described his reaction: &quot;I ran this idea past him and all of a sudden this guy&#x27;s eyeballing me rather closely and I said, &#x27;Come on General, I know you must have looked at this before, you&#x27;ve got to have a plan for it.&#x27; And the guy goes, &#x27;Mr. Clancy, to the best of my knowledge, if we had a plan to deal with this, it would be secret, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to talk to you about it, but to the best of my knowledge we&#x27;ve never looked at this possibility before.&#x27;&quot;

In April 1995, United States senator Sam Nunn outlined a scenario similar to the novel&#x27;s ending, in which terrorists attack the Capitol on the night of a State of the Union address by crashing a radio-controlled airplane filled with chemical weapons into it. Nunn concluded that the scenario is &quot;not far-fetched&quot; and that the required technology is readily available. However, the 9/11 Commission Report revealed that national security officials did not consider the possibility: “[Counterterror official] Richard Clarke told us that he was concerned about the danger posed by aircraft in the context of protecting the Atlanta Olympics of 1996, the White House complex, and the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa. But he attributed his awareness more to Tom Clancy novels than to warnings from the intelligence community.”

In the aftermath of the attacks, Clancy was called into CNN and commented on the similarity between a plane crash depicted in the novel and the crash of United Flight 93. CNN anchor Judy Woodruff later remarked: &quot;People in our newsroom have been saying today that what is happening is like right out of a Tom Clancy novel.&quot;

<text>John Patrick Ryan Sr. (Hon.), nicknamed Jack, is a fictional character created by author Tom Clancy and featured in his &quot;Ryanverse&quot; novels, which have consistently topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list over 30 years. Since Clancy&#x27;s death in 2013, five other authors, Mark Greaney, Grant Blackwood, Mike Maden, Marc Cameron and Don Bentley, have continued writing new novels for the franchise and its other connecting series with the approval of the Clancy family estate.

The son of a Baltimore police detective and a nurse, Ryan is a former U.S. Marine and stockbroker who becomes a civilian history professor at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). Ryan works with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) initially as a MITRE contractor before becoming an analyst and occasional field officer, eventually leading it as Deputy Director. After retiring from the CIA, Ryan later served as National Security Advisor and Vice President before suddenly becoming President of the United States following a terrorist attack on the United States Capitol. Ryan went on to serve two non-consecutive terms and mostly dealt with international crises in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Clancy told Robert Gates that &quot;You know, for the first several novels, I pretty much modeled Ryan’s career on yours.&quot;

Jack Ryan has been portrayed in adaptations by actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine, and John Krasinski. The film series from 1990 to 2014 have an unadjusted worldwide gross revenue of $788.4 million to date, making it the 57th-highest-grossing film series. The Amazon Prime Video series ran from 2018 to 2023.

==Fictional biography==
===Early life===
Ryan was born on May 17, 1950 to an Irish Catholic family in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, Emmet William Ryan, was a Baltimore Police Department homicide lieutenant and World War II veteran. The elder Ryan had served with Easy Company, 506th Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division at the Battle of the Bulge. His mother, Catherine Burke Ryan, was a nurse. &quot;Patriot Games&quot; mentioned that he had a sister, who lived in Seattle. &quot;Without Remorse&quot; mentioned that his sister is younger than he, and that he wanted to join the Marines to get a scholarship so the family would have more money for her education. After graduating from Loyola High School, a Catholic Jesuit prep school in Towson, Maryland in suburban Baltimore County, Ryan attended Boston College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics (with a strong minor in history), and was a rower. He commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps via the USMC Officer Candidates School. While waiting for the Corps to assign him, he passed the Certified Public Accountant exam.

After officer training at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, Ryan went on to serve briefly as a Marine infantry platoon leader. However, his military career was cut short at the age of 23 when his platoon&#x27;s helicopter, a CH-46 Sea Knight, crashed during a NATO exercise over the Greek island of Crete. The crash badly injured Ryan&#x27;s back. Surgeons at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland inadequately repaired his back. This led to a lengthy recovery process (during which he became addicted to pain medications) after which, complete with a permanent disability and wearing a back brace, he was discharged from the Marine Corps. He passed his stockbroker&#x27;s exam and took a position with Wall Street investment firm Merrill Lynch&#x27;s Baltimore office.

Ryan&#x27;s parents died in a plane crash at Chicago Midway International Airport 19 months after his crash in Crete. He developed a fear of flying that persisted for years.

The film version of &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; changed Ryan&#x27;s educational background to being a 1972 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. As &quot;Red October&quot; is sailing into the Penobscot River in Maine, Ryan says that he grew up in that area. In the film, it is also said the helicopter crash happened in his third year at the academy and he finished his senior year from his hospital bed. The film version of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; also implies that he is a graduate of Annapolis by briefly showing a certificate on the wall of their home. In the Amazon Prime television series, &quot;Jack Ryan&quot;, Ryan has earned a Ph.D. in economics, rather than simply an B.A.

===Civilian career===
While managing clients&#x27; portfolios, Ryan began to invest his own money, banking on a tip he had received from an uncle about the workers&#x27; takeover of the Chicago and North Western Railway, making about $6 million off his $100,000 initial investment. He did so well that one of Merrill Lynch&#x27;s senior vice presidents, Joe Mueller, came to Baltimore to have dinner with him, with the objective of inviting him to the firm&#x27;s New York City headquarters near Wall Street. Also present is Mueller&#x27;s daughter Caroline, nicknamed Cathy, then a senior medical student at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. They immediately fall in love and get engaged.

One night, while having dinner with his fiancée, Ryan throws out his back. Cathy takes him directly to Dr. Stanley Rabinowitz, professor of neurosurgery at famed Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, to be evaluated. Rabinowitz later operates on Ryan&#x27;s back and cures his chronic pain in relatively short order. (In a later novel, the surgeon is credited as Sam Rosen, a doctor introduced in &quot;Without Remorse&quot;.) Ryan subsequently persuades the government to terminate his disability checks. Cathy later becomes an ophthalmic surgeon at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins.

After creating a net worth of $8 million, Ryan left the firm after four years and enrolled at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. for six doctoral courses in history. He does a brief stint at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, then accepts a position at the U.S. Naval Academy as a civilian professor of history. In addition, he has also written books on naval history: &quot;Options and Decisions&quot;, &quot;Doomed Eagles&quot;, and &quot;Fighting Sailor&quot;, a biography of World War II Admiral William &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey, in which he justifies Halsey&#x27;s actions during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

===First CIA work and career===
Following a recommendation from Father Tim O&#x27;Riley, a Jesuit priest and professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to a Central Intelligence Agency contact, Ryan was asked to work as a consultant for the agency, although officially employed by the MITRE Corporation. He agreed and spent several months at agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, where he wrote a paper entitled &quot;Agents and Agencies&quot;, in which he maintained that state-sponsored terrorism is an act of war. He also invented the canary trap, a method for exposing an information leak, which involves giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of a group of suspects and seeing which version is leaked. By ensuring that each copy of the document differs slightly in its wording, if any copy is leaked, then it is possible to determine the informant&#x27;s identity.

These accomplishments come to the attention of U.S. Navy Vice Admiral James Greer, the CIA&#x27;s Deputy Director for Intelligence. The expertise of Ryan&#x27;s report, plus the application, persuaded Greer to offer him a permanent job in the CIA, but Ryan declined.

====&quot;Patriot Games&quot; (July 1987)====

While in London with his family in 1981, Ryan (portrayed by Harrison Ford in the film) stumbles upon a kidnapping attempt on the Prince of Wales and his family (in the film: Lord Holmes, a cousin of the Queen), which is orchestrated by Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army. He foils the attack by killing one gunman while injuring another and gets wounded in the process. Ryan is later knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as an honorary Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order; in the books, some British characters call him &quot;Sir John&quot; even though honorary knights are not permitted to use the style of &quot;Sir&quot;.

Sean Miller, the Irish gunman Ryan wounded, was sentenced to life imprisonment but is freed by his ULA compatriots, embittered over the failure of the kidnapping attempt, and particularly the death of his brother at Ryan&#x27;s hands in that attempt, he exacts revenge on Ryan by attacking his wife and daughter. After pleas by Greer, Ryan agrees to join the CIA in a permanent position as an analyst, originally to gather intelligence on the ULA. Later, Miller and his men stage another kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales, who are visiting the Ryan family in their Maryland home; however, they are overpowered by the combined efforts of Ryan, his friend Robert &quot;Robby&quot; Jackson, and the Prince as well as law enforcement and naval officers who are nearby. After the ordeal, Ryan&#x27;s second child Jack Ryan Jr. was born.

====&quot;Red Rabbit&quot; (August 05, 2002)====
Ryan&#x27;s first CIA assignment is to London as a member of a liaison group to the British Secret Intelligence Service. Initially called in to assess the Soviet government and economy, Ryan is later tasked to assist in the defection of a KGB communications officer who has discovered that his boss Yuri Andropov had ordered Pope John Paul II&#x27;s assassination. Although Ryan and a small team of British SIS agents helps the &quot;Rabbit&quot; and his family get to the West, they fail to prevent the attack on the Pope (which actually happened in real life in 1981). Nevertheless, the pope is only wounded and his would-be assassin captured, while the British execute his Bulgarian handler. &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s&quot; defection proves to be a major coup for both the American and British intelligence agencies. Ryan soon afterward suggests a nonmilitary long-term strategy to help hasten the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse and the end of the Cold War.

====&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (October 01, 1984)====
Captain First Rank Marko Aleksandrovich Ramius, the Soviet Navy&#x27;s top submarine commander, takes command of the &quot;Красный Октябрь&quot; (&quot;Krasny Oktyabr&quot;, or in English, &quot;Red October&quot;), the newest Typhoon-class ballistic missile submarine, with which he plans to defect with his officers. Having briefly met Captain Ramius at an embassy function several years before, Ryan (portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film) is asked by Admiral Greer to brief the President&#x27;s National Security Adviser Jeffrey Pelt and his staff, in his first trip to the White House, on Ramius&#x27; background and the deadly new capabilities of &quot;Red October&quot; secret revolutionary silent jet propulsion drive system. Ryan recognizes that the renegade ethnic Lithuanian captain may want to defect rather than attack the West. Ryan works to establish contact with him and support contingency efforts of the tailing American submarine &quot;USS Dallas&quot;. Ryan seeks to get Ramius and members of his crew along with the submarine secretly into the U.S., eventually succeeding.

====&quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (May 20, 1988)====
Ryan is reassigned to the CIA headquarters at Langley and becomes Admiral Greer&#x27;s special assistant. He is sent to Moscow as part of the American nuclear weapons reduction (START) team, and later engineers the extraction of CARDINAL, CIA&#x27;s highest agent-in-place, from the country. Along the way, he also forces KGB chairman Nikolay Gerasimov to defect due to his anti-American nature, which could jeopardize the arms reduction talks once he becomes General Secretary. His plan involves a disinformation campaign that shows himself under SEC investigation for insider trading, which provides an opening for Gerasimov to help Ryan defect to the Soviet Union and work for the KGB.

====&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (August 17, 1989)====
Ryan (portrayed by Harrison Ford in the film) is promoted to acting DDI when Greer is hospitalized with cancer. Despite this, he is not made aware of a highly covert and illegal CIA operation, encouraged by the president, which claimed that domestic drug abuse was a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to American security, and approved by corrupt National Security Advisor Admiral James Cutter. This operation targets Colombian drug lords in South America using light infantry troops of Hispanic descent and occasional precision air strikes with sophisticated &quot;smartbombs&quot;, in what is usually considered a law enforcement area. Ryan works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to rescue a small group of American soldiers cut off in Colombia, forcing him to miss Greer&#x27;s funeral. Also in this operation, he first met the U.S. government operative John Clark, with whom he would become friends. Around this time, Ryan also runs afoul of Elizabeth Elliot, international affairs advisor to then-presidential candidate Governor of Ohio J. Robert Fowler, and one of Cathy Ryan&#x27;s former professors.

====&quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (August 14, 1991)====
Ryan (portrayed by Ben Affleck in the film) reaches his highest post at the CIA, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. His career is jeopardized when Fowler becomes President and Elizabeth Elliott, Fowler&#x27;s lover/manipulator, becomes National Security Advisor. They not only deny Ryan any credit for an innovative Middle East peace plan (basically turning Jerusalem into a Vatican-like city co-ruled by three Christian, Jewish, and Arab/Muslim mayors), but also panic when Palestinian and former East German terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in Denver during the Super Bowl and nearly plunge the world into a Soviet-American nuclear war. Ryan defuses the nuclear crisis by commandeering the Washington-Moscow hot line and convincing the Soviet Premier (through his friend Golovko) that the crisis is a setup. He then refuses to confirm Fowler&#x27;s order to launch a nuclear missile at Qom (thus preventing the attack), where the Iranian ayatollah lives. The crisis and Elliot scandal drives Fowler to resign. On this note, Ryan retires from the CIA and flies to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia to witness the execution of the surviving terrorists, and is then honored by the U.S.&#x27;s Middle Eastern allies by being presented with the sword used to execute the terrorists.

The film again departs from the novel, by presenting a younger, unmarried Ryan, an intelligent mistress-free Fowler, a Greer-like Cabot, and the nuclear bomb is detonated over the city of Baltimore instead of Denver. The film also changes the identity of the terrorists from Arabs to neo-Nazis.

====&quot;Debt of Honor&quot; (August 17, 1994)====
After a brief stint as a stockbroker, Ryan returns to government service as the National Security Advisor, restoring honor to the job that Cutter and Elliot disgraced. It has been two and a half years since Fowler resigned and his vice president, Roger Durling, is now well into his own term. Jack and the administration must deal with a second war between the U.S. and Japan, as well as an attack on America&#x27;s economic infrastructure. After a clean sweep of Japan&#x27;s forces in the South Pacific, Vice President Ed Kealty is forced to resign after a sex scandal and President Durling taps Ryan for the job. Ryan accepts the job on the condition that he will only serve until the end of Durling&#x27;s term, and sees this as a way of ending his public life. Only minutes after Congress confirms Ryan, though, a Japanese airline pilot deliberately crashes a 747 into the U.S. Capitol building during Congress&#x27;s joint session, killing most of the people inside, decapitating the U.S. government, and elevating Ryan to the presidency.

===First Ryan administration===
====&quot;Executive Orders&quot; (July 01, 1996)====
The reluctant yet determined Ryan administration emerges as Ryan slowly rebuilds the government. He is faced with Kealty&#x27;s political trickery, as the former vice president disputes his legitimacy as the nation&#x27;s chief executive by publicly stating that he never actually resigned, when in fact a member of his staff had secretly taken the resignation letter from the office of the now-dead Secretary of State and destroyed it. Initially the lone voice of opposition to Ryan&#x27;s policies on live television, he later enlists disaffected CIA intelligence officials (affected by the reduction in force at the agency in favor of more field operatives) to procure classified information on Ryan from his time in the CIA. He then suborns NBC news anchor and fellow Ryan critic Tom Donner into ambushing him with questions about his CIA career in a televised interview. Donner&#x27;s colleague John Plumber later realizes his mistake and publicly apologizes to President Ryan, while Kealty&#x27;s challenge eventually fails in court.

Along the way, Ryan also has to deal with the dictator of the new United Islamic Republic (a coalition of Iran and Iraq), the Ayatollah Mahmoud Haji Daryaei. The ayatollah regards him as a weakling and seizes the opportunity to stage a multi-pronged attack on the country: a biological attack using a weaponized strain of the Ebola virus, a kidnapping attempt on his youngest daughter Katie, and an assassination attempt on himself through an Iranian sleeper agent disguised as a Secret Service bodyguard; with the U.S. overwhelmed by a multitude of crises, he believes that he can invade Saudi Arabia with little military opposition from the U.S. While the attempt on Katie was swiftly averted by the FBI and the Secret Service, the Ebola epidemic causes Ryan to declare martial law and enforce a travel ban that becomes instrumental in killing the virus, since it cannot survive in the American environment due to its fragile nature. He later deploys what is left of the American military to assist Saudi and Kuwaiti forces in repelling the UIR military, which also becomes successful. The would-be assassin is later arrested on the spot by the FBI after attempting to kill President Ryan inside the Oval Office.

=====Ryan Doctrine=====
At the end of &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, Ryan, in the tradition of Presidents Monroe, Truman, Carter and Reagan, issues a foreign policy doctrine which largely defines his administration&#x27;s international perspective. The Ryan Doctrine states that the U.S. will no longer tolerate attacks on &quot;our territory, our possessions, or our citizens,&quot; and will hold whoever orders such attacks accountable.

This statement comes soon after the Ebola attack on the U.S. ordered by Daryaei. Ryan announces the new doctrine on television, momentarily cutting away to show Daryaei and his UIR advisors being incinerated by laser-guided bombs launched from two F-117s, on Ryan&#x27;s orders. Therefore, the Ryan doctrine supersedes the executive order put in place by President Ford, which forbids the assassination of foreign heads of state. Ryan, however, believes it is a more ethical alternative than total war, since it punishes the person responsible for the attack instead of the people he rules.

Within the books, the Ryan doctrine is not officially invoked after Daryaei&#x27;s death (although Ryan threatens to use it on the Chinese leadership in &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, should anything happen to American citizens living in China as a consequence of the Siberian War).

====&quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; (August 21, 2000)====
Ryan has completed Durling&#x27;s term as president and has campaigned for the next election, which he wins. He retains most of his emergency Cabinet and has Robby Jackson as vice president. He has to deal with the attempted assassination of Golovko, who is now head of Russia&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Service (formerly the KGB). This turns out to be an attempt to sow confusion in the Russian government because of China&#x27;s designs to annex Eastern Siberia, where geologists had recently discovered a large amount of oil and gold. These events lead to the inclusion of Russia into NATO and the assistance of U.S. forces in the Sino-Russian conflict (although attacks on NATO members outside the Atlantic should not trigger Article V).

When the Chinese begin losing the war, U.S. forces target their strategic assets. A U.S. submarine sinks a Chinese ballistic missile submarine, causing the Chinese Politburo to panic and increase the readiness of their 12 land-based ICBMs. U.S. forces do not have the ability to destroy the silos, as they could only use deep-penetrating bombs, which had all been used to destroy Chinese bridges to disrupt the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s (PLA) logistical support. This causes the U.S. and Russia to send a joint RAINBOW-Spetsnaz team to destroy the silos. They destroy 11 of the 12 ICBMs, but one of them manages to launch and head towards Washington, DC, and with Ryan taking a command initiative at an Aegis missile cruiser, the ICBM is intercepted by ABMs from the .

With the PLA&#x27;s looming defeat in Siberia, which they were about to learn about via live UAV broadcasts from the CIA through the Internet, student demonstrators in Beijing raid a Politburo meeting, causing reformist minister Fang Gan to take control and arrest the war&#x27;s perpetrators, making peace negotiations with the U.S. and Russia, and beginning China&#x27;s transition to democracy.

=====The Campus=====
Following this, Ryan apparently completes his term and refuses to run for a second elected term. Robby Jackson thus campaigns to become the first African American President, but he is assassinated by the Ku Klux Klan on a trip to the South, enabling Kealty, his opponent, to become the next President by default. Before Ryan leaves office, he creates The Campus, a covert counter-terrorism organization that fronts as Hendley Associates, a financial trading firm. He also writes 100 presidential pardons for its members, with Attorney General Pat Martin&#x27;s assistance.

===Second Ryan administration===
====&quot;Dead or Alive&quot; (December 07, 2010)====
In his retirement, Ryan is living easy with a net worth of over $80 million. He is working on two versions of his memoirs, one for immediate release, and another detailing his CIA career to be published twenty years after his death. While he is at first publicly silent about his opinion on President Kealty&#x27;s policies, he becomes increasingly frustrated with the direction in which he is taking the country. Ultimately, he announces that he will come out of retirement to run for a second full term as a Republican presidential candidate. Despite not being originally involved in the Campus&#x27; activities due to his high-profile status, he gradually becomes more directly linked to the Campus&#x27; operations, aiding them from behind the scenes on occasion. Here, Ryan learns his son, Jack Jr., is a field operative of the Campus, a fact which he reluctantly accepts.

====&quot;Locked On&quot; (December 13, 2011)====
Ryan campaigns against Kealty, facing off against him in various televised debates. It becomes apparent that Ryan will win the election, as the majority of Americans had never entirely accepted Kealty. Despite the efforts of Paul Laska, a high-profile Czech billionaire and a devout enemy of Ryan, and key members of the Kealty administration who labelled Ryan&#x27;s longtime friend John Clark a fugitive in an effort to expose the Campus (as well as tying Ryan to it by association), Ryan narrowly wins the election, overcoming all of Kealty&#x27;s efforts to harm him.

====&quot;Threat Vector&quot; (December 04, 2012)====
Soon after returning to the presidency, Ryan deals with a developing crisis in China, where President Wei Zhen Lin has declared his intentions to annex Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan and expand his country&#x27;s territory into the South China Sea in a desperate attempt to recoup his country&#x27;s economic losses. In reality, PLA Chairman Su Ke Qiang has been manipulating President Wei for his expansionist policies, secretly sanctioning cyber attacks on America&#x27;s infrastructure that compromises the nation&#x27;s national security apparatus. President Ryan decides to take action by supporting Taiwan, along with India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which would also be affected by an expansion of China&#x27;s territory.

The Campus later tracks down the nerve center of China&#x27;s cyberattacks on the U.S. to an office building in Guangzhou. President Ryan orders the destruction of the building, decapitating China&#x27;s cyberwarfare abilities. He makes contact with Wei and warns him that the cyber attacks are considered an act of war on China&#x27;s part. After realizing that he has been used by Su for his own gain, Wei intentionally divulges information on Chairman Su&#x27;s whereabouts, which Ryan interprets as a request from the Chinese president to assassinate the military leader. The Campus, with aid from a local rebel force and the FSB, later carry out a false flag attack on Chairman Su&#x27;s motorcade outside Beijing. Ryan announces a blockade of China&#x27;s oil supplies until the war effort is abandoned, calling upon Wei and the Politburo to accept defeat. A cornered Wei later commits suicide, eventually ending the conflict between the United States and China.

====&quot;Command Authority&quot; (December 03, 2013)====
The Ryan administration then contends with newly elected Russian president Valeri Volodin, who is a dedicated communist seeking to restore Russia to its former glory. Volodin had merged the SVR and the FSB into one entity to be led by enigmatic FSB head Roman Talanov, and later decides to invade Ukraine all the way to the capital of Kyiv. President Ryan sends American military forces to counter Russia&#x27;s advance into Kyiv.

Ryan later finds out that Talanov is Zenith, a KGB assassin from the Cold War. Volodin had been his control officer, and together they had been employed by rogue elements within the KGB, who had an exit strategy in mind with the imminent fall of communism in the late 1980s by siphoning off billions of dollars from Soviet programs. Volodin then double-crossed his co-conspirators by ordering Talanov as Zenith to kill them all, as well as the bankers involved in order to prevent exposure to the rest of the KGB. In addition, Talanov was planted by his boss into Russian crime organization Seven Strong Men, rising in ranks to become its eventual leader and turning it into a tool for Volodin&#x27;s policies. Ryan uses this information to blackmail the Russian president into stopping the Russian Army&#x27;s advance into Kyiv. Talanov resigns and is later murdered.

====&quot;Full Force and Effect&quot; (2014)====
President Ryan deals with North Korean dictator Choi Ji-hoon, who attempts to start production at a rare earth mineral deposit found in their territory and then use the resulting billions of dollars in profit to purchase nuclear weapons technology. Choi decides to order the assassination of the American leader (with the aid of a Mexican drug cartel and an Arab bomb maker) in order to stop his persistent interference. During a state visit to Mexico City, Ryan barely survives the attempt on his life. The Campus later uncovers Choi&#x27;s involvement in the incident, which leads to the dictator being deposed from power and later executed.

====&quot;Commander in Chief&quot; (2015)====
Ryan squares off with Volodin once again, as he observes that a series of seemingly isolated attacks in Europe correspond with an increase in Russia&#x27;s oil profit. He tries to convince NATO, but they dispute his theory, fearing the consequences of an all-out war. Nevertheless, he sends the United States Navy to dispatch its Russian counterpart in the Baltic Sea. Volodin is later assassinated by the siloviki after his gambit of a covert violent offensive in an effort to recoup Russia&#x27;s economic losses fails.

====&quot;True Faith and Allegiance&quot; (2016)====
President Ryan faces a crisis where American military and intelligence personnel are being targeted by ISIS. The specificity of the target packages make it clear that a massive intelligence breach has occurred. President Ryan finds himself pressured by the media and some of his government advisers to send troops into the Middle East to fight the Islamic State terrorists, but he resists and gathers more intelligence. The culprit was later revealed to be a Romanian hacker, who had obtained an old copy of a database containing personal information on military and intelligence personnel. After footage of terrorist attacks released by ISIS inspires a wave of copycat attacks in the United States, President Ryan orders the bombing of the headquarters of Islamic State&#x27;s propaganda wing.

Ryan then appears in &quot;Point of Contact&quot; (2017) as he attends a funeral for his son Jack Junior&#x27;s colleague in Hendley Associates, Paul Brown, who was revealed as a former CIA officer who had helped avert a North Korean plot to crash the Asian stock market.

====&quot;Power and Empire&quot; (2017)====
Ryan deals with the Chinese once again, as a series of seemingly unrelated attacks in Asia, Europe, and Africa show their involvement. The Campus later discovers that a secret cabal composed of hardliners within the Chinese government are plotting to depose current president Zhao Chengzhi for his moderate stance on several issues of importance. The cabal plans to make Zhao look reckless, provoking Ryan to invoke the Ryan Doctrine and have him killed. Jack Ryan Jr. later prevents an assassination attempt on his father and President Zhao in the G20 summit in Tokyo, and the conspirators are later arrested for treason.

Ryan briefly appears in the next released novel &quot;Line of Sight&quot; (2018), where he orders the destruction of a building in Bosnia containing stolen thermobaric warheads to be launched by Serb extremists on a Serbian Orthodox Church event nearby as a false flag attack to provoke war between NATO and the Russians in the Balkans.

====&quot;Oath of Office&quot; (2018)====
President Ryan is faced with a multitude of crises. A flu epidemic as well as spring floods occur in the southeast United States, and Ryan has to deal with his political rival, senator Michelle Chadwick, who has been attacking him using bot-planted fake news stories. He sends the Secret Service to protect her from imminent assassination, and an attempt by Russian foreign intelligence was thwarted. President Ryan later delivers a presidential address showing the dangers of fake news. Overseas, Ryan has to deal with Russia plotting to invade Ukraine yet again disguised as a military exercise, as well as the siege of the United States embassy in Cameroon by the Cameroonian government eager on arresting its opposition leader.

President Ryan expresses caution over a series of protests in Iran, favorably dubbed the Persian Spring. His suspicion was proven true when it was revealed that the leader of the dissidents, Reza Kazem, was a proxy made by the Iranian government on behalf of rogue elements in the Russian government, who have stolen nuclear weapons and are intent on launching them on American military bases in or near Iran. Kazem reneges on his deal and plots to launch the missiles into low Earth orbit, creating space junk that would destroy several satellites in its path. Ryan orders the destruction of the nuclear defense facility in Mashhad containing one of the missiles; the other is launched into space but fails to reach its destination at the last minute.

Ryan then appears in the next Jack Ryan Jr. novel &quot;Enemy Contact&quot; (2019). He deals with U.S. senator Deborah Dixon&#x27;s stonewalling of his proposed foreign policy initiative, which includes building a U.S. military base in Poland to counter Russian aggression to the east. When it was revealed that Senator Dixon&#x27;s son has unsavory connections to the Chinese, President Ryan blackmails her into passing an anticorruption bill.

====&quot;Code of Honor&quot; (2019)====
President Ryan receives a cryptic text message from his friend and former CIA colleague Father Pat West. He warns him of a next-generation AI program named Calliope, which could be used by the Chinese military to start a conflict with the United States. The Jesuit priest had been imprisoned by Indonesian police for trumped-up charges of blasphemy against Islam, when in fact he had earlier witnessed the murder of an American software engineer who first told him about Calliope.

The chief executive discreetly orders the Campus to investigate Father West&#x27;s text. Then he calls on the Indonesian president to release his friend, to no avail. Undeterred, he makes a state visit to Indonesia, eventually informing the Indonesian president of China&#x27;s sinister plans. Father West is eventually released from prison.

Ryan appears in the next Jack Ryan Jr. novel &quot;Firing Point&quot; (2020). A series container ships mysteriously disappear across the Pacific Ocean, and President Ryan tries to pinpoint whoever is responsible.

====&quot;Shadow of the Dragon&quot; (2020)====
President Ryan tasks Director of National Intelligence Mary Pat Foley with finding a mole codenamed SURVEYOR within the CIA. He also discreetly orders the Campus to track down Medina Tohti, a Uyghur freedom fighter who worked with the missing Chinese engineering professor Liu Wangshu. The professor had been on board the Chinese nuclear ballistic missile submarine &quot;Long March&quot; #880 along the Arctic Ocean, which had suffered an engine fire that burned most of its crew. President Ryan eventually informs the Chinese president about the submarine, allowing him to rescue its crew.

==Series overview==
===Novels===
Jack Ryan has been featured in 36 novels which have been written by Tom Clancy, Grant Blackwood, Mark Greaney, Mike Maden, Marc Cameron, Don Bentley, Brian Andrews, and Jeffrey Wilson.

===Films===

Five films based on Clancy novels featuring Jack Ryan have been produced. Jack Ryan was portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, Harrison Ford in &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992) and &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), Ben Affleck in the 2002 film &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, and Chris Pine in 2014 film &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot;.

In the novels, &quot;Patriot Games&quot; occurs before &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, though the order was reversed in the film versions. Additionally, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; is not part of the Baldwin/Ford series, but rather an intended reboot of the franchise which departs significantly from the chronology of the novels. It takes place in 2002, whereas the novel takes place in 1991/1992. &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; is a second reboot of the franchise and departs from all previous films.

<text>John T. Clark (real name John Terence Kelly, at times codenamed Rainbow Six) is a fictional character created by Tom Clancy. He has been featured in many of his Ryanverse novels. Although he first appeared in &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988), his origin story was detailed in &quot;Without Remorse&quot; (1993).

Clark has been described by his creator as &quot;Ryan&#x27;s dark side&quot; and &quot;more inclined to take physical action than Jack is.&quot; A former Navy SEAL, he became an operations officer for the CIA, and at one point served as Ryan&#x27;s driver and bodyguard. During Ryan&#x27;s first term as President, Clark served as director of a multinational counterterrorism unit codenamed Rainbow, which was composed of elite soldiers from countries comprising the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). After retiring from CIA and Rainbow, Clark then worked for The Campus, an off-the-books intelligence organization created by President Ryan, later acquiring a position as director of operations.

In film, Clark has been portrayed by Willem Dafoe, Liev Schreiber, and Michael B. Jordan, the latter in a planned series including adaptations of &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and the in-development &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;. Clark has also appeared in the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; series of video games.

==Profile==

===Personal life===
John Kelly was born in Indianapolis to Irish-American parents somewhere in 1944-1945 and raised as a Catholic. His father, Timothy Kelly, served in the Navy during World War II and was a fireman who perished from a heart attack during a fire. John lost his mother to cancer when he was a young boy. He attended Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis.

His first wife Patricia &quot;Tish&quot; was pregnant when she was killed in a car accident. Six months after his wife died, Kelly had a brief relationship with Pamela Madden, a former prostitute who had been forced into working as a courier for a drug ring. She was later recaptured by members of the ring and subsequently tortured, raped, and killed; Kelly was gravely wounded. While recovering from his injuries at Johns Hopkins Hospital, he met his future second wife, nurse Sandra &quot;Sandy&quot; O&#x27;Toole. They eventually had two daughters, Patricia Doris and Margaret Pamela.

Kelly, who had by now changed his identity to Clark, first met Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez in the CIA during a black operation in Colombia (&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;). They would later work frequently together in succeeding novels. Chavez becomes Clark&#x27;s son-in-law when he marries his daughter Patricia, and they later have a son, John Conor, who was born in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, although misnamed as John Patrick in &quot;Threat Vector&quot;.

===Professional life===
When Clark was 18, he joined the US Navy (as John Terence Kelly) and later became a Navy SEAL who participated in several special operations, one of which was the rescue of a naval aviator shot down over North Vietnam. The aviator was the son of Admiral Dutch Maxwell and his rescue earned Kelly a promotion to Chief Petty Officer. After his first tour of duty, Kelly left the Navy but was later re-hired by the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s (CIA) Special Activities Division (Special Operations Group) for another mission in Vietnam; a rescue operation on a secret POW camp. At the same time, Kelly was carrying out his own war at home against a drug ring that killed his girlfriend, Pamela Madden. While he succeeded in taking it down, the Baltimore Police Department (including Emmet Ryan, Jack Ryan&#x27;s father) eventually identifies him as the man who murdered the drug dealers. In response, Kelly faked his own death (with the help of the CIA, which falsifies the identity of his fingerprints in his Navy personnel file) and goes to work for the CIA full-time, under the pseudonym &quot;John Clark&quot;. (See &quot;Without Remorse&quot;) His middle name appears variously with one and two &#x27;R&#x27;s, and the name &quot;John Terrence Clark&quot; appears in the novel &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;.

Throughout his career, Clark has been through a number of real-life crisis zones. In addition to the Vietnam War, he has also been through the Iran hostage crisis (see &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;) and the Gulf War, plus a number of missions in the Soviet Union, and claims to have &quot;had Abu Nidal&#x27;s head in my gunsights&quot;, but never got the green light allowing him to kill the man (&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;).

He first enters the Jack Ryan universe in &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, which also features police officer Emmet Ryan and his son Jack. Although he does not appear in &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, it is later revealed that he was the CIA&#x27;s liaison with a French black ops unit involved in the campaign against the ULA. He also does not appear in &quot;Red Rabbit&quot;, but is mentioned as giving advice to trainees at The Farm, the CIA training facility. He appears briefly in &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot;, during which he extracts KGB Chairman Gerasimov&#x27;s wife and daughter from Leningrad after the Chairman decides to defect to the United States. This marks Clark&#x27;s first published appearance.

In &quot;Clear and Present Danger,&quot; he commands a U.S. Army black-ops unit carrying out a secret war against the Medellín Cartel in Colombia. When the government abandons the men for political reasons, Clark and Jack Ryan fly down to Colombia and rescue the survivors. This is the first time he interacts with Ryan.

In &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, he is Ryan&#x27;s personal driver and bodyguard. Later in the novel, he is returned to the field for one operation, bugging the aircraft of the Japanese Prime Minister in Mexico City. During the operation, a terrorist bombing in Denver occurs and his mission is changed to intercepting the Palestinian terrorists trying to escape through Mexico, which he does successfully. He interrogates them and secures their confessions, then hands them over to the judicial system for eventual Islamic justice (execution by sword) in Riyadh.

In &quot;Debt of Honor&quot;, he is again a field officer for the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations (DO). At the beginning of the novel, he and Domingo Chavez capture an Aidid-like African warlord, Mohammed Abdul Corp, and bring him to justice. Soon thereafter, they are sent to Japan to assess the national mood of the country, where Clark is undercover as a Russian reporter. When the situation turns into a war between Japan and the United States, they establish contacts with the opposition in the Japanese government and are also tasked to eliminate a pair of Japanese AWACS planes.

Clark spends the first half of the next book, &quot;Executive Orders&quot;, serving as an instructor for CIA field officers in training. Early in the novel, Jack Ryan, the new President, issues a presidential pardon to John Terence Kelly for his several murders. This clears his name and personal honor, but he will continue his career as John Clark. Towards the end of the book, he and Chavez are returned to the field and ordered to discover who is responsible for an Ebola attack on the United States, an action they quickly trace to the new United Islamic Republic (comprising Iran and Iraq). With the cooperation of the Russian SVR, they are infiltrated into Tehran, where they laser-designate the home of UIR dictator Mahmoud Haji Daryaei so that Air Force stealth aircraft can destroy the house.

The next year, Clark writes a memo to the CIA expressing his concerns over the rise of international terrorism since the demise of the Cold War, and recommends creating a NATO response team that could be rapidly deployed in terrorist situations. This special unit is created soon thereafter, with its base in Hereford, England. It is code-named Rainbow, and Clark is put in command of the unit with the equivalent rank of major general.

In the book &quot;Rainbow Six&quot;, Rainbow is first put into operation. It responds successfully to three attacks by &quot;Red&quot; terrorists in Bern, Vienna, and Madrid. It also succeeds in defending itself from an attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) against its home base. This is eventually determined to have been ordered by a radical eco-terrorist group, which Rainbow tracks down and destroys in the last pages of the novel.

Clark&#x27;s next appearance is in &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, where he is still the head of Rainbow. Initially assigned to train Russian Spetsnaz operatives, Rainbow is temporarily deployed to the Russian-Chinese war being fought in Siberia. In a joint Rainbow-Spetsnaz operation, he is involved in the destruction of China&#x27;s only ICBM base. The operation is mostly successful: all but one of the missiles is destroyed, and the last one, while it is fired, is destroyed by the Navy before it can reach its intended target.

Neither Clark nor Rainbow appears in &quot;The Teeth of the Tiger&quot;, but it is revealed that Rainbow is still operating. Prior to Jack Ryan resigning as President, Clark&#x27;s Navy Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. During the Medal of Honor ceremony Jack Ryan, Jr. was present in the Oval Office.

Clark returns in &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, in which he is part of a Rainbow team that successfully rescues all hostages taken by terrorists at the Swedish embassy in Libya. This proves to be his last act with the CIA, as he is pushed into retirement by Kealty political appointees. He then joins The Campus, an off-the-books intelligence agency that Ryan had founded before the end of his presidency. Clark is immediately involved with the organization&#x27;s effort to find and neutralize &quot;the Emir&quot;, an international terrorist leader modeled on Osama bin Laden, while also serving as mentor and trainer to Jack&#x27;s son Jack Jr., a Campus analyst who wants to do fieldwork.

In &quot;Locked On&quot;, Clark becomes a pawn in Czech billionaire and Kealty supporter Paul Laska&#x27;s vendetta to discredit Ryan during the presidential campaign. The Emir had identified him as one of his captors to his Laska-affiliated lawyer. When it was revealed that he killed an East German Stasi operative in Berlin in 1981 (which was not a CIA matter but a personal job by his friend and Berlin station chief who had been blackmailed), he becomes the subject of a manhunt by the FBI and later French investigators hired by Laska.

Clark goes on the run and travels to eastern Europe to clear his name, later finding out that rogue SVR operative Valentin Kovalenko had given the information to Laska, who in turn covertly presented it to Kealty. However, he is captured shortly after and later tortured for information about The Campus by Kovalenko&#x27;s men. He is later rescued by the Russian government, who then assigns him to temporarily lead Rainbow in order to retake a Russian spaceport which had been hijacked by Muslim Dagestani terrorists intent on launching nuclear weapons into Moscow.

In &quot;Threat Vector&quot;, Clark has been exonerated by the outgoing Kealty administration. After an assassination job on a cell of former Libyan intelligence officers in Istanbul, he briefly retires from The Campus due to old age. However, he later comes out of retirement when Chinese special operations forces attack the headquarters of The Campus. He travels to China with fellow Campus operatives and works with the local rebels and FSB to assassinate People&#x27;s Liberation Army Chairman Su Ke Qiang, who has been waging war against the United States by trying to annex Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and territories in the South China Sea by military force as well as sanctioning cyberattacks on the U.S.

In &quot;Command Authority&quot;, Clark becomes director of operations for The Campus. He travels to Ukraine along with his fellow operatives to gather intelligence on Russian criminal organization Seven Strong Men and its leader Gleb the Scar. They take part in defending a CIA special mission compound in Sevastopol, which came under attack from pro-Russian protesters aided by FSB proxy agents and the Seven Strong Men. Clark later cooperates with Delta Force operatives in capturing Gleb the Scar, revealed to be directly involved in the polonium poisoning of former SVR head Sergey Golovko, in his heavily-guarded base of operations in Kyiv.

In &quot;Full Force and Effect&quot;, Clark and his fellow Campus colleagues investigate a connection between an American corporate espionage firm and the North Korean government, who are intent on producing nuclear weapons. In &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, he tracks down the accountant of Russian president Valeri Volodin, who has been moving his personal net worth to a safe place in anticipation of his failure to placate the siloviki should his plan of a covert armed offensive across Europe fail to repair the ongoing economic recession in his country. In &quot;True Faith and Allegiance&quot;, Clark helps investigate a series of terrorist attacks on American military and intelligence personnel, which is due to a massive intelligence breach. He later assassinates a Saudi technocrat who has been setting up ISIS with the attacks in order to save his country from economic ruin in a quagmire likely to result from American troops being redeployed to the Middle East.

In &quot;Power and Empire&quot;, Clark investigates Chinese agent provocateur Vincent Chen&#x27;s connection to a sex trafficking ring in Texas. He wages a one-man war on the ring in order to save a prostitute as well, who had been instrumental in revealing China&#x27;s involvement in several false flag attacks designed to blame the current president, whose moderate stance on several issues compelled a secret cabal to act to have him removed from power. Clark was later arrested for murder, but was released from police custody soon after.

Clark briefly appears in &quot;Line of Sight&quot;, where he assassinates a Romanian crime boss who had a vendetta against Jack Ryan Jr. in revenge for killing one of his associates in a previous novel.

In &quot;Oath of Office&quot;, Clark leads a surveillance operation in Portugal on French arms dealer Hugo Gaspard, who has ties to ISIS. He witnesses Gaspard&#x27;s murder by French assassin Lucile Fournier, who works under rival arms dealer Urbano da Rocha. Clark and his team then proceed to shadow Da Rocha and Fournier, who later strike a deal intended for Gaspard with a pair of Russian GRU officers. However, the Russians later double cross da Rocha, attempting to kill him in his villa. Clark rescues the arms dealer, who later reveals a plot to provide stolen nuclear weapons to dissident Reza Kazem on behalf of the GRU and the Iranian government.

In &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, Clark leads the Campus&#x27;s efforts to retrieve Calliope, a next-generation AI software, before the Chinese military uses it for sinister purposes. He later tracks down Kang, an assassin working for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army who had tried to assassinate a former Navy admiral who now works for a communications company.

In &quot;Shadow of the Dragon&quot;, Clark tracks down and rescues the daughter of an Uyghur freedom fighter who had worked with a missing Chinese scientist in Kashgar. They were later exfiltrated by the U.S. Special Forces at the Wakhjir Pass along the Afghanistan border.

Outside the novels, John Clark&#x27;s career continues further in the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; video game series. In &quot;Rainbow Six: Critical Hour&quot;, Clark retires and passes the leadership of Team Rainbow on to Chavez. Although Chavez appears in &quot;Rainbow Six: Vegas&quot; as Rainbow commander, no mention is made of Clark.

===Awards===
John Clark has been awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star with an oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star with Valor devices with three oak leaf clusters, three Purple Hearts and four Intelligence Stars. He is also a recipient of the Medal of Honor, awarded and presented to him by Jack Ryan (then President of the U.S.) for the rescue of a downed fighter pilot during his time in Vietnam (see &quot;Without Remorse&quot;). He is a simulated major general in the &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; book, though he only reached the rank of Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate (Chief Petty Officer) during his Naval career.

===Distinguishing marks===
Clark has a small tattoo of a red seal, sitting up on its hind flippers &quot;grinning impudently&quot; on his forearm. Though no other visual details are given, a comment made by Lieutenant Colonel Daniel &quot;Bear&quot; Malloy in &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; indicated that at least some soldiers in Ryanverse who dealt with special operations had heard of the red seal tattoo and understood that it was associated with the Third Special Operations Group (SOG), with whom Clark served during the Vietnam War. Clark stated that everyone in his unit got the tattoo. In the real world, having such a tattoo would violate operations security (OPSEC); however, similar tattoos are not particularly uncommon, so long as the tattoo is not specifically unit identifiable. Also, the Third SOG is not a real military unit, but a similarly named group, the Studies and Observation Group MACV-SOG, was initially named the Special Operations Group and was active in Vietnam in the types of operations and environments referenced in the series, and had Navy SEALs among its personnel. The symbol of the red seal is actually the unit insignia for SEAL Team 1.

Jordan was cast to play John Clark in the new film series. &quot;Without Remorse&quot; was released on 30 April 2021 and was directed by Stefano Sollima from a screenplay written by Taylor Sheridan and Will Staples. It is produced by Akiva Goldsman. &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; is currently in development.

==== Jack Ryan films ====
John Clark has been portrayed by Willem Dafoe in &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994) and Liev Schreiber in &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; (2002).

In &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; Clark is initially depicted as a cynical and opportunistic mercenary, but slowly reveals his virtues. Clark aids Ryan in rescuing Clark&#x27;s men from Escobedo and Cortez, saving Ryan&#x27;s life.

In &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; Clark is depicted as a much more sardonic character, though he, like his novel counterpart, has also participated in numerous CIA operations.

<doc id="30769" wikidata="Q310913" url="?curid=30769" title="Thích Nhất Hạnh">
<text>Thích Nhất Hạnh ( ; , Huế dialect: ; born Nguyễn Xuân Bảo; 11 October 1926 – 22 January 2022) was a Vietnamese Thiền Buddhist monk, peace activist, prolific author, poet and teacher, who founded the Plum Village Tradition, historically recognized as the main inspiration for engaged Buddhism. Known as the &quot;father of mindfulness&quot;, Nhất Hạnh was a major influence on Western practices of Buddhism.

In the mid-1960s, Nhất Hạnh co-founded the School of Youth for Social Services and created the Order of Interbeing. He was exiled from South Vietnam in 1966 after expressing opposition to the war and refusing to take sides. In 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Nhất Hạnh established dozens of monasteries and practice centers and spent many years living at the Plum Village Monastery, which he founded in 1982 in southwest France near Thénac, traveling internationally to give retreats and talks. Nhất Hạnh promoted deep listening as a nonviolent solution to conflict and sought to raise awareness of the interconnectedness of environments that sustain and promote peace. He coined the term &quot;engaged Buddhism&quot; in his book &quot;&quot;. 

After a 39-year exile, Nhất Hạnh was permitted to visit Vietnam in 2005. In 2018, he returned to Vietnam to his &quot;root temple&quot;, Từ Hiếu Temple, near Huế, where he lived until his death in 2022, at the age of 95.

==Early life==
Nhất Hạnh was born Nguyễn Xuân Bảo on 11 October 1926, in the ancient capital of Huế in central Vietnam. He is 15th generation Nguyễn Đình; the poet Nguyễn Đình Chiểu, author of &quot;Lục Vân Tiên&quot;, was his ancestor. His father, Nguyễn Đình Phúc, from Thành Trung village in Thừa Thiên, Huế, was an official with the French administration. His mother, Trần Thị Dĩ, was a homemaker from Gio Linh district. Nhất Hạnh was the fifth of their six children. Until he was age five, he lived with his large extended family at his grandmother&#x27;s home. He recalled feeling joy at age seven or eight after he saw a drawing of a peaceful Buddha, sitting on the grass. On a school trip, he visited a mountain where a hermit lived who was said to sit quietly day and night to become peaceful like the Buddha. They explored the area, and he found a natural well, which he drank from and felt completely satisfied. It was this experience that led him to want to become a Buddhist monk. At age 12, he expressed an interest in training to become a monk, which his parents, cautious at first, eventually let him pursue at age 16.

==Names applied to him==
Nhất Hạnh had many names in his lifetime. As a boy, he received a formal family name (Nguyễn Đình Lang) to register for school, but was known by his nickname (Bé Em). He received a spiritual name (Điệu Sung) as an aspirant for the monkhood; a lineage name (Trừng Quang) when he formally became a lay Buddhist; and when he ordained as a monk he received a Dharma name (Phùng Xuân). He took the Dharma title Nhất Hạnh when he moved to Saigon in 1949.

The Vietnamese name &quot;Thích&quot; () is from &quot;Thích Ca&quot; or &quot;Thích Già&quot; (, &quot;of the Shakya clan&quot;). All Buddhist monastics in East Asian Buddhism adopt this name as their surname, implying that their first family is the Buddhist community. In many Buddhist traditions, a person can receive a progression of names. The lineage name is given first when a person takes refuge in the Three Jewels. Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s lineage name is Trừng Quang (澄光, &quot;Clear, Reflective Light&quot;). The second is a dharma name, given when a person takes vows or is ordained as a monastic. Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s dharma name is Phùng Xuân (逢春, &quot;Meeting Spring&quot;) and his dharma title is Nhất Hạnh.

Neither &quot;Nhất&quot; () nor &quot;Hạnh&quot; (), which approximate the roles of middle name and given name, was part of his name at birth. &quot;Nhất&quot; means &quot;one&quot;, implying &quot;first-class&quot;, or &quot;of best quality&quot;; &quot;Hạnh&quot; means &quot;action&quot;, implying &quot;right conduct&quot;, &quot;good nature&quot;, or &quot;virtue&quot;. He translated his Dharma names as &quot;One&quot; (Nhất) and &quot;Action&quot; (Hạnh). Vietnamese names follow this convention, placing the family name first, then the middle name, which often refers to the person&#x27;s position in the family or generation, followed by the given name.

Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s followers called him (&quot;master; teacher&quot;), or &quot;Thầy&quot; Nhất Hạnh. Any Vietnamese monk in the Mahayana tradition can be addressed as &quot;thầy&quot;, with monks addressed as &quot;thầy tu&quot; (&quot;monk&quot;) and nuns addressed as &quot;sư cô&quot; (&quot;sister&quot;) or &quot;sư bà&quot; (&quot;elder sister&quot;). He is also known as Thiền Sư Nhất Hạnh (&quot;Zen Master Nhất Hạnh&quot;).

==Education==
At age 16, Nhất Hạnh entered the monastery at Từ Hiếu Temple, where his primary teacher was Zen Master Thanh Quý Chân Thật, who was from the 43rd generation of the Lâm Tế Zen school and the ninth generation of the Liễu Quán school. He studied as a novice for three years and received training in Vietnamese traditions of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism. Here he also learned Chinese, English and French. Nhất Hạnh attended Báo Quốc Buddhist Academy. Dissatisfied with the focus at Báo Quốc Academy, which he found lacking in philosophy, literature, and foreign languages, Nhất Hạnh left in 1950 and took up residence in the Ấn Quang Pagoda in Saigon, where he was ordained as a monk in 1951. He supported himself by selling books and poetry while attending Saigon University, where he studied literature, philosophy, psychology, and science and received a degree in French and Vietnamese Literature. 

In 1955, Nhất Hạnh returned to Huế and served as the editor of &quot;Phật Giáo Việt Nam&quot; (&quot;Vietnamese Buddhism&quot;), the official publication of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhists (Tổng Hội Phật Giáo Việt Nam) for two years before the publication was suspended as higher-ranking monks disapproved of his writing. He believed that this was due to his opinion that South Vietnam&#x27;s various Buddhist organisations should unite. In 1956, while he was away teaching in Đà Lạt, his name was expunged from the records of Ấn Quang, effectively disowning him from the temple. In late 1957, Nhất Hạnh decided to go on retreat, and established a monastic &quot;community of resistance&quot; named Phương Bôi, in Đại Lao Forest near Đà Lạt. During this period, he taught at a nearby high school and continued to write, promoting the idea of a humanistic, unified Buddhism. 

From 1959 to 1961, Nhất Hạnh taught several short courses on Buddhism at various Saigon temples, including the large Xá Lợi Pagoda, where his class was cancelled mid-session and he was removed due to disapproval of his teachings. Facing further opposition from Vietnamese religious and secular authorities, Nhất Hạnh accepted a Fulbright Fellowship in 1960 to study comparative religion at Princeton University. He studied at the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1961. In 1962 he was appointed lecturer in Buddhism at Columbia University and also taught as a lecturer at Cornell University. By then he had gained fluency in French, Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali and English, in addition to his native Vietnamese.

==Career==
===Activism in Vietnam 1963–1966===
In 1963, after the military overthrow of the minority Catholic regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, Nhất Hạnh returned to South Vietnam on 16 December 1963, at the request of Thich Tri Quang, the monk most prominent in protesting the religious discrimination of Diem, to help restructure the administration of Vietnamese Buddhism. As a result of a congress, the General Association of Buddhists and other groups merged to form the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) in January 1964, and Nhất Hạnh proposed that the executive publicly call for an end to the Vietnam War, help establish an institute for the study of Buddhism to train future leaders, and create a centre to train pacifist social workers based on Buddhist teaching.

In 1964, two of Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s students founded La Boi Press with a grant from Mrs. Ngo Van Hieu. Within two years, the press published 12 books, but by 1966, the publishers risked arrest and jail because the word &quot;peace&quot; was taken to mean communism. Nhất Hạnh also edited the weekly journal &quot;Hải Triều Âm&quot; (&quot;Sound of the Rising Tide&quot;), the UBCV&#x27;s official publication. He continually advocated peace and reconciliation, notably calling in September 1964, soon after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, for a peace settlement, and referring to the Viet Cong as brothers. The South Vietnamese government subsequently closed the journal.

On 1 May 1966, at Từ Hiếu Temple, Nhất Hạnh received the &quot;lamp transmission&quot; from Zen Master Chân Thật, making him a dharmacharya (teacher) and the spiritual head of Từ Hiếu and associated monasteries.

====Vạn Hanh Buddhist University====
On 13 March 1964, Nhất Hạnh and the monks at An Quang Pagoda founded the Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies (Học Viện Phật Giáo Việt Nam), with the UBCV&#x27;s support and endorsement. Renamed Vạn Hanh Buddhist University, it was a private institution that taught Buddhist studies, Vietnamese culture, and languages, in Saigon. Nhất Hạnh taught Buddhist psychology and prajnaparamita literature there, and helped finance the university by fundraising from supporters.

====School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS)====

In 1964, Nhất Hạnh co-founded the School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS), a neutral corps of Buddhist peace workers who went into rural areas to establish schools, build healthcare clinics, and help rebuild villages. The SYSS consisted of 10,000 volunteers and social workers who aided war-torn villages, rebuilt schools and established medical centers. He left for the U.S. shortly afterwards and was not allowed to return, leaving Sister Chân Không in charge of the SYSS. Chân Không was central to the foundation and many of the activities of the SYSS, which organized medical, educational and agricultural facilities in rural Vietnam during the war. Nhất Hạnh was initially given substantial autonomy to run the SYSS, which was initially part of Vạn Hạnh University. In April 1966, the Vạn Hạnh Students’ Union under the presidency of Phượng issued a &quot;Call for Peace&quot;. Vice Chancellor Thích Minh Châu dissolved the students&#x27; union and removed the SYSS from the university&#x27;s auspices.

====The Order of Interbeing====

Nhất Hạnh created the Order of Interbeing (), a monastic and lay group, between 1964 and 1966. He headed this group, basing it on the philosophical concept of interbeing and teaching it through the Five Mindfulness Trainings and the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings. The trainings were a modern adaptation of the traditional bodhisattva vows designed to support efforts to promote peace and rebuild war-torn villages. Nhất Hạnh established the Order of Interbeing from a selection of six SYSS board members, three men and three women, who took a vow to practice the Fourteen Precepts of Engaged Buddhism. He added a seventh member in 1981. 

In 1967, Nhat Chi Mai, one of the first six Order of Interbeing members, set fire to herself and burned to death in front of the Tu Nghiem Pagoda in Saigon as a peace protest after calling for an end to the Vietnam War. On several occasions, Nhất Hạnh explained to Westerners that Thích Quảng Đức and other Vietnamese Buddhist monks who self-immolated during the Vietnam war did not perform acts of suicide; rather, their acts were, in his words, aimed &quot;at moving the hearts of the oppressors, and at calling the attention of the world to the suffering endured then by the Vietnamese.&quot;

The Order of Interbeing expanded into an international community of laypeople and monastics focused on &quot;mindfulness practice, ethical behavior, and compassionate action in society.&quot; By 2017, the group had grown to include thousands known to recite the Fourteen Precepts.

===During the Vietnam War===
Vạn Hạnh University was taken over by one of the chancellors, who wished to sever ties with Nhất Hạnh and the SYSS, accusing Chân Không of being a communist. Thereafter the SYSS struggled to raise funds and faced attacks on its members. It persisted in its relief efforts without taking sides in the conflict.

Nhất Hạnh returned to the U.S. in 1966 to lead a symposium in Vietnamese Buddhism at Cornell University and continue his work for peace. He was invited by Professor George McTurnan Kahin, also of Cornell and a U.S. government foreign policy consultant, to participate on a forum on U.S. policy in Vietnam. On 1 June, Nhất Hạnh released a five-point proposal addressed to the U.S. government, recommending that (1) the U.S. make a clear statement of its desire to help the Vietnamese people form a government &quot;truly responsive to Vietnamese aspirations&quot;; (2) the U.S. and South Vietnam cease air strikes throughout Vietnam; (3) all anti-communist military operations be purely defensive; (4) the U.S. demonstrate a willingness to withdraw within a few months; and (5) the U.S. offer to pay for reconstruction. In 1967 he wrote &quot;Vietnam — The Lotus in the Sea of Fire&quot;, about his proposals. The South Vietnamese military junta responded by accusing him of treason and being a communist.

While in the U.S., Nhất Hạnh visited Gethsemani Abbey to speak with the Trappist monk Thomas Merton. When the South Vietnamese regime threatened to block Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s reentry to the country, Merton wrote an essay of solidarity, &quot;Nhat Hanh is my Brother&quot;. Between June and October 1963, Nhất Hạnh conducted numerous interviews with newspapers and television networks to rally support for the peace movement. During this time, he also undertook a widely publicized five-day fast. Additionally, he translated reports of human rights violations from Vietnamese into English and compiled them into a document he presented to the United Nations. In 1964, after the publication of his poem &quot;whoever is listening, be my witness: I cannot accept this war...&quot;, the American press called Nhất Hạnh an &quot;antiwar poet&quot; and a &quot;pro-Communist propagandist&quot;. In 1965 he wrote Martin Luther King Jr. a letter titled &quot;In Search of the Enemy of Man&quot;. During his 1966 stay in the U.S., Nhất Hạnh met King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, due in large part to Nhất Hạnh, King gave the speech &quot;Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence&quot; at Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, &quot;I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity&quot;. King also called Nhất Hạnh &quot;an apostle of peace and nonviolence&quot;. King named the candidate he had chosen to nominate with a &quot;strong request&quot; to the prize committee, in sharp violation of Nobel traditions and protocol. The committee did not make an award that year. 

====Refuge in France====
Nhất Hạnh moved to Paris in 1966 and became the chair of the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation a group involved with the Paris Peace Accords, which ultimately ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. For refusing to take sides in the war, Nhất Hạnh was exiled by both the North and South Vietnamese governments. He received asylum in France and moved to the Paris suburbs, living with other Vietnamese refugees. 

In 1969, Nhất Hạnh established the Unified Buddhist Church (Église Bouddhique Unifiée) in France (not a part of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam). In 1975, he formed the Sweet Potatoes Meditation Centre at Fontvannes, in the Foret d’Othe, near Troyes in Aube province southeast of Paris. For the next seven years, he focused on writing, and completed &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot;, &quot;The Moon Bamboo&quot;, and &quot;The Sun My Heart&quot;. 

Nhất Hạnh began teaching mindfulness in the mid-1970s with his books, particularly &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; (1975), serving as the main vehicle for his early teachings. In an interview for On Being, he said that &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; was &quot;written for our social workers, first, in Vietnam, because they were living in a situation where the danger of dying was there every day. So out of compassion, out of a willingness to help them to continue their work, &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; was written as a manual practice. And after that, many friends in the West, they think that it is helpful for them, so we allow it to be translated into English.&quot; The book was originally titled &quot;The Miracle of Being Awake&quot;, as in 1975 &quot;mindfulness&quot; was barely recognized in English. Its focus on integrating mindfulness into daily life, rather than confining it to meditation, emphasized that living mindfully could foster personal growth, enlightenment, and even global peace.

====Campaign to help boat people and expulsion from Singapore====
When the North Vietnamese army took control of the south in 1975, Nhất Hạnh was denied permission to return to Vietnam, and the communist government banned his publications. He soon began to lead efforts to help rescue Vietnamese boat people in the Gulf of Siam, eventually stopping under pressure from the governments of Thailand and Singapore.

Recounting his experience years later, Nhất Hạnh said he was in Singapore attending a conference on religion and peace when he discovered the plight of the suffering of the boat people:So many boat people were dying in the ocean, and Singapore had a very harsh policy on the boat people… The policy of Singapore at that time was to reject the boat people; Malaysia, also. They preferred to have the boat people die in the ocean rather than to bring them to land and make them into prisoners. Every time there was a boat with the boat people [that came] to the shore, they tried to push them [back] out into the sea in order [for them] to die. They didn&#x27;t want to host [them]. And those fishermen who had compassion, who were able to save the boat people from drowning in the sea, were punished. They had to pay a very huge sum of money so that next time they won&#x27;t have the courage to save the boat people.He stayed on in Singapore to organise a secret rescue operation. Aided by concerned individuals from France, the Netherlands, and other European countries, he hired a boat to bring food, water and medicine to refugees in the sea. Sympathetic fishermen who had rescued boat people would call up his team, and they shuttled the refugees to the French embassy in the middle of the night and helped them climb into the compound, before they were discovered by staff in the morning and handed over to the police where they were placed in the relative safety of detention. &quot;Please Call Me by My True Names&quot;, Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s best-known poem, was written in 1978 during his efforts to assist the boat people.

When the Singapore government discovered the clandestine network, the police surrounded its office and impounded the passports of both Nhất Hạnh and Chân Không, giving them 24 hours to leave the country. It was only with the intervention of the then-French ambassador to Singapore Jacques Gasseau that they were given 10 days to wind down their rescue operations.

Nhất Hạnh was only allowed to return to Singapore in 2010 to lead a meditation retreat at the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.

===Plum Village===
By 1982, Sweet Potatoes was too small to accommodate the growing number of people who wanted to visit for retreats. In 1982, Nhất Hạnh and Chân Không established the Plum Village Monastery, a vihara in the Dordogne near Bordeaux in southern France. Plum Village is the largest Buddhist monastery in Europe and America, with over 200 monastics and over 10,000 visitors a year.

The Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism (formerly the Unified Buddhist Church) and its sister organization in France, the Congrégation Bouddhique Zen Village des Pruniers, are the legally recognized governing bodies of Plum Village in France.

====Expanded practice centres====

By 2019, Nhất Hạnh had built a network of monasteries and retreat centres in several countries, including France, the U.S., Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Additional practice centres and associated organizations Nhất Hạnh and the Order of Interbeing established in the US include Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York; the Community of Mindful Living in Berkeley, California; Parallax Press; Deer Park Monastery (Tu Viện Lộc Uyển), established in 2000 in Escondido, California; Magnolia Grove Monastery (Đạo Tràng Mộc Lan) in Batesville, Mississippi; and the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbröl, Germany. (The Maple Forest Monastery (Tu Viện Rừng Phong) and Green Mountain Dharma Center (Ðạo Tràng Thanh Sơn) in Vermont closed in 2007 and moved to the Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush.) The monasteries, open to the public during much of the year, provide ongoing retreats for laypeople, while the Order of Interbeing holds retreats for specific groups of laypeople, such as families, teenagers, military veterans, the entertainment industry, members of Congress, law enforcement officers and people of colour. 

According to the Thích Nhất Hạnh Foundation, the charitable organization that serves as the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism&#x27;s fundraising arm, as of 2017 the monastic order Nhất Hạnh established comprises over 750 monastics in 9 monasteries worldwide.

Nhất Hạnh established two monasteries in Vietnam, at the original Từ Hiếu Temple near Huế and at Prajna Temple in the central highlands.

===Writings===
Nhất Hạnh has published over 130 books, including more than 100 in English, which as of January 2019 had sold over five million copies worldwide. His books, which cover topics including spiritual guides and Buddhist texts, teachings on mindfulness, poetry, story collections, a biography of the Buddha, and scholarly essays on Zen practice, have been translated into more than 40 languages as of January 2022. In 1986 Nhất Hạnh founded Parallax Press, a nonprofit book publisher and part of the Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism.

During his long exile, Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s books were often smuggled into Vietnam, where they had been banned.

===Later activism===
In 2014, major Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed called for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by 2020. Nhất Hạnh was represented by Chân Không.

Nhất Hạnh was known to refrain from consuming animal products as a means of nonviolence toward animals.

Christiana Figueres has said that Nhất Hạnh helped her overcome a personal crisis and develop the deep listening and empathy required to facilitate the Paris Agreement on climate change. 

==Relations with Vietnamese governments==
Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s relationship with the government of Vietnam varied over the years. He stayed away from politics, but did not support the South Vietnamese government&#x27;s policies of Catholicization. He questioned American involvement, putting him at odds with the Saigon leadership, which banned him from returning to South Vietnam while he was abroad in 1966.

His relationship with the communist government ruling Vietnam was tense due to its anti-religious stance. The communist government viewed him with skepticism, distrusted his work with the overseas Vietnamese population, and restricted his praying requiem on several occasions. 

===Return visits to Vietnam 2005–2007===

In 2005, after lengthy negotiations, the Vietnamese government allowed Nhất Hạnh to return for a visit. He was also allowed to teach there, publish four of his books in Vietnamese, and travel the country with monastic and lay members of his Order, including a return to his root temple, Tu Hieu Temple in Huế. Nhất Hạnh arrived on 12 January after 39 years in exile. The trip was not without controversy. Thich Vien Dinh, writing on behalf of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), called for Nhất Hạnh to make a statement against the Vietnamese government&#x27;s poor record on religious freedom. Vien Dinh feared that the government would use the trip as propaganda, suggesting that religious freedom is improving there, while abuses continue.
Despite the controversy, Nhất Hạnh returned to Vietnam in 2007, while the heads of the UBCV, Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do, remained under house arrest. The UBCV called his visit a betrayal, symbolizing his willingness to work with his co-religionists&#x27; oppressors. Võ Văn Ái, a UBCV spokesman, said, &quot;I believe Thích Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s trip is manipulated by the Hanoi government to hide its repression of the Unified Buddhist Church and create a false impression of religious freedom in Vietnam.&quot; The Plum Village website listed three goals for his 2007 trip to Vietnam: to support new monastics in his Order; to organize and conduct &quot;Great Chanting Ceremonies&quot; intended to help heal remaining wounds from the Vietnam War; and to lead retreats for monastics and laypeople. The chanting ceremonies were originally called &quot;Grand Requiem for Praying Equally for All to Untie the Knots of Unjust Suffering&quot;, but Vietnamese officials objected, calling it unacceptable for the government to &quot;equally&quot; pray for South Vietnamese and U.S. soldiers. Nhất Hạnh agreed to change the name to &quot;Grand Requiem For Praying&quot;. During the 2007 visit, Nhất Hạnh suggested ending government control of religion to President Nguyen Minh Triet. A provincial police officer later spoke to a reporter about this incident, accusing Nhất Hạnh of breaking Vietnamese law. The officer said, &quot;[Nhất Hạnh] should focus on Buddhism and keep out of politics.&quot;

During the 2005 visit, Nhất Hạnh &#x27;s followers were invited by Abbot Duc Nghi, a member of the official Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, to occupy Bat Nha monastery and continue their practice there. Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s followers say that during a sacred ceremony at Plum Village Monastery in 2006, Nghi received a transmission from Nhất Hạnh and agreed to let them occupy Bat Nha. Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s followers spent $1 million developing the monastery, building a meditation hall for 1,800 people. The government support initially given to his supporters is now believed to have been a ploy to get Vietnam off the US State Department&#x27;s Religious Freedom blacklist, improve chances of entry into the World Trade Organization, and increase foreign investment. During this time, thousands of people came to the center to practice, and Nhất Hạnh ordained more than 500 monks and nuns at the monastery.

In 2008, during an interview in Italian television, Nhất Hạnh made some statements regarding the Dalai Lama that his followers claim upset Chinese officials, who in turn put pressure on the Vietnamese government. The chairman of Vietnam&#x27;s national Committee on Religious Affairs sent a letter that accused Nhat Hanh&#x27;s organization of publishing false information about Vietnam on its website. It was written that the posted information misrepresented Vietnam&#x27;s policies on religion and could undermine national unity. The chairman requested that Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s followers leave Bat Nha. The letter also stated that Abbot Duc Nghi wanted them to leave. &quot;Duc Nghi is breaking a vow that he made to us... We have videotapes of him inviting us to turn the monastery into a place for worship in the Plum Village tradition, even after he dies — life after life. Nobody can go against that wish,&quot; said Brother Phap Kham. In September and October 2009, a standoff developed, which ended when authorities cut the power, and followed up with police raids augmented by mobs assembled through gang contacts. The attackers used sticks and hammers to break in and dragged off hundreds of monks and nuns. &quot;Senior monks were dragged like animals out of their rooms, then left sitting in the rain until police dragged them to the taxis where ‘black society’ bad guys pushed them into cars,&quot; a villager said in a phone interview. Two senior monks had their IDs taken and were put under house arrest without charges in their home towns. Monastics responded with chanting, but continued to be persecuted by the government.

==Religious approach and influence ==

=== Engaged Buddhism ===
Nhất Hạnh combined a variety of teachings of Early Buddhist schools, Mahayana, Zen, and ideas from Western psychology to teach mindfulness of breathing and the four foundations of mindfulness, offering a modern perspective on meditation practice.

Nhất Hạnh has also been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism movement (he is credited with coining the term), promoting the individual&#x27;s active role in creating change. He credited the 13th-century Vietnamese Emperor Trần Nhân Tông with originating the concept. Trần Nhân Tông abdicated his throne to become a monk and founded the Vietnamese Buddhist school of the Bamboo Forest tradition. He also called it Applied Buddhism in later years to emphasize its practical nature.

=== Mindfulness Trainings ===
Nhất Hạnh rephrased the five precepts for lay Buddhists, which were traditionally written in terms of refraining from negative activities, such as committing to taking positive action to prevent or minimize others&#x27; negative actions. For example, instead of merely refraining from stealing, Nhất Hạnh wrote, &quot;prevent others from profiting from human suffering or the suffering of other species on Earth&quot; by, for example, taking action against unfair practices or unsafe workplaces. 

According to Plum Village, Manifesto 2000, introduced by UNESCO, was largely inspired by their five mindfulness trainings. In keeping with the northern tradition of Bodhisattva precepts, Nhất Hạnh wrote the fourteen mindfulness trainings for the Order of Interbeing based on the ten deeds. He also updated the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya for Plum Village monastics while keeping its number of rules, 250 for monks and 348 for nuns.

=== Interbeing ===
Nhất Hạnh developed the English term &quot;interbeing&quot; by combining the prefix &quot;inter-&quot; with the verb &quot;to be&quot; to denote the interconnection of all phenomena. This was inspired by the Chinese word 相即 in Master Fa Zang&#x27;s &quot;Golden Lion Chapter&quot;, a Huayan summary of the Avatamsaka Sutra. Some scholars believed it was a presentation of the Prajnaparamita, which &quot;is often said to provide a philosophical foundation&quot; for Zen. Nhất Hạnh was also known for expressing deep teachings through simple phrases or parables. &quot;The sun my heart&quot;, for instance, was an insight of meditation on the interdependence of all things. He used &quot;no mud no lotus&quot; to illustrate the interrelationship between awakening and afflictions, well-being and ill-being. &quot;A cloud never dies&quot;, on the other hand, is a contemplation of phenomena beyond birth and death. To teach non-duality, he often told the story of his left and right hand. His meditation on aimlessness (&quot;apranihita&quot;) was told through the story of a river. The relationship between waves and water explained the Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Interpenetration of Truth and Phenomena.
=== A new translation of the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; ===
Nhất Hạnh completed new English and Vietnamese translations of the Heart Sutra in September 2014. In a letter to his students, he said he wrote these new translations because he thought that poor word choices in the original text had resulted in significant misunderstandings of these teachings for almost 2,000 years.

=== Manifestation-Only Teaching ===
Continuing the Yogācāra and Dharmalaksana school, Nhất Hạnh composed the &quot;fifty verses on the nature of consciousness&quot;. He preferred calling the teaching manifestation-only (vijnapti-matrata) rather than consciousness-only (vijnana-matrata) to avoid misintepretation into a kind of idealism.

=== The Father of Mindfulness ===
Called &quot;the Father of Mindfulness&quot;, Nhất Hạnh has been credited as one of the main figures in bringing Buddhism to the West, and especially for making mindfulness well known in the West. According to James Shaheen, the editor of the American Buddhist magazine &quot;&quot;, &quot;In the West, he&#x27;s an icon. I can&#x27;t think of a Western Buddhist who does not know of Thich Nhất Hạnh.&quot; His 1975 book &quot;The Miracle of Mindfulness&quot; was credited with helping to &quot;lay the foundations&quot; for the use of mindfulness in treating depression through &quot;mindfulness-based cognitive therapy&quot;, influencing the work of University of Washington psychology professor Marsha M. Linehan, the originator of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). J. Mark G. Williams of Oxford University and the Oxford Mindfulness Centre has said, &quot;What he was able to do was to communicate the essentials of Buddhist wisdom and make it accessible to people all over the world, and build that bridge between the modern world of psychological science and the modern healthcare system and these ancient wisdom practices – and then he continued to do that in his teaching.&quot; One of Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s students, Jon Kabat-Zinn, developed the mindfulness-based stress reduction course that is available at hospitals and medical centres across the world, and as of 2015, around 80% of medical schools are reported to have offered mindfulness training. As of 2019, it was reported that mindfulness as espoused by Nhất Hạnh had become the theoretical underpinning of a $1.1 billion industry in the U.S. One survey determined that 35% of employers used mindfulness in practices in the workplace.

=== Interfaith dialogue ===
Nhất Hạnh was known for his involvement in interfaith dialogue, which was not common when he began. He was noted for his friendships with Martin Luther King Jr. and Thomas Merton, and King wrote in his Nobel nomination for Nhất Hạnh, &quot;His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity&quot;. Merton wrote an essay for &quot;Jubilee&quot; in August 1966 titled &quot;Nhất Hạnh Is My Brother&quot;, in which he said, &quot;I have far more in common with Nhất Hạnh than I have with many Americans, and I do not hesitate to say it. It is vitally important that such bonds be admitted. They are the bonds of a new solidarity ... which is beginning to be evident on all five continents and which cuts across all political, religious and cultural lines to unite young men and women in every country in something that is more concrete than an ideal and more alive than a program.&quot; The same year, Nhất Hạnh met with Pope Paul VI and the pair called on Catholics and Buddhists to help bring about world peace, especially relating to the conflict in Vietnam. According to Buddhism scholar Sallie B. King, Nhất Hạnh was &quot;extremely skilled at expressing their teachings in the language of a kind of universal spirituality rather than a specifically Buddhist terminology. The language of this universal spirituality is the same as the basic values that they see expressed in other religions as well&quot;.

==Final years==
In November 2014, Nhất Hạnh experienced a severe brain hemorrhage and was hospitalized. After months of rehabilitation, he was released from the stroke rehabilitation clinic at Bordeaux Segalen University. In July 2015, he flew to San Francisco to speed his recovery with an aggressive rehabilitation program at UCSF Medical Center. He returned to France in January 2016. After spending 2016 in France, Nhất Hạnh travelled to the Thai Plum Village. He continued to see both Eastern and Western specialists while in Thailand, but was unable to verbally communicate for the remainder of his life.

In November 2018, a press release from the Plum Village community confirmed that Nhất Hạnh, then 92, had returned to Vietnam a final time and would live at Từ Hiếu Temple for &quot;his remaining days&quot;. In a meeting with senior disciples, he had &quot;clearly communicated his wish to return to Vietnam using gestures, nodding and shaking his head in response to questions&quot;. In January 2019, a representative of Plum Village, Sister True Dedication, wrote:

While it was clear Nhất Hạnh could no longer speak, Vietnamese authorities assigned plainclothes police to monitor his activities at the temple.

===Death===

Nhất Hạnh died at his residence in Từ Hiếu Temple on 22 January 2022, at age 95, as a result of complications from his stroke seven years earlier. His death was widely mourned by various Buddhist groups in and outside Vietnam. The Dalai Lama, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the U.S. State Department also issued words of condolence.

His five-day funeral, which began on the day of his death, had a seven-day wake that culminated with his cremation on 29 January. In a 2015 book, Nhất Hạnh described what he wanted for the disposition of his remains, in part to illustrate how he believes that he &quot;continues&quot; on in his teachings: 

At the conclusion of the 49-day mourning period, Nhất Hạnh&#x27;s ashes were portioned and scattered in Từ Hiếu Temple and temples associated with Plum Village.

<doc id="30770" wikidata="Q815436" url="?curid=30770" title="The Troubles">
<text>The Troubles () were an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland that lasted for about 30 years from the late 1960s to 1998. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mostly took place in Northern Ireland, at times violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe.

Sometimes described as an &quot;asymmetric&quot; or &quot;irregular&quot; war or a &quot;low-intensity conflict&quot;, the Troubles were a political and nationalistic struggle fueled by historical events, with a strong ethnic and sectarian dimension, fought over the status of Northern Ireland. Unionists and loyalists, who for historical reasons were mostly Ulster Protestants, wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists and republicans, who were mostly Irish Catholics, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland. Despite the division between Protestants and Catholics, it was not primarily a religious war. 

The conflict began during a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic-nationalist minority by the Protestant-unionist government and local authorities. The government attempted to suppress the protests. The police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), were overwhelmingly Protestant and known for sectarianism and police brutality. The campaign was also violently opposed by Ulster loyalists, who believed it was a front for republican political activity. Increasing tensions led to the August 1969 riots and the deployment of British troops, in what became the British Army&#x27;s longest operation. &quot;Peace walls&quot; were built in some areas to keep the two communities apart. Some Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a more neutral force than the RUC, but soon came to see it as hostile and biased, particularly after Bloody Sunday in 1972.

The main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces such as the British Army and RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary); and political activists. The security forces of the Republic of Ireland played a smaller role. Republicans carried out a guerrilla campaign against British forces as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructural, commercial, and political targets. Loyalists attacked republicans/nationalists and the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence, as well as feuds within and between paramilitary groups. The British security forces undertook policing and counterinsurgency campaigns, primarily against republicans. There were incidents of collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries (see Stevens Inquiries). The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests, and acts of civil disobedience, and led to increased segregation and the creation of temporary no-go areas.

More than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were members of paramilitary groups. Republic paramilitaries were responsible for 60% of total deaths, followed by loyalist paramilitaries at 30% and security forces at 10%. Loyalists were responsible for 48% of all civilian deaths, however, followed by republicans at 39% and security forces at 10%.

The Northern Ireland peace process led to paramilitary ceasefires and talks between the main political parties, which resulted in the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of &quot;power-sharing&quot; and it included acceptance of the principle of consent, commitment to civil and political rights, parity of esteem, police reform, paramilitary disarmament and early release of paramilitary prisoners.

There has been sporadic violence since the Agreement, including punishment attacks, loyalist gangs&#x27; control of major organised crime rackets (e.g., drugs supply, community coercion and violence, intimidation), and violent crime linked to dissident republican groups.

== Name ==
The word &quot;troubles&quot; has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for centuries. It was used to describe the 17th-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms by all three national parliaments. For example, after the Restoration in 1660, the English &quot;&quot; starts with &quot;The King&#x27;s most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious consideration the long and great troubles ...&quot;; as does the similar act in Scotland: &quot;The king&#x27;s most excellent majesty, considering that by the late troubles diverse of his subjects ...&quot; (Scottish Parliament 1662); and by the Irish Parliament in the Act of Explanation (1665) &quot;our royal father of blessed memory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom&quot; (Irish Parliament 1665, § 2). The term was used to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century. It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969.

== Background ==

=== 1609–1791 ===
In 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as &quot;planters&quot;, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster. Coupled with Protestant immigration to &quot;unplanted&quot; areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the &quot;planters&quot;, leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) and the Williamite war (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.

Anglican dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the Penal Laws that curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including both Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as Presbyterians) who did not conform to the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland. As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the Irish Catholic ability to rent. With Irish Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant &quot;Peep o&#x27; Day Boys&quot; and Catholic &quot;Defenders&quot;. This created polarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers among Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic reform.

=== 1791–1912 ===
Following the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day.

With the Acts of Union 1800 (which came into force on 1 January 1801), a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the Irish Parliament and incorporation of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a &quot;loyal&quot; Protestant community. Although Catholic emancipation was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland&#x27;s population), Dissenters, and Jews, the Repeal Association&#x27;s campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.

In the late 19th century, the Home Rule movement was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics) who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants) who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Great Britain.

Unionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.

=== 1912–1922 ===

By the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party.
In response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).

In response, nationalists led by Eoin MacNeill formed the Irish Volunteers in 1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the Third Home Rule Bill in the event of British or unionist refusal. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and Ireland&#x27;s involvement in the war, temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with Royal Assent, was suspended for the duration of the war.

The Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the National Volunteers, supporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the New British Army. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them Irish Republican Brotherhood infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of sixteen of the Rising&#x27;s leaders, the separatist Sinn Féin party won the December 1918 general election in Ireland with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 First Dáil (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat of conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State, which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In Ulster, particularly in the six counties which became Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.

The Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This partition of Ireland was confirmed when the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right in December 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 to opt out of the newly established Irish Free State. A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by W. T. Cosgrave, and was quietly dropped. As counties Fermanagh and Tyrone and border areas of Londonderry, Armagh, and Down were mainly nationalist, the Irish Boundary Commission could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or fewer. In October 1922, the Irish Free State government established the North-Eastern Boundary Bureau, a government office which by 1925 had prepared 56 boxes of files to argue its case for large areas of Northern Ireland to be transferred to the Free State.

Northern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own parliament and devolved government. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately gerrymandered unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its population. A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of Independence. The result was communal strife between Catholics and Protestants, with some historians describing this violence, especially that in Belfast, as a pogrom, although historian Peter Hart argues that the term is not appropriate given the reciprocity of violence in Northern Ireland. (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922) and Bloody Sunday (1921)).

=== 1922–1966 ===

A marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve law and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end. Various unionist militias were also incorporated into state structures, including the Ulster Special Constabulary, which Allen Feldman argues &quot;emulated the state&#x27;s fusion of repressive and ideological apparatuses&quot;.

In 1920, in local elections held under proportional representation, nationalists had won control over many local governments, including the County Councils of Fermanagh and Tyrone, and the Londonderry Borough Council governing Derry City. In response, in 1922 the new unionist government re-drew the electoral boundaries to give its supporters a disproportionate majority and abolished proportional representation in favour of first past the post voting. This resulted in control by unionists of areas such as Derry City, Fermanagh, and Tyrone, where they were actually a minority of voters.

The two sides&#x27; positions became strictly defined following this period. From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland&#x27;s nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment, and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored Edward Carson&#x27;s warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA&#x27;s brief Northern Campaign in the 1940s and Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern Ireland became relatively stable for a few years.

== Late 1960s ==

There is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the &#x27;Battle of the Bogside&#x27; on 12 August 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, defined the start of the Troubles as 1 January 1966 for the purposes of the act.

=== Civil rights campaign and unionist backlash ===

In March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland. In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) to oust Terence O&#x27;Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O&#x27;Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too &#x27;soft&#x27; on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies.
At the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV. In April and May 1966, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools, and businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould. On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring &quot;war&quot; against the IRA and anyone helping it. The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home on 27 May. A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls Road. Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland government. The UVF is still considered a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.

In the mid-1960s, a non-violent civil rights campaign began in Northern Ireland. It comprised groups such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the Campaign for Social Justice, the Derry Citizens&#x27; Action Committee, and People&#x27;s Democracy, whose stated goals were:

* an end to job discrimination – it showed evidence that Catholics/nationalists were less likely to be given certain jobs, especially government jobs
* an end to discrimination in housing allocation – it showed evidence that unionist-controlled local councils allocated housing to Protestants ahead of Catholics/nationalists
* one man, one vote – in Northern Ireland, only householders could vote in local elections, while in the rest of the United Kingdom all adults could vote
* an end to gerrymandering of electoral boundaries – this meant that nationalists had less voting power than unionists, even where nationalists were a majority
* reform of the police force (Royal Ulster Constabulary) – it was over 90% Protestant and criticised for sectarianism and police brutality
* repeal of the Special Powers Act – this allowed police to search without a warrant, arrest and imprison people without charge or trial, ban any assemblies or parades, and ban any publications; the Act was used almost exclusively against nationalists

Some suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose ultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of the IRA (then led by Cathal Goulding and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped to create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a dominant faction within it.

On 20 June 1968, civil rights activists, including nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) Austin Currie, protested against housing discrimination by squatting in a house in Caledon, County Tyrone. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children. RUC officers – one of whom was Beattie&#x27;s brother – forcibly removed the activists. Two days before the protest, the two Catholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed by police. Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to Stormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil rights movement.
On 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. Many more marches were held over the following year. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches and held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned. Because of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the RUC, which was almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing the attacks to occur. On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was banned by the Northern Ireland government. When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of nationalist politicians. The incident was filmed by television news crews and shown around the world. It caused outrage among Catholics and nationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and the RUC.

A few days later, a student civil rights group, People&#x27;s Democracy, was formed in Belfast. In late November, O&#x27;Neill promised the civil rights movement some concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too much by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People&#x27;s Democracy began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by loyalists. At Burntollet Bridge, the marchers were attacked by about 200 loyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars, bricks, and bottles in a planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City, it was again attacked. The marchers claimed that police did nothing to protect them and that some officers helped the attackers. That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry, attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse. Residents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out, creating &quot;Free Derry&quot;, which was briefly a no-go area for the security forces.

In March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water. Loyalists hoped the bombings would force O&#x27;Neill to resign and bring an end to any concessions to nationalists. There were six bombings between 30 March and 26 April. All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O&#x27;Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as prime minister.

=== August 1969 riots and aftermath ===

On 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend. One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery. Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat another Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven. He died of his injuries the next day.

On 12 August, the loyalist Apprentice Boys of Derry were allowed to march along the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the loyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and petrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm the Bogside. The RUC used CS gas, armoured vehicles, and water cannons, but were kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists. The continuous fighting, which became known as the Battle of the Bogside, lasted for three days.

In response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in Belfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks on RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist districts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed Shorland armoured cars mounted with heavy Browning machine guns. The Shorlands twice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a nine-year-old boy named Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in Armagh, Dungannon, and Coalisland.

During the riots, on 13 August, . He condemned the RUC and said that the Irish Government &quot;can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse&quot;. He called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed and said that Irish Army field hospitals were being set up at the border in County Donegal near Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent solution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military intervention. After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for a possible humanitarian intervention in Northern Ireland. The plan, Exercise Armageddon, was rejected and remained classified for thirty years.

On 14–15 August, British troops were deployed in Operation Banner in Derry and Belfast to restore order, but did not try to enter the Bogside, bringing a temporary end to the riots. Ten people had been killed, among them Rooney (the first child killed by police during the conflict), and 745 had been injured, including 154 who suffered gunshot wounds. 154 homes and other buildings were demolished and over 400 needed repairs, of which 83% of the buildings damaged were occupied by Catholics. Between July and 1 September 505 Catholic and 315 Protestant families were forced to flee their homes. The Irish Army set up refugee camps in the Republic near the border (see Gormanston Camp). Nationalists initially welcomed the British Army, as they did not trust the RUC.

On 9 September, the Northern Ireland Joint Security Committee met at Stormont Castle and decided that
On 10 September, the British Army started construction of the first &quot;peace wall&quot;. It was the first of many such walls across Northern Ireland, and still stands today.

After the riots, the Hunt Committee was set up to examine the RUC. It published its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an unarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to the streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the Shankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles. In October and December 1969, the UVF carried out a number of small bombings in the Republic of Ireland.

== 1970s ==

=== Violence peaks and Stormont collapses ===
Despite the British government&#x27;s attempt to do &quot;nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community&quot; and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as &quot;an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists&quot; meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated.

From 1970 to 1972, an explosion of political violence occurred in Northern Ireland. The deadliest attack in the early 1970s was the McGurk&#x27;s Bar bombing by the UVF in 1971. The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people, just over half of them civilians, were killed, the worst year in the entire conflict.

By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in Derry, blocking access to what was known as Free Derry; 16 of these were impassable even to the British Army&#x27;s one-ton armoured vehicles. Many of the nationalist or republican &quot;no-go areas&quot; were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Armythe Provisional IRA and Official IRA. There are several reasons offered for why violence escalated in these years.

Unionists say the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and Official IRA, particularly the former. These two groups were formed when the IRA split into the &#x27;Provisional&#x27; and &#x27;Official&#x27; factions. While the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation, the new Provisional IRA was determined to wage &quot;armed struggle&quot; against British rule in Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of &quot;defenders of the Catholic community&quot;, rather than seeking working-class ecumenical unity across both communities.

Nationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge in violence. One such incident was the Falls Curfew in July 1970, when 3,000 troops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA and killing four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial in 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants). Moreover, due to poor intelligence, very few of those interned were actually republican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly radicalised as a result of their experiences.

In August 1971, ten civilians were shot dead in the Ballymurphy massacre in Belfast. They were innocent and the killings were unjustified, according to a 2021 coroner&#x27;s inquest. Nine victims were shot by the British Army.

=== Bloody Sunday ===

Bloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later), while fifteen other civilians were wounded. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as &quot;1 Para&quot;.

This was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Troubles as it was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting incident. Bloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and Irish nationalists towards the British military and government while significantly elevating tensions. As a result, the Provisional IRA gained more support, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local areas.

Following the introduction of internment, there were numerous gun battles between the British Army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. These included the Battle at Springmartin and the Battle of Lenadoon. Between 1971 and 1975, 1,981 people were interned: 1,874 were Catholic/republican, and 107 were Protestant/loyalist. There were widespread allegations of abuse and even torture of detainees, and in 1972, the &quot;five techniques&quot; used by the police and army for interrogation were ruled to be illegal following a British government inquiry.

The Provisional IRA, or &quot;Provos&quot;, as they became known, sought to establish themselves as the defender of the nationalist community. The Official IRA (OIRA) began its own armed campaign in reaction to the ongoing violence. The Provisional IRA&#x27;s offensive campaign began in early 1971 when the Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army.

In 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security forces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300 bombings, mostly against commercial targets which they considered &quot;the artificial economy&quot;. Their bombing campaign killed many civilians, notably on Bloody Friday on 21 July, when they set off 22 bombs in the centre of Belfast, killing five civilians, two British soldiers, a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) reservist, and an Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member. Ten days later, nine civilians were killed in a triple car bombing in Claudy. The IRA is accused of committing this bombing but no proof for that accusation is yet published.

In 1972, the Official IRA&#x27;s campaign was largely counter-productive. The Aldershot bombing, an attack on the barracks of the Parachute Regiment in retaliation for Bloody Sunday, killed five female cleaners, a gardener and an army chaplain. The Official IRA killed three soldiers in Derry in April, but Joe McCann was killed by the Parachute Regiment in Belfast during the same month. The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972.

British troop concentrations peaked at 1:50 of the civilian population, the highest ratio found in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, higher than that achieved during the &quot;Malayan Emergency&quot;/&quot;Anti-British National Liberation War&quot; to which the conflict is frequently compared. Operation Motorman, the military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence. In total, almost 22,000 British forces were involved. In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland.

Despite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the Provisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement of a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972) which suspended the unionist-controlled Stormont parliament and government, and introduced &quot;direct rule&quot; from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of &quot;no-go areas&quot; in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.

=== Sunningdale Agreement and UWC strike ===
In June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this body were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called &quot;Irish dimension&quot; involving the Republic. The agreement provided for &quot;power-sharing&quot; – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists; and a &quot;Council of Ireland&quot; – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic that was designed to encourage cross-border co-operation.

Unionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA, whose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with nationalists who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the &quot;Irish dimension&quot; and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor Hugh Logue to an audience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool &quot;by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland&quot; also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian Faulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West, although Faulkner retained his position as Chief Executive in the new government. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan &quot;Dublin is only a Sunningdale away&quot;, and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.

Ultimately, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries and workers, who formed the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council. They organised a general strike, the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by MI5, a part of their campaign to &#x27;disorientate&#x27; British prime minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s government (see also Harold Wilson conspiracy theories). Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC strike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades detonated three no-warning car bombs in Dublin&#x27;s city centre during the Friday evening rush hour, resulting in 26 deaths and close to 300 injuries. Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in Monaghan, killing seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these attacks and the bombings were the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles.

=== Proposal of an independent Northern Ireland ===
Even as his government deployed troops in August 1969, Wilson ordered a secret study of whether the British military could withdraw from Northern Ireland, including all 45 bases, such as the submarine school in Derry. The study concluded that the military could do so in three months, but if increased violence collapsed civil society, Britain would have to send in troops again. Without bases, to do so would be an invasion of Ireland; Wilson thus decided against a withdrawal.

Wilson&#x27;s cabinet discussed the more drastic step of complete British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland as early as February 1969, as one of various possibilities for the region including direct rule. He wrote in 1971 that Britain had &quot;responsibility without power&quot; there, and secretly met with the IRA that year while leader of the opposition; his government in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a ceasefire. During the meetings, the parties discussed complete British withdrawal. Although the British government publicly stated that troops would stay as long as necessary, widespread fear from the Birmingham pub bombings and other IRA attacks in Britain itself increased support among MPs and the public for a military withdrawal.

The failure of Sunningdale and the effectiveness of the UWC strike against British authority were more evidence to Wilson of his 1971 statement. They led to the serious consideration in London of independence until November 1975. Had the withdrawal occurred – which Wilson supported but others, including James Callaghan, opposed – the region would have become a separate dominion. According to the secret plan, codenamed &quot;Doomsday&quot;, Britain would have had as little to do with the new &quot;Ulster Dominion&quot; as possible, with financial subsidies ending within five years. It would not have been an associated state, with Britain in control only of foreign relations, because a war between Ulster and the Republic would involve Britain. The dominion would also not have been a member of the British Commonwealth. The Northern Ireland Office cited the 1948 Newfoundland referendumsin which the island voluntarily joined Canada, its larger neighboras an example that divided Ireland might hopefully follow.

The British negotiations with the IRA, an illegal organisation, angered the Republic&#x27;s government. It did not know what was discussed but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, repartition of the island, or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three &quot;worst case scenarios&quot;, but concluded that the Irish government could do little.

The Irish government had already failed to prevent a crowd from the burning of British Embassy, Dublin in 1972. It believed that Ireland could not enlarge the country&#x27;s small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland&#x27;s inability to do so, would &quot;threaten democratic government in the Republic&quot;, which would jeopardise British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.

Wilson&#x27;s aides had in 1969 come to a similar conclusion, telling him that removing Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom would cause violence and a military intervention by the Republic that would not allow the removal of British troops. Loyalist leader Glen Barr said in 2008 that a British withdrawal would have caused civil war, as Loyalists would have expected the Republic to invade Northern Ireland. Peter Ramsbotham, British Ambassador to the United States, warned of a hostile American reaction.

Wilson&#x27;s desire to extricate the British government from Northern Ireland was ultimately stymied by the fear that doing so might lead to catastrophe. The Irish government so dreaded the consequences that FitzGerald refused to ask Britain not to withdrawas he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceedand other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a &quot;doomsday scenario&quot;. He wrote in 2006 that &quot;Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson&#x27;s premiership&quot;; in 2008, he said that the Republic &quot;was more at risk then than at any time since our formation&quot;.

=== Mid-1970s ===

In February 1974, an IRA time bomb killed 12 people on a coach on the M62 in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In December, a month after the Birmingham pub bombings killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made 1975 one of the &quot;bloodiest years of the conflict&quot;.

On 7 August 1974, a 24 year old man from Limehill near Pomeroy, County Tyrone was shot in the back and killed by a member of the British Army (First Battalion, Royal Regiment of Wales). At the first inquest the soldier was cleared of all charges but in 2020 another inquest was ordered by the Attorney General. The inquest was the first in a series of coroners&#x27; inquiries into deaths associated with the Troubles. The Coroner ruled that the killing of Paddy McElhone was unjustified with a judge stating &quot;an innocent man shot in cold blood without warning when he was no threat to anyone.&quot; The McElhone family issued a statement reading in part: &quot;Our family always knew that Paddy was an innocent young man, taken from his home and shot by a British soldier for no reason&quot;. The statement also said that his parents &quot;went to their graves broken-hearted knowing that their innocent son had been killed, without justification, explanation or apology&quot;. 

On 5 April 1975, Irish republican paramilitary members killed a UDA volunteer and four Protestant civilians in a gun and bomb attack at the Mountainview Tavern on the Shankill Road, Belfast. The attack was claimed by the Republican Action Force believed to be a covername used by Provisional IRA (IRA) volunteers.

On 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside Newry, popular Irish cabaret band the Miami Showband was returning home to Dublin after a gig in Banbridge when it was ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main A1 road. Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band&#x27;s minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in Kingsmill, South Armagh after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force. This resulted in 10 fatalities, with one man surviving despite being shot 18 times. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a loyalist double shooting attack against the Reavey and O&#x27;Dowd families the previous night.

The violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. This included a series of attacks in Southern England in 1974 and 1975 by Provisional IRA active service unit the Balcombe Street Gang. The British Government reinstated the ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal organisation. The Provisional IRA&#x27;s December 1974 ceasefire officially ended in January 1976, although it had carried out several attacks in 1975. The Provisional IRA had lost the hope it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the &quot;Long War&quot;, which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the &quot;Official&quot; movement eventually evolved into the Workers&#x27; Party, which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the &quot;Officials&quot;the Irish National Liberation Armycontinued a campaign of violence beginning in 1974.

=== Late 1970s ===

By the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities. One sign of this was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces.

In February 1978, the IRA bombed La Mon, a hotel restaurant in Comber, County Down. The decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the British. On 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten, while on holiday in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other people were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten&#x27;s son-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local boatman. That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the Parachute Regiment, were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the Warrenpoint ambush at Narrow Water Castle, near Warrenpoint, County Down. It was the British Army&#x27;s largest loss of life in a single incident in Operation Banner.

Successive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political settlement, tried to &quot;normalise&quot; Northern Ireland. Aspects included the removal of internment without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless Diplock courts to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the Maze prison initiating the &quot;blanket&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot; protests. Their protests culminated in hunger strikes in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status, as well as other concessions.

== 1980s ==

In the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands&#x27;s death. The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people attended Sands&#x27;s funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy.

In the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the Provisional IRA&#x27;s political wing, began to contest elections for the first time in both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the Irish Dáil, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn Féin.

The IRA&#x27;s &quot;Long War&quot; was boosted by large donations of arms from Libya in the 1980s (see Provisional IRA arms importation) partly due to Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s anger at British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government for assisting the Reagan government&#x27;s 1986 bombing of Libya, which had allegedly killed one of Gaddafi&#x27;s children. Additionally, it received funding from supporters in the Republic of Ireland and the United States and elsewhere throughout the Irish diaspora. Loyalist paramilitaries also received significant funding and arms from supporters in Canada and Scotland.

In July 1982, the IRA bombed military ceremonies in London&#x27;s Hyde Park and Regent&#x27;s Park, killing four soldiers, seven bandsmen, and seven horses. The INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In December 1982, it bombed a disco in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, frequented by off-duty British soldiers which killed 11 soldiers and six civilians. In December 1983, the IRA attacked Harrods using a car bomb, killing six people. One of the IRA&#x27;s most high-profile actions in this period was the Brighton hotel bombing on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound time bomb in the Grand Brighton Hotel in Brighton, where politicians including Thatcher were staying for the Conservative Party conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early hours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry, and injured 34 others.

On 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers were killed in a mortar attack on the police station. It was planned by the IRA&#x27;s South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a mark 10 mortar which was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight shells overshot the station; the ninth hit a portable cabin which was being used as a canteen. It was the RUC&#x27;s largest loss of life during the Troubles. On 8 May 1987, eight IRA members attacked an RUC station in Loughgall, County Armagh, using a bomb and guns. All were killed by the SAS – the most IRA members killed in a single incident in the Troubles. On 8 November 1987 in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, a Provisional IRA time bomb exploded during a Remembrance Sunday ceremony for UK Commonwealth war casualties. The bomb went off near a cenotaph that was at the heart of the parade. Eleven people (ten civilians and one serving member of the RUC) were killed and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously injured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in this condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000. The unit that carried out the bombing was disbanded. Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics, mostly civilians. Another bomb had been planted at nearby Tullyhommon at a parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate.

In March 1988, three IRA volunteers who were planning a bombing were shot dead by the SAS at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory attached to the south of Spain. This became known as Operation Flavius. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was attacked by Michael Stone, a UDA member who threw grenades as the coffin was lowered and shot at people who chased him. Stone killed three people, including IRA volunteer Kevin Brady. Stone was jailed for life the following year, but was freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement. Two British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, who were in plain clothes, drove their car into Brady&#x27;s funeral cortege in Andersonstown. The crowd assumed the soldiers were loyalists intent on repeating Stone&#x27;s attack; dozens of people surrounded and attacked their car. The soldiers were pulled out of their car, kidnapped and shot dead by the IRA. This became known as the Corporals killings.

In September 1989, the IRA used a time bomb to attack the Royal Marine Depot, Deal in Kent, killing 11 bandsmen.

Towards the end of the decade, the British Army tried to soften its public appearance to residents in communities such as Derry in order to improve relations between the local community and the military. Soldiers were told not to use the telescopic sights on their rifles to scan the streets, as civilians believed they were being aimed at. Soldiers were also encouraged to wear berets when manning checkpoints (and later other situations) rather than helmets, which were perceived as militaristic and hostile. The system of complaints was overhauled – previously, if civilians believed they were being harassed or abused by soldiers in the streets or during searches and made a complaint, they would never find out what action (if any) was taken. The new regulations required an officer to visit the complainants house to inform them of the outcome of their complaint.

In the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups—the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association, and Ulster Resistance—imported arms and explosives from South Africa. The weapons obtained were divided between the groups, although some of the weaponry (such as rocket-propelled grenades) were hardly used. In 1987, the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA, engaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA&#x27;s presence in some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its involvement in drug dealing, thus ending the feud.

== 1990s ==
=== Escalation in South Armagh ===
The IRA&#x27;s South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA strongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd.

In the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot patrols near Crossmaglen. They developed two sniper teams to attack British Army and RUC patrols. They usually fired from an improvised armoured car using a .50 BMG calibre M82 sniper rifle. Signs were put up around South Armagh reading &quot;Sniper at Work&quot;. The snipers killed a total of nine members of the security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed before the Good Friday Agreement was a British soldier, bombardier Steven Restorick.

The IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and elsewhere since the 1980s, including the 1990 shootdown of a Gazelle flying over the border between counties Tyrone and Monaghan by the East Tyrone Brigade; there were no fatalities in any of those incidents.

Another incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the Battle of Newry Road in September 1993. Two other helicopters, a British Army Lynx and a Royal Air Force Puma were shot down by improvised mortar fire in 1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, which were unchallenged by the security forces.

=== Downing Street mortar attack ===
On 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by firing a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War. The shelling caused only four injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the entire war cabinet were unharmed.

=== First ceasefire ===
After a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.

The year leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock, County Londonderry in which four people were killed. The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist areas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were killed – six Catholics and two Protestants.

On 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed three UVF members in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub in Loughinisland, County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a ceasefire. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the &quot;Combined Loyalist Military Command&quot;, reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires.

In 1995, the United States appointed George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy and as representing a President (Bill Clinton) with a deep interest in events. The British and Irish governments agreed that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups.

=== Second ceasefire ===
On 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others, and causing £85 million in damage to the city&#x27;s financial centre. Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government&#x27;s refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons.

The attack was followed by several more, most notably the 1996 Manchester bombing, which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It was the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack avoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of the emergency services, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of them outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was estimated at £411 million. Lance bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed during the Troubles, was shot dead at a checkpoint on the Green Rd near Bessbrook on 12 February 1997 by the IRA&#x27;s South Armagh sniper.

The IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn Féin. In September of the same year, Sinn Féin signed the Mitchell Principles and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader Billy Wright, leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group split from the Provisional IRA and formed the Real IRA (RIRA).

In August 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 civilians, the most by a single bomb during the Troubles. This bombing discredited &quot;dissident republicans&quot; and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously supported the Provisionals&#x27; campaign. They became small groups with little influence, but still capable of violence.

The INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Good Friday Agreement. Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their &quot;own&quot; communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between &quot;brigade commanders&quot; and involvement in organised crime.

=== Political process ===

After the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of &quot;power-sharing&quot;. In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.

A security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in Operation Banner – including the resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment – that would be replaced by an infantry brigade, deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.

The power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following &quot;Stormontgate&quot;, a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA&#x27;s failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties.

A feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been eclipsed in electoral terms of parties such as the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) by rival parties such as Sinn Féin and the DUP. Similarly, although political violence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared. Residential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists than ever. Thus, progress towards restoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.

== Support outside Northern Ireland ==

===Arms importation===

Both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives. Irish Republican paramilitaries received the vast majority of external support. Over the years, the Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers in the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons, and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.

The IRA&#x27;s primary external support was from the Republic of Ireland, whose safe haven allowed the group to raise legal and illegal funds, organise and train, and manufacture a large number of firearms and explosives with ease and then smuggled them into Northern Ireland and England. The IRA&#x27;s primary weapon in the Republic was explosives (including gelignite and ANFO), which were responsible for the vast majority of the bombings in Northern Ireland and England throughout the conflict. While the plastic explosive Semtex donated by Gaddafi was appreciated and infamous in IRA bombing campaigns, they were actually sparsely used. Notable events of IRA bombs of Irish origin included Bloody Friday, the Warrenpoint ambush, the assassination of Lord Mountbatten, and the Hyde Park and Regent&#x27;s Park bombings.

Loyalist paramilitaries also received support, mainly from Protestant supporters in Canada, England, and Scotland (including members of the Orange Order). From 1979 to 1986, loyalist paramilitaries imported up to 100 machine guns and &quot;as many rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition from Canada.&quot; Members of the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland sent gelignite explosives to UDA and UVF members. British Army&#x27;s Force Research Unit (FRU) agent Brian Nelson also secured a large amount of weaponry from the South African government to loyalists.

===Funding===

Irish Republican and Loyalist militants also received significant funding from groups, individuals, and state actors outside Northern Ireland. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, Libya gave the IRA over $12.5 million in cash (equivalent to $ million in ). The IRA also received at least $2 million from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in exchange for training them with bomb techniques, including shaped charges, propane bombs, landmines, and the construction of mortars (see also the Colombia Three). On the Loyalist side, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that &quot;in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to £100,000 a year.&quot;

In the Anglosphere outside Great Britain, Irish Americans, Irish Canadians, Irish Australians, and Irish New Zealanders provided considerable or substantial financial donations to the Republican movement, mostly the Provisionals. The financial backbone of the Provisional cause in America was the Irish Northern Aid Committee (NORAID), which was estimated to have raised $3.6 million between 1970 and 1991, including for supporting families of dead or imprisoned IRA members, lobbying and propaganda efforts, and sometimes purchasing weapons for the Provisional IRA. In Australia, officials estimated that by the 1990s, no more than A$20,000 were raised annually for the Provisionals. Canadian supporters raised money to secretly purchase weapons, notably detonators used for Canadian mining sites and smuggled to the IRA.

However, nearly all or the vast majority of the funding for both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries came from criminal and business activities within the island of Ireland and Great Britain. The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that:Historically, the vast majority of paramilitary funds for both Republican and Loyalist groups have been generated within Northern Ireland. The primary reason for this is the relative ease of raising funds within these communities. Sympathy for the cause is greatest within the originating community. Those concerned also have the local knowledge which facilitates crime or the direct intimidation of individuals from whom money is sought. The fact that Northern Ireland remains predominantly a cash economy also encourages a local focus, as it facilitates money laundering and makes it difficult for the law enforcement agencies to trace transactions.

== Collusion between security forces and paramilitaries ==
There were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against loyalists, and hindering police investigations. The De Silva Report found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces, who in turn also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of or with the knowledge of their handlers. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or informers.

The British Army&#x27;s locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was almost wholly Protestant. Despite recruits being vetted, some loyalist militants managed to enlist, mainly to obtain weapons, training, and information. A 1973 British Government document (uncovered in 2004), &quot;Subversion in the UDR&quot;, suggested that 5–15% of UDR soldiers then were members of loyalist paramilitaries. The report said the UDR was the main source of weapons for those groups, although by 1973, UDR weapons losses had dropped significantly, partly due to stricter controls. In 1977, the Army investigated a UDR battalion based at Girdwood Barracks, Belfast. The investigation found that 70 soldiers had links to the UVF, that thirty soldiers had fraudulently diverted up to £47,000 to the UVF, and that UVF members socialised with soldiers in their mess. Following this, two UDR members were dismissed. The investigation was halted after a senior officer claimed it was harming morale. By 1990, at least 197 UDR soldiers had been convicted of loyalist terrorist offences and other serious crimes, including 19 convicted of murder. This was only a small fraction of those who served in the UDR, but the proportion was higher than the regular British Army, the RUC, and the civilian population.

During the 1970s, the Glenanne ganga secret alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers, and RUC officerscarried out a string of gun and bomb attacks against nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the &quot;murder triangle&quot;. It also carried out some attacks in the Republic, killing about 120 people in total, mostly uninvolved civilians. The &quot;Cassel Report&quot; investigated 76 murders attributed to the group and found evidence that soldiers and policemen were involved in 74 of those. One member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of the collusion but allowed it to continue. The Cassel Report also stated some senior officers knew of the crimes but did nothing to prevent, investigate, or punish perpetrators. Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (1974), the Miami Showband killings (1975), and the Reavey and O&#x27;Dowd killings (1976).

The Stevens Inquiries found that elements of the security forces had used loyalists as &quot;proxies&quot; who, via double-agents and informers, had helped loyalist groups to kill targeted individuals, usually suspected republicans but also civilians both intentionally and otherwise. The inquiries concluded this had intensified and prolonged the conflict. The British Army&#x27;s Force Research Unit (FRU) was the main agency involved. Brian Nelson, the UDA&#x27;s chief &#x27;intelligence officer&#x27;, was a FRU agent. Through Nelson, FRU helped loyalists target people for assassination. FRU commanders say they helped loyalists target only suspected or known republican activists and prevented the killing of civilians. The Inquiries found evidence only two lives were saved and that Nelson/FRU was responsible for at least 30 murders and many other attacks, many on civilians. One victim was solicitor Pat Finucane. Nelson also supervised the shipping of weapons to loyalists in 1988. From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for more deaths than republicans, partly due to FRU involvement. Members of the security forces tried to obstruct the Stevens investigation.

A Police Ombudsman report from 2007 revealed that UVF members had been allowed to commit a string of terrorist offences, including murder, while working as informers for RUC Special Branch. It found that Special Branch had given informers immunity by ensuring they were not caught or convicted and blocking weapons searches. Ombudsman Nuala O&#x27;Loan concluded that this had led to &quot;hundreds&quot; of deaths and said senior British Government officials pressured her into halting her investigation. UVF member Robin Jackson has been linked to between 50 and 100 killings in Northern Ireland, although he was never convicted for any. It is alleged by many, including members of the security forces, that Jackson was an RUC agent. The Irish Government&#x27;s Barron Report alleged that Jackson also &quot;had relationships with British Intelligence&quot;. In 2016, a new Ombudsman report concluded that there had been collusion between the police and the UVF in relation to the deaths of six Catholic men in the 1994 Loughinisland massacre and that the investigation was undermined by the wish to protect informers, but found no evidence police had foreknowledge of the attack.

The Smithwick Tribunal concluded that a member of the (the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s police force) colluded with the IRA in the killing of two senior RUC officers in 1989. The two officers were ambushed by the IRA near Jonesborough, County Armagh, when returning from a cross-border security conference in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland.

== The Disappeared ==

During the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then secretly killed and buried. Eighteen peopletwo women and sixteen menincluding one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles. They are referred to informally as &quot;The Disappeared&quot;. All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans. Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists. The remains of all but four of &quot;The Disappeared&quot; have been recovered and turned over to their families.

== British Army attacks on civilians ==
British government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as &quot;extrajudicial killings&quot; of unarmed civilians. Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers on 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians on 12 May that same year. A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, provoking sectarian conflict and &quot;taking the heat off the Army&quot;. A former member stated: &quot;[W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group.&quot;

== Shoot-to-kill allegations ==

Republicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and pointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in 1987 were heavily armed. On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to confirm suspicions among republicans and in the British and Irish media of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members.

== Parades issue ==

Inter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the &quot;marching season&quot; when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange&#x27;s victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade and loyalist counter-riots against its banning.

In 1995, 1996, and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver killed by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in Ballymoney was petrol-bombed.

== Social repercussions ==


The impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London. The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults. There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, &quot;romperings&quot;, and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions. The legacy of the Troubles has been viewed by some, including researcher Rupert Taylor, as still persistent in Northern Ireland more than two decades after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, as inequality and division between Catholics and Protestants continue. 

In addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment and a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as Sailortown and the Pound Loney were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts. Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s, there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.

According to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a &quot;confused hedonism&quot; in respect of personal life. In Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the divorce rate rose. Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a result of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican areas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in some of the poorer districts. The Department of Health has looked at a report written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of Queen&#x27;s University, which asserted that the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current rate of suicide in Northern Ireland.

Further social issues arising from the Troubles include antisocial behavior and an aversion towards political participation. According to one historian, children raised during the Troubles were found to develop similar antisocial external behaviors as children similarly born in regions of conflict, notably those born and raised during World War II. Further studies into the impact of violence on the psychological development of children in Northern Ireland also found that those raised during the Troubles were more likely to be averse towards political participation, noting that while older generations still actively associated with their own social and political groups, younger generations became wary of such groups as social and political divisions continued to expand during the thirty years of the Troubles.

Peace lines, which were built in Northern Ireland during the early years of the Troubles, remain in place.

According to a 2022 poll, 69% of Irish nationalists polled believe there was no option but &quot;violent resistance to British rule during the Troubles&quot;.

== Casualties ==

According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001. Of these, 3,489 were killed up to 1998. According to the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot; (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict from 1966 to 2006. Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998.

In &quot;The Politics of Antagonism: Understanding Northern Ireland&quot;, Brendan O&#x27;Leary and John McGarry point out that &quot;nearly two per cent of the population of Northern Ireland have been killed or injured through political violence [...] If the equivalent ratio of victims to population had been produced in Great Britain in the same period some 100,000 people would have died, and if a similar level of political violence had taken place, the number of fatalities in the USA would have been over 500,000&quot;. Using this relative comparison to the US, analyst John M. Gates suggests that whatever one calls the conflict, it was &quot;certainly not&quot; a &quot;low intensity conflict&quot;.

In 2010, it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered some physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data gathered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the Victims Commission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 &#x27;victims&#x27; in Northern Ireland alone. It defines &#x27;victims&#x27; are those who are directly affected by &#x27;bereavement&#x27;, &#x27;physical injury&#x27;, or &#x27;trauma&#x27; as a result of the conflict.

One statistical breakdown of Troubles deaths put the death toll at 3,466, with 3,218 lives lost in Northern Ireland, 125 in Great Britain, 105 in the Republic of Ireland, and 18 in the rest of Europe.

=== Responsibility ===
Republican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of all deaths, loyalists 30% and British security forces 10%.

Loyalists killed 48% of the civilian casualties, republicans killed 39%, and the British security forces killed 10%. Most of the Catholic civilians were killed by loyalists, and most of the Protestant civilians were killed by republicans.

Of those killed by republican paramilitaries:

* 1,080 (~52.5%) were members/former members of the British security forces
* 722 (~35.1%) were civilians
* 188 (~9.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries
* 57 (~2.8%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries
* 11 (~0.5%) were members of the Irish security forces

Of those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:

* 878 (~85.5%) were civilians
* 94 (~9.2%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries
* 41 (~4.0%) were members of republican paramilitaries
* 14 (~1.4%) were members of the British security forces

Of those killed by British security forces:

* 188 (~51.5%) were civilians
* 146 (~40.2%) were members of republican paramilitaries
* 18 (~5.0%) were members of loyalist paramilitaries
* 13 (~3.6%) were fellow members of the British security forces

=== Status ===

Approximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries. About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland.

About 257 of those killed were children under the age of seventeen, representing 7.2% of the total, while 274 children under the age of eighteen were killed during the conflict.

It has been the subject of dispute whether some individuals were members of paramilitary organisations. Several casualties that were listed as civilians were later claimed by the IRA as their members. One Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and three Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members killed during the conflict were also Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers at the time of their deaths. At least one civilian victim was an off-duty member of the Territorial Army.

=== Location ===

Most killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast and County Armagh. Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city. Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself. Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.

== Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 ==

On 18 September 2023, the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 (c. 41), also known as the Legacy Act received royal assent. 

The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has raised concerns about the legislation&#x27;s incompatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998. The legislation exempts conduct related to the Troubles from prosecution and establishes the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery.

The legislation has been criticised by all major political parties in Northern Ireland, the Labour Party and the Irish government - the Irish government announced it was challenging the legislation through the European Court of Human Rights and Labour have pledged to repeal the legislation, but have stated they would keep the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery.

<text>Theoretical ecology is the scientific discipline devoted to the study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.

The field is broad and includes foundations in applied mathematics, computer science, biology, statistical physics, genetics, chemistry, evolution, and conservation biology. Theoretical ecology aims to explain a diverse range of phenomena in the life sciences, such as population growth and dynamics, fisheries, competition, evolutionary theory, epidemiology, animal behavior and group dynamics, food webs, ecosystems, spatial ecology, and the effects of climate change.

Theoretical ecology has further benefited from the advent of fast computing power, allowing the analysis and visualization of large-scale computational simulations of ecological phenomena. Importantly, these modern tools provide quantitative predictions about the effects of human induced environmental change on a diverse variety of ecological phenomena, such as: species invasions, climate change, the effect of fishing and hunting on food network stability, and the global carbon cycle.

==Modelling approaches==

As in most other sciences, mathematical models form the foundation of modern ecological theory.
* Phenomenological models: distill the functional and distributional shapes from observed patterns in the data, or researchers decide on functions and distribution that are flexible enough to match the patterns they or others (field or experimental ecologists) have found in the field or through experimentation.
* Mechanistic models: model the underlying processes directly, with functions and distributions that are based on theoretical reasoning about ecological processes of interest.

Ecological models can be deterministic or stochastic.

* Deterministic models always evolve in the same way from a given starting point. They represent the average, expected behavior of a system, but lack random variation. Many system dynamics models are deterministic.
* Stochastic models allow for the direct modeling of the random perturbations that underlie real world ecological systems. Markov chain models are stochastic.

Species can be modelled in continuous or discrete time.

* Continuous time is modelled using differential equations.
* Discrete time is modelled using difference equations. These model ecological processes that can be described as occurring over discrete time steps. Matrix algebra is often used to investigate the evolution of age-structured or stage-structured populations. The Leslie matrix, for example, mathematically represents the discrete time change of an age structured population.

Models are often used to describe real ecological reproduction processes of single or multiple species.
These can be modelled using stochastic branching processes. Examples are the dynamics of interacting populations (predation competition and mutualism), which, depending on the species of interest, may best be modeled over either continuous or discrete time. Other examples of such models may be found in the field of mathematical epidemiology where the dynamic relationships that are to be modeled are host–pathogen interactions.

Bifurcation theory is used to illustrate how small changes in parameter values can give rise to dramatically different long run outcomes, a mathematical fact that may be used to explain drastic ecological differences that come about in qualitatively very similar systems. Logistic maps are polynomial mappings, and are often cited as providing archetypal examples of how chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The maps were popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the theoretical ecologist Robert May. The difference equation is intended to capture the two effects of reproduction and starvation.

In 1930, R.A. Fisher published his classic &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;, which introduced the idea that frequency-dependent fitness brings a strategic aspect to evolution, where the payoffs to a particular organism, arising from the interplay of all of the relevant organisms, are the number of this organism&#x27; s viable offspring. In 1961, Richard Lewontin applied game theory to evolutionary biology in his &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;,
followed closely by John Maynard Smith, who in his seminal 1972 paper, “Game Theory and the Evolution of Fighting&quot;, defined the concept of the evolutionarily stable strategy.

Because ecological systems are typically nonlinear, they often cannot be solved analytically and in order to obtain sensible results, nonlinear, stochastic and computational techniques must be used. One class of computational models that is becoming increasingly popular are the agent-based models. These models can simulate the actions and interactions of multiple, heterogeneous, organisms where more traditional, analytical techniques are inadequate. Applied theoretical ecology yields results which are used in the real world. For example, optimal harvesting theory draws on optimization techniques developed in economics, computer science and operations research, and is widely used in fisheries.

==Population ecology==

Population ecology is a sub-field of ecology that deals with the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the environment. It is the study of how the population sizes of species living together in groups change over time and space, and was one of the first aspects of ecology to be studied and modelled mathematically.

===Exponential growth===
The most basic way of modeling population dynamics is to assume that the rate of growth of a population depends only upon the population size at that time and the per capita growth rate of the organism. In other words, if the number of individuals in a population at a time t, is N(t), then the rate of population growth is given by:
:formula_1
where r is the per capita growth rate, or the intrinsic growth rate of the organism. It can also be described as r = b-d, where b and d are the per capita time-invariant birth and death rates, respectively. This first order linear differential equation can be solved to yield the solution
:formula_2,
a trajectory known as Malthusian growth, after Thomas Malthus, who first described its dynamics in 1798. A population experiencing Malthusian growth follows an exponential curve, where N(0) is the initial population size. The population grows when r &gt; 0, and declines when r &lt; 0. The model is most applicable in cases where a few organisms have begun a colony and are rapidly growing without any limitations or restrictions impeding their growth (e.g. bacteria inoculated in rich media).

===Logistic growth===
The exponential growth model makes a number of assumptions, many of which often do not hold. For example, many factors affect the intrinsic growth rate and is often not time-invariant. A simple modification of the exponential growth is to assume that the intrinsic growth rate varies with population size. This is reasonable: the larger the population size, the fewer resources available, which can result in a lower birth rate and higher death rate. Hence, we can replace the time-invariant r with r’(t) = (b –a*N(t)) – (d + c*N(t)), where a and c are constants that modulate birth and death rates in a population dependent manner (e.g. intraspecific competition). Both a and c will depend on other environmental factors which, we can for now, assume to be constant in this approximated model. The differential equation is now:
:formula_3
This can be rewritten as:
:formula_4
where r = b-d and K = (b-d)/(a+c).

The biological significance of K becomes apparent when stabilities of the equilibria of the system are considered. The constant K is the carrying capacity of the population. The equilibria of the system are N = 0 and N = K. If the system is linearized, it can be seen that N = 0 is an unstable equilibrium while K is a stable equilibrium.

===Structured population growth===
Another assumption of the exponential growth model is that all individuals within a population are identical and have the same probabilities of surviving and of reproducing. This is not a valid assumption for species with complex life histories. The exponential growth model can be modified to account for this, by tracking the number of individuals in different age classes (e.g. one-, two-, and three-year-olds) or different stage classes (juveniles, sub-adults, and adults) separately, and allowing individuals in each group to have their own survival and reproduction rates.
The general form of this model is
:formula_5
where Nt is a vector of the number of individuals in each class at time &quot;t&quot; and L is a matrix that contains the survival probability and fecundity for each class. The matrix L is referred to as the Leslie matrix for age-structured models, and as the Lefkovitch matrix for stage-structured models.

If parameter values in L are estimated from demographic data on a specific population, a structured model can then be used to predict whether this population is expected to grow or decline in the long-term, and what the expected age distribution within the population will be. This has been done for a number of species including loggerhead sea turtles and right whales.

==Community ecology==
An ecological community is a group of trophically similar, sympatric species that actually or potentially compete in a local area for the same or similar resources. Interactions between these species form the first steps in analyzing more complex dynamics of ecosystems. These interactions shape the distribution and dynamics of species. Of these interactions, predation is one of the most widespread population activities.
Taken in its most general sense, predation comprises predator–prey, host–pathogen, and host–parasitoid interactions.

===Predator–prey interaction===
Predator–prey interactions exhibit natural oscillations in the populations of both predator and the prey. In 1925, the American mathematician Alfred J. Lotka developed simple equations for predator–prey interactions in his book on biomathematics. The following year, the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra, made a statistical analysis of fish catches in the Adriatic and independently developed the same equations. It is one of the earliest and most recognised ecological models, known as the Lotka-Volterra model:

:formula_6
:formula_7
where N is the prey and P is the predator population sizes, r is the rate for prey growth, taken to be exponential in the absence of any predators, α is the prey mortality rate for per-capita predation (also called ‘attack rate’), c is the efficiency of conversion from prey to predator, and d is the exponential death rate for predators in the absence of any prey.

Volterra originally used the model to explain fluctuations in fish and shark populations after fishing was curtailed during the First World War. However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally. Other examples of these models include the Lotka-Volterra model of the snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx in North America, any infectious disease modeling such as the recent outbreak of SARS

and biological control of California red scale by the introduction of its parasitoid, &quot;Aphytis melinus&quot;

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator–prey model and their common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka–Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio-dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.

===Host–pathogen interaction===
The second interaction, that of host and pathogen, differs from predator–prey interactions in that pathogens are much smaller, have much faster generation times, and require a host to reproduce. Therefore, only the host population is tracked in host–pathogen models. Compartmental models that categorize host population into groups such as susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) are commonly used.

===Host–parasitoid interaction===
The third interaction, that of host and parasitoid, can be analyzed by the Nicholson–Bailey model, which differs from Lotka-Volterra and SIR models in that it is discrete in time. This model, like that of Lotka-Volterra, tracks both populations explicitly. Typically, in its general form, it states:
:formula_8
:formula_9
where f(Nt, Pt) describes the probability of infection (typically, Poisson distribution), λ is the per-capita growth rate of hosts in the absence of parasitoids, and c is the conversion efficiency, as in the Lotka-Volterra model.

=== Competition and mutualism ===
In studies of the populations of two species, the Lotka-Volterra system of equations has been extensively used to describe dynamics of behavior between two species, N1 and N2. Examples include relations between &quot;D. discoiderum&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;,
as well as theoretical analysis of the behavior of the system.
:formula_10
:formula_11
The r coefficients give a “base” growth rate to each species, while K coefficients correspond to the carrying capacity. What can really change the dynamics of a system, however are the α terms. These describe the nature of the relationship between the two species. When α12 is negative, it means that N2 has a negative effect on N1, by competing with it, preying on it, or any number of other possibilities. When α12 is positive, however, it means that N2 has a positive effect on N1, through some kind of mutualistic interaction between the two.
When both α12 and α21 are negative, the relationship is described as competitive. In this case, each species detracts from the other, potentially over competition for scarce resources.
When both α12 and α21 are positive, the relationship becomes one of mutualism. In this case, each species provides a benefit to the other, such that the presence of one aids the population growth of the other.

:&quot;See Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations for further extensions of this model.&quot;

===Neutral theory===
Unified neutral theory is a hypothesis proposed by Stephen P. Hubbell in 2001. The hypothesis aims to explain the diversity and relative abundance of species in ecological communities, although like other neutral theories in ecology, Hubbell&#x27;s hypothesis assumes that the differences between members of an ecological community of trophically similar species are &quot;neutral,&quot; or irrelevant to their success. Neutrality means that at a given trophic level in a food web, species are equivalent in birth rates, death rates, dispersal rates and speciation rates, when measured on a per-capita basis. This implies that biodiversity arises at random, as each species follows a random walk. This can be considered a null hypothesis to niche theory. The hypothesis has sparked controversy, and some authors consider it a more complex version of other null models that fit the data better.

Under unified neutral theory, complex ecological interactions are permitted among individuals of an ecological community (such as competition and cooperation), providing all individuals obey the same rules. Asymmetric phenomena such as parasitism and predation are ruled out by the terms of reference; but cooperative strategies such as swarming, and negative interaction such as competing for limited food or light are allowed, so long as all individuals behave the same way. The theory makes predictions that have implications for the management of biodiversity, especially the management of rare species. It predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity constant, conventionally written &quot;θ&quot;, that appears to govern species richness on a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales.

Hubbell built on earlier neutral concepts, including MacArthur &amp; Wilson&#x27;s theory of island biogeography and Gould&#x27;s concepts of symmetry and null models.

==Spatial ecology==
===Biogeography===
Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species in space and time. It aims to reveal where organisms live, at what abundance, and why they are (or are not) found in a certain geographical area.

Biogeography is most keenly observed on islands, which has led to the development of the subdiscipline of island biogeography. These habitats are often a more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. In 1967, Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson published &quot;The Theory of Island Biogeography&quot;. This showed that the species richness in an area could be predicted in terms of factors such as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate. The theory is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory. The application of island biogeography theory to habitat fragments spurred the development of the fields of conservation biology and landscape ecology.

==== r/K-selection theory ====
A population ecology concept is r/K selection theory, one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience &quot;density-independent&quot; forces of natural selection, which is called &quot;r&quot;-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island&#x27;s carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called &quot;K&quot;-selection.

===Niche theory===
===Metapopulations===
Spatial analysis of ecological systems often reveals that assumptions that are valid for spatially homogenous populations – and indeed, intuitive – may no longer be valid when migratory subpopulations moving from one patch to another are considered. In a simple one-species formulation, a subpopulation may occupy a patch, move from one patch to another empty patch, or die out leaving an empty patch behind. In such a case, the proportion of occupied patches may be represented as
:formula_12
where m is the rate of colonization, and e is the rate of extinction. In this model, if e &lt; m, the steady state value of p is 1 – (e/m) while in the other case, all the patches will eventually be left empty. This model may be made more complex by addition of another species in several different ways, including but not limited to game theoretic approaches, predator–prey interactions, etc. We will consider here an extension of the previous one-species system for simplicity. Let us denote the proportion of patches occupied by the first population as p1, and that by the second as p2. Then,
:formula_13
:formula_14
In this case, if e is too high, p1 and p2 will be zero at steady state. However, when the rate of extinction is moderate, p1 and p2 can stably coexist. The steady state value of p2 is given by
:formula_15
(p*1 may be inferred by symmetry).
If e is zero, the dynamics of the system favor the species that is better at colonizing (i.e. has the higher m value). This leads to a very important result in theoretical ecology known as the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, where the biodiversity (the number of species that coexist in the population) is maximized when the disturbance (of which e is a proxy here) is not too high or too low, but at intermediate levels.

The form of the differential equations used in this simplistic modelling approach can be modified. For example:
# Colonization may be dependent on p linearly (m*(1-p)) as opposed to the non-linear m*p*(1-p) regime described above. This mode of replication of a species is called the “rain of propagules”, where there is an abundance of new individuals entering the population at every generation. In such a scenario, the steady state where the population is zero is usually unstable.
# Extinction may depend non-linearly on p (e*p*(1-p)) as opposed to the linear (e*p) regime described above. This is referred to as the “rescue effect” and it is again harder to drive a population extinct under this regime.

The model can also be extended to combinations of the four possible linear or non-linear dependencies of colonization and extinction on p are described in more detail in.

==Ecosystem ecology==
Introducing new elements, whether biotic or abiotic, into ecosystems can be disruptive. In some cases, it leads to ecological collapse, trophic cascades and the death of many species within the ecosystem. The abstract notion of ecological health attempts to measure the robustness and recovery capacity for an ecosystem; i.e. how far the ecosystem is away from its steady state. Often, however, ecosystems rebound from a disruptive agent. The difference between collapse or rebound depends on the toxicity of the introduced element and the resiliency of the original ecosystem.

If ecosystems are governed primarily by stochastic processes, through which its subsequent state would be determined by both predictable and random actions, they may be more resilient to sudden change than each species individually. In the absence of a balance of nature, the species composition of ecosystems would undergo shifts that would depend on the nature of the change, but entire ecological collapse would probably be infrequent events. In 1997, Robert Ulanowicz used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow), and eutrophication.

Ecopath is a free ecosystem modelling software suite, initially developed by NOAA, and widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.

===Food webs===
Food webs provide a framework within which a complex network of predator–prey interactions can be organised. A food web model is a network of food chains. Each food chain starts with a primary producer or autotroph, an organism, such as a plant, which is able to manufacture its own food. Next in the chain is an organism that feeds on the primary producer, and the chain continues in this way as a string of successive predators. The organisms in each chain are grouped into trophic levels, based on how many links they are removed from the primary producers. The length of the chain, or trophic level, is a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from plants to top predators. Food energy flows from one organism to the next and to the next and so on, with some energy being lost at each level. At a given trophic level there may be one species or a group of species with the same predators and prey.

In 1927, Charles Elton published an influential synthesis on the use of food webs, which resulted in them becoming a central concept in ecology. In 1966, interest in food webs increased after Robert Paine&#x27;s experimental and descriptive study of intertidal shores, suggesting that food web complexity was key to maintaining species diversity and ecological stability. Many theoretical ecologists, including Sir Robert May and Stuart Pimm, were prompted by this discovery and others to examine the mathematical properties of food webs. According to their analyses, complex food webs should be less stable than simple food webs. The apparent paradox between the complexity of food webs observed in nature and the mathematical fragility of food web models is currently an area of intensive study and debate. The paradox may be due partially to conceptual differences between persistence of a food web and equilibrial stability of a food web.

===Systems ecology===
Systems ecology can be seen as an application of general systems theory to ecology. It takes a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to the study of ecological systems, and particularly ecosystems. Systems ecology is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. Like other fields in theoretical ecology, it uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems. It also takes account of the energy flows through the different trophic levels in the ecological networks. Systems ecology also considers the external influence of ecological economics, which usually is not otherwise considered in ecosystem ecology. For the most part, systems ecology is a subfield of ecosystem ecology.

==Ecophysiology==
This is the study of how &quot;the environment, both physical and biological, interacts with the physiology of an organism. It includes the effects of climate and nutrients on physiological processes in both plants and animals, and has a particular focus on how physiological processes scale with organism size&quot;.

==Behavioral ecology==
===Swarm behaviour===

Swarm behaviour is a collective behaviour exhibited by animals of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps migrating in some direction. Swarm behaviour is commonly exhibited by insects, but it also occurs in the flocking of birds, the schooling of fish and the herd behaviour of quadrupeds. It is a complex emergent behaviour that occurs when individual agents follow simple behavioral rules.

Recently, a number of mathematical models have been discovered which explain many aspects of the emergent behaviour. Swarm algorithms follow a Lagrangian approach or an Eulerian approach. The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a field, working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms. However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an agent-based model following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm. Individual particle models can follow information on heading and spacing that is lost in the Eulerian approach. Examples include ant colony optimization, self-propelled particles and particle swarm optimization.

On cellular levels, individual organisms also demonstrated swarm behavior. Decentralized systems are where individuals act based on their own decisions without overarching guidance. Studies have shown that individual &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; behave like self-propelled particles (SPPs) and collectively display phase transition from ordered movement to disordered movements. Previously, it was thought that the surface-to-volume ratio was what limited the animal size in the evolutionary game. Considering the collective behaviour of the individuals, it was suggested that order is another limiting factor. Central nervous systems were indicated to be vital for large multicellular animals in the evolutionary pathway.

=== Synchronization ===
&quot;Photinus carolinus&quot; firefly will synchronize their shining frequencies in a collective setting. Individually, there are no apparent patterns for the flashing. In a group setting, periodicity emerges in the shining pattern. The coexistence of the synchronization and asynchronization in the flashings in the system composed of multiple fireflies could be characterized by the chimera states. Synchronization could spontaneously occur. The agent-based model has been useful in describing this unique phenomenon. The flashings of individual fireflies could be viewed as oscillators and the global coupling models were similar to the ones used in condensed matter physics.

==Evolutionary ecology==
The British biologist Alfred Russel Wallace is best known for independently proposing a theory of evolution due to natural selection that prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory. In his famous 1858 paper, Wallace proposed natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism which keeps species and varieties adapted to their environment.

&quot;The action of this principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.&quot;

The cybernetician and anthropologist Gregory Bateson observed in the 1970s that, though writing it only as an example, Wallace had &quot;probably said the most powerful thing that’d been said in the 19th Century&quot;. Subsequently, the connection between natural selection and systems theory has become an area of active research.

==Other theories==
In contrast to previous ecological theories which considered floods to be catastrophic events, the river flood pulse concept argues that the annual flood pulse is the most important aspect and the most biologically productive feature of a river&#x27;s ecosystem.

==History==
Theoretical ecology draws on pioneering work done by G. Evelyn Hutchinson and his students. Brothers H.T. Odum and E.P. Odum are generally recognised as the founders of modern theoretical ecology. Robert MacArthur brought theory to community ecology. Daniel Simberloff was the student of E.O. Wilson, with whom MacArthur collaborated on &quot;The Theory of Island Biogeography&quot;, a seminal work in the development of theoretical ecology.

Simberloff added statistical rigour to experimental ecology and was a key figure in the SLOSS debate, about whether it is preferable to protect a single large or several small reserves. This resulted in the supporters of Jared Diamond&#x27;s community assembly rules defending their ideas through Neutral Model Analysis. Simberloff also played a key role in the (still ongoing) debate on the utility of corridors for connecting isolated reserves.

Stephen P. Hubbell and Michael Rosenzweig combined theoretical and practical elements into works that extended MacArthur and Wilson&#x27;s Island Biogeography Theory - Hubbell with his Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography and Rosenzweig with his Species Diversity in Space and Time.

<text>Thomas Nast (; ; September 26, 1840December 7, 1902) was a German-born American caricaturist and editorial cartoonist often considered to be the &quot;Father of the American Cartoon&quot;.

He was a sharp critic of &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic Party political machine. He created a modern version of Santa Claus (based on the traditional German figures of Saint Nicholas and Weihnachtsmann) and the political symbol of the elephant for the Republican Party (GOP). Contrary to popular belief, Nast did not create Uncle Sam (the male personification of the United States Federal Government), Columbia (the female personification of American values), or the Democratic donkey, although he did popularize those symbols through his artwork. Nast was associated with the magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from 1859 to 1860 and from 1862 until 1886. Nast&#x27;s influence was so widespread that Theodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;Thomas Nast was our best teacher.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Nast was born in military barracks in Landau, Bavaria, Germany (now in Rhineland-Palatinate), as his father was a trombonist in the Bavarian 9th regiment band. Nast was the last child of Appolonia (née Abriss) and Joseph Thomas Nast. He had an older sister Andie; two other siblings had died before he was born. His father held political convictions that put him at odds with the Bavarian government, so in 1846, Joseph Nast left Landau, enlisting first on a French man-of-war and subsequently on an American ship. He sent his wife and children to New York City, where they arrived in June 1846, and at the end of his enlistment in 1850, he joined them there.

Nast attended school in New York City from the age of six to 14. He did poorly at his lessons, but his passion for drawing was apparent from an early age. In 1854, at the age of 14, he was enrolled for about a year of study with Alfred Fredericks and Theodore Kaufmann, and then at the school of the National Academy of Design. In 1856, he started working as a draftsman for &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;. His drawings appeared for the first time in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on March 19, 1859, when he illustrated a report exposing police corruption; Nast was 18 years old at that point.

==Career==

In February 1860, he went to England for the &quot;New York Illustrated News&quot; to depict one of the major sporting events of the era, the prize fight between the American John C. Heenan and the English Thomas Sayers sponsored by George Wilkes, publisher of &quot;Wilkes&#x27; Spirit of the Times&quot;. A few months later, as artist for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, he joined Garibaldi in Italy. Nast&#x27;s cartoons and articles about the Garibaldi military campaign to unify Italy captured the popular imagination in the U.S. In February 1861, he arrived back in New York. In September of that year, he married Sarah Edwards, whom he had met two years earlier.

He left the &quot;New York Illustrated News&quot; to work again, briefly, for &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated News&quot;. In 1862, he became a staff illustrator for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. In his first years with &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, Nast became known especially for compositions that appealed to the sentiment of the viewer. An example is &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1862), in which a wreath frames a scene of a soldier&#x27;s praying wife and sleeping children at home; a second wreath frames the soldier seated by a campfire, gazing longingly at small pictures of his loved ones. One of his most celebrated cartoons was &quot;Compromise with the South&quot; (1864), directed against those in the North who opposed the prosecution of the American Civil War. He was known for drawing battlefields in border and southern states. These attracted great attention, and Nast was referred to by President Abraham Lincoln as &quot;our best recruiting sergeant&quot;.

After the war, Nast strongly opposed the anti-Reconstruction policy of President Andrew Johnson, whom he depicted in a series of trenchant cartoons that marked &quot;Nast&#x27;s great beginning in the field of caricature&quot;.

===Style and themes===
Nast&#x27;s cartoons frequently had numerous sidebars and panels with intricate subplots to the main cartoon. A Sunday feature could provide hours of entertainment and highlight social causes. After 1870, Nast favored simpler compositions featuring a strong central image. He based his likenesses on photographs.

In the early part of his career, Nast used a brush and ink wash technique to draw tonal renderings onto the wood blocks that would be carved into printing blocks by staff engravers. The bold cross-hatching that characterized Nast&#x27;s mature style resulted from a change in his method that began with a cartoon of June 26, 1869, which Nast drew onto the wood block using a pencil, so that the engraver was guided by Nast&#x27;s linework. This change of style was influenced by the work of the English illustrator John Tenniel. A recurring theme in Nast&#x27;s cartoons is anti-Catholicism. Nast was baptized a Catholic at the Saint Maria Catholic Church in Landau, and for a time received Catholic education in New York City. 

When Nast converted to Protestantism remains unclear, but his conversion was likely formalized upon his marriage in 1861. (The family were practicing Episcopalians at St. Peter&#x27;s in Morristown.) Nast considered the Catholic Church to be a threat to American values. According to his biographer, Fiona Deans Halloran, Nast was &quot;intensely opposed to the encroachment of Catholic ideas into public education&quot;. When Tammany Hall proposed a new tax to support parochial Catholic schools, he was outraged. 
His 1871 cartoon &quot;The American River Ganges&quot;, depicts Catholic bishops, guided by Rome, as crocodiles moving in to attack American school children as Irish politicians prevent their escape. He portrayed public support for religious education as a threat to democratic government. The authoritarian papacy in Rome, ignorant Irish Americans, and corrupt politicians at Tammany Hall figured prominently in his work. Nast favored nonsectarian public education that mitigated differences of religion and ethnicity. However, in 1871 Nast and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; supported the Republican-dominated board of education in Long Island in requiring students to hear passages from the King James Bible, and his educational cartoons sought to raise anti-Catholic and anti-Irish fervor among Republicans and independents.

Nast expressed anti-Irish sentiment by depicting them as violent drunks. He used Irish people as a symbol of mob violence, machine politics, and the exploitation of immigrants by political bosses. Nast&#x27;s emphasis on Irish violence may have originated in scenes he witnessed in his youth. Nast was physically small and had experienced bullying as a child. In the neighborhood in which he grew up, acts of violence by the Irish against black Americans were commonplace.

In 1863, he witnessed the New York City draft riots in which a mob composed mainly of Irish immigrants burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground. His experiences may explain his sympathy for black Americans and his &quot;antipathy to what he perceived as the brutish, uncontrollable Irish thug&quot;. An 1876 Nast cartoon combined a caricature of Charles Francis Adams Sr with anti-Irish sentiment and anti-Fenianship.

In general, his political cartoons supported American Indians and Chinese Americans. He advocated the abolition of slavery, opposed racial segregation, and deplored the violence of the Ku Klux Klan. In one of his more famous cartoons, the phrase &quot;Worse than Slavery&quot; is printed on a coat of arms depicting a despondent black family holding their dead child; in the background is a lynching and a schoolhouse destroyed by arson. Two members of the Ku Klux Klan and White League, paramilitary insurgent groups in the Reconstruction-era South, shake hands in their mutually destructive work against black Americans.

Despite Nast&#x27;s championing of minorities, Morton Keller writes that later in his career &quot;racist stereotypy of blacks began to appear: comparable to those of the Irish—though in contrast with the presumably more highly civilized Chinese.&quot;

During Nast&#x27;s era, William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays were an inherent part of the school curriculum. He introduced into American cartoons the practice of modernizing scenes from Shakespeare for a political purpose, referencing 23 of his 37 plays in more than 100 cartoons—sometimes with just a recognizable line or two, but generally with pictorial content.

Nast also brought his approach to bear on the usually prosaic almanac business, publishing an annual &quot;Nast&#x27;s Illustrated Almanac&quot; from 1871 to 1875. &quot;The Green Bag&quot; republished all five of Nast&#x27;s almanacs in the 2011 edition of its &quot;Almanac &amp; Reader&quot;.

===Campaign against the Tweed Ring===
Nast&#x27;s drawings were instrumental in the downfall of Boss Tweed, the powerful Tammany Hall leader. As commissioner of public works for New York City, Tweed led a ring that by 1870 had gained total control of the city&#x27;s government, and controlled &quot;a working majority in the State Legislature&quot;. Tweed and his associates—Peter Barr Sweeny (park commissioner), Richard B. Connolly (controller of public expenditures), and Mayor A. Oakey Hall—defrauded the city of many millions of dollars by grossly inflating expenses paid to contractors connected to the Ring. Nast, whose cartoons attacking Tammany corruption had appeared occasionally since 1867, intensified his focus on the four principal players in 1870 and especially in 1871.

Tweed so feared Nast&#x27;s campaign that he sent an emissary to offer the artist a bribe of $100,000, which was represented as a gift from a group of wealthy benefactors to enable Nast to study art in Europe. Feigning interest, Nast negotiated for more before finally refusing an offer of $500,000 with the words, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do it. I made up my mind not long ago to put some of those fellows behind the bars&quot;. Nast pressed his attack in the pages of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and the Ring was removed from power in the election of November 7, 1871. Tweed was arrested in 1873 and convicted of fraud. When Tweed attempted to escape justice in December 1875 by fleeing to Cuba and from there to Spain, officials in Vigo were able to identify the fugitive by using one of Nast&#x27;s cartoons.

===Party politics===
Nast was the first journalist who did not own his newspaper to play a major role in shaping public opinion. His cartoons were influential in deciding five presidential elections: Abraham Lincoln (1864); Ulysses S. Grant (1868 and 1872); Rutherford B. Hayes (1876)—all Republicans—and Democrat Grover Cleveland (1884). His biting cartoons ridiculed the losers: George B. McClellan (1864); Horatio Seymour (1868); Horace Greeley (1872); Samuel J. Tilden (1876); and James G. Blaine (1884). Nast effectively sat out the 1880 election because he distrusted Republican James A. Garfield (who won) and admired Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, a Civil War hero and Nast&#x27;s personal friend. 

In addition to his talent, creativity and the repetitive impact of his cartoons, Nast benefited from his lack of meaningful competition before &quot;Puck&quot; arrived in 1877, and from the financial strength, editorial consistency and reach of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. America&#x27;s leading illustrated newspaper&#x27;s circulation was about 120,000 during the Civil War, 200,000 during subsequent presidential elections, and almost 300,000 during the height of the Tweed campaign. With passalong readership, Nast&#x27;s audience reached 500,000 to more than a million viewers.

The single most important and influential cartoon that Nast ever drew appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on August 24, 1864 (post-dated September 3) as the Democratic National Committee was assembling in Chicago to nominate McClellan (whom Lincoln had fired as his top Union general two years earlier) for president. &quot;Compromise with the South—Dedicated to the Chicago Convention&quot; captured the very crux of the existential emotional and political stake at issue in the forthcoming election.

Nast&#x27;s scathing caricature featured an arrogant, exultant Jefferson Davis shaking hands with a crippled Union soldier who—with his head bowed and his only leg shackled to a ball and chain—humbly accepted it. Columbia, representing the Union and modeled by Nast&#x27;s wife Sallie, wept at the gravestone marked &quot;In Memory of Our Union Heroes Who Fell in a Useless War.&quot; As Davis&#x27;s boot stomped on a Union grave and broke the sword of Northern Power, the cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails in his left hand was ready to flog his vanquished enemies. A Black family in chains despaired behind Davis. The Union flag, upside down in distress, recited its successes, including emancipation, on its stripes; the Confederate flag detailed a list of atrocities.

On October 16—almost eight weeks after Nast&#x27;s cartoon appeared—the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; published some more extreme demands which were not in the Democratic platform. Lincoln&#x27;s reelection managers took Nast&#x27;s cartoon, added &quot;The Rebel Terms of Peace,&quot; and made more than a million copies as campaign posters. In combination with General William T. Sherman&#x27;s capture of Atlanta on September 1 and General Phil Sheridan&#x27;s victory in the Shenandoah Valley on October 19, &quot;A Traitor&#x27;s Peace&quot; probably was the single most effective visual campaign advertisement in any American presidential election before or since.

Nast played an important role during the presidential election in 1868, and Ulysses S. Grant attributed his victory to &quot;the sword of Sheridan and the pencil of Thomas Nast.&quot; In the 1872 presidential campaign, Nast&#x27;s ridicule of Horace Greeley&#x27;s candidacy was especially merciless. After Grant&#x27;s victory in 1872, Mark Twain wrote the artist a letter saying: &quot;Nast, you more than any other man have won a prodigious victory for Grant—I mean, rather, for Civilization and Progress.&quot; Nast became a close friend of President Grant and the two families shared regular dinners until Grant&#x27;s death in 1885.

Nast and his wife moved to Morristown, New Jersey in 1872 and there they raised a family that eventually numbered five children. In 1873, Nast toured the United States as a lecturer and a sketch-artist. His activity on the lecture circuit made him wealthy. Nast was for many years a staunch Republican. Nast opposed inflation of the currency, notably with his famous rag-baby cartoons, and he played an important part in securing Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27; ultimate victory in the presidential election in 1876. Hayes later remarked that Nast was &quot;the most powerful, single-handed aid [he] had&quot;, but Nast quickly became disillusioned with President Hayes, whose lenient policy towards the South in removing federal troops he opposed.

The death of the &quot;Weekly&quot;″s publisher, Fletcher Harper, in 1877 resulted in a changed relationship between Nast and his editor George William Curtis. His cartoons appeared less frequently, and he was not given free rein to criticize Hayes or his policies. Beginning in the late 1860s, Nast and Curtis had frequently differed on political matters and particularly on the role of cartoons in political discourse. Curtis believed that the powerful weapon of caricature should be reserved for &quot;the Ku-Klux Democracy&quot; of the opposition party, and did not approve of Nast&#x27;s cartoons assailing Republicans such as Carl Schurz and Charles Sumner who opposed policies of the Grant administration. Nast said of Curtis: &quot;When he attacks a man with his pen it seems as if he were apologizing for the act. I try to hit the enemy between the eyes and knock him down.&quot; Fletcher Harper consistently supported Nast in his disputes with Curtis. After his death, his nephews, Joseph W. Harper Jr. and John Henry Harper, assumed control of the magazine and were more sympathetic to Curtis&#x27;s arguments for rejecting cartoons that contradicted his editorial positions.

Between 1877 and 1884, Nast&#x27;s work appeared only sporadically in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, which began publishing the milder political cartoons of William Allen Rogers. Although his sphere of influence was diminishing, from this period date dozens of his pro-Chinese immigration drawings, often implicating the Irish as instigators. Nast blamed U.S. Senator James G. Blaine (R-Maine) for his support of the Chinese Exclusion Act and depicted Blaine with the same zeal used against Tweed. Nast was one of the few editorial artists who took up for the cause of the Chinese in America.

During the presidential election of 1880, Nast felt that he could not support the Republican candidate, James A. Garfield, because of Garfield&#x27;s involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal; and did not wish to attack the Democratic candidate, Winfield Scott Hancock, his personal friend and a Union general whose integrity commanded respect. As a result, &quot;Nast&#x27;s commentary on the 1880 campaign lacked passion&quot;, according to Halloran. He submitted no cartoons to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; between the end of March 1883 and March 1, 1884, partly because of illness.

In 1884, Curtis and Nast agreed that they could not support the Republican candidate James G. Blaine, a proponent of high tariffs and the spoils system whom they perceived as personally corrupt. Instead, they became Mugwumps by supporting the Democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland, whose platform of civil service reform appealed to them. Nast&#x27;s cartoons helped Cleveland become the first Democrat to be elected president since 1856. In the words of the artist&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Nast St Hill, &quot;it was generally conceded that Nast&#x27;s support won Cleveland the small margin by which he was elected. In this his last national political campaign, Nast had, in fact, &#x27;made a president&#x27;.&quot;

Nast&#x27;s tenure at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; ended with his Christmas illustration of December 1886. It was said by the journalist Henry Watterson that &quot;in quitting &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, Nast lost his forum: in losing him, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; lost its political importance.&quot; Fiona Deans Halloran says &quot;the former is true to a certain extent, the latter unlikely.&quot;

Nast lost most of his fortune in 1884 after investing in a banking and brokerage firm operated by the swindler Ferdinand Ward. In need of income, Nast returned to the lecture circuit in 1884 and 1887. Although these tours were successful, they were less remunerative than the lecture series of 1873.

===After &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;===
In 1890, Nast published &quot;Thomas Nast&#x27;s Christmas Drawings for the Human Race&quot;. He contributed cartoons in various publications, notably the &quot;Illustrated American&quot;, but was unable to regain his earlier popularity. His mode of cartooning had come to be seen as outdated, and a more relaxed style exemplified by the work of Joseph Keppler was in vogue. Health problems, which included pain in his hands which had troubled him since the 1870s, affected his ability to work.

In 1892, he took control of a failing magazine, the &quot;New York Gazette&quot;, and renamed it &quot;Nast&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Now returned to the Republican fold, Nast used the &quot;Weekly&quot; as a vehicle for his cartoons supporting Benjamin Harrison for president. The magazine had little impact and ceased publication seven months after it began, shortly after Harrison&#x27;s defeat.

The failure of &quot;Nast&#x27;s Weekly&quot; left Nast with few financial resources. He received a few commissions for oil paintings and drew book illustrations. In 1902, he applied for a job in the State Department, hoping to secure a consular position in western Europe. Although no such position was available, President Theodore Roosevelt was an admirer of the artist and offered him an appointment as the United States&#x27; Consul General to Guayaquil, Ecuador in South America. Nast accepted the position and traveled to Ecuador on July 1, 1902. During a subsequent yellow fever outbreak, Nast remained on the job, helping numerous diplomatic missions and businesses escape the contagion. He contracted the disease and died on December 7 of that year. His body was returned to the United States, where he was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
Nast&#x27;s depictions of iconic characters, such as Santa Claus and Uncle Sam, are widely credited as forming the basis of popular depictions used today. Additional contributions by Nast include:

* Republican Party elephant
* Democratic Party donkey (although the donkey was associated with the Democrats as early as 1837, Nast popularized the representation)
* Tammany Hall tiger, a symbol of Boss Tweed&#x27;s political machine
* Uncle Sam, a lanky avuncular personification of the United States (first drawn in the 1830s; Nast and John Tenniel added the goatee)
* John Confucius, a variation of John Chinaman, a traditional caricature of a Chinese immigrant
* , 1871
* &quot;Peace in Union&quot;, a by oil painting which depicts the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865. The painting was a commission from Herman Kohlsaat in 1894. Upon its completion in 1895 it was presented as a gift to the citizens of Galena, Illinois.

In December 2011, a proposal to include Nast in the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2012 caused controversy. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that because of his stereotypical cartoons of the Irish, a number of objections were raised about Nast&#x27;s work. For example, &quot;The Usual Irish Way of Doing Things&quot; portrays an Irishman as being sub-human, drunk, and violent.

=== Thomas Nast Award ===
The Thomas Nast Award has been presented each year since 1968 by the Overseas Press Club to an editorial cartoonist for the &quot;best cartoons on international affairs.&quot; Past winners include Signe Wilkinson, Kevin (KAL) Kallaugher, Mike Peters, Clay Bennett, Mike Luckovich, Tom Toles, Herbert Block, Tony Auth, Jeff MacNelly, Dick Locher, Jim Morin, Warren King, Tom Darcy, Don Wright and Patrick Chappatte.

In December 2018, The OPC Board of Governors decided to remove Nast&#x27;s name from the award noting that Nast &quot;exhibited an ugly bias against immigrants, the Irish and Catholics&quot;. OPC President Pancho Bernasconi stated &quot;Once we became aware of how some groups and ethnicities were portrayed in a manner that is not consistent with how journalists work and view their role today, we voted to remove his name from the award.&quot;

=== Thomas Nast Prize ===
The Thomas Nast Prize for editorial cartooning has been awarded by the Thomas Nast Foundation (located in Nast&#x27;s birthplace of Landau, Germany) since 1978 when it was first given to Jeff MacNelly. The prize is awarded periodically to one German cartoonist and one North American cartoonist. Winners receive 1,300 Euros, a trip to Landau, and the Thomas Nast medal. The American advisory committee includes Nast&#x27;s descendant Thomas Nast III of Fort Worth, Texas. Other winners of the Thomas Nast Prize include Jim Borgman, Paul Szep, Pat Oliphant, David Levine, Jim Morin, and Tony Auth.

===Supposed connection to the word &quot;Nasty&quot;===
The word &quot;&quot; is erroneously thought to derive from Nast&#x27;s name, due to the cynical tone of many of his cartoons. In reality, the word&#x27;s origins are unclear, but it is ancient, with written evidence that dates to the 1400s. Chief etymological theories prominently include derivation from Old Norse, Old French and/or some relation to a Dutch term.

<text>The Teutonic Order is a Catholic religious institution founded as a military society in Acre, Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem was formed to aid Christians on their pilgrimages to the Holy Land and to establish hospitals. Its members have commonly been known as the Teutonic Knights, having historically served as a crusading military order for supporting Catholic rule in the Holy Land and the Northern Crusades during the Middle Ages, as well as supplying military protection for Catholics in Eastern Europe.

Purely religious since 1810, the Teutonic Order still confers limited honorary knighthoods. The Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Order, a Protestant chivalric order, is descended from the same medieval military order and also continues to award knighthoods and perform charitable work.

==Name==
The name of the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem is in and in Latin . Thus the term &quot;Teutonic&quot; echoes the German origins of the order () in its Latin name. German-speakers commonly refer to the (official short name, literally &quot;German Order&quot;), historically also as (&quot;German Order of Knights&quot;), (&quot;Order of the German Lords&quot;), (&quot;Order of the German Knights&quot;), (&quot;Knights of Mary&quot;), (&quot;The lords in white capes&quot;), &quot;etc.&quot;.

The Teutonic Knights have been known as in Polish (&quot;Order of the Cross&quot;) and as in Lithuanian, in Latvian, or, simply, (&quot;The Order&quot;) in Estonian.
==History==

The fraternity which preceded the formation of the Order was formed in the year 1191 in Acre by German merchants from Bremen and Lübeck. After the capture of Acre they took over a hospital in the city in order to take care of the sick and began to describe themselves as the Hospital of St. Mary of the German House in Jerusalem. Pope Clement III approved it and the Order started to play an important role in Outremer (the general name for the Crusader states), controlling the port tolls of Acre. After Christian forces were defeated in the Middle East, the Order was moved to Burzenland (southeastern Transylvania) in 1211 to help defend the southeastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cumans. The Order invited German planters to help build up settlements to provide support. As the Order pushed back the invaders, the settlements expanded. King Andrew II of Hungary became concerned he was losing influence. So, in 1225, after Pope Honorius III&#x27;s papal bull claiming his authority over the Order&#x27;s territory in Transylvania and its tax exemption toward the king, Andrew expelled the Order.

The Order&#x27;s next assignment concerned Konrad I of Masovia, who was settling a frontier around Prussia, a region named for the Prussians who lived there. Konrad was unable to stop the Prussian raids and the Dobrzyń knights he had gathered for this purpose were defeated, in 1228. So, in coordination with the Holy Roman Empire and Konrad, the Grand Master Hermann von Salza and his Teutonic Order arrived in the region, in 1230. Along with Konrad&#x27;s forces, the Order pushed back the Prussians and began to push further to conquer and Christianize them.

Through the Golden Bull of Rimini and Treaty of Kruszwica, the Order asserted its claims to the territory that was now secure, the Chełmno Land (also: Ziemia Chełmińska or Kulmerland). From this, the Order created the independent State of the Teutonic Order, to which conquered territory was continuously added. Through the incorporation of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and further crusading, the added territory included Livonia. Over time, certain kings and dukes of Poland would challenge the Order&#x27;s land claims, specifically Chełmno Land and, later, Pomerelia (also Pomorze Gdańskie or Pomerania), Kuyavia, and Dobrzyń Land.

Following the Christianization of Lithuania, the Order State was no longer crusading. It was instead recruiting planters from the Holy Roman Empire and a fighting force to augment feudal levies. There were also wars against the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Novgorod Republic. Through its control of port cities and trade, specifically with the Hanseatic League, the Order State built up its economic base. The Order State also built ships and had a naval presence in the Baltic Sea. In 1410, a Polish-Lithuanian army decisively defeated the Order State and broke its military power at the Battle of Grunwald. However, the Order State successfully defended its capital in the following Siege of Marienburg (Malbork) and was saved from collapse.

In 1515, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I made a marriage alliance with Sigismund I of Poland-Lithuania. Thereafter, the empire did not support the Order against Poland. In 1525, Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg resigned and converted to Lutheranism, becoming Duke of Prussia as a vassal of Poland. Soon after, the Order lost Livonia and its holdings in the Protestant areas of Germany. The Order did keep its considerable holdings in Catholic areas of Germany until 1809, when Napoleon Bonaparte ordered its dissolution and the Order lost its last secular holdings.

However, the Order continued to exist as a charitable and ceremonial body. It was outlawed by Nazi Germany in 1938, but re-established in 1945. Today it operates primarily with charitable aims in Central Europe.

The Knights wore white surcoats with a black cross. A cross pattée was sometimes used as their coat of arms; this emblem was later used for military decoration and insignia by the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany as the Iron Cross. The motto of the Order was: &quot;Helfen, Wehren, Heilen&quot; (&quot;Help, Defend, Heal&quot;).

=== Foundation ===

In 1143, Pope Celestine II ordered the Knights Hospitaller to take over management of a German hospital in Jerusalem, which, according to the chronicler Jean d&#x27;Ypres, accommodated the countless German pilgrims and crusaders who could neither speak the local language nor Latin (&quot;patriæ linguam ignorantibus atque Latinam&quot;). Although formally an institution of the Hospitallers, the pope commanded that the prior and the brothers of the &quot;domus Theutonicorum&quot; (house of the Germans) should always be Germans themselves, so a tradition of a German-led religious institution could develop during the 12th century in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

After the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, some merchants from Lübeck and Bremen took up the idea and founded a field hospital for the duration of the Siege of Acre in 1190, which became the nucleus of the order; Pope Celestine III recognized it in 1192 by granting the monks Augustinian Rule. However, based on the model of the Knights Templar, it was transformed into a military order in 1198 and the head of the order became known as the Grand Master (&quot;magister hospitalis&quot;). It received papal orders for crusades to take and hold Jerusalem for Christianity and defend the Holy Land against the Muslim Saracens. During the rule of Grand Master Hermann von Salza (1209–1239) the Order changed from being a hospice brotherhood for pilgrims to primarily a military order.

The Order was founded in Acre, and the Knights purchased Montfort Castle, northeast of Acre, in 1220. This castle, which defended the route between Jerusalem and the Mediterranean Sea, was made the seat of the Grand Masters in 1229, although they returned to Acre after losing Montfort to Muslim control in 1271. The Order received donations of land in the Holy Roman Empire (especially in present-day Germany and Italy), Frankokratia, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, elevated his close friend Hermann von Salza to the status of &quot;Reichsfürst&quot;, or &quot;Prince of the Empire&quot;, enabling the Grand Master to negotiate with other senior princes as an equal. During Frederick&#x27;s coronation as King of Jerusalem in 1225, Teutonic Knights served as his escort in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; von Salza read the emperor&#x27;s proclamation in both French and German. However, the Teutonic Knights were never as influential in Outremer as the older Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller.

Teutonic Order domains in the Levant: 
* In the Kingdom of Jerusalem: 
** Montfort Castle (&quot;Starkenberg&quot;), 1220–1271; inland from Nahariya in Northern Israel
** Mi&#x27;ilya (&quot;Castellum Regis&quot;), 1220–1271; near Montfort
** Khirbat Jiddin (&quot;Judin&quot;), 1220–1271; near Montfort
** Cafarlet, 1255–1291; south of Haifa
** the Lordship of Toron and Lordship of Joscelin in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon, both owned by the Teutonic Knights 1220–1229 but under Muslim rule during that period. The Knights retained Maron, a vassal of Toron, after 1229, and in 1261 acquired another Toron-Ahmud, another vassal lordship. They also leased (1256) and bought (1261) the stronghold of Achziv (&quot;Casale Umberti&quot;, Arabic &quot;Az-Zīb&quot;) on the coast north of Nahariya. 
** the Lordship of the Schuf, an offshoot of the Lordship of Sidon, 1256–1268; inland from modern Saida in Lebanon
* In the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia: 
** Amouda, 1212–1266; near modern Osmaniye, Turkey
** Düziçi (&quot;Aronia&quot;), 1236–1270s; near Amouda

=== Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary ===
In 1211, Andrew II of Hungary accepted the services of the Teutonic Knights and granted them the district of Burzenland in Transylvania, where they would be exempt from fees and duties and could administer their own justice. Andrew had been involved in negotiations for the marriage of his daughter with the son of Hermann, Landgrave of Thuringia, whose vassals included the family of Hermann von Salza. Led by a brother called Theoderich or Dietrich, the Order defended the south-eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary against the neighbouring Cumans. Many forts of wood and mud were built for defence. They settled new German peasants among the existing Transylvanian Saxon inhabitants. The Cumans had no fixed settlements for resistance, and soon the Teutons were expanding into their territory. By 1220, the Teutonics Knights had built five castles, some of them made of stone. Their rapid expansion made the Hungarian nobility and clergy, who were previously uninterested in those regions, jealous and suspicious. Some nobles claimed these lands, but the Order refused to share them, ignoring the demands of the local bishop. 

After the Fifth Crusade, King Andrew returned to Hungary and found his kingdom full of resentment because of the expenses and losses of the failed military campaign. When the nobles demanded that he cancel the concessions made to the Knights, he concluded that they had exceeded their task and that the agreement should be revised, but did not revert the concessions. However, Prince Béla, heir to the throne, was allied with the nobility. In 1224, the Teutonic Knights, seeing that they would have problems when the Prince inherited the Kingdom, petitioned Pope Honorius III to be placed directly under the authority of the Papal See, rather than that of the King of Hungary. This was a grave mistake, as King Andrew, angered and alarmed at their growing power, responded in 1225 by expelling the Teutonic Knights, although he allowed the ethnically German commoners and peasants settled here by the Order to remain and these became part of the larger group of the Transylvanian Saxons. Lacking the military organization and experience of the Teutonic Knights, the Hungarians failed to replace them with adequate defence against the attacking Cumans. Soon, the steppe warriors would be a threat again.

===Prussia===

In 1226, Konrad I, Duke of Masovia in north-eastern Poland, appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Old Prussians, allowing the Teutonic Knights use of Chełmno Land as a base for their campaign. This being a time of widespread crusading fervor throughout Western Europe, Hermann von Salza considered Prussia a good training ground for his knights for the wars against the Muslims in Outremer. With the Golden Bull of Rimini, Emperor Frederick II bestowed on the Order a special imperial privilege for the conquest and possession of Prussia, including Chełmno Land, with nominal papal sovereignty. In 1235 the Teutonic Knights assimilated the smaller Order of Dobrzyń, which had been established earlier by Christian, the first Bishop of Prussia.

The conquest of Prussia was accomplished with much bloodshed over more than fifty years, during which native Prussians who remained unbaptised were subjugated, killed, or exiled. Fighting between the Knights and the Prussians was ferocious; chronicles of the Order state the Prussians would &quot;roast captured brethren alive in their armour, like chestnuts, before the shrine of a local god&quot;.

The native nobility who submitted to the crusaders had many of their privileges confirmed by the Treaty of Christburg. After the Prussian uprisings of 1260–83, however, much of the Prussian nobility emigrated or were resettled, and many free Prussians lost their rights. The Prussian nobles who remained were more closely allied with the German landowners and were gradually assimilated. Peasants in frontier regions, such as Samland, had more privileges than those in more populated lands, such as Pomesania. The crusading knights often accepted baptism as a form of submission by the natives. Christianity along western lines slowly spread through Prussian culture. Bishops were reluctant to have pagan Prussian religious practices integrated into the new faith, while the ruling knights found it easier to govern the natives when they were semi-pagan and lawless. After fifty years of warfare and brutal conquest, the end result was that most of the Prussian natives were either killed or deported.

The Order ruled Prussia under charters issued by the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor as a sovereign monastic state, comparable to the arrangement of the Knights Hospitallers in Rhodes and later in Malta.

To make up for losses from the plague and to replace the partially exterminated native population, the Order encouraged immigration from the Holy Roman Empire (mostly Germans, Flemish, and Dutch) and from Masovia (Poles), the later Masurians. These included nobles, burghers, and peasants, and the surviving Old Prussians were gradually assimilated through Germanization. The settlers founded numerous towns and cities on former Prussian settlements. The Order itself built a number of castles (&quot;Ordensburgen&quot;) from which it could defeat uprisings of Old Prussians, as well as continue its attacks on the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, with which the Order was often at war during the 14th and 15th centuries. Major towns founded by the Order included Thorn (Toruń), Kulm (Chełmno), Allenstein (Olsztyn), Elbing (Elbląg), Memel (Klaipėda), and Königsberg, founded in 1255 in honor of King Otakar II of Bohemia on the site of a destroyed Prussian settlement.

===Livonia===

After suffering a devastating defeat in the Battle of Saule, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were absorbed by the Teutonic Knights in 1237. The Livonian branch subsequently became known as the Livonian Order.

Although the Northern Crusades were aimed at pagan Balts and Finns, rather than Orthodox Russians, several unsuccessful attempts were made to persuade Novgorod to convert to Catholicism after the capture of Tartu. Livonian missionary and Crusade activity in Estonia caused conflicts with Novgorod, which had also attempted to subjugate, raid and convert the pagan Estonians. Hoping to exploit Novgorod&#x27;s weakness in the wake of the Mongol and Swedish invasions, the Teutonic Knights penetrated deep into Novgorodian territory; however, in 1242, they were defeated in the Battle of the Ice at the hands of Prince Alexander Nevsky. The &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; describes the events:

Over the next decades the Order focused on the subjugation of the Curonians and Semigallians. In 1260 it suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Durbe against Samogitians, and this inspired rebellions throughout Prussia and Livonia. After the Knights won a crucial victory in the Siege of Königsberg from 1262 to 1265, the war had reached a turning point. The Curonians were finally subjugated in 1267 and the Semigallians in 1290. The Order suppressed a major Estonian rebellion in 1343–1345, and in 1346 purchased the Duchy of Estonia from Denmark.

===Against Lithuania===

The Teutonic Knights began to direct their campaigns against pagan Lithuania (see Lithuanian mythology), due to the long existing conflicts in the region (including constant incursions into the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s territory by pagan raiding parties) and the lack of a proper area of operation for the Knights, after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem at Acre in 1291 and their later expulsion from Hungary. At first the knights moved their headquarters to Venice, from which they planned the recovery of Outremer; this plan was, however, soon abandoned, and the Order later moved its headquarters to Marienburg, so it could better focus its efforts on the region of Prussia. Because &quot;Lithuania Propria&quot; remained non-Christian until the end of the 14th century, much later than the rest of eastern Europe, the conflicts were dragged out over a longer time, and many Knights from western European countries, such as England and France, journeyed to Prussia to participate in the seasonal campaigns (&quot;reyse&quot;) against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1348, the Order won a great victory over the Lithuanians in the Battle of Strėva, severely weakening them. In 1370 it won a decisive victory over Lithuania in the Battle of Rudau.

Warfare between the Order and the Lithuanians was particularly brutal. It was common practice for Lithuanians to torture captured enemies and civilians. It is recorded by a Teutonic chronicler that they had the habit of tying captured knights to their horses and having both of them burned alive, while sometimes a stake would be driven into their bodies or the knight would be flayed. Lithuanian pagan customs included ritualistic human sacrifice, the hanging of widows, and the burying of a warrior&#x27;s horses and servants with him after his death. The knights would also, on occasion, take captives from defeated Lithuanians, whose condition (as that of other war captives in the Middle Ages) was extensively researched by Jacques Heers. The conflict had much influence in the political situation of the region and was the source of many rivalries between Lithuanians or Poles and Germans; the degree to which it impacted the mentalities of the time can be seen in the lyrical works of men such as the contemporary Austrian poet Peter Suchenwirt.

Overall, the conflict lasted over 200 years (although with varying degrees of active hostility during that time), its front line extending along both banks of the Neman River, with as many as twenty forts and castles between Seredžius and Jurbarkas alone.

===Against Poland===

A dispute over the claims to Pomerelia embroiled the Order in further conflict at the beginning of the 14th century. Duke Władysław I the Elbow-high of Poland wanted the region, citing inheritance from Przemysł II. He was opposed by some Pomeranian nobles, but also a Danish prince, who supported the Margrave of Brandenburg&#x27;s claim that the region had been granted to Brandenburg as a fief by King Wenceslaus. Forces from Denmark and Brandenburg had tried and failed to take the site in 1301 and 1306 but, in the summer of 1308, Brandenburg&#x27;s forces tried again, targeting the present-day site of Gdańsk, where a rebellion had erupted in their favor. Władysław pressed the Teutonic Order for help and the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Siegfried von Feuchtwangen, drove Brandenburg out. The Knights requested payment in exchange and Władysław refused.

By November, the Order forces under a Prussian Landmeister Heinrich von Plötzke took the site for themselves. According to some sources, they massacred the town&#x27;s inhabitants, although the exact extent of the violence is unknown and widely recognized by historians to be an unsolvable mystery. The estimates range from 60 rebellious leaders, reported by dignitaries of the region and Knight chroniclers, to 10,000 civilians, a number cited in a papal bull (of dubious provenance) that was used in a legal process installed to punish the Order for the event; the legal dispute went on for a time, but the Order was eventually absolved of the charges. In the Treaty of Soldin, the Teutonic Order purchased the castles of Gdańsk, Świecie, and Tczew and their hinterlands from the margraves for 10,000 marks on 13 September 1309.

Control of Pomerelia allowed the Order to connect their monastic state with the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Crusading reinforcements and supplies could travel from the Imperial territory of Hither Pomerania through Pomerelia to Prussia, while Poland&#x27;s access to the Baltic Sea was blocked. While Poland had mostly been an ally of the knights against the pagan Prussians and Lithuanians, the capture of Pomerelia turned the kingdom into a determined enemy of the Order.

The capture of Gdańsk marked a new phase in the history of the Teutonic Knights. The persecution and abolition of the powerful Knights Templar, which began in 1307, worried the Teutonic Knights, but control of Pomerelia allowed them to move their headquarters in 1309 from Venice to Marienburg (Malbork) on the Nogat River, outside the reach of secular powers. The position of Prussian Landmeister was merged with that of the Grand Master. The Pope began investigating misconduct by the knights, but no charges were found to have substance. Along with the campaigns against the Lithuanians, the knights faced a vengeful Poland and legal threats from the Papacy.

The Treaty of Kalisz of 1343 ended the open war between the Teutonic Knights and Poland. The Knights relinquished Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land to Poland, but retained Chełmno Land and Pomerelia with Gdańsk (Germanized as &quot;Danzig&quot;).

===Battle of Legnica===
In 1236, the Knights of Saint Thomas, an English order, adopted the rules of the Teutonic Order. A contingent of Teutonic Knights of indeterminate number is traditionally believed to have participated at the Battle of Legnica in 1241 during the first Mongol invasion of Poland. The combined Polish-German army was crushed by the Mongol army and their superior tactics, with few survivors.

===Height of power===
In 1337, Emperor Louis IV allegedly granted the Order the imperial privilege to conquer all Lithuania and Russia. During the reign of Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode (1351–1382), the Order reached the peak of its international prestige and hosted numerous European crusaders and nobility.

King Albert of Sweden ceded Gotland to the Order as a pledge (similar to a fiefdom), with the understanding that they would eliminate the pirating Victual Brothers from this strategic island base in the Baltic Sea. An invasion force under Grand Master Konrad von Jungingen conquered the island in 1398 and drove the Victual Brothers out of Gotland and the Baltic Sea.

In 1386, Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania was baptised into Christianity and married Queen Jadwiga of Poland, taking the name Władysław II Jagiełło and becoming King of Poland. This created a personal union between the two countries and a potentially formidable opponent for the Teutonic Knights. The Order initially managed to play Władysław II Jagiełło and his cousin Vytautas against each other, but this strategy failed when Vytautas began to suspect that the Order was planning to annex parts of his territory.

The baptism of Jogaila began the official conversion of Lithuania to Christianity. Although the crusading rationale for the Order&#x27;s state ended when Prussia and Lithuania had become officially Christian, the Order&#x27;s feuds and wars with Lithuania and Poland continued. The Lizard Union was created in 1397 by Prussian nobles in Chełmno Land to oppose the Order&#x27;s policy.

In 1407, the Teutonic Order reached its greatest territorial extent and included the lands of Prussia, Pomerelia, Samogitia, Courland, Livonia, Estonia, Gotland, Dagö, Ösel, and the Neumark, pawned by Brandenburg in 1402.

===Decline===

In 1410, at the Battle of Grunwald a combined Polish–Lithuanian army, led by Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas, decisively defeated the Order in the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and most (50 out of 60) of the Order&#x27;s higher dignitaries fell on the battlefield. The Polish–Lithuanian army then began the Siege of Marienburg (Malbork), the capital of the Order, but was unable to take Marienburg owing to the resistance of Heinrich von Plauen. When the First Peace of Thorn was signed in 1411, the Order managed to retain essentially all of its territories, although the Knights&#x27; reputation as invincible warriors was irreparably damaged.

While Poland and Lithuania were growing in power, that of the Teutonic Knights dwindled through infighting. They were forced to impose high taxes to pay a substantial indemnity but did not give the cities sufficient requested representation in the administration of their state. The authoritarian and reforming Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen was forced from power and replaced by Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg, but the new Grand Master was unable to revive the Order&#x27;s fortunes. After the Gollub War the Knights lost some small border regions and renounced all claims to Samogitia in the 1422 Treaty of Melno. Austrian and Bavarian knights feuded with those from the Rhineland, who likewise bickered with Low German-speaking Saxons, from whose ranks the Grand Master was usually chosen. The western Prussian lands of the Vistula River Valley and the Brandenburg Neumark were ravaged by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Some Teutonic Knights were sent to battle the invaders but were defeated by the Bohemian infantry. The Knights also sustained a defeat in the Polish-Teutonic War (1431–1435).

In 1440, the Prussian Confederation was founded by gentry and burghers of the State of the Teutonic Order. In 1454, it rose up against the Order and asked Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon to incorporate the region into the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed an act of incorporation in Kraków. Mayors, burghers and representatives from the region pledged allegiance to the Polish King during the incorporation in March 1454 in Kraków. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War between the Teutonic Order and Poland. The main cities of the incorporated territory were authorized by Casimir IV to mint Polish coins. Much of Prussia was devastated in the war, during the course of which the Order returned Neumark to Brandenburg in 1455 to raise funds for war. Because Marienburg Castle was handed over to mercenaries in lieu of their pay, and eventually passed to Poland, the Order moved its base to Königsberg in Sambia. In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the defeated Order renounced any claims to the territories of Gdańsk/Eastern Pomerania and Chełmno Land, which were reintegrated with Poland, and the region of Elbląg and Malbork, and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, which were also recognized as part of Poland, while retaining the eastern territories in historic Prussia, but as a fief and protectorate of Poland, also considered an integral part of &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Kingdom of Poland. From now on, every Grand Master of the Teutonic Order was obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning Polish king within six months of taking office. The Grand Master became a prince and counselor of the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland.

After the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521), the Order was completely ousted from Prussia when Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg converted to Lutheranism in 1525. He secularized the Order&#x27;s remaining Prussian territories and assumed from his uncle Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, the hereditary rights to the Duchy of Prussia as a personal vassal of the Polish Crown, the Prussian Homage. Ducal Prussia retained its currency, laws and faith. The aristocracy was not present in the Sejm.

Although it had lost control of all of its Prussian lands, the Teutonic Order retained its territories within the Holy Roman Empire and Livonia, although the Livonian branch retained considerable autonomy. Many of the Imperial possessions were ruined in the German Peasants&#x27; War from 1524 to 1525 and subsequently confiscated by Protestant territorial princes. The Livonian territory was then partitioned by neighboring powers during the Livonian War; in 1561 the Livonian Master Gotthard Kettler secularized the southern Livonian possessions of the Order to create the Duchy of Courland, also a vassal of Poland.

After the loss of Prussia in 1525, the Teutonic Knights concentrated on their possessions in the Holy Roman Empire. Since they held no contiguous territory, they developed a three-tiered administrative system: holdings were combined into commanderies that were administered by a commander (&quot;Komtur&quot;). Several commanderies were combined to form a bailiwick headed by a &quot;Landkomtur&quot;. All of the Teutonic Knights&#x27; possessions were subordinate to the Grand Master, whose seat was in Bad Mergentheim.

There were twelve German bailiwicks:
* Thuringia;
* Alden Biesen (in present-day Belgium);
* Hesse;
* Saxony;
* Westphalia;
* Franconia;
* Koblenz;
* Alsace-Burgundy;
* An der Etsch und im Gebirge (in Tyrol);
* Utrecht;
* Lorraine; and
* Austria.

Outside of German areas were the bailiwicks of
* Sicily;
* Apulia;
* Lombardy;
* Bohemia;
* &quot;Romania&quot; (in Greece); and
* Armenia-Cyprus.

The Order gradually lost control of these holdings until, by 1809, only the seat of the Grand Master at Mergentheim remained.

Following the abdication of Albert of Brandenburg, Walter von Cronberg became &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; in 1527, and later Administrator of Prussia and Grand Master in 1530. Emperor Charles V combined the two positions in 1531, creating the title &quot;Hoch- und Deutschmeister&quot;, which also had the rank of Prince of the Empire. A new Grand Magistery was established in Mergentheim in Württemberg, which was attacked during the German Peasants&#x27; War. The Order also helped Charles V against the Schmalkaldic League. After the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, membership in the Order was open to Protestants, although the majority of brothers remained Catholic. The Teutonic Knights became tri-denominational, with Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed bailiwicks.

The Grand Masters, often members of the great German families (and, after 1761, members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine), continued to preside over the Order&#x27;s considerable holdings in Germany. Teutonic Knights from Germany, Austria, and Bohemia were used as battlefield commanders leading mercenaries for the Habsburg monarchy during the Ottoman wars in Europe.

The military history of the Teutonic Knights was to end in 1805 by the Article XII of the Peace of Pressburg, which ordered the German territories of the Knights converted into a hereditary domain and gave the Austrian Emperor responsibility for placing a Habsburg prince on its throne. These terms had not been fulfilled by the time of the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809, and therefore Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the Knights&#x27; remaining territory to be disbursed to his German allies, which was completed in 1810.

== Medieval organization ==

=== Administrative structure about 1350 ===








=== Universal leadership ===

==== Generalkapitel ====
The &quot;Generalkapitel&quot; (general chapter) was the collection of all the priests, knights and half-brothers (German: &quot;Halbbrüder&quot;). Because of the logistical problems in assembling the members, who were spread over large distances, only deputations of the bailiwicks and commandries gathered to form the General chapter. The General chapter was designed to meet annually, but the conventions were usually limited to the election of a new Grandmaster. The decisions of the &quot;Generalkapitel&quot; had a binding effect on the &quot;Großgebietigers&quot; of the order.

==== Hochmeister ====

The &quot;Hochmeister&quot; (Grand Master) was the highest officer of the order. Until 1525, he was elected by the &quot;Generalkapitel&quot;. He had the rank of the ruler of an ecclesiastic imperial state and was sovereign prince of Prussia until 1466. Despite this high formal position, in practice, he was only a kind of first among equals.

==== Großgebietige ====
The &quot;Großgebietige&quot; were high officers with competence on the whole order, appointed by the &quot;Hochmeister&quot;. There were five offices.

* The &quot;Großkomtur&quot; (&quot;Magnus Commendator&quot;), the deputy of the Grandmaster
* The &quot;Treßler&quot;, the treasurer
* The &quot;Spitler&quot; (&quot;Summus Hospitalarius&quot;), responsible for all hospital affairs
* The &quot;Trapier&quot;, responsible for dressing and armament
* The &quot;Marschall&quot; (&quot;Summus Marescalcus&quot;), the chief of military affairs

=== National leadership ===

==== Landmeister ====
The order was divided into three national chapters, Prussia, Livland and the territory of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. The highest officer of each chapter was the &quot;Landmeister&quot; (country master). They were elected by the regional chapters. In the beginning, they were only substitutes of the Grandmaster but were able to create a power of their own so that, within their territory, the Grandmaster could not decide against their will. At the end of their rule over Prussia, the Grandmaster was only &quot;Landmeister&quot; of Prussia. There were three Landmeisters:
*The &quot;Landmeister in Livland&quot;, the successor of the &quot;Herrenmeister&quot; (lords master) of the former Livonian Brothers of the Sword.
*The &quot;Landmeister of Prussia&quot;, after 1309 united with the office of the Grandmaster, who was situated in Prussia from then.
*The &quot;Deutschmeister&quot;, the &quot;Landsmeister&quot; of the Holy Roman Empire. When Prussia and Livland were lost, the &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; also became Grandmaster.

==== Regional leadership ====
Because the properties of the order within the rule of the &quot;Deutschmeister&quot; did not form a contiguous territory, but were spread over the whole empire and parts of Europe, there was an additional regional structure, the bailiwick. &quot;Kammerballeien&quot; (&quot;Chamber Bailiwicks&quot;) were governed by the Grandmaster himself. Some of these bailiwicks had the rank of imperial states:
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Thuringia (Zwätzen)
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Hesse (Marburg)
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Saxonia (Elmsburg from 1221 until 1260 moved to Lucklum)
* Brandenburg
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Westphalia (Deutschordenskommende Mülheim)
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Franconia (Ellingen)
* &quot;Chamber Bailiwick&quot; of Koblenz
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Swabia-Alsace-Burgundy (Rouffach)
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick at the Etsch and in the Mountains (South Tyrol) (Bozen)
* Utrecht
* Lorraine (Trier)
* &quot;Chamber Bailiwick&quot; of Austria
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Alden Biesen
* Sicily
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Apulia (San Leonardo)
* Lombardy (also called Lamparten)
* &quot;Chamber Bailiwick&quot; of Bohemia
* Teutonic Order Bailiwick of Romania (Achaia, Greece)
* Armenia–Cyprus

=== Local leadership ===

==== Komtur ====
The smallest administrative unit of the order was the Kommende. It was ruled by a Komtur, who had all administrative rights and controlled the &quot;Vogteien&quot; (district of a reeve) and &quot;Zehnthöfe&quot; (tithe collectors) within his rule. In the commandry, all kinds of brothers lived together in a monastic way. Noblemen served as Knight-brothers or Priest-brothers. Other people could serve as Sariantbrothers, who were armed soldiers, and as Half-brothers, who were working in the economy and healthcare.

==== Special offices ====
* The &quot;Kanzler&quot; (chancellor) of the Grandmaster and the Deutschmeister. The chancellor took care of the keys and seals and was also the recording clerk of the chapter.
* The &quot;Münzmeister&quot; (master of the mint) of Thorn. In 1226, the order received the right to produce its own coins – the &quot;Moneta Dominorum Prussiae&quot; – Schillingen. Customary laws for coinage did not come about until the Kulm laws of 1233 were written. And the first coins were not minted until late 1234 or early 1235. 
* The &quot;Pfundmeister&quot; (customs master) of Danzig. The &quot;Pfund&quot; was a local customs duty.
* The &quot;Generalprokurator&quot; the representative of the order at the Holy See.
* The &quot;Großschäffer&quot;, a trading representative with special authority.

== Modern organization ==
=== Evolution and reconfiguration as a Catholic religious order ===
The Catholic order continued to exist in the various territories ruled by the Austrian Empire, out of Napoleon&#x27;s reach. From 1804 the Order was headed by members of the Habsburg dynasty.

The collapse of the Habsburg monarchy and the Empire it governed in Austria, the Italian Tyrol, Bohemia and the Balkans brought a shattering crisis to the Order. While in the new Austrian Republic, the Order seemed to have some hope of survival, in the other former parts of the Habsburg territories, the tendency was to regard the Order as an honorary chivalric Order of the House of Habsburg. The consequence of this risked being the confiscation of the Order&#x27;s property as belongings of the House of Habsburg. So as to make the distinction clearer, in 1923 the then High Master, Field Marshal Eugen of Austria-Teschen, Archduke of Austria, a member of the House of Habsburg and an active army commander before and during the First World War, had one of the Order&#x27;s priests, Norbert Klein, at the time Bishop of Brno (Brünn) elected his Coadjutor and then abdicated, leaving the Bishop as High Master of the Order.

As a result of this move, by 1928 the now-independent former Habsburg territories all recognized the Order as a Catholic religious order. The Order itself introduced a new Rule, approved by Pope Pius XI in 1929, according to which the government of the Order would in the future be in the hands of a priest of the Order, as would its constituent provinces, while the women religious of the Order would have women superiors. In 1936 the situation of the women religious was further clarified and the Congregation of the Sisters of the Order was given as their supreme moderator the High Master of the Order, the Sisters also having representation at the Order&#x27;s general chapter.

This completed the transformation of what remained in the Catholic Church of the Teutonic knights into a Catholic religious order now renamed simply the &quot;Deutscher Orden&quot; (&quot;German Order&quot;). However, further difficulties were in store.

The promising beginnings of this reorganization and spiritual transformation suffered a severe blow through the expansion of German might under the National Socialist regime. After Austria&#x27;s annexation by Germany in 1938, and similarly the Czech lands in 1939 the Teutonic Order was suppressed throughout the &quot;Großdeutsches Reich&quot; until Germany&#x27;s defeat. This did not prevent the National Socialists from using imagery of the medieval Teutonic knights for propagandistic purposes.

The Fascist rule in Italy, which since the end of the First World War had absorbed the Southern Tyrol, was not a propitious setting, but following the end of hostilities, a now democratic Italy provided normalized conditions, In 1947 Austria legally abolished the measures taken against the Order and restored confiscated property. Despite being hampered by the Communist regimes in Yugoslavia and in Czechoslovakia, the Order was now broadly in a position to take up activities in accordance with elements of its tradition, including care for the sick, for the elderly, for children, including work in education, in parishes and in its own internal houses of study. In 1957 a residence was established in Rome for the Order&#x27;s Procurator General to the Holy See, to serve also as a pilgrim hostel. Conditions in Czechoslovakia gradually improved and in the meanwhile, the forced exile of some members of the Order led to the Order&#x27;s re-establishing itself with some modest, but historically significant, foundations in Germany. The Sisters, in particular, gained several footholds, including specialist schools and care of the poor and in 1953 the former house of Augustinian Canons, St. Nikola, in Passau became the Sisters&#x27; Motherhouse. Although the reconstruction represented by the reformed Rule of 1929 had set aside categories such as the knights, over time the spontaneous involvement of laypeople in the Order&#x27;s apostolates has led to their revival in a modernized form, a development formalized by Pope Paul VI in 1965.

With the official title of &quot;Brethren of the German House of St Mary in Jerusalem&quot;, the Order today is unambiguously a Catholic religious order, though sui generis. Various features of its life and activities recall those of monastic and mendicant orders. At its core are priests who make a solemn religious profession, along with lay brothers who make a perpetual simple profession. Also part of the Order are the Sisters, with internal self-government within their own structures but with representation in the Order&#x27;s General Chapter. Their ultimate superior is the High Master of the Order. The approximately 100 Catholic priests and 200 nuns of the Order are divided into five provinces, namely, Austria, Southern Tyrol-Italy, Slovenia, Germany, Czech Republic and Slovakia. While the priests predominantly provide spiritual guidance, the nuns primarily care for the ill and the aged. Many of the priests care for German-speaking communities outside of Germany and Austria, especially in Italy and Slovenia; in this sense, the Teutonic Order has returned to its 12th-century roots: the spiritual and physical care of Germans in foreign lands.

There is an Institute of &quot;Familiares&quot;, most of whom are laypeople, and who are attached by spiritual bonds to the Order but do not take vows. The &quot;Familiares&quot; are grouped especially into the bailiwicks of Germany, Austria, Southern Tyrol, Ad Tiberim (Rome), and the bailiwick of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as also in the independent commandry of Alden Biesen in Belgium, though others are dispersed throughout the world. Overall, there are in recent years some 700.

By the end of the 20th century, then, this religious Order had developed into a charitable organization and established numerous clinics, as well as sponsoring excavation and tourism projects in Israel. In 2000, the German chapter of the Teutonic Order declared bankruptcy, and its upper management was dismissed; an investigation by a special committee of the Bavarian parliament in 2002 and 2003 to determine the cause was inconclusive.

The current Abbot General of the Order, who also holds the title of High Master, is Father Frank Bayard. The current seat of the High Master is the &quot;Church of the German Order&quot; (&quot;Deutschordenskirche&quot;) in Vienna. Near the St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral (&quot;Stephansdom&quot;) in the Austrian capital is the Treasury of the Teutonic Order, which is open to the public, and the Order&#x27;s central archive. Since 1996, there has also been a museum dedicated to the Teutonic Knights at their former castle in Bad Mergentheim in Germany, which was the seat of the High Master from 1525 to 1809.

==== Honorary Knights ====
Honorary Knights of the Teutonic Order have included:
* Konrad Adenauer
* Leutgard
* Udo Arnold
* Franz Josef II
* Rudolf Graber
* Otto von Habsburg
* Karl Habsburg-Lothringen
* Joachim Meisner
* Eduard Gaston Pöttickh von Pettenegg
* Eduard Schick
* Christoph Schönborn
* Carl Herzog von Württemberg

=== Protestant Bailiwick of Utrecht ===
A portion of the Order retains more of the character of the knights during the height of its power and prestige. Der &quot;Balije van Utrecht&quot; (&quot;Bailiwick of Utrecht&quot;) of the &quot;Ridderlijke Duitsche Orde&quot; (&quot;Chivalric German [i.e., &#x27;Teutonic&#x27;] Order&quot;) became Protestant at the Reformation, and it remained an aristocratic society. The relationship of the Bailiwick of Utrecht to the Catholic &quot;Deutscher Orden&quot; resembles that of the Protestant Bailiwick of Brandenburg to the Catholic Order of Malta: each is an authentic part of its original order, though differing from and smaller than the Catholic branch.

== Insignia ==
The Knights wore white surcoats with a black cross, granted by Innocent III in 1205. A cross pattée was sometimes used. The coat of arms representing the grandmaster (&quot;Hochmeisterwappen&quot;) is shown with a golden cross fleury or cross potent superimposed on the black cross, with the imperial eagle as a central inescutcheon. The golden cross fleury overlaid on the black cross became widely used in the 15th century. A legendary account attributes its introduction to Louis IX of France, who is said to have granted the master of the order this cross as a variation of the Jerusalem cross, with the fleur-de-lis symbol attached to each arm, in 1250. While this legendary account cannot be traced back further than the early modern period (Christoph Hartknoch, 1684), there is some evidence that the design does indeed date to the mid 13th century.

The black cross pattée was later used for military decoration and insignia by the Kingdom of Prussia and Germany as the Iron Cross.

The motto of the Order is &quot;Helfen, Wehren, Heilen&quot; (&quot;to help, to defend, to heal&quot;).

== Influence on German and Polish nationalism and Soviet patriotism ==
The German historian Heinrich von Treitschke used imagery of the Teutonic Knights, a Germanic myth, to promote pro-German and anti-Polish rhetoric. Many middle-class German nationalists adopted this imagery and its symbols. During the Weimar Republic, associations and organisations of this nature contributed to laying the groundwork for the formation of Nazi Germany. 

An organization predating the Nazi Party itself, as well as Nazi-supported preceding and Nazi preceding and during World War II propaganda made use of the Teutonic Knights&#x27; imagery, with the common goal of instilling the importance of for the future of Germany and the German people. According to medieval historian Erik Christiansen, &quot;Himmler&#x27;s plan to mould the SS as a reincarnation of [The Teutonic Order] proved [...] the irresistible strength of bad history.&quot; Though gradually taking hold ever since with one of Prince Adalbert of Prussia&#x27;s 1849 proposals, after a lull during the Weimar Republic, whereupon it reverted to a simple tricolor overlayed with an Iron Cross, (though itself also derivative,) a version of Germany&#x27;s Reichskriegsflagge (war ensign) emerged with a more closely resembling The State of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s cross&#x27;s original shape with a circle-overlaid balkenkreuz. Hitler based his German Order on the Teutonic Order, while especially the Hochmeister&#x27;s ceremonial regalia, also the Marian Cross of the Teutonic Order, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and of the cross of the Knight of Justice of the Order of St. John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).

After Hitler approved the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (GPO), Germanization campaigns were extolled as the modern adaptation of what it portrayed as &quot;civilizing missions&quot; of the Teutonic Order.
Yet, despite these references to the Teutonic Order&#x27;s history in Nazi propaganda, the Order itself was abolished in 1938 and its members were persecuted by the German authorities. This occurred mostly due to Hitler&#x27;s and Himmler&#x27;s belief that, throughout history, Catholic military-religious orders had been tools of the Holy See and as such constituted a threat to the Nazi regime.

The converse was true for Polish nationalism, for example &quot;The Knights of the Cross&quot; by Henryk Sienkiewicz, which used the Teutonic Knights as symbolic shorthand for Germans in general, conflating the two into an easily recognisable image of the hostile. After the Battle of Grunwald, the Teutonic Order was portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler&#x27;s armies.

In the Soviet Union, the image of Alexander Nevsky became a national symbol of the struggle against German occupation during World War II, and many Soviet historians portrayed him as a Russian bastion against both German and papal aggression. The government sought historical continuity by referring to the Soviet struggle as the Great Patriotic War. The Order of Alexander Nevsky was re-established in 1942 by the Soviet government during the war, which would be awarded to servicemen in the Soviet army. The 1938 film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; by Sergei Eisenstein, which depicts the Battle on the Ice, was re-released in 1941 following the German invasion. Joseph Stalin used the film to mobilize feelings of Russian patriotism.

<text>&quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; is a video game franchise created by video game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and mainly developed and published by Nintendo. The universe of the &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series consists of various lands, the most predominant being The franchise is set within a fantasy world reminiscent of medieval Europe which consists of several recurring locations, races and creatures. The most prominent race in the series are the Hylians, a humanoid race with elfin features identifiable by their long, pointed ears. The series&#x27; lore contains a creation myth, several fictional alphabets, the most prominent being Hylian, and a fictional universal currency, the rupee. Most games in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series follow a similar storyline, which involves the protagonist Link battling monsters to save Princess Zelda and defeat a villain, which is often the series&#x27; main antagonist, Ganon. Nintendo developed the series&#x27; lore into a timeline that spans thousands of years across its history.

Hyrule was created as the original setting for &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and has remained the main environment for successive games in the series. Inspired by dungeon crawlers, Miyamoto and Tezuka developed a high fantasy world in the form of a 2D map filled with monsters, puzzles and dungeons. Hyrule transitioned to a 3D environment with the development of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. For &quot;Breath of the Wild,&quot; released in 2017, Nintendo developed Hyrule into a seamless open world. Since the launch of the original game, the series has been a commercial and critical success and introduced landmark innovations in world design that have influenced numerous developers in the video game industry.
== Overview ==

The &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; series is set in a fantasy world that first appeared in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, which was developed and published by Nintendo. The game introduced Hyrule as the series&#x27; primary setting and series protagonist Link, a Hylian boy or young man who is the player character. The storyline of each game varies, but follows a common overarching plot that involves Link travelling through Hyrule to rescue Princess Zelda and save the world from evil, which is typically the series&#x27; main villain, Ganon. A recurring plot element in the games is Ganon&#x27;s attempts to obtain the Triforce, a mystical artifact that will enable him to possess ultimate power. Although Link and Zelda have similar appearances in each game, they are different characters who reappear whenever evil threatens the world. &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; was established as the beginning of the series&#x27; history and involves the antagonist Demise cursing the first incarnations of Link and Zelda so their descendants appear in an endless cycle to protect Hyrule from evil.

==Hyrule==

=== Concept and design ===

Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto conceived the land of Hyrule as the setting for the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda,&quot; describing it as &quot;a miniature garden that you can put into a drawer and revisit anytime you like&quot;. He drew his inspiration from the Kyoto countryside that he had explored in his childhood and wanted to recreate the experience of adventure and discovery. Alongside writer Takashi Tezuka, Miyamoto created a fantasy world in the style of fantasy authors like Tolkien, which was viewed from a top-down perspective. It was populated with colourful characters, monsters and dungeons for the player to explore.

==== 2D world design ====
Miyamoto and Tezuka started working on &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; during the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;. Initially, the game did not feature an overworld. In &quot;Hyrule Historia&quot;, Miyamoto said that Nintendo aimed to develop a launch title for the Famicom Disk System. An early game was initially designed to make use of the Disk System&#x27;s ability to rewrite data, allowing players to create dungeons and explore other players&#x27; creations. He explained: &quot;We made a one-player game with dungeons under mountains that surrounded Death Mountain, but we couldn&#x27;t shake that &quot;I want to play above ground, too!&quot; feeling, so we added forests and lakes, and eventually Hyrule Field&quot;.

The first specifications were drawn up on a whiteboard by Miyamoto and then copied onto a document on 1 February 1985. The document detailed early concepts for items and enemies that would later feature in the game, such as a compass, bows and arrows and a boomerang, and &quot;Hakkai&quot;, an early name given to Ganon. This was developed into rough sketches for various items and enemies within the following two weeks. The name for the game had not yet been decided, so the title was simply labelled &quot;Adventure&quot;. Long paper was used to create the first land map of Hyrule, which was developed by Tezuka and Miyamoto sitting side by side and drawing together. Miyamoto said that the name &quot;Hyrule&quot; seemed like the perfect choice during a discussion to find a name for a high-fantasy region. In Japan, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game was released as &quot;The Hyrule Fantasy&quot;, which was almost chosen as the name for the entire franchise, but was dropped after the first game. Miyamoto said this could have been due to the name being too similar to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, which was released soon afterwards. 

The original Hyrule map was designed to encourage exploration and discovery, requiring up to several hours to navigate. The map is nonlinear, so players are free to choose from several unmarked paths, with just a few areas being inaccessible at the start. Miyamoto was influenced by &quot;The Black Onyx&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot;, two games that centre around fantasy dungeon crawling. The &quot;Zelda&quot; world was defined by its mazes, hidden rooms and treasures. The game&#x27;s nine dungeons were designed to be difficult to locate, forcing players to uncover the secrets of the map with little help. In addition to its underworld, the Hyrule map consists of a large overworld created out of a grid structure that is much larger than can be displayed on a single screen. It is 16 blocks wide and eight blocks high and comprises 128 areas. Miyamoto said that maps for the game were included in North America: &quot;The maps included various hints, but to be honest, I thought it would be more enjoyable to play the game without any help. So we sealed the map, with a message reading &#x27;You should only use the map and strategic tips as a last resort&#x27;&quot;. Players were required to begin their adventure in the centre of Hyrule and use instinct alone to find an old man inside a cave who gives Link a sword and declares, &quot;It&#x27;s dangerous to go alone!&quot;. While navigating Hyrule&#x27;s overworld and its many dangerous enemies, players must eventually find the dungeons, which each feature various enemies, items and a boss.

The concept of a role-playing game was a new experience for players in the 1980s. The gameplay diverged from the fast-paced games typically found in arcades like &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot;, by offering players an open world to explore, puzzles to solve and a fantasy story that centres on a protagonist embarking on an adventure to save a princess from an evil villain and bring peace to Hyrule. The new game concept caused concern with Nintendo&#x27;s management. In 2003, Miyamoto stated in an interview for Superplay magazine: &quot;I remember that we were very nervous, because &quot;The Legend Of Zelda&quot; was our first game that forced the players to think about what they should do next. We were afraid that gamers would become bored and stressed by the new concept&quot;. During the testing phase, players complained about getting lost inside the game&#x27;s dungeons, but rather than making the game more simplistic, Miyamoto decided to make it more challenging by removing Link&#x27;s sword at the beginning of the game and forcing players to locate it. He wanted to encourage players to communicate with each other while solving the game&#x27;s puzzles.

==== Transition to 3D ====
Hyrule continued to evolve over the course of successive games. The transition from a 2D to 3D world occurred with the release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, due to the capabilities of the Nintendo 64, which gave players the opportunity to experience a more realistic game environment. The 3D world was also accompanied by an expanding fictional lore that laid the foundation for other games in the series within an official fictional timeline. The game&#x27;s dungeons were each unique and connected to a specific area of Hyrule and its inhabitants. Several recurring races, such as the Gorons, Zora and Gerudo were introduced and given a distinct history and culture. Hyrule Field, an expansive open grassy area, was positioned at the centre of Hyrule, acting as a hub that connects other areas to create the illusion of a vast world. The game&#x27;s time travel mechanic also introduced a dark version of Hyrule Kingdom, a land corrupted by Ganondorf&#x27;s influence, with Hyrule Castle Town in ruins and Redead zombies as its inhabitants. 

Due to concerns about the limitations of the Nintendo 64, Miyamoto initially conceived the game taking place within a central hub in the confines of Ganon&#x27;s Castle, similar to Peach&#x27;s Castle in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. He described &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; as a &quot;huge project&quot; due to the fact that it involved making the game environment from 3D polygons and was larger in scale than anything that he had previously worked on. He said that he had approached the game by first focusing on what types of characters he wanted to include, rather than on the story or the game functions. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was designed with several innovations to help the player navigate the expansive 3D world and interact with the environment. The camera system was designed to integrate with the 3D world of Hyrule, giving the player a sense of perspective and tracking the movements of Link. The game&#x27;s Z-targeting system was created to provide the player with a simple way to lock on and interact with objects, characters and enemies in the game world. The game also made use of context sensitive controls by using the A button for a range of interactions, such as mounting a horse or opening a treasure chest. These features were landmarks for Nintendo and influenced 3D world development within the games industry.

During development, the staff spent less time on developing the dungeons. According to Miyamoto: &quot;Instead of mapping your way through a maze, I think what&#x27;s more important is a sense of dread, a sense of pressure, and of course an opportunity for finding secrets and solving puzzles—we should be pursuing an emotional immediacy, the sense that you are really there&quot;. Hyrule and its characters in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; were depicted in an art style that drifted towards Western fantasy, although Miyamoto said there was no intentional replication of cultural elements from one specific country. Hyrule&#x27;s fantasy characters were partially inspired by the American television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. In an interview, Takashi Tezuka said he had used the series as inspiration when creating &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;: &quot;After that, in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, all kinds of suspicious characters appeared&quot;. Many assets and character models in the game were later reused for &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, both for stylistic purposes and to save development time.

==== Open air concept ====
Producer Eiji Aonuma approached &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; by breaking the conventions of previous games. He explained that in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, the game world featured &quot;routes&quot; to help players navigate the 3D environment without getting lost, but that certain handholding and blockages had caused players to feel frustrated. By contrast, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;&#x27;s Hyrule was designed to allow the player to explore a vast world in any way they liked. Nintendo&#x27;s senior product marketing manager Bill Trinen described the game as &quot;open air&quot;: &quot;I look at this game and I see a world that is fully integrated into the exploration and the adventure. It&#x27;s not just a world that you&#x27;re passing through. It&#x27;s sort of a world that you&#x27;re a part of&quot;. The game world benefited from advancements in Nintendo hardware. Earlier games had been restricted by the available technology, creating the need to separate Hyrule into individual connecting areas, but the game world could now be experienced as a seamless environment. The concept of an &quot;open air&quot; environment began during work on &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. Aonuma said that he wanted to remove the small connecting areas of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and replace them with open expanses, but the world ended up feeling smaller than he intended. 
&quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;&#x27;s open world was inspired by other video games. The game&#x27;s director Hidemaro Fujibayashi named &quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Terraria&quot; as his inspirations for &quot;the sense of adventure, exploration and how it inspired curiosity&quot;. Aonuma also mentioned several other games that he had played, including &quot;The Witcher&quot;, &quot;Far Cry&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;. He also cited &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; as the basis for many of the world&#x27;s mechanics, such as the ability to climb and explore between areas. The development team began &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; by working on a 2D prototype of Hyrule to test interactions between objects. This was developed into a complex physics and chemistry engine that would present a higher level of realism. The chemistry engine allowed for elements, such as fire, water and electricity to interact with each other and objects in the game world. This was designed to provide the player with a more interactive gameplay that was coined &quot;chemical reaction play&quot;. Hyrule in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; was depicted using an art style that was based on the stylised visuals of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; but developed into a more realistic, detailed style. The civilization of the Hylians was developed with a focus on their castle in the style of medieval Europe to return to the roots of the series, while the ancient technological features of the Sheikah were inspired by the Jōmon period of Japanese history.

Fujibayashi stated that the layout of Hyrule in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; was inspired in part by his hometown of Kyoto: &quot;I took a map of Kyoto and overlaid it on the game world, and I tried to imagine going to places that I know in Kyoto. I&#x27;d think &#x27;It takes this much time to get from point A to point B, so how does that translate to the game?&#x27; And that&#x27;s how we started mapping out the world in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;&quot;. The development team used landmarks in Kyoto as a way of comparing the distance between landmarks in the game world, which helped staff during the development of the game. This measurement of distance allowed Hyrule to be scaled up to an enormous world that appears twelve times the size of its predecessor in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. 

For &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, Aonuma used the same map of Hyrule as the one players experienced in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; to create a continuation of the same world. Hyrule was extensively expanded, by introducing Sky Islands to the map to place emphasis on vertical gameplay. In addition to its sky expansion, the game introduced the Depths, a vast pitch-black area beneath the surface of Hyrule. Aonuma said the development team had learned lessons from &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, where Link was restricted by the hardware to descend from particular points. He explained that the team had wanted to create the ability to &quot;traverse a world that&#x27;s not only horizontally connected in a single world, but vertically connected as well&quot;, noting the sense of freedom the player experiences by diving into that.

=== Depiction ===

The a medieval-based fantasy land, is the main setting of the series, which first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Many of its areas have appeared throughout the series, such as Hyrule Castle, the Lost Woods, Kakariko Village, Death Mountain and Lake Hylia.

Hyrule was formed by three goddesses: and It is established in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; that Din created the physical geography of the realm, Nayru created the physical laws to govern it, and Farore created the races to uphold the law and the flora and fauna that inhabit the world. After the goddesses completed their tasks, they departed for the heavens, leaving behind three golden triangles containing their power to govern all things; this relic became known as the Triforce. The creation myth was elaborated upon in &quot;Echoes of Wisdom&quot;, with the goddesses creating the world to be a prison for a primordial chaos entity named Null that had previously consumed anything that tried to form within the void. &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; expanded on this history by detailing the rise of Demon King Demise and his dark forces, who attempt to take the Triforce and destroy the world. The goddess Hylia stays to protect the Triforce and leads an army of free people into battle to weaken Demise and seal him away from the world. The realm was eventually named Hyrule after its dominant race, the Hylians, who established a kingdom across the land. The kingdom is ruled by the Royal Family of Hyrule, into which the various incarnations of Princess Zelda are often born.
The Hylian alphabet is a cipher of either English or Japanese that first appears in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, where it is identified as &quot;the ancient language of the Hylians&quot; and is composed of symbols that Link must translate to progress. In Japan, an explanation of the Hylian alphabet was written on the back of the instruction manual for &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; with a phonographic writing system, or syllabary, like the Japanese language. Since its first appearance, five more Hylian scripts have been developed and deciphered: the Old Hylian Syllabary used in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, the Modern Hylian Syllabary used in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, the Hylian Alphabet used in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, the Hylian Alphabet used in &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, and the Hylian Alphabet used in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. The first three are used for transcribing Japanese, while the latter three are used to transcribe English, totaling six variations of written Hylian. Additional languages have subsequently appeared in the series. The language of the Gerudo was introduced in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, a written and spoken language that is similar to Hylian and is written in elongated, wispy letters. The Sheikah language was introduced in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and consists of a complete alphabet of square-shaped symbols. Players have deciphered these languages to translate numerous signs and inscriptions commonly found around Hyrule.
The universal currency of Hyrule is the rupee. Although it shares its name with the real-world currency, Miyamoto said in an interview that this was not intentional and that he chose the word because it seemed cute and sounded like &quot;rubies&quot;. Rupees resemble hexagonal crystals or gems and come in various colors that determine their value. In the manual for the original game, the currency was called rubies, but this was changed to rupees in later games. Subsequent games introduced more colors and sizes for rupees, each denoting a specific value. Generally, green rupees have the least value, while gold and silver rupees have the most.

===Hyrulean geography===

Although the geography of Hyrule varies from game to game, it typically features several recurring geographical landmarks, which appear in different locations relative to each other depending on the game.
* is a large volcanic mountain located in northern Hyrule. It first appeared in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and has appeared through the series up to &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; reveals it is part of the Eldin Mountains, a mountain range in the Eldin Province. The main inhabitants of Death Mountain are the Gorons, a race of rock-eating golems that mine the mountains in search of food; the mountains are littered with caves as a result of their mining activities.
* is Ganon&#x27;s fortress, which has acted as the battleground between him and Link in several games. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, when Link travels to the future, it has been built in place of Hyrule Castle.
* is the home of Hyrule&#x27;s royal family, which first appeared in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. It is a symbol of the power of the Hyrulean monarchy and is frequently the main target of Hyrule&#x27;s enemies, particularly Ganon. It is often a central area that Link visits during his quest.
* is a village that first appears in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and has since reappeared in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. Kakariko Village is often portrayed as a small, prosperous town that was originally founded by the Sheikah. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, Shadow Beasts have kidnapped most of the villagers, making the town resemble a ghost town. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, the village has survived the Great Calamity and is inhabited by the Sheikah.
* is the largest freshwater lake in Hyrule. It commonly features collectible items and dungeons, and is often where Link encounters members of the Zora race.
* The is a large enchanted forest that appears in various games, starting with &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. It is home to the Kokiri, Koroks and Fairies, and its maze-like structure leads travelers in circles unless they take the correct path through the forest. Rumors state that those who become lost are turned into Stalfos. In several games, the Great Deku Tree and/or the Master Sword can be found in a shrine there.
* is a location consisting of two large rock formations next to each other that resemble a pair of eyeglasses. It housed the final dungeon in the original game. It is usually associated with Death Mountain, but is located in the Gerudo Highlands in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;. Spectacle Rock also appears in &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, and &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;.
* is the temple that houses the Master Sword in several games. It is also used to traverse time, most notably in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, where it allows the player to travel between the past and future. In some games, it serves as a dungeon.

== Objects ==
=== Triforce ===
The also called the &quot;Power of the Gods&quot; and the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;, is a triangular sacred relic left behind by the three Golden Goddesses after they created Hyrule. It is made up of three smaller triangles known as the Triforce of Power, the Triforce of Wisdom, and the Triforce of Courage. These embody the essences of their respective goddesses, and present a power struggle and balance of morality between the central characters, Ganon, Zelda and Link. The Triforce first appeared in the original game as a focal point of the plot, which involves Ganon stealing the Triforce of Power and Link searching for the scattered pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom to stop him and protect Hyrule from evil. The Triforce of Courage was introduced in &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot; as the third piece. When united, the Triforce allows the person who touches it to make a wish that usually lasts until they die or the wish is granted. If the person who finds it does not possess a balance of the three virtues it represents, the pieces will split into its three components, leaving the finder with the one that represents the characteristic they value most.

=== Master Sword ===

The also known as &quot;The Blade of Evil&#x27;s Bane&quot;, the &quot;Sword of Resurrection&quot;, or the &quot;sword that seals the darkness&quot; is a divine, magic sword and Link&#x27;s signature weapon. It is one of the few weapons capable of harming Ganon and acts as a key to the Sacred Realm. It was first introduced in &quot;A Link To The Past&quot;, it has the power to &quot;repel evil&quot;, which enables it to overcome powerful dark magic and slay evil and demonic beings that cannot be harmed by conventional weaponry. &quot;Skyward Sword&quot; reveals that it was originally known as the Goddess Sword, which is inhabited by a sentient female spirit named Fi. Near the end of the game, the Goddess Sword transforms into the Master Sword after being infused with the Three Sacred Flames, with Fi&#x27;s spirit form ceasing to be after the Master Sword absorbs Demise&#x27;s remains. The sword traditionally rests in a stone pedestal hidden in locations indigenous to Hyrule, such as the Temple of Time or the Lost Woods. Like the Sword in the Stone, the Master Sword can only be removed by someone who is worthy of wielding it.

==Other lands and worlds==
Hyrule is the main recurring setting of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, but several games are set outside Hyrule in other lands, realms and parallel worlds. The geographical relationship between Hyrule and these other worlds is not clearly defined.

* The is a parallel world to Hyrule that appears in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;. It is a darker version of Hyrule, which is referred to as the Light World.
* The is the setting of &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, formed after a deluge flooded Hyrule. Only a few mountaintops are still visible above the water, which form the islands and archipelagos of the Great Sea. Due to the relatively small size of these islands, the large expanses of ocean between each island require the player to use charts to navigate between them.
* is a land that Link travels to in &quot;Oracle of Seasons&quot;, where Din finds him and is subsequently captured by the General of Darkness, Onox, causing the four seasons in Holodrum to fall into chaos. Holodrum is protected by a huge tree called a Maku Tree. Link eventually dispels the darkness using a Huge Maku Seed.
* is a kingdom that is the main setting of &quot;Tri Force Heroes.&quot; It is ruled by Princess Styla, who has been cursed to wear a drab jumpsuit.
* is the setting of &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, which Link washes ashore on after a storm and which has a giant egg atop its highest peak. To escape the island, Link must awaken the Wind Fish, which he later discovers will cause the island to disappear, as it exists in its dreams. He ultimately achieves this goal, but the island ceases to exist.
* is a land that appears in &quot;Oracle of Ages&quot;. In a similar storyline to that of Holodrum, the land of Labrynna is thrown into chaos after Nayru is possessed by the sorceress Veran, causing the flow of time to be disrupted.
* is a parallel world to Hyrule that appears in &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;. It is similar to Hyrule in geography and is ruled by Princess Zelda&#x27;s Lorulean counterpart, Princess Hilda. Like Hyrule, Lorule originally had its own Triforce, which was the source of various conflicts. However, the Royal Family of Lorule decided to destroy the Triforce in an attempt to put an end to conflict, only to bring calamity to their world as a result.
* is a kingdom founded by Link and Tetra following the events of &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot; which appears in &quot;Spirit Tracks&quot;. New Hyrule is home to the titular Spirit Tracks, magical train tracks created by the Spirits of Good, the guardian deities of the country. The Tracks connect the four sections of the continent and allow for travel by train between them.
* is a collection of large floating islands in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, which were created when the Goddess Hylia used the last of her power to raise what was left of the surviving Hylians along with a plot of land that was still free during the Great War with Demise. Below the clouds lies &quot;the Surface&quot;.
* is a parallel world to Hyrule that serves as the main setting of &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;. Link enters it through a portal deep within the Lost Woods. The land and its citizens are very similar to that of Hyrule. Termina is split into four distinct regions, guarded by four giant deities: the swampy Woodfall, home of the Deku Scrubs, to the south; the icy Snowhead Mountains of the Gorons to the north; Great Bay, home of the Zora to the west; and the undead wastelands of Ikana Canyon to the east. Its capital, Clock Town, lies in the center.
* The is a parallel world to Hyrule that appears in &quot;Twilight Princess,&quot; which is inhabited by the Twili. Its ruler Midna was overthrown by antagonist Zant, who seeks to gain power over the Twilight Realm and transforms the Twili into Shadow Beasts. Link and Midna work together to cleanse the twilight from Hyrule and defeat Zant.
* The World of the Ocean King is the setting of &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, which takes place after the events of &quot;The Wind Waker.&quot; Its world is similar to the Great Sea, with several islands located on the ocean.
* The Depths is the underworld of &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, which is scattered with ruins and mirrors the surface of Hyrule. It is connected to the surface by the chasms across Hyrule and receives very little light, being pitch-black until Link activates the Lightroots located across it.
* The Still World is another world that appears in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&quot;, which is connected to Hyrule through rifts that each lead to a different section of it. People, objects, and terrain transported there are frozen in time.

==Characters==

Despite most games in the series nominally taking place centuries apart, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; often features many recurring characters. The silent protagonist Link and the princess Zelda are reincarnated in most &quot;Zelda&quot; games, while the antagonistic force Ganon, the final boss of most &quot;Zelda&quot; games, born from the primordial evil &quot;Demise&quot;, repeatedly returns in a new form as well. Other figures who reappear across the series include Zelda&#x27;s caretaker Impa and the fairy-obsessed man Tingle. In many &quot;Zelda&quot; games, Link obtains a horse named Epona.

Link is frequently accompanied by a companion in &quot;Zelda&quot; games, starting with Navi in &quot;The Ocarina of Time&quot;. Characters like Navi, Midna, and Fi serve a tutorial function in their respective games and comment on events as they transpire in the story. The supporting cast of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, featuring characters such as Mipha, Prince Sidon, and Urbosa, has proven to be popular among fans of the series.

==Races==
Since the release of the original game, the series has featured several races. Alongside the Hylian race, which established the land of Hyrule, there are various other prominent races, such as the Gorons, Gerudo, Rito and Zora.

* Ancient Robots are a prehistoric mechanical race that appear in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, who Link encounters in the Lanayru Desert. They were created by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru, but their land eventually became a barren desert and they rusted away. However, they can be revived using a Timeshift Stone to change the present to the past. Although the designers expressed concern about including advanced technology in &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, they decided that they did not look out of place with a &quot;softer&quot; design resembling the Dogū, which was more befitting of fantasy.
* Dragons are a recurring race that usually appear as benevolent guardians or powerful enemies. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, Link must slay Volvagia, a dragon boss in the Fire Temple. In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, the Sky Spirit Valoo acts as the godlike dragon and the patron deity of the Rito tribe. When Link arrives on Dragon Roost Island, he defeats the boss Gohma by damaging Valoo&#x27;s tail. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, Link encounters the dragon Argorok, who is the boss of the City in the Sky. In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, Link is aided by the three dragons Faron, Eldin and Lanayru, which guard the three regions of the Surface. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, the three dragons and can be found in several locations around Hyrule. &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; features a fourth dragon, the , which is later revealed to be Zelda transformed after undergoing the process of draconification to restore the shattered Master Sword through sacred power.
* Fairies are magical creatures that appear as small, winged humanoids often obscured by light. They tend to be shy and can be found hiding in many places throughout Hyrule, mainly at fairy fountains or fairy springs. In most games in the series, fairies will heal Link if he manages to catch one; he can also put them in empty bottles to have them heal him later. If Link dies while he has a bottled fairy in his possession, the fairy will automatically resurrect him. Great fairies are powerful, high ranking fairies that use their magic to enchant Link&#x27;s items into more powerful versions. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, the Kokiri form a symbiotic relationship with their guardian fairies, who act as companions and mentors. One of these is Navi, who serves as Link&#x27;s sidekick and helps him learn about the world outside Kokiri Forest.

* The are a race of human warrior-thieves indigenous to the Gerudo Desert, which bears their name. Their physical traits include scarlet hair, aquiline noses, gold or green eyes, round or pointed ears, and bronzed skin. Like the Amazons, the race consists entirely of women, apart from a single Gerudo male who is born every century and is lawfully crowned king of the tribe, and worshipped like a God king. When there is no male present to be king, leadership is instead entrusted to female chiefs. Ganondorf, the main antagonist of the series, is king of the Gerudo. The Gerudo appear as pirates in &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, where they live in the ocean at Great Bay. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, they are traders and merchants. As men are not permitted in Gerudo Town, Link must crossdress as a female to enter.

* The are a race of mountain-dwelling rock people who first appeared in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. They have the ability to roll along the ground and have a round rock-like physical appearance. Goron culture revolves around brotherhood and strength, usually referring to each other and those they deem strong as &quot;Brother&quot; or &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Gorons show high regard for individuals who display great strength and bravery and enjoy matching their strength with others in competition such as sumo wrestling and racing. They live in tribes headed by a patriarch, such as in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. They mainly inhabit mountainous areas, such as Death Mountain, and are resistant to intense heat and lava. They also consume rocks and minerals, which they mine from the earth.
* are an elf-like race of humans that predominantly make up the population of Hyrule, most prominently Link and Zelda, in which they established an organized civilization resembling that of medieval Europe. They were created as the first race of Hyrule by the goddess Hylia, born with magic-infused blood said to be a gift from the goddesses that grants them psychic powers and magical skill. Their long pointed ears are said to allow them to hear messages sent by the gods. In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, Hylians live on the floating island of Skyloft and are accompanied by bird-like creatures called Loftwings. Hylians are a fairly diverse species, having variations in skin, hair and eye colour. Due to repeated attacks from enemies, such as Ganon, large Hylian armies exist to protect Hyrule.

* The are a pixie-like race who inhabit the Kokiri Forest, who branched off from the Hylians due to wanting to live a more natural life as Hyrule continued to industrialize. They are guarded by the Great Deku Tree, whose power causes them to not age once they grow up into kids, and who considers them to be his children. They are cautious and secretive, believing that they will die if they leave the forest. Each one receives a small fairy who serves as their lifelong friend, guardian, and teacher. Link was raised as a Kokiri in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, but was not born to them, as his Hylian mother entrusted him to the Great Deku Tree when he was an infant.
* The are plant-like beings that first appeared in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and are said to have been transformed from the Kokiri following the Great Flood. They are small creatures with wood-like bodies and masks made from leaves, with their light weight allowing them to travel by using sprouts as propellers. They leave their home, the &quot;Forest Haven&quot;, to plant seeds from the Great Deku Tree all over the world, and return once a year to hold a ceremony and obtain more seeds. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Koroks can be found all over Hyrule and their seeds can be traded with Hestu, a large Korok, to upgrade weapon inventory slots. Koroks are difficult to find despite being numerous and are best protected in Korok Forest, a hidden location in the Lost Woods.
* The are a race of birds with long necks and human-like faces that appear in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. They live in the an airborne city that is the seventh dungeon in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and which Link reaches by launching himself out of an enormous cannon&quot;.&quot; A female Oocca, can warp the player back to the entrance of the game&#x27;s dungeons, and her son, warps the player to Ooccoo&#x27;s location. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, they are mentioned to be closer to the gods than the Hylians. Some in Hyrule theorize that the Oocca actually evolved into the Hylians, or that they created Hylians and a city in the sky for them to live in. Ooccoo has also appeared in other Nintendo games, such as &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Hyrule Warriors&quot;.
* Minish, referred to in their native language as are small humanoid sprites no bigger than a human thumb that live in secret, who first appear in &quot;The Minish Cap&quot;. They are only visible to children and tend to live in forests, but also appear inside of buildings and holes in and around various spots of Hyrule. There are three variations of the Minish, which are distinguished by their attire: Forest Minish, Town Minish and Mountain Minish. Most Minish are helpful and like to hide valuable objects for others to find, although one Picori, became evil after becoming obsessed with human nature.
* The are a race of raptor-like humanoids first introduced in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; who evolved from the Zora. In &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;, they live on Dragon Roost Island, an island on the Great Sea, and have a tribal elder and elaborately dressed guards. They are initially flightless, as they are born without wings; throughout a young Rito&#x27;s childhood, they are called a Fledgling. After a child reaches a certain age, they must visit their guardian, the Sky Spirit, Valoo, in a coming-of-age ceremony to receive one of his scales, which enables them to grow wings. Most Rito can fly for great distances and hover in place, but some struggle to fly for long periods of time. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, the Rito reside in the Hebra region in northwest Hyrule and tolerate cold climates. These Rito feature a much more prominent avian design that includes wings and are able to fly using updrafts. Prominent Rito characters include Revali, the Rito Champion, and Kass, a wandering minstrel who displays the Rito&#x27;s appreciation of music through song.
* The are ancient and mysterious ninja-like warriors commonly distinguished by their red eyes and white hair, whose most prominent recurring representative is Zelda&#x27;s nursemaid and bodyguard Impa. They have a divinely ordained role to protect the royal family of Hyrule. Despite their physical resemblance to Hylians, they are a different race with great technological prowess, as seen in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; with the Guardians, Shrines, and Towers, as well as the Sheikah Slate. They are physically stronger than other races and are among the most potent magic wielders in Hyrule. Their symbol, the Eye of the Sheikah, which is a single eye with three triangles above and a teardrop beneath, is commonly seen in the series, even in games where the Sheikah are not present. 
* are a race that inhabit the Twilight Realm and appear in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. They come from a group referred to as the Interlopers, who used extraordinary magic to dominate a war between Hylians for the Triforce and the Sacred Realm. After witnessing this, the Golden Goddesses ordered the Light Spirits to seal their magic in the Fused Shadow; the Interlopers were then banished to the Twilight Realm, a dark mirror world of Hyrule, where they adapted and evolved into the Twili. The most prominent members of their race are , the titular Twilight Princess, and who overthrew her with Ganondorf&#x27;s help to become king of the Twilight.
* The Zonai are an ancient race that appear in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. Initially referenced through various ruins in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, they are established in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; as the tribe that originally founded Hyrule, with Rauru being the first king alongside his wife Sonia. In the game, Zonai technology is prominent across Hyrule in the form of Shrines, ruins, Constructs, and other Zonai devices. They also created the Geoglyphs, which Link investigates during the Main Quest &quot;The Dragon&#x27;s Tears&quot; along with their respective Dragon&#x27;s Tears in order to learn more about Zelda&#x27;s disappearance. In the ancient past, they were created around the Dragon&#x27;s Tears by individuals who viewed the memories within them. In &quot;Creating a Champion&quot;, the Zonai are described as magic users who worship the Triforce.

* The are a race of aquatic piscine humanoids that inhabit Zora&#x27;s Domain or Lake Hylia. In the original game and &quot;Link to the Past&quot;, Zora were enemies that attacked Link from the water with projectiles, though in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; the giant Zora King aids Link by selling him a pair of flippers, allowing him to swim and use the network of whirlpools that link far corners of Hyrule. By &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, their role in most stories changed to a neutral or friendly race. Zora government is monarchical, either ruled by a king, such as King Dorephan in &quot;Breath of the Wild,&quot; Sidon in &quot;Tears of the Kingdom,&quot; and King Zora De Bon XVI in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, or queen, such as Queen Oren in &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot; and Queen in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;. Two different branches exist: &quot;River Zora&quot; are more violent and can shoot fire, while &quot;Sea Zora&quot; are generally passive. Zora have long lifespans and lay eggs to reproduce, which must be kept in cold, clean water to develop healthily, and eggs from the same clutch must be kept together to hatch. Newborn Zora have the appearance of a tadpole.

== Enemies ==
The appearance of some creatures varies across different titles of the series:

* are animated statues built to guard ancient ruins that come to life and attack when disturbed. They have monstrous appearances and carry a sword and shield. If Link approaches, they will chase after him. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are a race of goblin-like creatures, that first appeared in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;. Bokoblins come in a variety of colors. They often appear as standard enemies and wield boko sticks, machetes and clubs. Though their appearance varies from game to game, the one thing that remains consistent is they wear loincloths with a single skull. In &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;, they are less common and their role as standard enemies is largely taken over by the Bulblins. In &quot;Skyward Sword&quot;, Bokoblins are common monsters that serve the Demon Tribe, under Demon Lord Ghirahim and the Demon King Demise. The game also introduces Technoblins and Cursed Bokoblins, undead Bokoblins that can curse Link. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, Bokoblins are low-level, comical enemies that commonly appear across Hyrule living in camps.
* are jelly-like creatures with squat, translucent bodies, stalk-eyes, and a smiling mouth. They mostly move by bouncing around. ChuChus appear in various colours and some possess specific abilities. Once they are defeated, they will drop ChuChu jelly, which can be used by Link as an ingredient and for upgrading armour.
* are large armored knights armed with swords and shields. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; but are recurring foes that appear in &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; and other games.
* are wooden plant-like creatures introduced in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; that appear mostly in the overworld and dungeons. Deku are small creatures that have leaves sprouting out from their heads, red glowing eyes and tube-like mouths that can shoot Deku Nuts. They can fly by using large leaves to glide, and some can use the leaves on their head to fly indefinitely after taking off from a Deku Flower. There are four types of Deku depicted in the series: Deku Scrubs, Mad Scrubs, Business Scrubs, and Royal Scrubs.
* and Wallmasters are ghostly manifestations of giant hands that drag adventurers back to the entrance of a dungeon. Floormasters split up into smaller versions when the original is attacked. Wallmasters first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; while Floormasters first appeared in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. Floormasters also appear in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;The Minish Cap&quot;.
* are undead creatures wrapped like mummies. They resemble ReDeads in regards to their slow and zombie-like movement; in some games, setting a Gibdo&#x27;s bandages alight will reveal a Stalfos or a ReDead underneath. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are recurring boss monsters which typically resemble giant arthropods with a single eye. The eye serves as their weak point. The original Gohma first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game.
* Guardians are large mechanical foes that can blast enemies with a powerful laser from their single eye. They appear in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;. Guardian Stalkers roam Hyrule by moving on their mechanical legs, whilst Guardian Skywatchers use propellers for locomotion. Producer Eiji Aonuma said that they were based on the octoroks that appear in the original game.
* are a recurring enemy and sub-boss in the Legend of Zelda series. The Hinox&#x27;s single eye is its most vulnerable place, dealing the most damage to it when hit. They are cyclops-like ogres and have appeared in &quot;A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, &quot;Four Swords Adventures&quot;, &quot;Phantom Hourglass&quot;, &quot;A Link Between Worlds&quot;, &quot;Tri Force Heroes&quot;, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, and most recently &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;, Hinoxs can be either red, blue or black, depending on their strength. They are the largest monster found within the game and will uproot nearby trees to use as weapons against the player if provoked. Stalnox are skeletal versions of Hinox that appear in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot;.
* are bat monsters that often lurk in dark places such as caves, waiting to dive bomb unwary travelers attempting to bite off chunks of flesh. Some Keese have the ability to pick up elements they fly through and there are fire, ice, cursed, and electric variants. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are yellowish cylindrical monsters that can suck in creatures as large as humans and consume items they carry. They are known for swallowing the shields and tunics that Link uses. Like Likes dissolve into a puddle when killed, leaving the stolen items. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are swift and cunning anthropomorphic lizards that often attack in pairs and can parry and dodge oncoming attacks. They first appeared in &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Lizalfos can throw weapons and dash toward their target.
* are large, strong centaur-like creatures with a head of a lion and horns that first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. This creature has multiple variations including red, blue, white, and silver, with each color denoting the Lynel&#x27;s strength. In &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, Lynels are extremely powerful foes that are resistant to attacks.
* are orc-like monsters that serve as Ganon&#x27;s footsoldiers. In &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot;, Moblins resembled bulldogs, but are pig-like in more recent games. They commonly wield spears, swords, bows, or occasionally massive clubs. They are one of the most common enemies in the games and are considered &quot;mighty&quot;, but also &quot;dumb&quot;. They are described as greedy, self-possessed creatures, and the major antagonist will commonly use them as mercenaries or summoned monsters.
* are octopus monsters that have appeared in almost every &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; game (except for &quot;Twilight Princess&quot;). Octoroks produce rocks within their body that they can fire from their snout via compressed air with the force of a musket shot. Some species of Octorok are land-dwelling while others are mostly aquatic. Big Octos are a very large ocean-dwelling breed sometimes known to attack ships. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are lantern-carrying ghosts formed from concentrated hatred toward the living that freely roam graveyards and other haunted locales. They always carry their signature lanterns. In some editions, they can go invisible when Link is doing a certain action or in a certain form. In &quot;Tears of the Kingdom,&quot; they appear in the Depths as obtainable items and a currency for Bargainer Statues. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are undead creatures resembling zombies with dark brown skin and flat mask-like faces that can paralyze enemies with a scream, and cling to them to drain health away. They first appeared in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;.
* are giant spiders, named for the bony plate in the shape of a human skull that forms their carapace. They are most commonly found in dark places, such as forests, caves, and dungeons but can also sometimes be found in towns at night. Skulltulas and Giant Skulltulas hang from ceiling surfaces, suspended by a strand of silk waiting to drop on unwary prey.
* are animated skeletons mostly from the remains of dead warriors who still have a strong will to fight, and serve evil powers such as Ganon or Vaati. In &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, by using the Mask of Truth, the player learns from a Gossip Stone that humans that get lost while in the Lost Woods will become Stalfos. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are cyclopean four-legged insectoid creatures who use their powerful legs to leap upon and attack prey. Blue Tektites can walk on water, and both Blue and Red Tektites can jump up cliffs. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.
* are magician-like creatures that wear wizard robes and often use fire and ice magic. They first appeared in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; introduced elemental Wizzrobes, who use various magical rods to summon elemental attacks, elemental enemies and even change the weather accordingly. The regular types are the Fire, Electric and Ice Wizzrobes, but each has a more powerful variant. These are known as Meteo and Thunder Wizzrobes, and Blizzrobes respectively.

==Reception==
In their January 2010 issue, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed Hyrule as one of the greatest Nintendo locations, citing the vast number of areas to explore, as well as referencing players&#x27; first experiences with the Lost Woods and Death Mountain as highlights of the players&#x27; adventures. Steve Watts of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the original game world, commenting that although it is minimalist, it, &quot;conveys the feeling of going on a grand adventure through the wilderness, and the lack of hand-holding that would come to define later &quot;Zelda&quot; games makes the world feel that much more expansive and mysterious&quot;. Yannick LeJacq for &quot;Kotaku&quot; commented that &quot;Hyrule is one of the most iconic settings in the history of video games. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; players have been poring over it in one way or another for almost 30 years now&quot;.

&quot;Polygon&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Parish remarked on the impact that Hyrule and its centrepiece Hyrule Field had on gamers in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. He commented: &quot;Open game worlds existed before &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. And in truth, &quot;Ocarina&quot;″s rendition of Hyrule isn&#x27;t even really all that open. But the game explored the relationship between its environments, the camera&#x27;s 3D perspective and Link&#x27;s place in it all to create a realm that felt far more like a real location than the game worlds that had come before it&quot;. &quot;Destructoid&quot; also noted Hyrule&#x27;s impact in &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, saying &quot;there was nothing else like it before 1998&quot; and continued: &quot;The awesome thing about Hyrule is that I can honestly see a place like it existing in our world. It&#x27;s not just some fantasy, flashy place like you&#x27;d find in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. It&#x27;s meant to look like the real world, and Miyamoto achieved that goal in a way no one would have expected without actually seeing it first&quot;.

The open world of Hyrule in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; has received praise for its design. Noelle Warner of &quot;Destructoid&quot; ranked all of the settlements in &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; and chose Tarrey Town as the favourite location, because players must build it from the ground up, making it one of the longest side quests in the game. Kate Gray, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, was impressed by the beauty and large scale of the game world, noting that &quot;the greens of the open plains contrast with the dark black of Death Mountain, which is streaked with orange lava on the distant horizon&quot;. She also commented on the &quot;range of quiet, clever techniques designed to help players navigate the environment&quot;. Andrew Webster of &quot;The Verge&quot; responded positively to the grandness of the game&#x27;s massive open world: &quot;The scale could have been daunting, but the joy of discovery and the satisfaction that comes from finding your own way make it inviting instead&quot;.

Senior editor Caty McCarthy of &quot;USgamer&quot; ranked the in-game map of &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; as the best video game map, describing it as &quot;perfect&quot; world design in terms of the way it integrates with the gameplay. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Hyrule as the sixth greatest game world, commenting that &quot;few game worlds manage to leave as indelible an impression on the collective gaming subconscious as &quot;Zelda&quot; has. For that alone it ranks up there as one of the best, most fully realized worlds in all of gaming&quot;. In 2021, Evan Narcisse of &quot;Kotaku&quot; listed Hyrule as one of the richest sci-fi and fantasy worlds in video games.

== Influence and legacy ==
Since the release of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda game&quot;, critics have commented on the influence and legacy of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; universe on the gaming industry. Ozzie Mejia of &quot;Shacknews&quot; highlighted the importance of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;: &quot;Before the open worlds of a &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, a &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, or a &quot;Skyrim&quot;, there was the intimidating land of Hyrule. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; has done more than shape the series as it&#x27;s known today. It is known for influencing many of today&#x27;s best games and its formula has inspired many of today&#x27;s most recognizable game developers, both in the mainstream and indie space&quot;. Liz Finnegan for &quot;The Escapist&quot; commented on the original game&#x27;s influence on the RPG genre, particularly its nonlinear open world, and opined that &quot;&quot;Zelda&quot;″s design inspired countless other titles to adopt the action-adventure-exploration hybrid with a top-down perspective and expansive, cohesive overworld. These games have long since been informally dubbed &quot;&quot;Zelda&quot; clones&quot;. Christian Donlan of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted the similarity and influence that Hyrule had on &quot;Dark Souls&quot;, comparing both kingdoms: &quot;In the original &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot;, however, Hyrule feels, well, a bit more like Lordran—a place of scarred earth and wasteland, parched and rugged and filled with horrible creatures that erupt from the sands or move in staggering hops&quot;. The original game was a phenomenal commercial success for Nintendo, selling over 6.5 million copies, and has been described by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time.

&quot;USGamer&quot;&#x27;s Nadia Oxford commented on the significance of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; and considered it to be &quot;a genius work of game design&quot;. She said that &quot;it brought the traditionally top-down series into a fully 3D realm while successfully preserving the heart and soul of previous &quot;Zelda&quot; games. Its &#x27;Z-targeting&#x27; mechanic refined the clumsy auto-targeting systems that made 3D console games of the day feel inferior to 3D action games on the PC. Finally, it presented a story about healing a broken world&quot;. Heather Alexandra, writing for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, remarked on the impact of the game&#x27;s release: &quot;There have been countless open world games since 1998, but &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was the moment when the concept of massive, interconnected worlds began to really crystalize&quot;. Keza MacDonald of &quot;The Guardian&quot; also commented on the influence of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, noting that it was one of the first real 3D adventures and that it &quot;remains eminently playable today because so many of the things it invented became standard for any 3D game that came after it&quot;. Tom Power of &quot;Gamesradar&quot; opined that the game is often considered to be the greatest video game due to its technological innovations: &quot;The problems Nintendo solved back then have been influential across gaming genres and, whilst public acknowledgment of this influence is thin on the ground, it&#x27;s difficult not to view &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; as one of the fathers of modern gaming&quot;.

In the months following the release of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; in 2017, many video game developers were influenced by its open world design. Alx Preston, creator of &quot;Hyper Light Drifter&quot;, remarked that &quot;the sense of freedom and experimentation is incredibly inspiring&quot;. Adam Saltsman, creator of &quot;Canabalt&quot;, commented on the consistency of the game environment and the player&#x27;s ability to experiment. Vlambeer&#x27;s Rami Ismail said that &quot;no game has done verticality as well as &quot;BotW&quot;&quot;. Sam Byford of &quot;The Verge&quot; commented on the impact of &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;&#x27;s open world on the video game industry, describing it as a &quot;revolutionary approach to open-world game design&quot;. He cited several other subsequent game worlds that bear similarities to &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;, including &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, &quot;Immortals Fenyx Rising&quot; and &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot;. Both the miHoYo development team of &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; and Sam Barlow, creator of &quot;Telling Lies&quot; have cited &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; as a significant source of inspiration. &quot;Elden Ring&quot; director Hidetaka Miyazaki also said that he was influenced by &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot;″s open world. Upon its release, &quot;Breath of the Wild&quot; achieved critical acclaim and was the biggest commercial success of the franchise and one of the best-selling video games, selling 29 million copies on the Nintendo Switch as of December 2022 and over 1.6 million copies on the Wii U.

<doc id="30780" wikidata="Q1456261" url="?curid=30780" title="Traducianism">
<text>In Christian theology, Traducianism is a doctrine about the origin of the soul holding that this immaterial aspect is transmitted through natural generation along with the body, the material aspect of human beings. That is, human propagation is of the whole being, both material and immaterial aspects: an individual&#x27;s soul is derived from the soul of one or both parents. This implies that only the soul of Adam was created directly by God (with Eve&#x27;s substance, material and immaterial, being taken from out of Adam), in contrast with the idea of creationism of the soul, which holds that all souls are created directly by God.

==History==

All Church Fathers agreed that the soul of Adam was directly created by God; they disagreed about whether humans thereafter were each given souls as a special act of creation, or whether souls were passed on to them the same way their bodies were. Tertullian actively advocated traducianism, the parental generation of souls. After the rise of Pelagianism, some theologians hesitated between traducianism and creationism, believing the former to offer a better, if not the only, explanation of the transmission of original sin. For Augustine, traducianism suggested a simple explanation for original sin, but he could not decide between it and creationism. In his writing to Saint Jerome, Augustine said, &quot;If that opinion of the creation of new souls is not opposed to this established article of faith let it be also mine; if it is, let it not be thine.&quot; Jerome condemned it and said that creationism was the opinion of the Church, but he admitted that most of the Western Christians held traducianism. Gregory of Nyssa alone among the Greek Fathers leaned toward traducianism. Theodore Abu Qurrah, Macarius, Rufinus and Nemesius also favored that view. Clement of Alexandria laid the foundations for the creationist view. Ambrose of Milan drew a distinction between the creation of Eve&#x27;s body from Adam&#x27;s rib and the creation of her soul by citing Genesis 2:22: &quot;the man said: &quot;This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.&quot; He noted that it did not say &quot;soul of my soul&quot;, but that can only mean that the souls of the first man and the first woman were both created separately and independently.

Creationism always prevailed in the East and became the general opinion of medieval theologians. Amongst the Scholastics, there were no defenders of traducianism. Alexander of Hales characterized creationism as the more probable opinion. All the other scholastics held creationism as certain and differed only in regard to the censure that should be attached to the opposite error. Accordingly, Peter Lombard asserted, &quot;The Catholic Church teaches that souls are created at their infusion into the body.&quot; Saint Thomas Aquinas was more emphatic: &quot;It is heretical to say that the intellectual soul is transmitted by process of generation.&quot; Hugh of Saint Victor and Hilary of Poitiers were creationists. Anselm of Canterbury was against traducianism.

There was a diversity of opinions among the remaining scholastics. Some held that the soul of a child is produced by the soul of the parents just as the body is generated by the parent body. Others maintained that all souls are created apart and are then united with their respective bodies, either by their own volition or by the command and action of God. Still others declared that the soul in the moment of its creation is infused into the body. Although for a time, the several views were upheld, and it was doubtful which came nearest the truth, the Church subsequently condemned the first two and approved the third. Gregory of Valencia spoke of &quot;Generationism&quot; as &quot;certainly erroneous.&quot; Although there are no explicit definitions authoritatively put forth by the Catholic Church that would warrant calling Creationism to be &quot;de fide&quot; doctrine, there can be no doubt as to which view has been favored by ecclesiastical authority.

That the soul sinned in its pre-existent state and on that account was incarcerated in the body is regarded by the Catholic Church as a fiction that has been repeatedly condemned. Divested of that fiction, the theory that the soul exists prior to its infusion into the organism, while not explicitly reprobated, is obviously opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church according to which souls are multiplied correspondingly with the multiplication of human organisms. However, whether the rational soul is infused into the organism at conception, as the modern opinion holds, or some weeks subsequently, as medieval scholastics supposed, is an open question to some theologians.

Martin Luther, like Augustine, was unwilling to make a dogmatic statement but at least later in his life moved away from the medieval consensus and favored the Traducian position. In the theses Luther prepared for Peter Hegemon&#x27;s doctoral disputation in 1545 concerning the origin of souls, Luther argues for the view that the soul of the child is generated from the souls of the parents in a way that is analogous to the generation of the body from the parents, believing this to be more consistent with the Biblical testimony than an immediate direct creation of each individual soul by God. The Lutheran dogmatic tradition that followed was decidedly traducian, with Johann Gerhard, David Hollatz, Johannes Andreas Quenstedt all clearly articulating traducianism. John Calvin favoured creationism, as did Robert Baron. The Catholic Church postulates that the souls are created immediately at the moment of the conception. Pope Pius XII stated: &quot;That the souls are created by God, it is the Catholic Faith that obliges us to accept.&quot;

==Supporters==

Traducianism was developed initially by Tertullian, who took a semi-materialistic view of the nature of the soul. It has been endorsed by Church Fathers such as Saint Gregory of Nyssa, Saint Anastasius Sinaita, and other theological figures in the early centuries of Christianity. Protestant advocates include various Lutheran Churches as well as some modern theologians such as Augustus H. Strong (Baptist), and Gordon Clark (Presbyterian), Lewis Sperry Chafer, Millard Erickson, Norman L. Geisler, and Robert L. Reymond.

W. G. T. Shedd says that the soul of any given individual is a part of the original soul given to Adam, and therefore is not originated in the act of procreation.

In &quot;Evil, Sin and Christian Theism&quot; (2022), Andrew Loke argues for a modified hylomorphic theory that combines the merits of both Traducianism and Creationism. According to this view, a unique soul is generated when the gametes of parents that carry soulish potentialities meet (Traducian account), but it is God who gives a unique shape to the soul (Creationist account). Thus, while the &quot;soul-stuffs&quot; are ancestrally passed on, the soul-shape is divinely caused.

==Arguments in support==

Supporters of traducianism present arguments from the Bible such as: 
* Begetting includes the image and likeness of God (Genesis ), but since God is Spirit, this must mean the immaterial aspect of human beings.
* God&#x27;s creation is &quot;finished&quot; (), thus no new souls are created directly, but are instead transmitted by natural generation just as the body is.
* Creationism destroys the idea of the miraculous and supernatural, since it incorporates God&#x27;s supernatural, miraculous creation of the soul (out of nothing or himself) into the natural process of reproduction. This is inherently contradictory, since it makes that which is against natural law a part of nature: it is against natural law that something is created out of nothing.
* God created all things &quot;very good&quot; (), yet many Christians understand the Bible to teach that after the fall, all are sinful at birth (Job ; ; Psalm ; John ) and from conception (). Since most Theologians hold that God would not have created something sinful, it follows that souls are not created directly but are generated. Those who adhere to Roman Catholicism believe that it is possible for God to create a soul that simultaneously takes on a fallen nature, much like He can create a soul that simultaneously is prevented from taking on a fallen nature (see The Immaculate Conception); this view is not typically held by Protestants or other Christian denominations. 
* In , some interpreters see the traducian model as the best explanation for the begetting of monstrous offspring with human bodies and Demonic souls by the Angels that took wives of the daughters of men. The soul-creationist&#x27;s difficulty of God creating souls for such monsters may be why most later churchmen rejected the literal interpretation of Genesis 6 as referring to Angels interbreeding with human women.
* Traducianists find support in Romans 5:12, &quot;Therefore, just as through one person sin entered the world, and through sin, death, and thus death came to all, inasmuch as all sinned...&quot; and 1 Corinthians &quot;For just as in Adam all die, so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,&quot;
* can be understood to teach that Souls are already present in the loins.
* Foundational to the traducian position is the statement in Hebrews 7:10: &quot;When Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.&quot;
* Since God is indivisible in both quality and nature, the creation of human souls cannot therefore be from some division beyond himself and not of his own substance and quality. It follows then that the creation of the human soul is the product of a merging and reconfiguration within God himself so therefore humanity, being made themselves in God&#x27;s image and similarly constrained, would likewise generate and issue forth souls but not actually creating anything beyond divine providence.

* Also, in the Nicene Creed, the Son was generated, not created, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son.
* According to Genesis chapters 1 and 2, God rested from creating on the 7th day. Creating new souls at each human conception could be seen as working against his finishing of creation.

==Arguments in opposition==
Reasons for opposing the traducianism of human beings include the metaphysical argument that since humans cannot control their own existence, their existence cannot be caused by themselves; it must rather be caused by a necessary being otherwise known as God. Creation, in other words, includes God&#x27;s on-going causation of human existence. This causation is through the human soul because, as Saint Thomas Aquinas argues, the human Soul has activities beyond the capacity of matter and the existence of these activities shows that the human soul is both immaterial and immortal---but not independent of God&#x27;s causality. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that &quot;every spiritual soul is created immediately by God - it is not &quot;produced&quot; by the parents, and also that it is immortal...&quot; This argument, however, isn&#x27;t contradictory with the idea that Souls can give existence to new Souls the same way there is intentionality, action and causation in the material nature. Humans have, however, free will and thus control over their own existence, as much as they are responsible for the act of procreation.
Traducianism contradicts the concept of the indivisibility of the soul, but this is a merging and creation of two souls. If the souls are incapable of division, then it is impossible for the soul of the child to be derived from the souls of the parents. But this is a merging and creation by two souls, and God would also have to divide himself in order to create a new one through his own substance. To God, nothing is impossible, as it is possible to God to create a new one from nothing perhaps from himself. Such is being divided from something, even two rather than one, both parents souls being that powerful. Also, in the Nicene Creed, the Son was generated, not created, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father.

The weakness of traducianism, to many theologians, is that it makes the generation of the soul dependent as it is parallel to of the transmission of matter. Presbyterian theologian Charles Hodge held that since the nature of the soul is immaterial it could not be transmitted by natural generation. To others, however, it is not a weakness of argument, since to God that is not impossible, Spirit isn&#x27;t like matter, not being the same process, and since any way of existence of soul is as good as any other, and since for every human body there is a soul, regardless of how and what made it come into existence, and that soul comes in to existence because there is a transmission of matter to create a human being, there is not any issue about God making his generation of the soul dependent of the transmission of matter. Also, in the Nicean Creed, the Son was generated, not created, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from both the Father and the Son.

Yet another argument for opposing traducianism is from the Genesis&#x27; accounts of Creation. If it took divine action to create human beings in the beginning, it takes divine action now because neither in the beginning nor in the present is it possible for mortal beings to make immortal souls. This argument, however, isn&#x27;t contradictory with the idea that, if the first souls had to be created by God, that was simply because they were the first, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the can&#x27;t originate new ones on their own.

Traducianism proceeds on the unproven assumption that God only works in a managerial manner after completing the creation of the world, as creacionism proceeds on the unproven opposite assumption. Louis Berkhof points out that God continues to work immediately both in the performance of miracles and in some parts of the work of redemption.

Some Calvinist Reformed Protestants oppose traducianism by contending that it means that if the parents of the child are Regenerate, then the soul of the child must also be Regenerate, which obscures the doctrine of Original Sin as articulated by Augustinian theologians of the Calvinist Tradition. This argument, however, isn&#x27;t contradictory to the idea that the parents are responsible for their own Regeneration the same way their offspring is responsible for its own Regeneration. It can also be argued that, if there is an Original Sin, newly created souls are bounded to something that was not caused by anyone that has given origin to them, thus contradicting the same doctrine.

The Charismatic Movement also generally supports the idea that the Holy Spirit is the &quot;Creator&quot; of every individual soul, citing the traditional hymn Veni Creator Spiritus as evidence that Christians have long invoked the divine soul-making properties of the spirit. states: &quot;But Jesus answered them, &quot;My Father is still working, so I am working, too,&quot; indicating that God is still at work giving life at the time Jesus&#x27; words are spoken. But working can simply have the meaning that God is simply working for the salvation of mankind. In its origin it was an allusion to the Jewish belief that God remained actively working in the Universe even after its creation and does not necessarily mean soul creation or the creation of anything new.

Some might oppose crerationism based on the fact that God is not a constant automatic and other-dependent machine of soul creation, including the souls of those born from sin, such as rape and incest.

<text>The Tulsa race massacre, also known as the Tulsa race riot or the Black Wall Street massacre, was a two-day-long white supremacist terrorist massacre that took place between May 31 and June 1, 1921, when mobs of white residents, some of whom had been appointed as deputies and armed by city government officials, attacked black residents and destroyed homes and businesses of the Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The event is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history. The attackers burned and destroyed more than 35 square blocks of the neighborhood—at the time, one of the wealthiest black communities in the United States, colloquially known as &quot;Black Wall Street.&quot;

More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals, and as many as 6,000 black residents of Tulsa were interned in large facilities, many of them for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 36 dead. The 2001 Tulsa Reparations Coalition examination of events identified 39 dead, 26 black and 13 white, based on contemporary autopsy reports, death certificates, and other records. The commission gave several estimates ranging from 75 to 300 dead.

The massacre began during Memorial Day weekend after 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner, was accused of assaulting Sarah Page, a white 21-year-old elevator operator in the nearby Drexel Building. He was arrested and rumors that he was to be lynched were spread throughout the city, where a white man named Roy Belton had been lynched the previous year. Upon hearing reports that a mob of hundreds of white men had gathered around the jail where Rowland was being held, a group of 75 black men, some armed, arrived at the jail to protect Rowland. The sheriff persuaded the group to leave the jail, assuring them that he had the situation under control.

The most widely reported and corroborated inciting incident occurred as the group of black men left when an elderly white man approached O. B. Mann, a black man, and demanded that he hand over his pistol. Mann refused, and the old man attempted to disarm him. A gunshot went off, and then, according to the sheriff&#x27;s reports, &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot; The two groups shot at each other until midnight when the group of black men were greatly outnumbered and forced to retreat to Greenwood. At the end of the exchange of gunfire, 12 people were dead, 10 white and 2 black. Alternatively, another eyewitness account was that the shooting began &quot;down the street from the Courthouse&quot; when black business owners came to the defense of a lone black man being attacked by a group of around six white men. It is possible that the eyewitness did not recognize the fact that this incident was occurring as a part of a rolling gunfight that was already underway. As news of the violence spread throughout the city, mob violence exploded. White rioters invaded Greenwood that night and the next morning, killing men and burning and looting stores and homes. Around noon on June 1, the Oklahoma National Guard imposed martial law, ending the massacre.

About 10,000 black people were left homeless, and the cost of the property damage amounted to more than $1.5 million in real estate and $750,000 in personal property (equivalent to $ million in ). By the end of 1922, most of the residents&#x27; homes had been rebuilt, but the city and real estate companies refused to compensate them. Many survivors left Tulsa, while residents who chose to stay in the city, regardless of race, largely kept silent about the terror, violence, and resulting losses for decades. The massacre was largely omitted from local, state, and national histories for years.

In 1996, 75 years after the massacre, a bipartisan group in the state legislature authorized the formation of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. The commission&#x27;s final report, published in 2001, states that the city had conspired with the racist mob; it recommended a program of reparations to survivors and their descendants. The state passed legislation to establish scholarships for the descendants of survivors, encourage the economic development of Greenwood, and develop a park in memory of the victims of the massacre in Tulsa. The park was dedicated in 2010. Schools in Oklahoma have been required to teach students about the massacre since 2002, and in 2020, the massacre officially became a part of the Oklahoma school curriculum.

==Background==

In 1921, Oklahoma had a racially, socially, and politically tense atmosphere. The territory of northern Oklahoma had been established for the forced resettlement of Native Americans from the southeast, some of whom had owned slaves. The slaves were the first black inhabitants of Indian Territory, having been brought in by their native owners. Other areas had received many settlers from the South whose families had been slaveholders before the Civil War. Oklahoma was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907. The newly created state legislature, which had a large Democratic majority, passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as its first order of business. The 1907 Oklahoma Constitution did not call for strict segregation; delegates feared that U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt would veto the document if they included such restrictions. Still, the first law passed by the new legislature segregated all rail travel, and voter registration rules effectively disenfranchised non-whites. This meant that they were also barred from either serving on juries or serving in local public offices. These laws were enforced until they were ruled unconstitutional after the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Major cities passed laws that imposed additional restrictions.

On August 4, 1916, Tulsa passed an ordinance that mandated residential segregation by forbidding members of either race from residing on any block where three-quarters or more of the residents were members of the other race. Although the United States Supreme Court declared such an ordinance unconstitutional the following year, Tulsa and many other cities continued to establish and enforce segregation for the next three decades.
Many servicemen returned to Tulsa following the end of the First World War in 1918. As they tried to re-enter the labor force, social tensions and white supremacist sentiment increased in cities where job competition was fierce. An economic slump in Northeastern Oklahoma increased the level of unemployment. The Civil War, which ended in 1865, was still in living memory; civil rights for African Americans were lacking.

The Ku Klux Klan was resurgent (influenced by the popular 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;). Since 1915, the Ku Klux Klan had been growing in urban chapters across the country. Its first significant appearance in Oklahoma occurred on August 12, 1921. By the end of 1921, 3,200 of Tulsa&#x27;s 72,000 residents were Klan members, according to one estimate. In the early 20th century, lynchings were common in Oklahoma as part of a continuing effort to assert and maintain white supremacy. By 1921, at least 31 people, mostly men and boys, had been lynched in the newly formed state; 26 were black.

At the same time, black veterans pushed to have their civil rights enforced, believing that they had earned full citizenship as the result of their military service. In what became known as the &quot;Red Summer&quot; of 1919, industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast experienced severe race riots in which whites attacked black communities, sometimes with the assistance of local authorities.

As a booming oil city, Tulsa also supported a large number of affluent, educated, and professional African American residents. Greenwood was a district in Tulsa that was organized in 1906 following Booker T. Washington&#x27;s 1905 tour of Arkansas, Indian Territory, and Oklahoma. It was a namesake of the Greenwood District, which Washington had established as his own district in Tuskegee, Alabama, five years earlier. Greenwood became so prosperous that it came to be known as &quot;the Negro Wall Street&quot; (now commonly referred to as &quot;the Black Wall Street&quot;). Most black people lived together in the district. Black Americans had created their own businesses and services in this enclave, including several grocers, two newspapers, two movie theaters, nightclubs, and numerous churches. Black professionals, including doctors, dentists, lawyers, and clergy, served the community. During his trip to Tulsa in 1905, Washington encouraged the cooperation, economic independence, and excellence being demonstrated there. Greenwood residents selected their own leaders and raised capital there to support economic growth. In the surrounding areas of northeastern Oklahoma, they also enjoyed relative prosperity and participated in the oil boom.

===Encounter in the elevator===
On May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner who was employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator in the nearby Drexel Building at 319 South Main Street in order to use the top-floor &quot;colored&quot; restroom, which his employer had arranged for use by his black employees. There, he encountered Sarah Page, the 21-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty. Whether—and to what extent—Rowland and Page knew each other has long been a matter of speculation. The two likely knew each other at least by sight because Rowland would have regularly ridden in Page&#x27;s elevator on his way to and from the restroom. A clerk at Renberg&#x27;s, a clothing store on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman&#x27;s scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building. The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in a distraught state. Thinking that she had been sexually assaulted, he summoned the authorities. Apart from the clerk&#x27;s interpretation that Rowland had attempted to rape Page, many explanations have been given for the incident, with the most common explanation being that Rowland tripped as he got onto the elevator, and as he tried to catch his fall, he grabbed onto the arm of Page, who then screamed. Others suggested that Rowland and Page had a lover&#x27;s quarrel.

The 2001 Oklahoma Commission Final Report notes that it was unusual for both Rowland and Page to be working downtown on Memorial Day when most stores and businesses were closed. But it has been speculated that Rowland was there because the shine parlor where he worked may have been open to draw in some of the parade traffic, while Page had been required to work in order to transport Drexel Building employees and their families to choice parade viewing spots on the building&#x27;s upper floors.

===Brief investigation===
Although the police questioned Page, no written account of her statement has been found, but apparently, she told the police that Rowland had grabbed her arm and nothing more, and would not press charges. The police determined that what happened between the two individuals was less than an assault. They conducted a low-key investigation rather than launching a man-hunt for her alleged assailant.

Regardless of whether or not assault had occurred, Rowland had reason to be fearful, as African American men accused of raping white women were often prime targets for lynch mobs. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Rowland fled to his mother&#x27;s house in the Greenwood neighborhood.

==Tuesday, May 31==

===Arrest of Rowland===
On the morning after the incident, Henry Carmichael, a white detective, and Henry C. Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and detained him. Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at the corner of First Street and Main Street. Late that day, Police Commissioner J. M. Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland&#x27;s life. He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail on the top floor of the Tulsa County Courthouse.

Rowland was well-known among attorneys and other legal professionals within the city, many of whom knew him through his work as a shoeshiner. Some witnesses later recounted hearing several attorneys defend Rowland in their conversations with one another. One of the men said, &quot;Why, I know that boy, and have known him a good while. That&#x27;s not in him.&quot;

===Newspaper coverage===
The &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot;, owned, published, and edited by Richard Lloyd Jones, and one of two white-owned papers that were published in Tulsa, broke the story in that afternoon&#x27;s edition with the headline: &quot;Nab Negro for Attacking Girl In an Elevator&quot;, describing the alleged incident. According to some witnesses, the same edition of the &quot;Tribune&quot; included an editorial warning of a potential lynching of Rowland, titled &quot;To Lynch Negro Tonight&quot;. The paper was known at the time to have a &quot;sensationalist&quot; style of news writing. Allegedly, all original copies of that issue of the paper have apparently been destroyed, and the relevant page is missing from the microfilm copy. The Tulsa Race Riot Commission in 1997 offered a reward for a copy of the editorial, which went unclaimed. A copy of the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; of 1 June 1921 was found: on the front page was an article headlined &quot;Nab Negro for attacking girl in an Elevator&quot; [right]. The editorial page was also found: it did not have an article headlined &quot;To Lynch A Negro Tonight&quot;. Other newspapers of the time like &quot;The Black Dispatch&quot; and the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; did not call attention to any such editorial after the event. So, the exact content of the column—and whether or not it existed at all—remains in dispute. However, Chief of Detectives James Patton attributed the cause of the riots entirely to the newspaper account and stated, &quot;If the facts in the story as told the police had only been printed I do not think there would have been any riot whatsoever.&quot;

===Stand-off at the courthouse===
The afternoon edition of the &quot;Tribune&quot; hit the streets shortly after 3 p.m., and soon, news spread of a potential lynching. By 4 p.m., local authorities were on alert. White residents began congregating at and near the Tulsa County Courthouse. By sunset, around 7:30 p.m., the several hundred white residents assembled outside the courthouse appeared to have the makings of a lynch mob. Willard M. McCullough, the newly elected sheriff of Tulsa County, was determined to avoid events such as the 1920 lynching of white murder suspect Roy Belton in Tulsa, which had occurred during the term of his predecessor. The sheriff took steps to ensure Rowland&#x27;s safety. McCullough organized his deputies into a defensive formation around Rowland, who was terrified. The &quot;Guthrie Daily Leader&quot; reported that Rowland had been taken to the county jail before crowds started to gather. The sheriff positioned six of his men, armed with rifles and shotguns, on the roof of the courthouse. He disabled the building&#x27;s elevator and had his remaining men barricade themselves at the top of the stairs with orders to shoot any intruders in sight. The sheriff went outside and tried to talk the crowd into going home, but to no avail. According to an account by Scott Ellsworth, the sheriff was &quot;hooted down&quot;. At about 8:20 p.m., three white men entered the courthouse, demanding that Rowland be turned over to them. Although vastly outnumbered by the growing crowd out on the street, Sheriff McCullough turned the men away.

A few blocks away on Greenwood Avenue, members of the black community gathered to discuss the situation at Gurley&#x27;s Hotel. Given the recent lynching of Belton, a white man accused of murder, they believed that Rowland was greatly at risk. Many black residents were determined to prevent the crowd from lynching Rowland, but they were divided about tactics. Young World War I veterans prepared for a battle by collecting guns and ammunition. Older, more prosperous men feared a destructive confrontation that likely would cost them dearly. O. W. Gurley stated that he had tried to convince the men that there would be no lynching, but the crowd responded that Sheriff McCullough had personally told them their presence was required. At about 9:30 p.m., a group of approximately 50–60 black men, armed with rifles and shotguns, arrived at the jail to support the sheriff and his deputies in defending Rowland from the mob. Corroborated by ten witnesses, attorney James Luther submitted to the grand jury that they were following the orders of Sheriff McCullough, who publicly denied he gave any orders:
===Taking up arms===
Having seen the armed black men, some of the more than 1,000 whites who had been at the courthouse went home for their own guns. Others headed for the National Guard armory at the corner of Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm themselves. The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition. Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry Regiment learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he consequently took measures to prevent it. He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory. When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300 to 400 men. Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter. After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory.

At the courthouse, the crowd had swollen to nearly 2,000, many of them now armed. Several local leaders, including Reverend Charles W. Kerr, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, tried to dissuade mob action. Chief of Police John A. Gustafson later claimed that he tried to talk the crowd into going home.

Anxiety on Greenwood Avenue was rising. Many black residents worried about the safety of Rowland. Small groups of armed black men ventured toward the courthouse in automobiles, partly for surveillance and to demonstrate they were prepared to take necessary action to protect Rowland. Many white men interpreted these actions as a &quot;Negro uprising&quot; and became concerned. Eyewitnesses reported gunshots, presumably fired into the air, increasing in frequency during the evening.

In Greenwood, rumors began to fly—in particular, a report that whites were storming the courthouse. Shortly after 10 p.m., a second, larger group of approximately 75 armed black men decided to go to the courthouse. They offered their support to the sheriff, who declined their help.

There are conflicting reports about the exact time and nature of the incident, or incidents, that immediately precipitated the massacre. According to the 2001 Commission, &quot;As the black men were leaving, a white man attempted to disarm a tall, African American World War I veteran. A struggle ensued, and a shot rang out.&quot; Then, according to the sheriff, &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot; At the end of the exchange of gunfire, 12 people were dead, 10 white and two black.

Another firsthand account originates from Eloise Taylor Butler—the daughter of the famed &quot;Peg Leg&quot; Taylor—who was nineteen years old and in Greenwood on that day. According to Eloise&#x27;s great-granddaughter, who passed on the story that Eloise told her, while &quot;the initial story was that it started at the Courthouse,&quot; in fact, &quot;It escalated &quot;to&quot; the Courthouse. It started like down the street from the Courthouse.&quot; This key inciting incident reportedly occurred when a group of around six white men approached and beat down a lone black man. Black store owners reportedly then came out of nearby shops to help defend the black man, and &quot;once they started defending him, they ended up having to shoot.&quot; The account further notes, &quot;[The black store owners] fought back the best they could. But...[the white mob] started on that end of town, where the black people started fighting, [the white mob] set those initial shops on fire at the very beginning.&quot; The 2001 Commission itself does note that &quot;African American homes and businesses along Archer were the first targets&quot; of the white mob&#x27;s arson. These could possibly be the same shops &quot;down the street from the Courthouse&quot; where this inciting incident reportedly took place, and it establishes an immediate motive for those particular shops being targeted first. Of course, it may simply be the case that they were targeted first only out of convenience—Archer being the first street on Greenwood&#x27;s side of the Frisco Tracks. Moreover, while the Taylor account seems adamant that this incident occurred before the initial gunfight at the Courthouse (and then &quot;escalated &quot;to&quot; the Courthouse&quot;), it&#x27;s still possible that the incident Taylor witnessed was itself simply a product of the rolling gunfight that is known to have ensued across the streets of Tulsa following that first widely reported exchange of gunfire.

===Outbursts of violence===
The gunshots triggered an almost immediate response, with both sides firing on each other. The first &quot;battle&quot; was said to last a few seconds or so, but it took a toll, because ten whites and two black men lay dead or dying in the street. The black men who had offered to provide security retreated toward Greenwood. A rolling gunfight ensued. The armed white mob pursued the black contingent toward Greenwood, with many stopping to loot local stores for additional weapons and ammunition. Along the way, bystanders, many of whom were leaving a movie theater after a show, were caught off guard by the mobs and fled. Panic set in as the white mob began firing on any black people in the crowd. The white mob also shot and killed at least one white man in the confusion. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, some in the mob were deputized by a police officer and instructed to &quot;get a gun and get a nigger&quot;. So began a major attack on the African-American community.

At around 11 p.m., members of the National Guard unit began to assemble at the armory to organize a plan to subdue the rioters. Several groups were deployed downtown to set up guard at the courthouse, police station, and other public facilities. Members of the local chapter of the American Legion joined in on patrols of the streets. The forces appeared to have been deployed to protect the white districts adjacent to Greenwood. The National Guard rounded up numerous black people and took them to the Convention Hall on Brady Street for detention.

At around midnight, a small crowd of whites assembled outside the courthouse. Members of the crowd were heard yelling expletives and calling for Rowland to be lynched, but ultimately did not storm the courthouse.

==Wednesday, June 1==
Throughout the early morning hours, groups of armed white and black men squared off in gunfights. The fighting was concentrated along sections of the Frisco tracks, a dividing line between the black and white commercial districts. A rumor circulated that more black people were coming by train from Muskogee to help with an invasion of Tulsa. At one point, passengers on an incoming train were forced to take cover on the floor of the train cars, as they had arrived amid crossfire, with the train taking hits on both sides. Small groups of whites made brief forays by car into Greenwood, indiscriminately firing into businesses and residences. They often received return fire. Meanwhile, white rioters threw lighted oil rags into several buildings along Archer Street, igniting them.

As unrest spread to other parts of the city, many middle-class white families who employed black people in their homes as live-in cooks and servants were accosted by white rioters. They demanded the families turn over their employees to be taken to detention centers around the city. Many white families complied, but those who refused were subjected to attacks and vandalism in turn.

===Fires begin===
At around 1 a.m., the white mob began setting fires, mainly in businesses on commercial Archer Street at the southern edge of the Greenwood district. As news traveled among Greenwood residents in the early morning hours, many began to take up arms in defense of their neighborhood, while others began a mass exodus from the city. Throughout the night both sides continued fighting, sometimes only sporadically.

As crews from the Tulsa Fire Department arrived to put out fires, they were turned away at gunpoint. Scott Elsworth makes the same claim, but his reference makes no mention of firefighters. Mary E. Jones Parrish, a survivor of the massacre, gave only praise for the National Guard. Another reference Elsworth gives to support the claim of holding firefighters at gunpoint is only a summary of events in which they suppressed the firing of guns by the rioters and disarmed them of their firearms. Yet another of his references states that they were fired upon by the white mob, &quot;It would mean a fireman&#x27;s life to turn a stream of water on one of those negro buildings. They shot at us all morning when we were trying to do something but none of my men was hit. There is not a chance in the world to get through that mob into the negro district.&quot; By 4 a.m., an estimated two dozen black-owned businesses had been set ablaze.

Tulsa co-founder and Ku Klux Klan member W. Tate Brady participated in the riot as a night watchman. &quot;This Land Press&quot; reported that previously, Brady led the Tulsa Outrage, the November 7, 1917, tarring and feathering of members of the Industrial Workers of the World—an incident understood to be economically and politically, rather than racially, motivated.

===Daybreak===
Upon sunrise, around 5 a.m., a train whistle sounded (Hirsch said it was a siren). Some rioters believed this sound to be a signal for the rioters to launch an all-out assault on Greenwood. A white man stepped out from behind the Frisco depot and was fatally shot by a sniper in Greenwood. Crowds of rioters poured from their shelter, on foot, and by car, into the streets of the neighborhood. Five white men in a car led the charge but were killed by a fusillade of gunfire before they had traveled one block.

Overwhelmed by the sheer number of attackers, black residents retreated north on Greenwood Avenue to the edge of town. Chaos ensued as terrified residents fled. The rioters shot indiscriminately and killed many along the way. Splitting into small groups, they began breaking into houses and buildings, looting. Several residents later testified the rioters broke into occupied homes and ordered the residents out to the street, where they could be driven or forced to walk to detention centers. A rumor spread among the rioters that the new Mount Zion Baptist Church was being used as a fortress and armory. Purportedly twenty caskets full of rifles had been delivered to the church, though no evidence was found.

===Attack by air===
Numerous eyewitnesses described airplanes carrying white assailants, who fired rifles and dropped firebombs on buildings, homes, and fleeing families. The privately owned aircraft had been dispatched from the nearby Curtiss-Southwest Field outside Tulsa. Law enforcement officials later said that the planes were to provide reconnaissance and protect against a &quot;Negro uprising&quot;. Law enforcement personnel were thought to be aboard at least some flights. Eyewitness accounts, such as testimony from the survivors during Commission hearings and a manuscript by eyewitness and attorney Buck Colbert Franklin, discovered in 2015, said that on the morning of June 1, at least &quot;a dozen or more&quot; planes circled the neighborhood and dropped &quot;burning turpentine balls&quot; on an office building, a hotel, a filling (gas) station, and multiple other buildings. Men also fired rifles at black residents, gunning them down in the street.

Richard S. Warner concluded in his submission to The Oklahoma Commission that contrary to later reports by claimed eyewitnesses of seeing explosions, there was no reliable evidence to support such attacks. Warner noted that while a number of newspapers targeted at black readers heavily reported the use of nitroglycerin, turpentine, and rifles from the planes, many cited anonymous sources or second-hand accounts. Beryl Ford, one of the pre-eminent historians of the disaster, concluded from his large collection of photographs that there was no evidence of any building damaged by explosions. Danney Goble commended Warner on his efforts and supported his conclusions. State representative Don Ross (born in Tulsa in 1941), however, dissented from the evidence presented in the report concluding that bombs were in fact dropped from planes during the violence.

In 2015, a previously unknown written eyewitness account of the events of May 31, 1921, was discovered and subsequently obtained by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. The 10-page typewritten letter was authored by Buck Colbert Franklin, noted Oklahoma attorney and father of John Hope Franklin.

Notable quotes include:

Franklin reports seeing multiple machine guns firing at night and hearing &quot;thousands and thousands of guns&quot; being fired simultaneously from all directions. He states that he was arrested by &quot;a thousand boys, it seemed... firing their guns every step they took.&quot; An account of Franklin&#x27;s experiences during this event appears in his autobiography, &quot;My Life and an Era&quot;.

===Arrival of National Guard troops===
Adjutant General Charles F. Barrett of the Oklahoma National Guard arrived by special train at about 9:15 a.m., with 109 troops from Oklahoma City. Ordered in by the governor, he could not legally act until he had contacted all the appropriate local authorities, including Mayor T. D. Evans, the sheriff, and the police chief. Meanwhile, his troops paused to eat breakfast. Barrett summoned reinforcements from several other Oklahoma cities. Barrett declared martial law at 11:49 a.m., and by noon the troops had managed to suppress most of the remaining violence.

Thousands of black residents had fled the city; another 4,000 people had been rounded up and detained at various centers. Under martial law, the detainees were required to carry identification cards. As many as 6,000 Greenwood residents were interned at three local facilities: Convention Hall (now known as the Tulsa Theater), the Tulsa County Fairgrounds (then located about a mile northeast of Greenwood) and McNulty Park (a baseball stadium at Tenth Street and Elgin Avenue).

A 1921 letter from an officer of the Service Company, Third Infantry, Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived on May 31, 1921, reported numerous events related to the suppression of the riot:
* taking about 30–40 black residents into custody;
* putting a machine gun on a truck and taking it on patrol, although it was not functioning and much less useful than &quot;an ordinary rifle&quot;;
* being fired on by black snipers from the &quot;church&quot; and returning fire;
* being fired on by white men;
* turning the prisoners over to deputies to take them to police headquarters;
* being fired upon again by armed black residents and having two NCOs slightly wounded;
* searching for black snipers and firearms;
* detailing an NCO to take 170 black residents to the civil authorities; and
* delivering an additional 150 black residents to the Convention Hall.
Captain John W. McCune reported that stockpiled ammunition within the burning structures began to explode, which might have further contributed to casualties. Martial law was withdrawn on June 4, under Field Order No. 7.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
The massacre was covered by national newspapers, and the reported number of deaths varies widely. On June 1, 1921, the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; reported that nine white people and 68 black people had died in the riot, but shortly afterwards it changed that number to a total of 176 dead. The next day, the same paper reported the count as nine white people and 21 black people. The &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; headline said &quot;175 Killed, Many Wounded&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that 77 people had been killed, including 68 black people, but it later lowered the total to 33. The &quot;Richmond Times Dispatch&quot; of Virginia reported that 85 people (including 25 white people) were killed; it also reported that the police chief had reported to Governor Robertson that the total was 75; and that a police major put the figure at 175. The Oklahoma Department of Vital Statistics put the number of deaths at 36 (26 black and 10 white). Very few people, if any, died as a direct result of the fire. Official state records show five deaths by conflagration for the entire state in 1921.

Walter Francis White of the NAACP traveled to Tulsa from New York and reported that, although officials and undertakers said that the fatalities numbered 10 white and 21 black, he estimated the number of the dead to be 50 whites and between 150 and 200 blacks; he also reported that 10 white men were killed on Tuesday; six white men drove into the black section and never came out, and 13 whites were killed on Wednesday; he reported that Major O.T. Johnson of the Salvation Army in Tulsa, said that 37 blacks were employed as gravediggers to bury 120 blacks in individual graves without coffins on Friday and Saturday. The Oklahoma Commission described Johnson&#x27;s statement being that his crew was over three dozen grave diggers who dug &quot;about&quot; 150 graves. Ground-penetrating radar was used to investigate the sites purported to contain these mass graves. Multiple eyewitness reports and &quot;oral histories&quot; suggested the graves could have been dug at three different cemeteries across the city. The sites were examined, and no evidence of ground disturbance indicative of mass graves was found. However, at one site, the ground disturbance was found in a five-meter square area, but cemetery records indicate that three graves had been dug and bodies buried within this envelope before the riot.

Oklahoma&#x27;s 2001 Commission into the riot provides multiple contradicting estimates. Goble estimates 100–300 deaths, and Franklin and Ellsworth estimate 75–100 deaths and describe some of the higher estimates as dubious as the low estimates. C. Snow was able to confirm 39 casualties, all listed as male although four were unidentifiable; 26 were black and 13 were white. The 13 white fatalities were all taken to hospitals. Eleven of them had come from outside of Oklahoma, and possibly as many as half were petroleum industry workers. Only eight of the confirmed 26 black fatalities were brought to hospitals, and as hospitals were segregated, and with the black Frissell Memorial Hospital having burned down, the only place where the injured blacks were treated was at the basement of Morningside Hospital. Several hundred were injured.

The Red Cross, in their preliminary overview, mentioned wide-ranging external estimates of 55 to 300 dead; however, because of the hurried nature of undocumented burials, they declined to submit an official estimate, stating, &quot;The number of dead is a matter of conjecture.&quot; The Red Cross registered 8,624 persons; 183 people were hospitalized, mostly for gunshot wounds or burns (they are differentiated in their records on the basis of triage category not the type of wound), while a further 531 required first aid or surgical treatment; eight miscarriages were attributed to be a result of the tragedy; 19 died in care between June 1 and December 30, 1921.

The nearly 10,000 people in Greenwood who were affected relied, in large part, on the relief efforts of the Red Cross. Important for the future survival of this district, they worked to create &quot;a large-scale plan in order to provide security, food, shelter, job training and placement, health coverage, and legal support for all of them [the survivors].&quot; The Red Cross was working in the aftermath of a tragedy, the victims of which &quot;had all the characteristics of prisoners of war: homeless and helpless, abandoned by their home country, confined in specific areas, denied basic human rights, treated without respect and deprived of their possessions&quot;. In less than a year of being in Tulsa, the Red Cross had set up a hospital for black patients, which was the first in Oklahoma&#x27;s history; performed mass vaccinations for illnesses that could have been easily spread in the camps where survivors found themselves, as well as built infrastructure to provide fresh water, adequate food, and sufficient housing for those who no longer had a place of residence.


===Property losses===
The commercial section of Greenwood was destroyed. Losses included 191 businesses, a junior high school, several churches, and the only hospital in the district. The Red Cross reported that 1,256 houses were burned and another 215 were looted but not burned. The Tulsa Real Estate Exchange estimated property losses amounted to US$1.5 million in real estate and $750,000 in personal property (equivalent to a total of $ million in ).

The Red Cross report in December 1921 estimated that 10,000 people were made homeless by the destruction. Over the next year, local citizens filed more than US$1.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in riot-related claims against the city.

===Identities of the African American victims===
On June 3, the &quot;Morning Tulsa Daily World&quot; reported major points of their interview with Deputy Sheriff Barney Cleaver concerning the events leading up to the Tulsa riot. Cleaver was a deputy sheriff for Okmulgee County and not under the supervision of the city police department; his duties mainly involved enforcing the law among the &quot;colored people&quot; of Greenwood, but he also operated a business as a private investigator. He had previously been dismissed as a city police investigator for assisting county officers with a drug raid at Gurley&#x27;s Hotel but not reporting his involvement to his superiors. He had considerable land holdings and suffered tremendous financial damages as a result of the riot. Among his holdings were several residential properties and Cleaver Hall, a large community gathering place and function hall. He reported personally evicting a number of armed criminals who had taken to barricading themselves within properties he owned. Upon eviction, they merely moved to Cleaver Hall. Cleaver reported that the majority of violence started at Cleaver Hall along with the rioters barricaded inside. Charles Page offered to build him a new home.

The &quot;Morning Tulsa Daily World&quot; stated, &quot;Cleaver named Will Robinson, a dope peddler and all-around bad negro, as the leader of the armed blacks. He has also the names of three others who were in the armed gang at the courthouse. The rest of the negroes participating in the fight, he says, were former servicemen who had an exaggerated idea of their own importance... They did not belong here, had no regular employment, and were simply a floating element with seemingly no ambition in life but to foment trouble.&quot; O.W. Gurley, owner of Gurley&#x27;s Hotel, identified the following men by name as arming themselves and gathering in his hotel: Will Robinson, Peg Leg Taylor, Bud Bassett, Henry Van Dyke, Chester Ross, Jake Mayes, O. B. Mann, John Suplesox, Fatty, Jack Scott, Lee Mable, John Bowman and W. S. Weaver.

===Public Safety Committee===
By June 6, the Associated Press reported that a citizens&#x27; Public Safety Committee had been established, made up of 250 white men who vowed to protect the city and put down any more disturbance. A white man was shot and killed that day after he failed to stop as ordered by a National Guardsman.

===Rebuilding===
Governor James B. A. Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff&#x27;s Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.

State Attorney General Sargent Prentiss Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot. A total of 27 cases were brought before the court, and the jury indicted more than 85 individuals. In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.

On June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge Loyal J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group. He said at the mass meeting:

Many black families spent the winter of 1921–1922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of &#x27;destitute blacks&#x27;.

A group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee, which first sought to rezone the &quot;burned area&quot; as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee, which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.

===Tulsa Union Depot===
Despite the Red Cross&#x27;s best efforts to assist with the reconstruction of Greenwood&#x27;s residential area, the considerably altered present-day layout of the district and its surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the extensive redevelopment of Greenwood by people unaffiliated with the neighborhood prior to the riot, stand as proof that the Red Cross relief efforts had limited success.

Tulsa&#x27;s main industries at the time of the riot were banking (BOK Financial Corporation), administrative (PennWell, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company), and petroleum engineering services (Skelly Oil), earning Tulsa the title of &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot;. Joshua Cosden is also regarded as a founder of the city, having constructed the tallest building in Tulsa, the Cosden Building. The construction of the Cosden Building and Union Depot was overseen by the Manhattan Construction Company, which was based in Tulsa. Francis Rooney is the great-grandson and beneficiary of the estate of Laurence H. Rooney, founder of the Manhattan Construction Company.

City planners immediately saw the fire that destroyed homes and businesses across Greenwood as a fortunate event for advancing their objectives, meanwhile showing a disregard for the welfare of affected residents. Plans were made to rezone &#x27;The Burned Area&#x27; for industrial use. The &quot;Tulsa Daily World&quot; reported that the mayor and city commissioners expressed that, &quot;a large industrial section will be found desirable in causing a wider separation between negroes and whites.&quot; The reconstruction committee organized a forum to discuss their proposal with community leaders and stakeholders. Naming, among others, O.W. Gurley, Rev. H.T.F. Johnson, and Barney Cleaver as participants in the forum, it was reported that all members were in agreement with the plan to redevelop the burned district as an industrial section and agreed that the proposed union station project was desirable. &quot;...not a note of dissension was expressed.&quot; The article states that these community leaders would again meet at the First Baptist Church in the following days. &quot;The Black Dispatch&quot; describes the content of the following meeting at the First Baptist Church. The reconstruction committee had intended to have the black landholders sign over their property to a holding company managed by black representatives on behalf of the city. The properties were then to be turned over to a white appraisal committee, which would pay residents for the residentially zoned land at the lower industrial zoned value in advance of the rezoning. Professor J.W. Hughes addressed the white reconstruction committee members in opposition to their proposition, coining a slogan that would come to galvanize the community, &quot;I&#x27;m going to hold what I have until I get What I&#x27;ve lost.&quot;

Construction of the Tulsa Union Depot, a large central rail hub connecting three major railroads, began in Greenwood less than two years after the riot. Prior to the riot, construction had already been underway for a smaller rail hub nearby. However, in the aftermath of the riot, land on which homes and businesses had been destroyed by the fires suddenly became available, allowing for a larger train depot near the heart of the city to be built in Greenwood instead.

===1921 grand jury investigation===

====Allegations of corruption====
The Tulsa Police Department, in the words of Chief Chuck Jordan, &quot;did not do their job then, y&#x27;know, they just didn&#x27;t&quot;. Parrish, an African-American citizen of Tulsa, summarized the lawlessness in Oklahoma as a contributing factor in 1922 as, &quot;if ... it were not for the profitable alliance of politics and vice or professional crime, the tiny spark which is the beginning of all these outrages would be promptly extinguished.&quot; Clark, a prominent Oklahoma historian and law professor, completed his doctoral dissertation in law on the subject of lawlessness in Oklahoma specifically on this period of time and how lawlessness had led to the rise of the second KKK, in order to illustrate the need for effective law enforcement and a functional judiciary.

====John A. Gustafson====
Chief of Police John A. Gustafson was the subject of an investigation. Official proceedings began on June 6, 1921. He was prosecuted on multiple counts: refusing to enforce prohibition, refusing to enforce anti-prostitution laws; operating a stolen automobile-laundering racket and allowing known automobile thieves to escape justice, for the purpose of extorting the citizens of Tulsa for rewards relating to their return; repurposing vehicles for his own use or sale; operating a fake detective agency for the purpose of billing the city of Tulsa for investigative duties he was already being paid for as chief of police; failing to enforce gun laws; and failure to take action during the riots.

The attorney general of Oklahoma received numerous letters alleging members of the police force had conspired with members of the justice system to threaten witnesses in corruption trials stemming from the Grand Jury investigations. In the letters, various members of the public requested the presence of the state attorney general at the trial. An assistant of the attorney general replied to one such letter by stating that their budget was too stretched to respond and recommending instead that the citizens of Tulsa simply vote for new officers.

Gustafson was found to have a long history of fraud pre-dating his membership in the Tulsa Police Department. His previous partner in his detective agency, Phil Kirk, had been convicted of blackmail. Gustafson&#x27;s fake detective agency ran up high billings on the police account. Investigators noted that many blackmail letters had been sent to members of the community from the agency. One particularly disturbing case involved the frequent rape, by her father, of an 11-year-old girl who had since become pregnant. Instead of prosecuting, they sent a &quot;Blackhand letter&quot;. On July 30, 1921, out of five counts of an indictment, Gustafson was found guilty of two counts: negligence for failing to stop the riot (which resulted in dismissal from police force), and conspiracy for freeing automobile thieves and collecting rewards (which resulted in a jail sentence).

===Breaking the silence===
Three days after the massacre, President Warren G. Harding spoke at the all-black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. He declared, &quot;Despite the demagogues, the idea of our oneness as Americans has risen superior to every appeal to mere class and group. And so, I wish it might be in this matter of our national problem of races.&quot; Speaking directly about the events in Tulsa, he said, &quot;God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it.&quot;

There were no convictions for any of the charges related to violence. There were decades of silence about the terror, violence, and losses of this event. The riot was largely omitted from local, state, and national histories: &quot;The Tulsa race riot of 1921 was rarely mentioned in history books, classrooms, or even in private. Black and white people alike grew into middle age, unaware of what had taken place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011/06/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was not recognized in the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; feature of &quot;Fifteen Years Ago Today&quot; or &quot;Twenty-five Years Ago Today&quot;. A 2017 report detailing the history of the Tulsa Fire Department from 1897 until the date of publication makes no mention of the 1921 massacre.

Several people tried to document the events, gather photographs, and record the names of the dead and injured. Mary Elizabeth Jones Parrish, a young black teacher and journalist from Rochester, New York, was hired by the Inter-racial Commission to write an account of the riot. Parrish was a survivor, and she wrote about her experiences, collected other accounts, gathered photographs and compiled &quot;a partial roster of property losses in the African American community&quot;. She published these in &quot;Events of the Tulsa Disaster&quot;, in 1922. It was the first book to be published about the riot. The first academic account was a master&#x27;s thesis written in 1946 by Loren L. Gill, a veteran of World War II, but the thesis did not circulate beyond the University of Tulsa.

In 1971, a small group of survivors gathered for a memorial service at Mount Zion Baptist Church with black and white people in attendance. That same year, the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce decided to commemorate the riot, but when they read the accounts and saw photos gathered by Ed Wheeler, host of a radio history program, detailing the specifics of the riot, they refused to publish them. He then took his information to the two major newspapers in Tulsa, both of which also refused to run his story. His article, &quot;Profile of a Race Riot&quot; was published in &quot;Impact Magazine&quot;, a publication aimed at black audiences, but most of Tulsa&#x27;s white residents never knew about it.

In the early 1970s, along with Henry C. Whitlow, Jr., a history teacher at Booker T. Washington High School, Mozella Franklin Jones helped to desegregate the Tulsa Historical Society by mounting the first major exhibition on the history of African Americans in Tulsa. Jones also created, at the Tulsa Historical Society, the first collection of massacre photographs available to the public. While researching and sharing the history of the riot, Jones collaborated with a white woman named Ruth Sigler Avery, who was also trying to publicize accounts of the riot. The two women, however, encountered pressure, particularly among whites, to keep silent.

==Survivors==
The Tulsa massacre claimed an estimated 150–300 lives; over 800 people were seriously injured, and many more are estimated to have had their lives drastically changed forever.

===Olivia Hooker ===
Olivia Hooker was born on February 12, 1915, in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Her family was one of the many families affected by the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 when she was only six years old. Her family&#x27;s home in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma was broken into by a group of white men with torches and was torn apart. Many of her family&#x27;s belongings were destroyed. One item that Hooker recalled was her sister&#x27;s piano. She remembered hearing a group of white men whacking into the piano as she and her four other siblings hid under the dining room table, which their mother covered with a tablecloth. Her father owned a store in Tulsa, which she recalled was absolutely destroyed and only one safe was left standing. The only reason it was left standing was that it was too big and heavy to be destroyed or stolen. Hooker also remembered vividly her schoolhouse being destroyed and blown up with dynamite. After the massacre, Hooker and her family moved to Topeka, Kansas to rebuild their lives. Hooker recalled her mother telling her, &quot;don&#x27;t spend your time agonizing over the past.&quot; With a new fresh start in Topeka, Kansas, Hooker was the first African American woman to join the Coast Guard (in February 1945). After leaving the Coast Guard, Hooker went on to earn her Master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Teacher&#x27;s College, Columbia University. She earned her doctorate in clinical psychology at the University of Rochester. Hooker went on to have multiple jobs with her degree in psychology, mostly basing her work on the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. Olivia Hooker retired from work at the age of 87. She died at the age of 103 on November 21, 2018 in her home in New York.

===Eldoris McCondichie===
Eldoris McCondichie was born on September 1, 1911, in Tyler, Texas. She was four years old when she and her family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the Greenwood district. Her family was part of the working class. Her father had worked in a field and her mother did housework. On May 31, 1921, McCondichie was nine years old. She remembered being frantically awakened by her mother. She remembered her mother saying, &quot;the white people are killing the colored people.&quot; McCondichie and her family evacuated their Tulsa home to find refuge up north from the massacre. McCondichie described how &quot;airplanes were raining down bullets&quot;, and how no one had enough time to even put clothes on and evacuate their homes. She recalled seeing women walking on the railroad track with no shoes in their nightgowns. She remembered finding shelter in a chicken coop during the riots to protect herself from machine gun fire. After McCondichie and her family evacuated Tulsa, they found refuge in a farmer&#x27;s home overnight. Her family traveled to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, where they stayed for about 2–3 days until they knew it was safe to return home. Upon returning to Tulsa, Eldoris described what was left of the Greenwood district as &quot;war-torn&quot;. She recalled many businesses and homes were burnt to the ground. Her family slowly rebuilt their lives in Tulsa and never left, referring to it as their &quot;forever home&quot;. Eldoris was married to Arthur McCodichie for 67 years and had four children; two sons and two daughters. She died on September 12, 2010, several days after celebrating her 99th birthday. Her final resting place is in the Crownhill Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

===George Monroe===
George Monroe was five years old during the attack on the Greenwood district. He claimed some images could never leave his mind. He remembered seeing people getting shot and his own curtains being set on fire by a mob of white men. He also recalled hiding under a bed with his older sister, when a rioter stepped on his finger, causing his sister to throw her hand over his mouth to prevent the men from hearing his screams. George Monroe lived out the rest of his life in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He became a musician, owner of a Tulsa nightclub, and the first black man in Tulsa to sell Coca-Cola. George Monroe died in 2001.

===Mary E. Jones Parrish===

Mary Elizabeth Jones Parrish (1892–1972) was born in 1892 in Yazoo City, Mississippi. She moved to Tulsa around 1919 and worked teaching typing and shorthand at a branch of the YMCA. Parrish was reading in her home when the Tulsa race massacre began on the evening of May 31, 1921. Parrish&#x27;s daughter, Florence Mary, called the young journalist and teacher to the window. &quot;Mother,&quot; she said, &quot;I see men with guns.&quot; The two eventually fled into the night under a hail of bullets. Mary Parrish wrote a first-person account and collected eye-witness statements from dozens of others and published them immediately following the tragedy under the title &quot;The Events of the Tulsa Disaster&quot;. Parrish documented the magnitude of the loss of human life and property at the hands of white vigilantes. Parrish hoped that her book would &quot;open the eyes of the thinking people to the impending danger of letting such conditions exist and in the &#x27;Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.&#x27; A new edition was published in 2021 by Trinity University Press under the title, &quot;The Nation Must Awake: My Witness to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921. &quot;The new edition includes a new afterword by Anneliese M. Bruner, Parrish&#x27;s great-granddaughter. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Parrish&#x27;s &quot;a story of survival... remains relevant a century later&quot; while &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;The first and most visceral long-form account of how Greenwood residents experienced the massacre.&quot;

===Lessie Benningfield (&quot;Mother Randle&quot;)===
Lessie Benningfield, also known as Mother Randle, was born in Morris, Oklahoma on November 10, 1914. Her parents were farmers; she had three sisters and a brother. Benningfield does not recall much due to her young age during the massacre. She remembers a mob of white men barging into her home and then destroying her family&#x27;s house. She has memories of feelings of intense fear while trying to evacuate her home and get somewhere safe with her family. She spent the rest of her childhood and young adulthood in Tulsa and graduated from Booker T. Washington High School. Benningfield is now a part of an active lawsuit with the Greenwood Advocates, which is a team of human and civil rights lawyers fighting for justice for victims and their families. Benningfield states she still has nightmares of seeing the piles of dead bodies she saw during the massacre. For her 106th birthday, which took place in 2020, the community raised thousands of dollars for her to remodel her home. Since then, she has been interviewed several times and remained in the public eye during the 2021 centennial anniversary of the massacre at the age of 107.

===Hal Singer===
Hal Singer was born on October 8, 1919, in Tulsa, Oklahoma to two working-class parents. His mother worked in a wealthy white resident&#x27;s home as a cook and his father worked producing oil rigging tools. Singer was 18 months old when the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 took place. A white woman, for whom his mother worked, put his family on a train to Kansas City during the massacre so the Singer family would have a safe place to wait it out. Up to the day of his passing, Singer recalled how forever grateful he was for the woman&#x27;s kindness. When his family returned to their home, it was burnt to the ground. They had to rebuild their whole lives again from scratch. However, they stayed in Tulsa in the Greenwood district all through his childhood. As a young boy, Singer hung out by the rail tracks and invited jazz bands to come over and have some of his mother&#x27;s cooking. This helped him in the long run as he became an iconic saxophonist of his generation. Singer went on to play with and for Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, and Billie Holiday. He was married for over 50 years to his wife Arlette Singer. On August 18, 2020, just months before his 101st birthday, he died in Chatou, a suburb of Paris, France.

===Essie Lee Johnson Beck===
Essie Johnson (1916–2006) was five years old when the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 took place. Her family evacuated their Tulsa home in the early hours of May 31. Beck remembers her parents making her and her siblings stay away from the windows because there were active shooters targeting the windows of homes. She describes the feelings of fright and confusion. Her family had to evacuate their home since almost all homes were being burnt to the ground in her neighborhood. Her mother took Beck and her four other siblings and started running to find shelter elsewhere. Beck recalls watching airplanes above her dropping bombs onto the roof of houses causing them to catch on fire. Her mother was trying to get her and her siblings to Golden Gate Park. Beck&#x27;s father stayed behind to help as much as possible and to assist injured people. Beck recalls once they got to Golden Gate Park, they hid behind trees. Beck and her family soon after that found shelter in churches and school basements for the remaining days. Once they were cleared to go back, their home was burnt to the ground. Beck recalls having to live in a tent on the dirt waiting for their house to be rebuilt. She describes the whole experience to be awful.

===Vernice Simms===
Vernice Simms was seventeen years old when the Massacre took place. She lived in the Greenwood district with her family as she attended Booker T. Washington High School, where she was preparing for her prom. Simms remembers vividly being in her backyard when bullets started raining down and everyone was cautioned to get into the house as quickly as possible. As the riots and massacre progressed, Simms and her family found refuge at a white family&#x27;s home, where they were safe from the massacre. When they returned to their Greenwood home, everything was burnt to the ground. Simms and her family had to live in a tent. She recalls Booker T. Washington High School being turned into a hospital for the wounded. Simms volunteered at the hospital where she fed and gave water to people who were injured during the massacre. While her house was being rebuilt by her father, she finished high school in Oklahoma City. Afterward, Simms studied at Langston University. After she graduated from university, she came home to see her house finally rebuilt. She recalls never getting any money from insurance or the government to help. Simms described the events as devastating and scary.

===Lena Eloise Taylor Butler===
Eloise Taylor was nineteen years old and she lived in Greenwood when the Massacre took place. She was the daughter of the famed Horace Greeley Beecher Taylor, better known as &quot;Peg Leg&quot; Taylor. According to Taylor&#x27;s great-granddaughter, who has passed on Eloise&#x27;s story, Eloise witnessed some of the first gunfighting of the Massacre. She recounts how Peg Leg Taylor &quot;fought his way to&quot; Eloise and helped her escape into the woods north of the city, where they then lay and hid while White rioters continued to hunt down and kill other survivors around them. &quot;...they found some of the people that were out there in the woods laying on their stomach—Lord help these people!—and they just shot &#x27;em. Right there on the ground where they lay. I&#x27;m talking about kids...women. They didn&#x27;t care. Old people. People who had breastfed them. They didn&#x27;t give a damn. They killed &#x27;em right there on the ground...&quot; Eloise was reportedly so terrified that when &quot;...finally her daddy told her to &#x27;get up...get up and c&#x27;mon,&#x27; she said [in order] for them to move, he had to hurt her. She said he had to hurt her to make her stand up.&quot; Eloise and her father then walked several miles to a nearby town, where they &quot;got help, got warm, got clothes, got food, and moved on&quot;, and where they also &quot;decided that they would never talk about it again&quot;. Eloise finally opened up to her great-granddaughters about her experience in 1997, only a few short years before she died in 2000 at the age of 98.

==Tulsa Race Massacre Commission==
In 1996, as the riot&#x27;s 75th anniversary neared, the state legislature authorized an Oklahoma Commission to investigate the Tulsa Race Riot, by appointing individuals to study and prepare a report detailing a historical account of the riot. Authorization of the study &quot;enjoyed strong support from members of both political parties and all political persuasions&quot;. The commission had originally been called the &quot;Tulsa Race Riot Commission&quot;, but in November 2018, the name was changed to &quot;Tulsa Race Massacre Commission&quot;. The commission conducted interviews and heard testimony in order to thoroughly document the causes and damages.

The commission delivered its final report on February 21, 2001. The report recommended actions for substantial restitution to the black residents, listed below in order of priority:

==Post-commission actions==

===Search for mass graves===
The Tulsa Race Massacre Commission arranged for archaeological, non-invasive ground surveys of Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and Booker T. Washington Cemetery, which were identified as possible locations for mass graves of black victims of the violence. Oral histories, other sources and timing suggested that whites would have buried blacks at the first two locations; black people were said to have buried black victims at the third location after the riot was over. The people who were buried at Washington Cemetery, which is reserved for black people, were probably thought to be those victims who had died of their wounds after the riot had ended, since it was the most distant suspected burial location from downtown.

Investigations of the three potential mass grave sites were performed in 1997 and 1998. Even though the total area of all three of these locations could not be surveyed, preliminary data suggested that they contained no mass graves. In 1999, an eyewitness who had seen whites burying black victims at Oaklawn Cemetery was found. A team investigated the potential area with more equipment. In the end, searches for mass graves were made with the aid of technology that included ground-penetrating radar, followed by core sampling. The experts&#x27; report, presented to the Commission in December 2000, could not substantiate claims of mass graves in Oaklawn Cemetery, Washington Cemetery, or Newblock Park. A promising spot in Washington Cemetery had turned out to be a layer of clay, and another promising spot in Newblock Park had turned out to be an old basement. The suggestion that the bodies had been burned in the city incinerator was also considered unfeasible and discounted, given the incinerator&#x27;s capacity and logistical considerations.

In preparation for the 100th anniversary of the massacre, state archaeologists, using ground-penetrating radar, probed Oaklawn Cemetery for &quot;long-rumored&quot; mass graves. Mayor G. T. Bynum calls it &quot;a murder investigation&quot;. After input from the public, officials from the Oklahoma Archeological Survey used three subsurface scanning techniques to survey Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and an area known as The Canes along the Arkansas River. The Oklahoma Archeological Survey subsequently announced that they were discontinuing search efforts at Newblock Park after not finding any evidence of graves. On December 17, 2019, the team of forensic archaeologists announced that they had found anomalies consistent with that of human-dug pits beneath the ground at Oaklawn Cemetery and the ground where the Interstate 244 bridge crosses the Arkansas River. They announced that the anomalies are likely candidates for mass graves, but further radar surveys and physical excavations of the sites are needed. Researchers secured permission to perform &quot;limited excavations&quot; from the city and as a result, they will be able to determine what the contents of these sites are, beginning in April 2020, and while they do not expect to dig up any human remains, they asserted that if they find any human remains in the course of their excavations, they will treat them with the proper respect. An initial dig at a suspected area of the Oaklawn Cemetery in July 2020 found no human remains.

On October 21, 2020, a forensic team said that it had unearthed 11 coffins in Oaklawn Cemetery; records and research suggested that as many as 18 victims would be found. The forensic team will need to do more work in order to determine if the coffins contain the remains of massacre victims. As stated by Kary Stackelbeck, a state archaeologist, the remains will not be moved until they can be properly exhumed because their deterioration needs to be prevented. She also stated that the site where the remains were discovered &quot;constitutes a mass grave... We have a high degree of confidence that this is one of the locations we were looking for. But we have to remain cautious because we have not done anything to expose the human remains beyond those that have been encountered.&quot; The team planned to exhume the remains in June 2021. Forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield later planned to analyze the remains in order to determine if they are the remains of people who were killed in the 1921 massacre. In June 2021, after scientists resumed work at the site, 35 coffins were recovered from the mass grave. The remains of 19 people were taken to an on-site science lab. Officials stated that they have completed a preliminary analysis of nine of those human remains.

Stackelbeck announced in September 2023 a completed survey identified 59 gravesites, 57 of which were previously undiscovered. Seven sets of remains were recovered, each found in simple wooden boxes. C. L. Daniel was the first victim identified in July 2024 from the remains exhumed. He was a World War I veteran from Georgia who was a resident of Utah. By August 3, 2024, remains believed to be two additional victims of the riot were found. By August 16, 2024 the remains of eleven riot victims had been recovered from Oaklawn Cemetery

===Reconciliation===
In March 2001, each of the 118 known survivors of the riot still alive at the time, the youngest of whom was 85, was given a gold-plated medal bearing the state seal, as had been approved by bi-partisan state leaders. The Tulsa Reparations Coalition, sponsored by the Center for Racial Justice, Inc., was formed on April 7, 2001, to obtain restitution for the damages suffered by Tulsa&#x27;s black community, as recommended by the Oklahoma Commission.

On June 1, 2001, Governor Frank Keating signed the &quot;1921 Tulsa Race Riot Reconciliation Act&quot; into law. The act acknowledged that the event occurred but failed to deliver any substantial reparations to the victims or their descendants. In spite of the commission&#x27;s recommendation for reparations in their report on the riot, the Oklahoma state legislature did not agree that reparations were appropriate and thus did not include them in the reconciliation act. The act provided for the following:
* More than 300 college scholarships for descendants of Greenwood residents;
* Creation of a memorial to those who died in the riot. A park with statues was dedicated as John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park on October 27, 2010, named in honor of the notable African-American historian from Tulsa; and
* Economic development in Greenwood.

===Survivors&#x27; lawsuit===
Five survivors, represented by a legal team that included Johnnie Cochran and Charles Ogletree, filed suit against the city of Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma (&quot;Alexander, et al. v. Oklahoma, et al.&quot;) in February 2003, based on the findings of the 2001 report. Ogletree said the state and city should compensate the victims and their families &quot;to honor their admitted obligations as detailed in the commission&#x27;s report&quot;. The federal district and appellate courts dismissed the suit on the grounds that a recommendation was not an &quot;admitted obligation&quot; and noting the statute of limitations had been exceeded on the 80-year-old case. The state requires that civil rights cases be filed within two years of the event. For that reason, the court did not rule on the issues. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal.

In April 2007, Ogletree appealed to the U.S. Congress to pass a bill extending the statute of limitations for the case, given the state and city&#x27;s accountability for the destruction and the long suppression of material about it. The bill was introduced by John Conyers of Michigan and heard by the Judiciary Committee of the House but it did not pass, because of concerns about ex post facto legislation.

===John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park===

A park was developed in 2010 in the Greenwood area as a memorial to victims of the riot. In October 2010, the park was named for noted historian John Hope Franklin, who was born and raised in Tulsa. He became known as a historian of the South. The park includes three statues of figures by sculptor Ed Dwight, representing &quot;Hostility&quot;, &quot;Humiliation&quot; and &quot;Hope&quot;.

===Renewed calls for restitution===
An extensive curriculum on the event was provided to Oklahoma school districts in 2020.

On May 29, 2020, the eve of the 99th anniversary of the event and the onset of the George Floyd protests, Human Rights Watch released a report titled &quot;The Case for Reparations in Tulsa, Oklahoma: A Human Rights Argument&quot;, demanding reparations for survivors and descendants of the violence because the economic impact of the massacre is still visible as illustrated by the high poverty rates and lower life expectancies in north Tulsa. Several documentary projects were also announced at this time with plans to release them on the 100th anniversary of the event, including &quot;Black Wall Street&quot; by Dream Hampton, and another documentary by Salima Koroma.

In September 2020, a 105-year old survivor of the massacre, Viola Fletcher, filed a lawsuit with two other survivors against the city for reparations caused by damages to the city&#x27;s black businesses.

In 2021, Oklahoma librarians persuaded the Library of Congress to change the official subject headings, which place limits on the terms that people are allowed to use whenever they conduct searches for some of the information, for the event from &quot;riot&quot; to &quot;massacre&quot;.

On May 19, 2021, survivors Fletcher, then 107; her 100-year-old brother, Hughes Van Ellis; and 106-year old Lessie Benningfield Randle testified about their experiences during the massacre and their reparations lawsuit before a House Judiciary subcommittee. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in July 2023, but in November 2023, their lawyers appealed that decision to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

On June 12, 2024 the Oklahoma Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit, effectively concluding the suit. The Court dismissed the lawsuit stating that although the grievances submitted by the plaintiffs were legitimate, they concluded that Oklahoma&#x27;s public nuisance statute did not apply to them. Their testimony of the three survivors coincided with pending resolutions before the U.S. House and Senate Judiciary Committees that propose federal recognition of the centennial of the massacre on May 31 and June 1.

In September 2024, the Department of Justice opened a federal review of the massacre under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. The report was released on January 10, 2025, which found that &quot;the massacre was the result not of uncontrolled mob violence, but of a coordinated, military-style attack on Greenwood&quot;.

Tulsa&#x27;s ongoing Beyond Apology Commission is tasked with improving economic mobility and the building of inter-generational wealth for survivors of the massacre and was reported by the New York Times to be planning new housing benefits in January 2025.

=== House Bill 1775 ===

In 2021, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed Oklahoma House Bill 1775 into law. The bill is typically referred to as a ban on critical race theory. The bill has created confusion for educators regarding classroom content about the Tulsa race massacre. When asked about the impact of the bill on instruction around the massacre, State School Superintendent Ryan Walters said, &quot;I’d say you’d be judgmental of the issue of the action, of the content of the character of the individual, but let’s not tie it to the skin color and say that the skin color determined that.&quot; In response to criticism of his remarks, Walters said that he was &quot;referring to individuals who carried out the crime … They had evil, racist intentions and murdered people … They didn’t act that way because they were white, they acted that way because they were racist&quot;, and that students &quot;should be able to learn that history&quot;. Walters&#x27; confusing responses illustrate the ambiguity of the bill&#x27;s language resulting in concerns for educators as the stakes are high for violating the statute. The future of education on this topic remains unclear, as the bill is facing several legal challenges. 

==President Biden&#x27;s 2021 visit==
On June 1, 2021, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, President Joe Biden visited the area, the first sitting president to do so, and during his visit, he made a speech in which he stated, &quot;Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try.&quot; Biden toured the Greenwood Cultural Center and met with survivors Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis, and Lessie Benningfield Randle.

==Tulsa Historical Society and Museum==
The Tulsa Historical Society and Museum offer a virtual exhibit of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 that is open at all times during the day and is free of charge to the public. This online exhibit offers many photos, audio recordings, documents, and resources that cannot be found anywhere else. It also offers a traveling exhibit consisting of 4 panels regarding the Tulsa Race Massacre that are allowed to travel to locations within the Tulsa Metropolitan Area. The main goal of the panels is to educate the community.

==Present-day Black Wall Street==
Black Wall Street can still be found today under the Historical Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, it took about 10 years to rebuild the district. The historical Vernon AME Church is the only building standing today that is a part of the last remaining structure of the 1921 massacre.

The residents of the Greenwood district try to keep the memory of the Tulsa Race Massacre prominent within the community. Today, many memorials stand out of respect for the memory of what was once Black Wall Street. Many investigations are still underway in the Greenwood District in the hope that more unmarked graves can be found and more victims of the Massacre can be identified.

Amusan (who serves as the President of the African Ancestral Society), Robinson asks, &quot;What is the most reasonable estimate of how many people died?&quot; Amusan replies, &quot;You&#x27;re looking at 4,000 people that you cannot account for.&quot;

<text>The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is a species of reptile endemic to New Zealand. Despite its close resemblance to lizards, it is actually the only extant member of a distinct lineage, the previously highly diverse order Rhynchocephalia. The name is derived from the Māori language and means &quot;peaks on the back&quot;.

The single extant species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which was highly diverse during the Mesozoic era. Rhynchocephalians first appeared in the fossil record during the Triassic, around 240 million years ago, and reached worldwide distribution and peak diversity during the Jurassic, when they represented the world&#x27;s dominant group of small reptiles. Rhynchocephalians declined during the Cretaceous, with their youngest records outside New Zealand dating to the Paleocene. Their closest living relatives are squamates (lizards and snakes). Tuatara are of interest for studying the evolution of reptiles.

Tuatara are greenish brown and grey, and measure up to from head to tail-tip and weigh up to with a spiny crest along the back, especially pronounced in males. They have two rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlapping one row on the lower jaw, which is unique among living species. They are able to hear, although no external ear is present, and have unique features in their skeleton.

Tuatara are sometimes referred to as &quot;living fossils&quot;. This term is currently deprecated among paleontologists and evolutionary biologists. Although tuatara have preserved the morphological characteristics of their Mesozoic ancestors (240–230 million years ago), there is no evidence of a continuous fossil record to support the idea that the species has survived unchanged since that time. 

The species has between five and six billion base pairs of DNA sequence, nearly twice that of humans.

The tuatara has been protected by law since 1895. Tuatara, like many of New Zealand&#x27;s native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, such as the Polynesian rat &quot;(Rattus exulans)&quot;. Tuatara were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, until the first North Island release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Wildlife Sanctuary (now named &quot;Zealandia&quot;) in 2005. During routine maintenance work at Zealandia in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This is thought to be the first case of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island in over 200 years.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Relationships of the tuatara to other living reptiles and birds, after Simões et al. 2022
Tuatara, along with other now-extinct members of the order Rhynchocephalia, belong to the superorder Lepidosauria, as do the order Squamata, which includes lizards and snakes. Squamates and tuatara both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits.

Tuatara were originally classified as lizards in 1831 when the British Museum received a skull. John Edward Gray used the name &quot;Sphenodon&quot; to describe the skull; this remains the current scientific name for the genus. &quot;Sphenodon&quot; is derived from the Greek for &quot;wedge&quot; (σφήν, σφηνός/&quot;sphenos&quot;) and &quot;tooth&quot; (ὀδούς, ὀδόντος/&quot;odontos&quot;). In 1842, Grey described a member of the species as &quot;Hatteria punctata&quot;, not realising that it and the skull he received in 1831 were both tuatara. 

The genus remained misclassified as a lizard until 1867, when Albert C. L. G. Günther of the British Museum noted features similar to birds, turtles, and crocodiles. He proposed the order Rhynchocephalia (meaning &quot;beak head&quot;) for the tuatara and its fossil relatives. Since 1869, &quot;Sphenodon punctatus&quot; (or the variation &quot;Sphenodon punctatum&quot; in some earlier sources) has been used as the scientific name for the species.

At one point, many disparate species were incorrectly referred to the Rhynchocephalia, resulting in what taxonomists call a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. Williston in 1925 proposed the Sphenodontia to include only tuatara and their closest fossil relatives. However, Rhynchocephalia is the older name and in widespread use today. Many scholars use Sphenodontia as a subset of Rhynchocephalia, including almost all members of Rhynchocephalia, apart from the most primitive representatives of the group.

The earliest rhynchocephalian, &quot;Wirtembergia&quot;, is known from the Middle Triassic of Germany, around 240 million years ago. During the Late Triassic, rhynchocephalians greatly diversified, going on to become the world&#x27;s dominant group of small reptiles during the Jurassic period, when the group was represented by a diversity of forms, including the aquatic pleurosaurs and the herbivorous eilenodontines. The earliest members of Sphenodontinae, the clade which includes the tuatara, are known from the Early Jurassic of North America. The earliest representatives of this group are already very similar to the modern tuatara. Rhynchocephalians declined during the Cretaceous period, possibly due to competition with mammals and lizards, with their youngest record outside of New Zealand being of &quot;Kawasphenodon&quot;, known from the Paleocene of Patagonia in South America.

A species of sphenodontine is known from the Miocene Saint Bathans fauna from Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. Whether it is referable to &quot;Sphenodon&quot; proper is not entirely clear, but it is likely to be closely related to tuatara. The ancestors of the tuatara were likely already present in New Zealand prior to its separation from Antarctica around 82–60 million years ago.

Cladogram of the position of the tuatara within Sphenodontia, after Simoes et al., 2022:

===Species===
While there is currently considered to be only one living species of tuatara, two species were previously identified: &quot;Sphenodon punctatus&quot;, or northern tuatara, and the much rarer &quot;Sphenodon guntheri&quot;, or Brothers Island tuatara, which is confined to North Brother Island in the Cook Strait. The specific name &quot;punctatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;spotted&quot;, and &quot;guntheri&quot; refers to German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther. A 2009 paper re-examined the genetic bases used to distinguish the two supposed species of tuatara, and concluded they represent only geographic variants, and only one species should be recognised. Consequently, the northern tuatara was re-classified as &quot;Sphenodon punctatus punctatus&quot; and the Brothers Island tuatara as &quot;Sphenodon punctatus guntheri&quot;. The Brothers Island tuatara has olive brown skin with yellowish patches, while the colour of the northern tuatara ranges from olive green through grey to dark pink or brick red, often mottled, and always with white spots. In addition, the Brothers Island tuatara is considerably smaller. However, individuals from Brothers Island could not be distinguished from other modern and fossil samples on the basis of jaw morphology. 

An extinct species of &quot;Sphenodon&quot; was identified in November 1885 by William Colenso, who was sent an incomplete subfossil specimen from a local coal mine. Colenso named the new species &quot;S. diversum&quot;. Fawcett and Smith (1970) consider it a synonym to the subspecies, based on a lack of distinction.

==Description==

Tuatara are the largest reptiles in New Zealand. Adult &quot;S. punctatus&quot; males measure in length and females . Tuatara are sexually dimorphic, males being larger. The San Diego Zoo even cites a length of up to . Males weigh up to , and females up to . Brothers Island tuatara are slightly smaller, weighing up to 660 g (1.3 lb).

Their lungs have a single chamber with no bronchi.

The tuatara&#x27;s greenish brown colour matches its environment, and can change over its lifetime. Tuatara shed their skin at least once per year as adults, and three or four times a year as juveniles. Tuatara sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a tuatara&#x27;s back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be stiffened for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female&#x27;s.

===Skull===

Unlike the vast majority of lizards, the tuatara has a complete lower temporal bar closing the lower temporal fenestra (an opening of the skull behind the eye socket), caused by the fusion of the quadrate/quadratojugal (which are fused into a single element in adult tuatara) and the jugal bones of the skull. This is similar to the condition found in primitive diapsid reptiles. However, because more primitive rhynchocephalians have an open lower temporal fenestra with an incomplete temporal bar, this is thought to be derived characteristic of the tuatara and other members of the clade Sphenodontinae, rather than a primitive trait retained from early diapsids. The complete bar is thought to stabilise the skull during biting.

The tip of the upper jaw is chisel- or beak-like and separated from the remainder of the jaw by a notch, this structure is formed from fused premaxillary teeth, and is also found in many other advanced rhynchocephalians. The teeth of the tuatara, and almost all other rhynchocephalians, are described as acrodont, as they are attached to the apex of the jaw bone. This contrast with the pleurodont condition found in the vast majority of lizards, where the teeth are attached to the inward-facing surface of the jaw. The teeth of the tuatara are extensively fused to the jawbone, making the boundary between the tooth and jaw difficult to discern, and the teeth lack roots and are not replaced during the lifetime of the animal, unlike those of pleurodont lizards. It is a common misconception that tuatara lack teeth and instead have sharp projections on the jaw bone; histology shows that they have true teeth with enamel and dentine with pulp cavities. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey, such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones.

The tuatara possesses palatal dentition (teeth growing from the bones of the roof of the mouth), which is ancestrally present in reptiles (and tetrapods generally). While many of the original palatal teeth present in reptiles have been lost, as in all other known rhynchocephalians, the row of teeth growing from the palatine bones in the tuatara have been enlarged, and as in other members of Sphenodontinae the palatine teeth are orientated parallel to the teeth in the maxilla; during biting the teeth of the lower jaw slot between the two upper tooth rows. The structure of the jaw joint allows the lower jaw to slide forwards after it has closed between the two upper rows of teeth. This mechanism allows the jaws to shear through chitin and bone.

The brain of &quot;Sphenodon&quot; fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume in the endocranium.

===Sensory organs===
==== Eyes ====
The eyes can focus independently, and are specialised with three types of photoreceptive cells, all with fine structural characteristics of retinal cone cells used for both day and night vision, and a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the nictitating membrane. Five visual opsin genes are present, suggesting good colour vision, possibly even at low light levels.

==== Parietal eye (third eye) ====
Like some other living vertebrates, including some lizards, the tuatara has a third eye on the top of its head called the parietal eye (also called a pineal or third eye) formed by the parapineal organ, with an accompanying opening in the skull roof called the pineal or parietal foramen, enclosed by the parietal bones. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with rod-like structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is visible only in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. While capable of detecting light, it is probably not capable of detecting movement or forming an image. It likely serves to regulate the circadian rhythm and possibly detect seasonal changes, and help with thermoregulation.

Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.

==== Hearing ====
Together with turtles, the tuatara has the most primitive hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no tympanum (eardrum) and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes into contact with the quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialised, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800 Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40 dB at 200 Hz.

==== Odorant receptors ====
Animals that depend on the sense of smell to capture prey, escape from predators or simply interact with the environment they inhabit, usually have many odorant receptors. These receptors are expressed in the dendritic membranes of the neurons for the detection of odours. The tuatara has around 472 receptors, a number more similar to what birds have than to the large number of receptors that turtles and crocodiles may have.

===Spine and ribs===
The tuatara spine is made up of hourglass-shaped amphicoelous vertebrae, concave both before and behind. This is the usual condition of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to tuatara within the amniotes. The vertebral bodies have a tiny hole through which a constricted remnant of the notochord passes; this was typical in early fossil reptiles, but lost in most other amniotes.

The tuatara has gastralia, rib-like bones also called gastric or abdominal ribs, the presumed ancestral trait of diapsids. They are found in some lizards, where they are mostly made of cartilage, as well as crocodiles and the tuatara, and are not attached to the spine or thoracic ribs. The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib. This feature is also present in birds. The tuatara is the only living tetrapod with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.

In the early tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, together with bony elements such as bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia may have been involved in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.

===Tail and back===
The spiny plates on the back and tail of the tuatara resemble those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it. The regrowth takes a long time and differs from that of lizards. Well illustrated reports on tail regeneration in tuatara have been published by Alibardi and Meyer-Rochow. The cloacal glands of tuatara have a unique organic compound named tuataric acid.

=== Age determination ===
Currently, there are two means of determining the age of tuatara. Using microscopic inspection, hematoxylinophilic rings can be identified and counted in both the phalanges and the femur. Phalangeal hematoxylinophilic rings can be used for tuatara up to ages 12–14 years, as they cease to form around this age. Femoral rings follow a similar trend, however they are useful for tuatara up to ages 25–35 years. Around that age, femoral rings cease to form. Further research on age determination methods for tuatara is required, as tuatara have lifespans much longer than 35 years (ages up to 60 are common, and captive tuatara have lived to over 100 years). One possibility could be via examination of tooth wear, as tuatara have fused sets of teeth.

=== Physiology ===
Adult tuatara are terrestrial and nocturnal reptiles, though they will often bask in the sun to warm their bodies. Hatchlings hide under logs and stones, and are diurnal, likely because adults are cannibalistic. Juveniles are typically active at night, but can be found active during the day. The juveniles&#x27; movement pattern is attributed to genetic hardwire of conspecifics for predator avoidance and thermal restrictions. Tuatara thrive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles, and hibernate during winter. They remain active at temperatures as low as , while temperatures over are generally fatal. The optimal body temperature for the tuatara is from , the lowest of any reptile. The body temperature of tuatara is lower than that of other reptiles, ranging from over a day, whereas most reptiles have body temperatures around . The low body temperature results in a slower metabolism.

== Ecology ==

Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters share the tuatara&#x27;s island habitat during the birds&#x27; nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds&#x27; burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds&#x27; guano helps to maintain invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey, including beetles, crickets, spiders, wētās, earthworms, and snails. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird&#x27;s eggs and chicks. Young tuatara are also occasionally cannibalised. The diet of the tuatara varies seasonally, and they consume mainly fairy prions and their eggs in the summer. In total darkness no feeding attempt was observed, and the lowest light intensity at which an attempt to snatch a beetle was observed occurred under 0.0125 lux. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara of both sexes defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily. Female tuatara rarely exhibit parental behaviour by guarding nests on islands with high rodent populations.

Tuataras are parasitised by the tuatara tick (&quot;Archaeocroton sphenodonti&quot;), a tick that directly depends on tuataras. These ticks tend to be more prevalent on larger males, as they have larger home ranges than smaller and female tuatara and interact with other tuatara more in territorial displays.

==Reproduction==
Tuatara reproduce very slowly, taking 10 to 20 years to reach sexual maturity. Though their reproduction rate is slow, tuatara have the fastest swimming sperm by two to four times compared to all reptiles studied earlier. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female will either allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males do not have a penis; they have rudimentary hemipenes; meaning that intromittent organs are used to deliver sperm to the female during copulation. They reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers. This process is sometimes referred to as a &quot;cloacal kiss&quot;. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds. Along with birds, the tuatara is one of the few members of Amniota to have lost the ancestral penis.

Tuatara eggs have a soft, parchment-like 0.2 mm thick shell that consists of calcite crystals embedded in a matrix of fibrous layers. It takes the females between one and three years to provide eggs with yolk, and up to seven months to form the shell. It then takes between 12 and 15 months from copulation to hatching. This means reproduction occurs at two- to five-year intervals, the slowest in any reptile. Survival of embryos has also been linked to having more success in moist conditions. Wild tuatara are known to be still reproducing at about 60 years of age; &quot;Henry&quot;, a male tuatara at Southland Museum in Invercargill, New Zealand, became a father (possibly for the first time) on 23 January 2009, at age 111, with an 80 year-old female.

The sex of a hatchling depends on the temperature of the egg, with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuatara, and cooler eggs producing females. Eggs incubated at have an equal chance of being male or female. However, at , 80% are likely to be males, and at , 80% are likely to be females; at all hatchlings will be females. Some evidence indicates sex determination in tuatara is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.

Tuatara probably have the slowest growth rates of any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35 years of their lives. The average lifespan is about 60 years, but they can live to be well over 100 years old; tuatara could be the reptile with the second longest lifespan after tortoises. Some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years. This may be related to genes that offer protection against reactive oxygen species. The tuatara genome has 26 genes that encode selenoproteins and 4 selenocysteine-specific tRNA genes. In humans, selenoproteins have a function of antioxidation, redox regulation and synthesis of thyroid hormones. It is not fully demonstrated, but these genes may be related to the longevity of this animal or may have emerged as a result of the low levels of selenium and other trace elements in the New Zealand terrestrial systems.

== Genomic characteristics ==
The most abundant LINE element in the tuatara is L2 (10%). Most of them are interspersed and can remain active. The longest L2 element found is 4 kb long and 83% of the sequences had ORF2p completely intact. The CR1 element is the second most repeated (4%). Phylogenetic analysis shows that these sequences are very different from those found in other nearby species such as lizards. Finally, less than 1% are elements belonging to L1, a low percentage since these elements tend to predominate in placental mammals. Usually, the predominant LINE elements are the CR1, contrary to what has been seen in the tuatara. This suggests that perhaps the genome repeats of sauropsids were very different compared to mammals, birds and lizards.

The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known to play roles in disease resistance, mate choice, and kin recognition in various vertebrate species. Among known vertebrate genomes, MHCs are considered one of the most polymorphic. In the tuatara, 56 MHC genes have been identified; some of which are similar to MHCs of amphibians and mammals. Most MHCs that were annotated in the tuatara genome are highly conserved, however there is large genomic rearrangement observed in distant lepidosaur lineages.

Many of the elements that have been analyzed are present in all amniotes, most are mammalian interspersed repeats or MIR, specifically the diversity of MIR subfamilies is the highest that has been studied so far in an amniote. 16 families of SINEs that were recently active have also been identified.

The tuatara has 24 unique families of DNA transposons, and at least 30 subfamilies were recently active. This diversity is greater than what has been found in other amniotes and in addition, thousands of identical copies of these transposons have been analyzed, suggesting to researchers that there is recent activity.

The genome is the second largest known to reptiles. Only the Greek tortoise genome is larger. Around 7,500 LTRs have been identified, including 450 endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Studies in other Sauropsida have recognised a similar number but nevertheless, in the genome of the tuatara it has been found a very old clade of retrovirus known as Spumavirus.

More than 8,000 non-coding RNA-related elements have been identified in the tuatara genome, of which the vast majority, about 6,900, are derived from recently active transposable elements. The rest are related to ribosomal, spliceosomal and signal recognition particle RNA.

The mitochondrial genome of the genus &quot;Sphenodon&quot; is approximately 18,000 bp in size and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA and 22 transfer RNA genes.

DNA methylation is a very common modification in animals and the distribution of CpG sites within genomes affects this methylation. Specifically, 81% of these CpG sites have been found to be methylated in the tuatara genome. Recent publications propose that this high level of methylation may be due to the amount of repeating elements that exist in the genome of this animal. This pattern is closer to what occurs in organisms such as zebrafish, about 78%, while in humans it is only 70%.

==Conservation==
Tuatara are absolutely protected under New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953. The species is also listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning commercial international trade in wild sourced specimens is prohibited and all other international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated by the CITES permit system.
===Distribution and threats===
Tuatara were once widespread on New Zealand&#x27;s main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains have been found in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32 offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, &quot;kiore&quot; (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, tuatara were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the distinct tuatara populations had become extinct in the past century.

The recent discovery of a tuatara hatchling on the mainland indicates that attempts to re-establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success. The total population of tuatara is estimated to be between 60,000 and 100,000.

==== Climate change ====
Tuatara have temperature-dependent sex determination meaning that the temperature of the egg determines the sex of the animal. For tuatara, lower egg incubation temperatures lead to females while higher temperatures lead to males. Since global temperatures are increasing, climate change may be skewing the male to female ratio of tuatara. Current solutions to this potential future threat are the selective removal of adults and the incubation of eggs.

===Eradication of rats===
Tuatara were removed from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and maintained in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into &quot;in situ&quot; captivity, where females produced 42 eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.

In the Hen and Chicken Islands, Polynesian rats were eradicated on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles have once again been seen on the latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara have been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this. Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of D&#x27;Urville Island, to prepare for the release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.

====Brothers Island tuatara====
&quot;Sphenodon punctatus guntheri&quot; is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400. In 1995, 50 juvenile and 18 adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, more than half of the animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34 juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to Matiu/Somes Island, a more publicly accessible location in Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.

In late October 2007, 50 tuatara collected as eggs from North Brother Island and hatched at Victoria University were being released onto Long Island in the outer Marlborough Sounds. The animals had been cared for at Wellington Zoo for the previous five years and had been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure at the zoo, off display.

There is another out of country population of Brothers Island tuatara that was given to the San Diego Zoological Society and is housed off-display at the San Diego Zoo facility in Balboa. No successful reproductive efforts have been reported yet.

====Northern tuatara====

&quot;S. punctatus punctatus&quot; naturally occurs on 29 islands, and its population is estimated to be over 60,000 individuals. In 1996, 32 adult northern tuatara were moved from Moutoki Island to Moutohora. The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.

A mainland release of &quot;S.p. punctatus&quot; occurred in 2005 in the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Sanctuary. The second mainland release took place in October 2007, when a further 130 were transferred from Stephens Island to the Karori Sanctuary. In early 2009, the first recorded wild-born offspring were observed.

===Captive breeding===

The first successful breeding of tuatara in captivity is believed to have achieved by Sir Algernon Thomas at either his University offices or residence in Symonds Street in the late 1880s or his new home, Trewithiel, in Mount Eden in the early 1890s.

Several tuatara breeding programmes are active in New Zealand. Southland Museum and Art Gallery in Invercargill was the first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme; starting in 1986 they bred &quot;S. punctatus&quot; and have focused on &quot;S. guntheri&quot; more recently.

Hamilton Zoo, Auckland Zoo and Wellington Zoo also breed tuatara for release into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was discovered that tuatara have temperature-dependent sex determination.
The Victoria University of Wellington maintains a research programme into the captive breeding of tuatara, and the Pūkaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre keeps a pair and a juvenile.

The WildNZ Trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at Ruawai. One notable captive breeding success story took place in January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110 year-old tuatara Henry and 80 year-old tuatara Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed.

In January 2016, Chester Zoo, England, announced that they succeeded in breeding the tuatara in captivity for the first time outside its homeland.

==Cultural significance==
Tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends, and are held as &quot;ariki&quot; (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate &quot;tapu&quot; (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is &quot;mana&quot;, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a &quot;taonga&quot; (special treasure) along with being viewed as the kaitiaki (guardian) of knowledge.

The tuatara was featured on one side of the New Zealand five-cent coin, which was phased out in October 2006. &quot;Tuatara&quot; was also the name of the &quot;Journal of the Biological Society&quot; of Victoria University College and subsequently Victoria University of Wellington, published from 1947 until 1993. It has now been digitised by the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, also at Victoria.

== In popular culture ==
* A tuatara named &quot;Tua&quot; is prominently featured in the 2017 novel &quot;Turtles All the Way Down&quot; by John Green.
* There is a brand of New Zealand craft beer named after the Tuatara which particularly references the third eye in its advertising.
* In the season one finale of &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; an old tuatara named Duster is used to represent themes of ageing and transition.
* In the 2023 animated movie &quot;Leo&quot;, the main character is a tuatara named Leo.

<text>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, and has numerous applications because it is chemically inert. The commonly known brand name of PTFE-based composition is Teflon by Chemours, a spin-off from DuPont, which originally invented the compound in 1938. 
Polytetrafluoroethylene is a fluorocarbon solid, as it is a high-molecular-weight polymer consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine. PTFE is hydrophobic: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons exhibit only small London dispersion forces due to the low electric polarizability of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid.

Polytetrafluoroethylene is used as a non-stick coating for pans and other cookware. It is non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is used as a graft material in surgery and as a coating on catheters.

PTFE and chemicals used in its production are some of the best-known and widely applied per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are persistent organic pollutants. PTFE occupies more than half of all fluoropolymer production, followed by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF).

For decades, DuPont used perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8) during production of PTFE, later discontinuing its use due to legal actions over ecotoxicological and health effects of exposure to PFOA. Dupont&#x27;s spin-off Chemours today manufactures PTFE using an alternative chemical it calls GenX, another PFAS. Although GenX was designed to be less persistent in the environment compared to PFOA, its effects may be equally harmful or even more detrimental than those of the chemical it has replaced.

== History ==

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was accidentally discovered in 1938 by Roy J. Plunkett while he was working in Chemours Chambers Works plant in New Jersey for DuPont. A team of Dupont chemists attempted to make a new chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, called tetrafluoroethylene. The gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle&#x27;s weight had dropped to the point signaling &quot;empty&quot;. John J. Beall (chemist), noticing a weight differential in his test cylinder, brought it to the attention of Roy Plunkett. The chemists in the lab sawed the bottle apart and found the bottle&#x27;s interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to the already known polyethylene) in 1941, and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.

By 1948, DuPont, which founded Kinetic Chemicals in partnership with General Motors, was producing over of Teflon-brand polytetrafluoroethylene per year in Parkersburg, West Virginia. An early use was in the Manhattan Project as a material to coat valves and seals in the pipes holding highly reactive uranium hexafluoride at the vast K-25 uranium enrichment plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

In 1954, Colette Grégoire urged her husband, the French engineer Marc Grégoire, to try the material he had been using on fishing tackle on her cooking pans. He subsequently created the first PTFE-coated, non-stick pans under the brand name Tefal (combining &quot;Tef&quot; from &quot;Teflon&quot; and &quot;al&quot; from aluminium). In the United States, Marion A. Trozzolo, who had been using the substance on scientific utensils, marketed the first US-made PTFE-coated pan, &quot;The Happy Pan&quot;, in 1961. Non-stick cookware has since become a common household product, now offered by hundreds of manufacturers across the world.

The brand name Zepel was used for promoting its stain-resistance and water-resistance when applied to fabrics.

In the 1990s, it was found that PTFE could be radiation cross-linked above its melting point in an oxygen-free environment. Electron beam processing is one example of radiation processing. Cross-linked PTFE has improved high-temperature mechanical properties and radiation stability. That was significant because, for many years, irradiation at ambient conditions has been used to break down PTFE for recycling. This radiation-induced chain scission allows it to be more easily reground and reused.

Corona discharge treatment of the surface to increase the energy and improve adhesion has been reported.

== Production ==
PTFE is produced by free-radical polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene. The net equation is as follows:
: &quot;n&quot; F2C=CF2 → −(F2C−CF2)&quot;n&quot;−
Because tetrafluoroethylene can explosively decompose to tetrafluoromethane () and carbon, a special apparatus is required for the polymerization to prevent hot spots that might initiate this dangerous side reaction. The process is typically initiated with persulfate, which homolyzes to generate sulfate radicals:
: [O3SO−OSO3]2− ⇌ 2 
The resulting polymer is terminated with sulfate ester groups, which can be hydrolyzed to give OH end-groups.

Granular PTFE is produced via suspension polymerization, where PTFE is suspended in an aqueous medium primarily via agitation and sometimes with the use of a surfactant. PTFE is also synthesized via emulsion polymerization, where a surfactant is the primary means of keeping PTFE in an aqueous medium. Surfactants in the past have included perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). More recently, Perfluoro 3,6 dioxaoctanoic acid (PFO2OA) and FRD-903 (GenX) are being used as alternatives.

== Properties ==
PTFE is a thermoplastic polymer, which is a white solid at room temperature, with a density of about 2200 kg/m3 and a melting point of . It maintains high strength, toughness and self-lubrication at low temperatures down to , and good flexibility at temperatures above . PTFE gains its properties from the aggregate effect of carbon-fluorine bonds, as do all fluorocarbons. The only chemicals known to affect these carbon-fluorine bonds are highly reactive metals like the alkali metals, at higher temperatures such metals as aluminium and magnesium, and fluorinating agents such as xenon difluoride and cobalt(III) fluoride. At temperatures above PTFE undergoes depolymerization. However, it begins to decompose at about through , and pyrolysis occurs at temperatures above .

The coefficient of friction of plastics is usually measured against polished steel. PTFE&#x27;s coefficient of friction is 0.05 to 0.10, which is the third-lowest of any known solid material (aluminium magnesium boride (BAM) being the lowest, with a coefficient of friction of 0.02; diamond-like carbon being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE&#x27;s resistance to van der Waals forces means that it is the only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. In addition, PTFE can be used to prevent insects from climbing up surfaces painted with the material. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants from climbing out of formicaria. There are surface treatments for PTFE that alter the surface to allow adhesion to other materials.

Because of its chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as a gasket material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing. However, until the 1990s, PTFE was not known to crosslink like an elastomer, due to its chemical inertness. Therefore, it has no &quot;memory&quot; and is subject to creep. Because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers that exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, Belleville washers are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, thereby ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of the gasket.

PTFE is an ultraviolet (UV) transparent polymer. However, when exposed to an excimer laser beam it severely degrades due to heterogeneous photothermal effect.

== Processing ==
Processing PTFE can be difficult and expensive because its high melting temperature, , is above its decomposition temperature. Even when molten, PTFE does not flow due to its exceedingly high melt-viscosity. The viscosity and melting point can be decreased by inclusion of small amount of comonomers such as perfluoro (propylvinyl ether) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP). These cause the otherwise perfectly linear PTFE chain to become branched, reducing its crystallinity.

Some PTFE parts are made by cold-moulding, a form of compression molding. Here, fine powdered PTFE is forced into a mould under high pressure (10–100 MPa). After a settling period, lasting from minutes to days, the mould is heated at , allowing the fine particles to fuse (sinter) into a single mass.

== Applications and uses ==

=== Wire insulation, electronics ===
The most common use of PTFE, consuming about 50% of production, is for the insulation of wiring in aerospace and computer applications (e.g. hookup wire, coaxial cables). This application exploits the fact that PTFE has excellent dielectric properties, specifically low group velocity dispersion, especially at high radio frequencies, making it suitable for use as an excellent insulator in connector assemblies and cables, and in printed circuit boards used at microwave frequencies. Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes PTFE the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker, higher dispersion and lower-melting-point polyethylene commonly used in low-cost applications.

=== Bearings seals ===
In industrial applications, owing to its low friction, PTFE is used for plain bearings, gears, slide plates, seals, gaskets, bushings, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms acetal and nylon.

=== Electrets ===
Its extremely high bulk resistivity makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life electrets, the electrostatic analogues of permanent magnets.

=== Composites ===
PTFE film is also widely used in the production of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built and, in breather and bagging materials, is used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with bismaleimide resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather, and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.

Gore-Tex is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, US, was one of the largest applications of PTFE coatings. of the material was used in the creation of the white double-layered PTFE-coated fiberglass dome.

=== Chemically inert liners ===
Because of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in hose assemblies, expansion joints, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.

=== Tensioned membrane structures ===
PTFE architectural membranes are created by coating a woven glass-fibre base cloth with PTFE, forming one of the strongest and most durable materials used in tensile structures. Some notable structures featuring PTFE-tensioned membranes include The O2 Arena in London, Moses Mabhida Stadium in South Africa, Metropolitano Stadium in Spain and the Sydney Football Stadium Roof in Australia.

=== Musical instruments ===
PTFE is often found in musical instrument lubrication products, most commonly valve oil.
=== Lubricants ===
PTFE is used in some aerosol lubricant sprays, including in micronized and polarized form. It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste. Brands include GT85, Tri-Flow and WD-40 Specialist.

=== Kitchenware ===

PTFE is best known for its use in coating non-stick frying pans and other cookware, as it is hydrophobic and possesses fairly high heat resistance.

The sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE.
=== Others ===

Other niche applications include:
* It is often found in ski bindings as a non-mechanical AFD (anti-friction device) 
* It can be stretched to contain small pores of varying sizes and is then placed between fabric layers to make a waterproof, breathable fabric in outdoor apparel.
* It is used widely as a fabric protector to repel stains on formal school-wear, like uniform blazers.
* It is frequently used as a lubricant to prevent captive insects and other arthropods from escaping.
* It is used as a coating for medical and healthcare applications formulated to provide strength and heat resistance to surgical devices and other medical equipment. 
* It is used as a film interface patch for sports and medical applications, featuring a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, which is installed in strategic high friction areas of footwear, insoles, ankle-foot orthosis, and other medical devices to prevent and relieve friction-induced blisters, calluses and foot ulceration.
* Expanded PTFE membranes have been used in trials to assist trabeculectomy surgery to treat glaucoma.
* Powdered PTFE is used in pyrotechnic compositions as an oxidizer with powdered metals such as aluminium and magnesium. Upon ignition, these mixtures form carbonaceous soot and the corresponding metal fluoride, and release large amounts of heat. They are used in infrared decoy flares and as igniters for solid-fuel rocket propellants. Aluminium and PTFE is also used in some thermobaric fuel compositions.
* Powdered PTFE is used in a suspension with a low-viscosity, azeotropic mixture of siloxane ethers to create a lubricant for use in twisty puzzles.
* In optical radiometry, sheets of PTFE are used as measuring heads in spectroradiometers and broadband radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE&#x27;s capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide range of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the ratio of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert&#x27;s cosine law. Thus PTFE enables cosinusoidal angular response for a detector measuring the power of optical radiation at a surface, e.g. in solar irradiance measurements.
* Teflon-coated bullets are coated with PTFE to reduce wear on the rifling of firearms that uncoated projectiles would cause. PTFE itself does not give a projectile an armor-piercing property.
* Its high corrosion resistance makes PTFE useful in laboratory environments, where it is used for lining containers, as a coating for magnetic stirrers, and as tubing for highly corrosive chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid, which will dissolve glass containers. It is used in containers for storing fluoroantimonic acid, a superacid.
* PTFE tubes are used in gas-gas heat exchangers in gas cleaning of waste incinerators. Unit power capacity is typically several megawatts.
* PTFE is widely used as a thread seal tape in plumbing applications, largely replacing paste thread dope.
* PTFE membrane filters are among the most efficient industrial air filters. PTFE-coated filters are often used in dust collection systems to collect particulate matter from air streams in applications involving high temperatures and high particulate loads such as coal-fired power plants, cement production and steel foundries. 
* PTFE grafts can be used to bypass stenotic arteries in peripheral vascular disease if a suitable autologous vein graft is not available.
* Many bicycle lubricants and greases contain PTFE and are used on chains and other moving parts subjected to frictional forces (such as hub bearings).
* PTFE is used for some types of dental floss.
* PTFE can also be used when placing dental fillings, to isolate the contacts of the adjacent tooth so the restorative materials will not stick to the adjacent tooth.
* PTFE sheets are used in the production of butane hash oil due to its non-stick properties and resistance to non-polar solvents.
* PTFE, associated with a slightly textured laminate, makes the plain bearing system of a Dobsonian telescope.
* PTFE is widely used as a non-stick coating for food processing equipment; dough hoppers, mixing bowls, conveyor systems, rollers, and chutes. PTFE can also be reinforced where abrasion is present – for equipment processing seeded or grainy dough for example.
* PTFE has been experimented with for electroless nickel plating.
* PTFE tubing is used for Bowden tubing in 3D printers because its low friction allows the extruder stepper motor to push filament through it more easily.
* PTFE is commonly used in aftermarket add-on mouse feet for gaming mice to reduce friction of the mouse against the mouse pad, resulting in a smoother glide.
* PTFE foils are commonly used with laserprinters everywhere, in their fuser unit, wrapped around the heater element(s) and as well on the opposite pressure roller to prevent any kind of sticking to it (neither the printed paper nor toner waste)
* PTFE is also used to make body jewellery as it&#x27;s much safer to wear compared to materials like acrylic, that release toxics into the body at 26.6 °C, unlike PTFE at 650–700 °C.
* PTFE is used to make bookbinding tools for folding, scoring and separating sheets of paper. These are typically referred to as Teflon bone folders.
* PTFE is commonly used for the tip of desoldering pumps due to its high melting temperature.

== Safety ==
While PTFE is stable at lower temperatures, it begins to deteriorate at temperatures of about , it decomposes above , and pyrolysis occurs at temperatures above . The main decomposition products are fluorocarbon gases and a sublimate, including tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and difluorocarbene radicals (RCF2).

An animal study conducted in 1955 concluded that it is unlikely that these products would be generated in amounts significant to health at temperatures below . Above those temperatures the degradation by-products can be lethal to birds, and can cause flu-like symptoms in humans (polymer fume fever), although in humans those symptoms disappear within a day or two of being moved to fresh air.

Most cases of polymer fume fever in humans occur due to smoking PTFE-contaminated tobacco, although cases have occurred in people who have welded near PTFE components. PTFE-coated cookware is unlikely to reach dangerous temperatures with normal use, as meat is usually fried between , and most cooking oils (except refined safflower and avocado oils) start to smoke before a temperature of is reached. A 1973 study by DuPont&#x27;s Haskell Laboratory found that a 4-hour exposure to the fumes emitted by PTFE cookware heated to was lethal for parakeets, although that was a higher temperature than the required for fumes from pyrolyzed butter to be lethal to the birds.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical formerly used in the manufacture of PTFE products such as non-stick coated cookware, can be carcinogenic for people who are exposed to it (see Ecotoxicity). Concerning levels of PFOA have been found in the blood of people who work in or live near factories where the chemical is used, and in people regularly exposed to PFOA-containing products such as some ski waxes and stain-resistant fabric coatings, but non-stick cookware was not found to be a major source of exposure, as the PFOA is burned off during the manufacturing process and not present in the finished product. Non-stick coated cookware has not been manufactured using PFOA since 2013, and PFOA is no longer being made in the United States.

== Ecotoxicity ==
===Living Building Challenge===
PTFE was added to the Living Building Challenge (LBC) Red List in 2016. The Red List bans substances prevalent in the building industry that pose serious risks to human health and the environment from construction that seeks to meet the criteria of the Living Building Challenge (LBC).

=== Trifluoroacetate ===
Sodium trifluoroacetate and the similar compound sodium chlorodifluoroacetate can both be generated when PTFE undergoes thermolysis, as well as producing longer chain polyfluoro- and/or polychlorofluoro- (C3-C14) carboxylic acids which may be equally persistent. These products can accumulate in evaporative wetlands and have been found in the roots and seeds of wetland plant species, but has not been observed to have an adverse impact on plant health or germination success.

=== PFOA ===

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8) has been used as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of PTFE, although several manufacturers have entirely discontinued its use.

PFOA persists indefinitely in the environment. PFOA has been detected in the blood of many individuals of the general US population in the low and sub-parts per billion range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) have been estimated to be in every American person&#x27;s blood stream in the parts per billion range, though those concentrations have decreased by 70% for PFOA and 84% for PFOS between 1999 and 2014, which coincides with the end of the production and phase out of PFOA and PFOS in the US. The general population has been exposed to PFOA through massive dumping of C8 waste into the ocean and near the Ohio River Valley. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet cleaning liquids, house dust, microwave popcorn bags, water, food and PTFE cookware.

As a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with DuPont, three epidemiologists conducted studies on the population of Parkersburg, WV surrounding the (former DuPont) Chemours Washington Works chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population. The studies concluded that there was an association between PFOA exposure and six health outcomes: kidney cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and gestational hypertension (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure).

Overall, PTFE cookware is considered a minor exposure pathway to PFOA.

=== GenX ===

As a result of the lawsuits concerning the PFOA class-action lawsuit, DuPont began to use GenX, a similarly fluorinated compound, as a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid in the manufacture of fluoropolymers, such as Teflon-brand PTFE. However, the EPA has classified GenX as more toxic than PFOA and it has proven to be a &quot;regrettable substitute&quot;; its effects may be equally harmful or even more detrimental than those of the chemical it was meant to replace.

The chemicals are manufactured by Chemours, a corporate spin-off of DuPont, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Fayetteville Works was the site where DuPont began manufacture of PFOA after the lawsuit in Parkersburg WV halted their production there. When EPA asked companies to voluntarily phase out PFOA production, it was replaced by GenX in Fayetteville Works. In June of 2017, The Wilmington Star-News broke the story that GenX was found in the Cape Fear River – the drinking water supply for 500,000 people. The source of the pollution was determined to be the Fayetteville Works site, which had been run by DuPont since its founding in 1971 and then managed by DuPont spinoff, The Chemours Company, since 2015. The water utility confirmed they had no ability to filter these chemicals from the drinking water. 

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NC DEQ) records indicate that DuPont started release PFAS into the area beginning in 1976 with the production of Nafion, and that PFAS including GenX had been released as a byproduct of the production of Vinyl Ethers since 1980, exposing the Cape Fear Basin for decades. A small nonprofit called Cape Fear River Watch sued NC DEQ for not taking swifter and stronger action, and sued the polluter, Chemours, for violations of the Clean Water Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. The result was a Consent Order, signed February 25, 2019 by Cape Fear River Watch, NC DEQ, and Chemours. The order has required Chemours to stop wastewater discharge, air emissions, groundwater discharge, sampling and filtration options to well users, and required sampling that proved there were upwards of 300 distinct PFAS compounds being released from Fayetteville Works.

== Similar polymers ==
The Teflon trade name is also used for other polymers with similar compositions:
* Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA)
* Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)

These retain the useful PTFE properties of low friction and nonreactivity, but are also more easily formable. For example, FEP is softer than PTFE and melts at ; it is also highly transparent and resistant to sunlight.

<doc id="30795" wikidata="Q126462" url="?curid=30795" title="Thomas Paine">
<text>Thomas Paine (born Thomas Pain; – June 8, 1809) was an English-born American Founding Father, French Revolutionary, inventor, and political philosopher. He authored &quot;Common Sense&quot; (1776) and &quot;The American Crisis&quot; (1776–1783), two of the most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution, and he helped to inspire the colonial era patriots in 1776 to declare independence from Great Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era ideals of human rights.

Paine was born in Thetford, Norfolk, and immigrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of Benjamin Franklin, arriving just in time to participate in the American Revolution. Virtually every American Patriot read his 47-page pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot;, which catalyzed the call for independence from Great Britain. &quot;The American Crisis&quot; was a pro-independence pamphlet series. Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the French Revolution. While in England, he wrote &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics, particularly the Anglo-Irish conservative writer Edmund Burke. His authorship of the tract led to a trial and conviction &quot;in absentia&quot; in England in 1792 for the crime of seditious libel.

The British government of William Pitt the Younger was worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to Britain and had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine&#x27;s work advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government and was therefore targeted with a writ for his arrest issued in early 1792. Paine fled to France in September, despite not being able to speak French, but he was quickly elected to the French National Convention. The Girondins regarded him as an ally; consequently, the Montagnards regarded him as an enemy, especially Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier, the powerful president of the Committee of General Security. In December 1793, Vadier arrested Paine and took him to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. He completed the first part of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; just before he was arrested. Mark Philp notes that &quot;In prison Paine managed to produce (and to convey to Daniel Isaac Eaton, the radical London publisher) a dedication for &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; and a new edition of the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; with a new preface.&quot; James Monroe used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794.

Paine became notorious because of his pamphlets and attacks on his former allies, who he felt had betrayed him. In &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; and other writings, he advocated Deism, promoted reason and freethought, and argued against religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. In 1796, he published a bitter open letter to George Washington, whom he denounced as an incompetent general and a hypocrite. He published the pamphlet &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot; (1797), discussing the origins of property and introducing the concept of a guaranteed minimum income through a one-time inheritance tax on landowners. In 1802, he returned to the U.S. He died on June 8, 1809. Only six people attended his funeral, as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity and his attacks on the nation&#x27;s leaders.

==Early life and education==
Paine was born on January 29, 1736 the son of Joseph Pain, a tenant farmer and stay-maker, and Frances () Pain, in Thetford, Norfolk, England. Joseph was a Quaker and Frances an Anglican. Despite claims that Paine changed the spelling of his family name upon his emigration to America in 1774, he was using &quot;Paine&quot; in 1769, while still in Lewes, Sussex.

He attended Thetford Grammar School (1744–1749), at a time when there was no compulsory education. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to his father. Following his apprenticeship, aged 19, Paine enlisted and served as a privateer, aboard the ship King of Prussia. Upon returning to Britain in 1759, he became a master staymaker, establishing a shop in Sandwich, Kent.

On September 27, 1759, Paine married Mary Lambert. His business collapsed soon after. Mary became pregnant; and, after they moved to Margate, she went into early labour, in which she and their child died.

In July 1761, Paine returned to Thetford to work as a officer. In December 1762, he became an Excise Officer in Grantham, Lincolnshire; in August 1764, he was transferred to Alford, also in Lincolnshire, at a salary of £50 per annum. On August 27, 1765, he was dismissed as an Excise Officer for &quot;claiming to have inspected goods he did not inspect&quot;. On July 31, 1766, he requested his reinstatement from the Board of Excise, which they granted the next day, upon vacancy. While awaiting that, he worked as a staymaker.

In 1767, he was appointed to a position in Grampound, Cornwall. Later he asked to leave this post to await a vacancy, and he became a school teacher in London.

On February 19, 1768, he was appointed to Lewes in Sussex, a town with a tradition of opposition to the monarchy and pro-republican sentiments since the revolutionary decades of the 17th century. Here he lived above the 15th-century Bull House, the tobacco shop of Samuel Ollive and Esther Ollive.

Paine first became involved in civic matters when he was based in Lewes. He appears in the Town Book as a member of the Court Leet, the governing body for the town. He was also a member of the parish vestry, an influential local Anglican church group whose responsibilities for parish business would include collecting taxes and tithes to distribute among the poor. On March 26, 1771, at age 34, Paine married Elizabeth Ollive, the daughter of his recently deceased landlord, whose business as a grocer and tobacconist he then entered into.
From 1772 to 1773, Paine joined excise officers asking Parliament for better pay and working conditions, publishing, in summer of 1772, &quot;The Case of the Officers of Excise&quot;, a 12-page article, and his first political work, spending the London winter distributing the 4,000 copies printed to the Parliament and others. In spring 1774, he was again dismissed from the excise service for being absent from his post without permission. The tobacco shop failed. On April 14, to avoid debtors&#x27; prison, he sold his household possessions to pay debts. He formally separated from his wife Elizabeth on June 4, 1774, and moved to London. In September, mathematician, Fellow of the Royal Society, and Commissioner of the Excise George Lewis Scott introduced him to Benjamin Franklin, who was there as a voice for colonial opposition to British colonial rule, especially as it related to the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. He was publisher and editor of the largest American newspaper, &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; and suggested emigration to Philadelphia. He handed out a letter of recommendation to Paine, who emigrated in October to the American colonies, arriving in Philadelphia on November 30, 1774.

===In &quot;Pennsylvania Magazine&quot;===
Paine barely survived the transatlantic voyage. The ship&#x27;s water supplies were bad and typhoid fever killed five passengers. On arriving at Philadelphia, he was too sick to disembark. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s physician, there to welcome Paine to America, had him carried off ship; Paine took six weeks to recover. He became a citizen of Pennsylvania &quot;by taking the oath of allegiance at a very early period&quot;. In March 1775, he became editor of the &quot;Pennsylvania Magazine&quot;, a position he conducted with considerable ability.

Before Paine&#x27;s arrival in America, sixteen magazines had been founded in the colonies and ultimately failed, each featuring substantial content and reprints from England. In late 1774, Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken announced his plan to create what he called an &quot;American Magazine&quot; with content derived from the colonies. Paine contributed two pieces to the magazine&#x27;s inaugural issue dated January 1775, and Aitken hired Paine as the Magazine&#x27;s editor one month later. Under Paine&#x27;s leadership, the magazine&#x27;s readership rapidly expanded, achieving a greater circulation in the colonies than any American magazine up until that point. While Aitken had conceived of the magazine as nonpolitical, Paine brought a strong political perspective to its content, writing in its first issue that &quot;every heart and hand seem to be engaged in the interesting struggle for &quot;American Liberty.&quot;&quot;

Paine wrote in the &quot;Pennsylvania Magazine&quot; that such a publication should become a &quot;nursery of genius&quot; for a nation that had &quot;now outgrown the state of infancy,&quot; exercising and educating American minds, and shaping American morality. On March 8, 1775, the &quot;Pennsylvania Magazine&quot; published an unsigned abolitionist essay titled &quot;African Slavery in America&quot;. The essay is often attributed to Paine on the basis of a letter by Benjamin Rush, recalling Paine&#x27;s claim of authorship to the essay. The essay attacked slavery as an &quot;execrable commerce&quot; and &quot;outrage against Humanity and Justice.&quot;

Consciously appealing to a broader and more working-class audience, Paine also used the magazine to discuss worker rights to production. This shift in the conceptualization of politics has been described as a part of &quot;the &#x27;modernization&#x27; of political consciousness,&quot; and the mobilization of ever greater sections of society into political life.

==American Revolution==
===&quot;Common Sense&quot; (1776)===

Paine has a claim to the title &quot;The Father of the American Revolution&quot;, which rests on his pamphlets, especially &quot;Common Sense,&quot; which crystallized sentiment for independence in 1776. It was published in Philadelphia on January 10, 1776, and signed anonymously &quot;by an Englishman&quot;. It was an immediate success, with Paine estimating it sold 100,000 copies in three months to the two million residents of the 13 colonies. During the course of the American Revolution, one biographer estimated a total of about 500,000 copies were sold, including unauthorized editions. However, some historians dispute these numbers. Paine&#x27;s original title for the pamphlet was &quot;Plain Truth&quot;, but Paine&#x27;s friend, pro-independence advocate Benjamin Rush, suggested &quot;Common Sense&quot; instead. Finding a printer who was daring enough to commit his print shop to the printing of &quot;Common Sense&quot; was not easy. At the advice of Rush, Paine commissioned Robert Bell to print his work.

The pamphlet came into circulation in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was passed around and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the idea of republicanism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. &quot;Common Sense&quot; is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offers a solution for Americans disgusted with and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.

Paine&#x27;s attack on monarchy in &quot;Common Sense&quot; is essentially an attack on George III. Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king&#x27;s ministers and Parliament, Paine laid the responsibility firmly at the king&#x27;s door. &quot;Common Sense&quot; was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court, so as to realize America&#x27;s providential role in providing an asylum for liberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain, &quot;Common Sense&quot; demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation.

Paine was not on the whole expressing original ideas in &quot;Common Sense&quot;, but rather employing rhetoric as a means to arouse resentment of the Crown. To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with &quot;Common Sense&quot; serving as a primary example. Part of Paine&#x27;s work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine&#x27;s contemporaries. Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine&#x27;s easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.

&quot;Common Sense&quot; was immensely popular in disseminating to a very wide audience ideas that were already in common use among the elite who comprised Congress and the leadership cadre of the emerging nation, who rarely cited Paine&#x27;s arguments in their public calls for independence. The pamphlet probably had little direct influence on the Continental Congress&#x27; decision to issue a Declaration of Independence, since that body was more concerned with how declaring independence would affect the war effort. One distinctive idea in &quot;Common Sense&quot; is Paine&#x27;s beliefs regarding the peaceful nature of republics; his views were an early and strong conception of what scholars would come to call the democratic peace theory.

Loyalists vigorously attacked &quot;Common Sense&quot;; one attack, titled &quot;Plain Truth&quot; (1776), by Marylander James Chalmers, said Paine was a political quack and warned that without monarchy, the government would &quot;degenerate into democracy&quot;. Even some American revolutionaries objected to &quot;Common Sense&quot;; late in life John Adams called it a &quot;crapulous mass&quot;. Adams disagreed with the type of radical democracy promoted by Paine (that men who did not own property should still be allowed to vote and hold public office) and published &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot; in 1776 to advocate a more conservative approach to republicanism.

Sophia Rosenfeld argues that Paine was highly innovative in his use of the commonplace notion of &quot;common sense&quot;. He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought. He used two ideas from Scottish Common Sense Realism: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone. Paine also used a notion of &quot;common sense&quot; favored by philosophes in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used &quot;common sense&quot; as a weapon to de-legitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement.

According to historian Robert Middlekauff, &quot;Common Sense&quot; became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions. Monarchy, he said, was preposterous and it had a heathenish origin. It was an institution of the devil. Paine pointed to the Old Testament, where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God. Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were &quot;two ancient tyrannies.&quot; They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the &quot;universal order of things,&quot; which began with God. That was, Middlekauff says, exactly what most Americans wanted to hear. He calls the Revolutionary generation &quot;the children of the twice-born&quot;. because in their childhood they had experienced the Great Awakening, which, for the first time, had tied Americans together, transcending denominational and ethnic boundaries and giving them a sense of patriotism.

=== Possible involvement in drafting the Declaration of Independence ===

While there is no historical record of Paine&#x27;s involvement in drafting the Declaration of Independence, some scholars of Early American History have suspected his involvement. As noted by the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, multiple authors have hypothesized and written on the subject, including Moody (1872), Van der Weyde (1911), Lewis (1947), and more recently, Smith &amp; Rickards (2007).

In 2018, the Thomas Paine National Historical Association introduced an early draft of the Declaration that contained evidence of Paine&#x27;s involvement based on an inscription of &quot;T.P.&quot; on the back of the document. During the early deliberations of the Committee of Five members chosen by Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence, John Adams made a hastily written manuscript copy of the original draft of the Declaration of Independence on June 24, 1776, known as the Sherman Copy. Adams made this copy shortly before preparing another neater, fair copy that is held in the Adams Family Papers collection at the Massachusetts Historical Society. The Sherman copy of the Declaration of Independence is one of several working drafts of the Declaration, made for Roger Sherman&#x27;s review and approval before the Committee of Five submitted a finalized draft to Congress. The Sherman Copy of the Declaration of Independence contains an inscription on the back of the document that states: &quot;A beginning perhaps-Original with Jefferson-Copied from Original with T.P.&#x27;s permission.&quot; According to the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, the individual referenced as &quot;T.P.&quot; in the inscription appears to be Thomas Paine.

The degree to which Paine was involved in formulating the text of the Declaration is unclear, as the original draft referenced in the Sherman Copy inscription is presumed lost or destroyed. However, John Adams&#x27; request for permission of &quot;T.P.&quot; to copy the original draft may suggest that Paine had a role either assisting Jefferson with organizing ideas within the Declaration, or contributing to the text of the original draft itself.

===&quot;The American Crisis&quot; (1776)===
In late 1776, Paine published &quot;The American Crisis&quot; pamphlet series to inspire the Americans in their battles against the British army. He juxtaposed the conflict between the good American devoted to civic virtue and the selfish provincial man. To inspire his soldiers, General George Washington had &quot;The American Crisis&quot;, first &quot;Crisis&quot; pamphlet, read aloud to them. It begins:

===Foreign affairs===
In 1777, Paine became secretary of the Congressional Committee on Foreign Affairs. The following year, he alluded to secret negotiation underway with France in his pamphlets. His enemies denounced his indiscretions. There was scandal; together with Paine&#x27;s conflict with Robert Morris and Silas Deane, it led to Paine&#x27;s expulsion from the Committee in 1779.

However, in 1781, he accompanied John Laurens on his mission to France. Eventually, after much pleading from Paine, New York State recognized his political services by presenting him with an estate at New Rochelle, New York and Paine received money from Pennsylvania and from Congress at Washington&#x27;s suggestion. During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide-de-camp to the important general, Nathanael Greene.

====Silas Deane Affair====

In what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of Silas Deane, an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret. Deane&#x27;s goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence. Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of Robert Morris, one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution and working with Pierre Beaumarchais, a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict. Paine uncovered the financial connection between Morris, who was Superintendent for Finance of the Continental Congress, and Deane.

Wealthy men, such as Robert Morris, John Jay and powerful merchant bankers, were leaders of the Continental Congress and defended holding public positions while at the same time profiting off their own personal financial dealings with governments. Amongst Paine&#x27;s criticisms, he had written in the &quot;Pennsylvania Packet&quot; that France had &quot;&quot;prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship&quot;,&quot; referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties. This was alleged to be effectively an embarrassment to France, which potentially could have jeopardized the alliance. John Jay, the President of the Congress, who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine&#x27;s comments. The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticizing an American revolutionary. He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters. This much-added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character and he resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779. Paine left the Committee without even having enough money to buy food for himself.

Much later, when Paine returned from his mission to France, Deane&#x27;s corruption had become more widely acknowledged. Many, including Robert Morris, apologized to Paine, and Paine&#x27;s reputation in Philadelphia was restored.

===&quot;Public Good&quot;===

In 1780, Paine published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Public Good,&quot; in which he made the case that territories west of the 13 colonies that had been part of the British Empire belonged after the Declaration of Independence to the American government, and did not belong to any of the 13 states or to any individual speculators. A royal charter of 1609 had granted to the Virginia Company land stretching to the Pacific Ocean. A small group of wealthy Virginia land speculators, including the Washington, Lee, and Randolph families, had taken advantage of this royal charter to survey and to claim title to huge swaths of land, including much land west of the 13 colonies. In &quot;Public Good,&quot; Paine argued that these lands belonged to the American government as represented by the Continental Congress. This angered many of Paine&#x27;s wealthy Virginia friends, including Richard Henry Lee of the powerful Lee family, who had been Paine&#x27;s closest ally in Congress, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, all of whom had claims to huge wild tracts that Paine was advocating should be government owned. The view that Paine had advocated eventually prevailed when the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was passed.

The animosity Paine felt as a result of the publication of &quot;Public Good&quot; fueled his decision to embark with Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens on a mission to travel to Paris to obtain funding for the American war effort.

===Funding the Revolution===
Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission. It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5 million livres in silver, as part of a &quot;present&quot; of 6 million and a loan of 10 million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of Benjamin Franklin. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Paine and probably Col. Laurens, &quot;positively objected&quot; that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting &quot;a bad precedent and an improper mode&quot;. Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the Bank of North America to raise money to supply the army. In 1785, he was given $3,000 by the U.S. Congress in recognition of his service to the nation.

Henry Laurens (father of Col. John Laurens) had been the ambassador to the Netherlands, but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner Lord Cornwallis in late 1781, Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate, Thomas Willing, who became the first president of the Bank of North America in January 1782. They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to &quot;organize&quot; the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Paine more than to Morris.
Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in Bordentown City, New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809. This is the only place in the world where Paine purchased real estate. In 1785, Paine was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1787, Paine proposed an iron bridge design for crossing the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia. Having little success in acquiring funding, Paine returned to Paris, France seeking investors or other opportunities to implement his, at the time, novel iron bridge design. Because Paine had few friends when arriving in France aside from Lafayette and Jefferson, he continued to correspond heavily with Benjamin Franklin, a long time friend and mentor. Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France.

Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called &quot;Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament&quot;. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations.

==&quot;Rights of Man&quot;==

Back in London by 1787, Paine would become engrossed in the French Revolution that began two years later and decided to travel to France in 1790. Meanwhile, conservative intellectual Edmund Burke launched a counterrevolutionary blast against the French Revolution, entitled &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class, and sold 30,000 copies. Paine set out to refute it in his &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791). He wrote it not as a quick pamphlet, but as a long, abstract political tract of 90,000 words which tore apart monarchies and traditional social institutions. On January 31, 1791, he gave the manuscript to publisher Joseph Johnson. A visit by government agents dissuaded Johnson, so Paine gave the book to publisher J. S. Jordan, then went to Paris, on William Blake&#x27;s advice. He charged three good friends, William Godwin, Thomas Brand Hollis, and Thomas Holcroft, with handling publication details. The book appeared on March 13, 1791, and sold nearly a million copies. It was &quot;eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsmen, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north&quot;.
Undeterred by the government campaign to discredit him, Paine issued his &quot;Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining Principle and Practice&quot; in February 1792. Detailing a representative government with enumerated social programs to remedy the numbing poverty of commoners through progressive tax measures, Paine went much farther than such contemporaries as James Burgh, Robert Potter, John Scott, John Sinclair or Adam Smith. Radically reduced in price to ensure unprecedented circulation, it was sensational in its impact and gave birth to reform societies. An indictment for seditious libel followed, for both publisher and author, while government agents followed Paine and instigated mobs, hate meetings, and burnings in effigy. A fierce pamphlet war also resulted, in which Paine was defended and assailed in dozens of works. The authorities aimed, with ultimate success, to force Paine out of Great Britain. He was then tried &quot;in absentia&quot; and found guilty, but he was beyond the reach of British law. The French translation of &quot;Rights of Man, Part II&quot; was published in April 1792. The translator, François Lanthenas, eliminated the dedication to Lafayette, as he believed Paine thought too highly of Lafayette, who was seen as a royalist sympathizer at the time.
In summer of 1792, he answered the sedition and libel charges thus: &quot;If, to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy ... to promote universal peace, civilization, and commerce, and to break the chains of political superstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank; if these things be libellous ... let the name of libeller be engraved on my tomb.&quot;

Paine was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution and was granted honorary French citizenship alongside prominent contemporaries such as Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and others. Paine&#x27;s honorary citizenship was in recognition of the publishing of his &quot;Rights of Man, Part II&quot; and the sensation it created within France. Despite his inability to speak French, he was elected to the National Convention, representing the district of Pas-de-Calais.

Several weeks after his election to the National Convention, Paine was selected as one of nine deputies to be part of the convention&#x27;s Constitutional Committee, charged to draft a suitable constitution for the French Republic. He subsequently participated in the Constitutional Committee in drafting the Girondin constitutional project. He voted for the French Republic, but argued against the execution of Louis XVI, referred to as Louis Capet following his deposition, saying the monarch should instead be exiled to the United States: firstly, because of the way royalist France had come to the aid of the American Revolution; and secondly, because of a moral objection to capital punishment in general and to revenge killings in particular. Paine&#x27;s speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by Jean-Paul Marat, who claimed that, as a Quaker, Paine&#x27;s religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment and thus he should be ineligible to vote. Marat interrupted a second time, stating that the translator was deceiving the convention by distorting the meanings of Paine&#x27;s words, prompting Paine to provide a copy of the speech as proof that he was being correctly translated.

Paine wrote the second part of &quot;Rights of Man&quot; on a desk in Thomas &#x27;Clio&#x27; Rickman&#x27;s house, with whom he was staying in 1792 before he fled to France. This desk is currently on display in the People&#x27;s History Museum in Manchester.

Regarded as an ally of the Girondins, he was seen with increasing disfavor by the Montagnards, who were now in power after the Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793. Paine was under scrutiny by the authorities also because he was a personal adversary of Gouverneur Morris, who was the American ambassador in France and a friend of George Washington. The revolutionary government, both the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security, sought to gain the favor of the American ambassador, not wanting to risk the alliance with the United States; therefore, they were more inclined to focus on Paine.

==&quot;The Age of Reason&quot;==


Paine was arrested in France on December 28, 1793, following the orders of Vadier. Joel Barlow was unsuccessful in securing Paine&#x27;s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. He was treated as a political prisoner by the Committee of General Security. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine&#x27;s release to the convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine&#x27;s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and therefore a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine protested and claimed that he was a citizen of the U.S. However, Ambassador Morris did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment.

Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the jailer on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine&#x27;s case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside, because the door of Paine&#x27;s cell had been left open when the jailer was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).

Paine was released in November 1794 largely because of the work of the new American ambassador to France, James Monroe, who successfully argued the case for Paine&#x27;s U.S. citizenship. In July 1795, he was re-admitted into the convention, as were other surviving Girondins. Paine was one of only three &quot;députés&quot; to oppose the adoption of the new 1795 constitution, because it eliminated universal suffrage, which had been proclaimed, at least for men, by the Montagnard Constitution of 1793.

In addition to receiving a British patent for a single-span iron bridge, Paine developed a smokeless candle and worked with inventor John Fitch in developing steam engines.

In 1797, Paine lived in Paris with Nicholas Bonneville and his wife, Marguerite Brazier. As well as Bonneville&#x27;s other controversial guests, Paine aroused the suspicions of authorities. Bonneville hid the Royalist Antoine Joseph Barruel-Beauvert at his home. Beauvert had been outlawed following the coup of 18 Fructidor on September 4, 1797. Paine believed that the United States under President John Adams had betrayed revolutionary France.

In 1800, still under police surveillance, Bonneville took refuge with his father in Evreux. Paine stayed on with him, helping Bonneville with the burden of translating the &quot;Covenant Sea&quot;. The same year, Paine purportedly had a meeting with Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon claimed he slept with a copy of &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (&quot;Les Droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot; in French) under his pillow and went so far as to say to Paine that &quot;a statue of gold should be erected to you in every city in the universe&quot;. Paine discussed with Napoleon how best to invade England. In December 1797, he had written two essays, one of which was pointedly named &quot;Observations on the Construction and Operation of Navies with a Plan for an Invasion of England and the Final Overthrow of the English Government&quot;, in which he promoted the idea to finance 1,000 gunboats to carry a French invading army across the English Channel. In 1804, Paine returned to the subject, writing &quot;To the People of England on the Invasion of England&quot; advocating the idea. However, upon noting Napoleon&#x27;s progress towards dictatorship, he condemned him as &quot;the completest charlatan that ever existed&quot;. 

===Criticism of George Washington===
Upset that President Washington, a friend since the Revolutionary War, did nothing during Paine&#x27;s imprisonment in France, Paine believed Washington had betrayed him and conspired with Robespierre. While staying with Monroe, Paine planned to send Washington a letter of grievance on the president&#x27;s birthday. Monroe stopped the letter from being sent, and after Paine&#x27;s criticism of the Jay Treaty, which was supported by Washington, Monroe suggested that Paine live elsewhere.

Paine then sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Having received no response, Paine contacted his longtime publisher Benjamin Bache, the Jeffersonian democrat, to publish his &quot;Letter to George Washington&quot; of 1796 in which he derided Washington&#x27;s reputation by describing him as a treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. Paine wrote that &quot;the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any&quot;. He declared that without France&#x27;s aid Washington could not have succeeded in the American Revolution and had &quot;but little share in the glory of the final event&quot;. He also commented on Washington&#x27;s character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.

==Later years==

Paine remained in France until 1802, returning to the United States only at President Jefferson&#x27;s invitation. Paine also paid for the passage for Bonneville&#x27;s wife Marguerite Brazier and the couple&#x27;s three sons, Benjamin, Louis, and Thomas Bonneville, to whom Paine was godfather. Paine returned to the U.S. in the early stages of the Second Great Awakening and a time of great political partisanship. The &quot;Age of Reason&quot; gave ample excuse for the religiously devout to dislike him, while the Federalists attacked him for his ideas of government stated in &quot;Common Sense,&quot; for his association with the French Revolution, and for his friendship with President Jefferson. Also, still fresh in the minds of the public was his &quot;Letter to Washington,&quot; published six years before his return. This was compounded when his right to vote was denied in New Rochelle on the grounds that Gouverneur Morris did not recognize him as an American and Washington had not aided him.

Brazier took care of Paine at the end of his life and buried him after his death. In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to her, including 100 acres (40.5 ha) of his farm so she could maintain and educate Benjamin and his brother Thomas.

==Death==
On the morning of June 8, 1809, Paine died, aged 72, at 59 Grove Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. Although the original building no longer exists, the present building has a plaque noting that Paine died at this location.

After his death, Paine&#x27;s body was brought to New Rochelle, but the Quakers would not allow it to be buried in their graveyard as per his last will, so his remains were buried under a walnut tree on his farm. In 1819, English agrarian radical journalist William Cobbett, who in 1793 had published a hostile continuation of Francis Oldys (George Chalmer)&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Thomas Paine&quot;, dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett&#x27;s effects when he died over fifteen years later but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what happened to them after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine&#x27;s remains, such as his skull and right hand.

At the time of his death, most American newspapers reprinted the obituary notice from the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; that was in turn quoting from &quot;The American Citizen&quot;, which read in part: &quot;He had lived long, did some good, and much harm&quot;. Only six mourners came to his funeral, two of whom were black, most likely freedmen. Months later appeared a hostile biography by James Cheetham, who had admired him since the latter&#x27;s days as a young radical in Manchester, and who had been friends with Paine for a short time before the two fell out. Many years later the writer and orator Robert G. Ingersoll wrote:

==Ideas and views==

Biographer Eric Foner identifies a utopian thread in Paine&#x27;s thought, writing: &quot;Through this new language he communicated a new visiona utopian image of an egalitarian, republican society&quot;.

Paine&#x27;s utopianism combined civic republicanism, belief in the inevitability of scientific and social progress and commitment to free markets and liberty generally. The multiple sources of Paine&#x27;s political theory all pointed to a society based on the common good and individualism. Paine expressed a redemptive futurism or political messianism. Writing that his generation &quot;would appear to the future as the Adam of a new world&quot;, Paine exemplified British utopianism.

Later, his encounters with the Indigenous peoples of the Americas made a deep impression. The ability of the Iroquois to live in harmony with nature while achieving a democratic decision-making process helped him refine his thinking on how to organize society.
===Slavery===

Paine was critical of slavery and declared himself to be an abolitionist. As secretary to the Pennsylvania legislature, he helped draft legislation to outlaw Patriot involvement in the international slave trade. Paine&#x27;s statement, &quot;Man has no property in man&quot;, although used by him in &quot;Rights of Man&quot; to deny the right of any generation to bind future ones, has also been interpreted as an argument against slavery. In the book, Paine also describes his mission, among other things, as to &quot;break the chains of slavery and oppression&quot;.

On March 8, 1775, one month after Paine became the editor of &quot;The Pennsylvania Magazine&quot;, the magazine published an anonymous article titled &quot;African Slavery in America,&quot; the first prominent piece in the colonies proposing the emancipation of African-American slaves and the abolition of slavery. Paine is often credited with writing the piece, on the basis of later testimony by Benjamin Rush, cosigner of the Declaration of Independence.

During the American Revolutionary War, the British implemented several policies that allowed fugitive slaves fleeing from American enslavers to find refuge within British lines. Writing in response to these policies, Paine wrote in &quot;Common Sense&quot; that Britain &quot;hath stirred up the Indians and the Negroes to destroy us&quot;. Paine, together with Joel Barlow, unsuccessfully tried to convince President Jefferson not to import the institution of slavery to the territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, suggesting he rather settle it with free Black families and German immigrants.

===State funded social programs===
In his &quot;Rights of Man, Part Second&quot;, Paine advocated a comprehensive program of state support for the population to ensure the welfare of society, including state subsidy for poor people, state-financed universal public education, and state-sponsored prenatal care and postnatal care, including state subsidies to families at childbirth. Recognizing that a person&#x27;s &quot;labor ought to be over&quot; before old age, Paine also called for a state pension to all workers starting at age 50, which would be doubled at age 60.

===&quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;===
His last pamphlet, &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;, published in the winter of 1795, opposed agrarian law and agrarian monopoly and further developed his ideas in the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; about how land ownership separated the majority of people from their rightful, natural inheritance and means of independent survival. The U.S. Social Security Administration recognizes &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot; as the first American proposal for an old-age pension and basic income or citizen&#x27;s dividend. Per &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;:

In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right, and not a charity ... [Government must] create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive at that age.

In this pamphlet he argued &quot;All accumulation of personal property, beyond what a man&#x27;s own hands produce, is derived to him by living in society; and he owes on every principle of justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part of that accumulation back again to society from whence the whole came&quot;.

Lamb argues that Paine&#x27;s analysis of property rights marks a distinct contribution to political theory. His theory of property defends a libertarian concern with private ownership that shows an egalitarian commitment. Paine&#x27;s new justification of property sets him apart from previous theorists such as Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf and John Locke. Lamb says it demonstrates Paine&#x27;s commitment to foundational liberal values of individual freedom and moral equality. In response to Paine&#x27;s &quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;, Thomas Spence wrote &quot;The Rights of Infants&quot; wherein he argued that Paine&#x27;s plan was not beneficial to impoverished people because landlords would just keep raising land prices, further enriching themselves rather than giving the commonwealth an equal chance.

===Fiat currency===
Paine was strongly opposed to fiat money, which he viewed as counterfeiting by the state. He said &quot;The punishment of a member [of a legislature] who should move for such a law ought to be death&quot;. As part of his essay &quot;Dissertations on Government, etc.&quot;, published in February, 1786, Paine included a scathing condemnation of paper money emphasizing &quot;The pretense for paper money has been, that there was not a sufficiency of gold and silver. This, so far from being a reason for paper emissions, is a reason against them.&quot;

==Religious views==
Before his arrest and imprisonment in France, knowing that he would probably be arrested and executed, following in the tradition of early 18th-century English Deism Paine wrote the first part of &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; (1793–1794). Paine&#x27;s religious views as expressed in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; caused quite a stir in religious society, effectively splitting the religious groups into two major factions: those who wanted church disestablishment, and the Christians who wanted Christianity to continue having a strong social influence.

About his own religious beliefs, Paine wrote in &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;:



Though there is no definitive evidence Paine himself was a Freemason, upon his return to America from France he penned &quot;An Essay on the Origin of Free-Masonry&quot; (1803–1805) about Freemasonry being derived from the religion of the ancient Druids. Marguerite de Bonneville published the essay in 1810 after Paine&#x27;s death, but she chose to omit certain passages from it that were critical of Christianity, most of which were restored in an 1818 printing. In the essay, Paine stated that &quot;the Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun.&quot; Paine also had a negative attitude toward Judaism. While never describing himself as a Deist, he openly advocated Deism in his writings, and called Deism &quot;the only true religion&quot;:The opinions I have advanced ... are the effect of the most clear and long-established conviction that the Bible and the Testament are impositions upon the world, that the fall of man, the account of Jesus Christ being the Son of God, and of his dying to appease the wrath of God, and of salvation, by that strange means, are all fabulous inventions, dishonorable to the wisdom and power of the Almighty; that the only true religion is Deism, by which I then meant, and mean now, the belief of one God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the practice of what are called moral virtuesand that it was upon this only (so far as religion is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter. So say I nowand so help me God.

==Legacy==


Historian Jack P. Greene stated:

Harvey J. Kaye wrote that through Paine, through his pamphlets and catchphrases such as &quot;The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth,&quot; &quot;We have it in our power to begin the world over again,&quot; and &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls&quot; did more than move Americans to declare their independence:

John Stevenson argues that in the early 1790s, numerous radical political societies were formed throughout England and Wales in which Paine&#x27;s writings provided &quot;a boost to the self-confidence of those seeking to participate in politics for the first time.&quot; In its immediate effects, Gary Kates argues, &quot;Paine&#x27;s vision unified Philadelphia merchants, British artisans, French peasants, Dutch reformers, and radical intellectuals from Boston to Berlin in one great movement.&quot;

His writings in the long term inspired philosophic and working-class radicals in Britain and United States. Liberals, libertarians, left-libertarians, feminists, democratic socialists, social democrats, anarchists, free thinkers and progressives often claim him as an intellectual ancestor. Paine&#x27;s critique of institutionalized religion and advocacy of rational thinking influenced many British freethinkers in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as William Cobbett, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh, Christopher Hitchens and Bertrand Russell.

The quote &quot;Lead, follow, or get out of the way&quot; is widely but incorrectly attributed to Paine. It can be found nowhere in his published works.

===Abraham Lincoln===
In 1835, when he was 26 years old, Abraham Lincoln wrote a defense of Paine&#x27;s deism. A political associate, Samuel Hill, burned the manuscript to save Lincoln&#x27;s political career. Historian Roy Basler, the editor of Lincoln&#x27;s papers, said Paine had a strong influence on Lincoln&#x27;s style:

No other writer of the eighteenth century, with the exception of Jefferson, parallels more closely the temper or gist of Lincoln&#x27;s later thought. In style, Paine above all others affords the variety of eloquence which, chastened and adapted to Lincoln&#x27;s own mood, is revealed in Lincoln&#x27;s formal writings.

===Thomas Edison===
The inventor Thomas Edison said:

I have always regarded Paine as one of the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine&#x27;s works in my boyhood... it was, indeed, a revelation to me to read that great thinker&#x27;s views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine&#x27;s writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, &#x27;What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!&#x27; My interest in Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and again, just as I have done since my boyhood days.

===South America===
In 1811, Venezuelan translator Manuel Garcia de Sena published a book in Philadelphia that consisted mostly of Spanish translations of several of Paine&#x27;s most important works. The book also included translations of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution and the constitutions of five U.S. states.

It subsequently circulated widely in South America and through it Uruguayan national hero José Gervasio Artigas became familiar with and embraced Paine&#x27;s ideas. In turn, many of Artigas&#x27;s writings drew directly from Paine&#x27;s, including the &quot;Instructions of 1813&quot;, which Uruguayans consider to be one of their country&#x27;s most important constitutional documents, and was one of the earliest writings to articulate a principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.

===Memorials===
The first and longest-standing memorial to Paine is the carved and inscribed 12-foot marble column in New Rochelle, New York, organized and funded by publisher, educator and reformer Gilbert Vale (1791–1866) and raised in 1839 by the American sculptor and architect John Frazee, the Thomas Paine Monument (see image below).

New Rochelle is also the original site of Thomas Paine&#x27;s Cottage, which along with a 320-acre (130 ha) farm were presented to Paine in 1784 by act of the New York State Legislature for his services in the American Revolution. The same site is the home of the Thomas Paine Memorial Museum.

In the 20th century, Joseph Lewis, longtime president of the Freethinkers of America and an ardent Paine admirer, was instrumental in having larger-than-life-sized statues of Paine erected in each of the three countries with which the revolutionary writer was associated. The first, created by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum, was erected in the Parc Montsouris, Paris, just before World War II began but not formally dedicated until 1948. It depicts Paine standing before the French National Convention to plead for the life of King Louis XVI. The second, sculpted in 1950 by Georg J. Lober, was erected near Paine&#x27;s one-time home in Morristown, New Jersey. It shows a seated Paine using a drumhead as a makeshift table. The third, sculpted by Sir Charles Wheeler, President of the Royal Academy, was erected in 1964 in Paine&#x27;s birthplace, Thetford, England. With a quill pen in his right hand and an inverted copy of &quot;The Rights of Man&quot; in his left, it occupies a prominent location on King Street. Thomas Paine was ranked No. 34 in the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; 2002 extensive Nationwide poll conducted by the BBC.

===In popular culture===
* In 1982 the BBC produced a documentary &quot;The Most Valuable Englishman Ever&quot;, written and presented by Kenneth Griffith.
* In 1987, Richard Thomas appeared on stage in Philadelphia and Washington, DC, in the one-man play &quot;Citizen Tom Paine&quot; (an adaptation of Howard Fast&#x27;s 1943 novel of the same title), playing Paine &quot;like a star-spangled tiger, ferocious about freedom and ready to savage anyone who stands in his way,&quot; in a staging of the play in the bicentennial year of the United States Constitution.
* In 1995, the English folk singer Graham Moore released a song called &quot;Tom Paine&#x27;s Bones&quot; on an album of the same name. The song has since been covered by a number of other artists, including Dick Gaughan, Grace Petrie and Trials of Cato.
* In 2005, Trevor Griffiths published &quot;These are the Times: A Life of Thomas Paine&quot;, originally written as a screenplay for Richard Attenborough Productions. Although the film was not made, the play was broadcast as a two-part drama on BBC Radio 4 in 2008, with a repeat in 2012.
* In 2009, Paine&#x27;s life was dramatized in the play &quot;Thomas Paine Citizen of the World&quot;, produced for the &quot;Tom Paine 200 Celebrations&quot; festival
