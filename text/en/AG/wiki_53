<text>The three-age system is the periodization of human prehistory (with some overlap into the historical periods in a few regions) into three time-periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, although the concept may also refer to other tripartite divisions of historic time periods. In some periodizations, a fourth Copper Age is added as between the Stone Age and Bronze Age. The Copper, Bronze, and Iron Ages are also known collectively as the Metal Ages.

In history, archaeology and physical anthropology, the three-age system is a methodological concept adopted during the 19th century according to which artefacts and events of late prehistory and early history could be broadly ordered into a recognizable chronology. C. J. Thomsen initially developed this categorization in the period 1816 to 1825, as a result of classifying the collection of an archaeological exhibition chronologically – there resulted broad sequences with artefacts made successively of stone, bronze, and iron.

The system appealed to British researchers working in the academic field of ethnology – they adopted it to establish race sequences for Britain&#x27;s past based on cranial types. Although the craniological ethnology that formed its first scholarly context does not have modern scientific value, the &quot;relative chronology&quot; of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age remains in use in a general public context, and the three-ages concept underpins prehistoric chronology for Europe, the Mediterranean world and the Near East.

The structure reflects the cultural and historical background of Mediterranean Europe and the Middle East. It soon underwent further subdivisions, including the 1865 partitioning of the Stone Age into Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods by John Lubbock. The schema, however, has little or no utility for establishing chronological frameworks in sub-Saharan Africa, much of Asia, the Americas, and some other areas; and has little importance in contemporary archaeological or anthropological discussion for these regions. In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead.

==Origin==

The concept of dividing pre-historical ages into systems based on metals extends far back in European history, probably originated by Lucretius in the first century BC. But the present archaeological system of the three main ages – stone, bronze and iron – originates with the 19th century Danish archaeologist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, who placed the system on a more scientific basis by typological and chronological studies, at first, of tools and other artifacts present in the Museum of Northern Antiquities in Copenhagen (later the National Museum of Denmark). He later used artifacts and the excavation reports published or sent to him by Danish archaeologists who were doing controlled excavations. His position as curator of the museum gave him enough visibility to become highly influential on Danish archaeology. A well-known and well-liked figure, he explained his system in person to visitors at the museum, many of them professional archaeologists.

===The Metallic Ages of Hesiod===

In his poem &quot;Works and Days&quot;, the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, possibly between 750 and 650 BC, defined five successive Ages of Man: Golden, Silver, Bronze, Heroic and Iron. Only the Bronze Age and the Iron Age are based on the use of metal:

... then Zeus the father created the third generation of mortals, the age of bronze ... They were terrible and strong, and the ghastly action of Ares was theirs, and violence. ... The weapons of these men were bronze, of bronze their houses, and they worked as bronzesmiths. There was not yet any black iron.

Hesiod knew from the traditional poetry, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to the market value of each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so there must have been a golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: &quot;And I wish that I were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward.&quot;

===The Progress of Lucretius===
The moral metaphor of the ages of metals continued. Lucretius, however, replaced moral degradation with the concept of progress, which he conceived to be like the growth of an individual human being. The concept is evolutionary:

For the nature of the world as a whole is altered by age. Everything must pass through successive phases. Nothing remains forever what it was. Everything is on the move. Everything is transformed by nature and forced into new paths ... The Earth passes through successive phases, so that it can no longer bear what it could, and it can now what it could not before.
The Romans believed that animal species and humans were spontaneously generated from the materials of the Earth, because of which the Latin word &quot;mater&quot;, &quot;mother&quot;, descends to English-speakers as matter and material. In Lucretius the Earth is a mother, Venus, to whom the poem is dedicated in the first few lines. She brought forth humankind by spontaneous generation. Having been given birth as a species, humans must grow to maturity by analogy with the individual. The different phases of their collective life are marked by the accumulation of customs to form material civilization:

The earliest weapons were hands, nails and teeth. Next came stones and branches wrenched from trees, and fire and flame as soon as these were discovered. Then men learnt to use tough iron and copper. With copper they tilled the soil. With copper they whipped up the clashing waves of war, ... Then by slow degrees the iron sword came to the fore; the bronze sickle fell into disrepute; the ploughman began to cleave the earth with iron, ...

Lucretius envisioned a pre-technological human that was &quot;far tougher than the men of today ... They lived out their lives in the fashion of wild beasts roaming at large.&quot; The next stage was the use of huts, fire, clothing, language and the family. City-states, kings and citadels followed them. Lucretius supposes that the initial smelting of metal occurred accidentally in forest fires. The use of copper followed the use of stones and branches and preceded the use of iron.

===Early lithic analysis by Michele Mercati===

By the 16th century, a tradition had developed based on observational incidents, true or false, that the black objects found widely scattered in large quantities over Europe had fallen from the sky during thunderstorms and were therefore to be considered generated by lightning. They were so published by Konrad Gessner in &quot;De rerum fossilium, lapidum et gemmarum maxime figuris &amp; similitudinibus&quot; at Zurich in 1565 and by many others less famous. The name ceraunia, &quot;thunderstones&quot;, had been assigned.

Ceraunia were collected by many persons over the centuries including Michele Mercati, Superintendent of the Vatican Botanical Garden in the late 16th century. He brought his collection of fossils and stones to the Vatican, where he studied them at leisure, compiling the results in a manuscript, which was published posthumously by the Vatican at Rome in 1717 as &quot;Metallotheca&quot;. Mercati was interested in Ceraunia cuneata, &quot;wedge-shaped thunderstones&quot;, which seemed to him to be most like axes and arrowheads, which he now called ceraunia vulgaris, &quot;folk thunderstones&quot;, distinguishing his view from the popular one. His view was based on what may be the first in-depth lithic analysis of the objects in his collection, which led him to believe that they are artifacts and to suggest that the historical evolution of these artefacts followed a scheme.

Mercati, examining the surfaces of the ceraunia, noted that the stones were of flint and that they had been chipped all over by another stone to achieve by percussion their current forms. The protrusion at the bottom he identified as the attachment point of a haft. Concluding that these objects were not ceraunia, he compared collections to determine exactly what they were. Vatican collections included artifacts from the New World of exactly the shapes of the supposed ceraunia. The reports of the explorers had identified them to be implements and weapons or parts of them.

Mercati posed the question to himself, why would anyone prefer to manufacture artefacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the three-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based on the use of stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati&#x27;s ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.

===The usages of Mahudel and de Jussieu===
On 12 November 1734, Nicholas Mahudel, physician, antiquarian and numismatist, read a paper at a public sitting of the Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in which he defined three &quot;usages&quot; of stone, bronze and iron in a chronological sequence. He had presented the paper several times that year but it was rejected until the November revision was finally accepted and published by the academy in 1740. It was entitled &quot;.&quot; It expanded the concepts of Antoine de Jussieu, who had gotten a paper accepted in 1723 entitled . In Mahudel, there is not just one usage for stone, but two more, one each for bronze and iron.

He begins his treatise with descriptions and classifications of the &#x27;, the ceraunia of contemporaneous European interest. After cautioning the audience that natural and man-made objects are often easily confused, he asserts that the specific &quot;figures&quot; or &quot;formes that can be distinguished (&#x27;)&quot; of the stones were man-made, not natural:
It was Man&#x27;s hand that made them serve as instruments (&quot;&quot;)

Their cause, he asserts, is &quot;the industry of our forefathers (&#x27;).&quot; He adds later that bronze and iron implements imitate the uses of the stone ones, suggesting a replacement of stone with metals. Mahudel is careful not to take credit for the idea of a succession of usages in time but states: &quot;it is Michel Mercatus, physician of Clement VIII who first had this idea&quot;. He does not coin a term for ages, but speaks only of the times of usages. His use of &#x27; foreshadows the 20th century &quot;industries&quot;, but where the moderns mean specific tool traditions, Mahudel meant only the art of working stone and metal in general.

===The three-age system of C. J. Thomsen===

An important step in the development of the Three-age System came in the period 1816–1825 when the Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen was able to use the Danish national collection of antiquities and the records of their finds as well as reports from contemporaneous excavations to provide a solid empirical basis for the system. He showed that artefacts could be classified into types and that these types varied over time in ways that correlated with the predominance of stone, bronze or iron implements and weapons. In this way he turned the Three-age System from being an evolutionary scheme based on intuition and general knowledge into a system of relative chronology supported by archaeological evidence. Initially, the three-age system as it was developed by Thomsen and his contemporaries in Scandinavia, such as Sven Nilsson and J.J.A. Worsaae, was grafted onto the traditional biblical chronology. But, during the 1830s they achieved independence from textual chronologies and relied mainly on typology and stratigraphy.

In 1816 Thomsen at age 27 was appointed to succeed the retiring Rasmus Nyerup as Secretary of the &quot;Kongelige Commission for Oldsagers Opbevaring&quot; (&quot;Royal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities&quot;), which had been founded in 1807. The post was unsalaried; Thomsen had independent means. At his appointment Bishop Münter said that he was an &quot;amateur with a great range of accomplishments.&quot; Between 1816 and 1819 he reorganized the commission&#x27;s collection of antiquities. In 1819 he opened the first Museum of Northern Antiquities, in Copenhagen, in a former monastery, to house the collections. It later became the National Museum.

Like the other antiquarians Thomsen undoubtedly knew of the three-age model of prehistory through the works of Lucretius, the Dane Vedel Simonsen, Montfaucon and Mahudel. Sorting the material in the collection chronologically he mapped out which kinds of artefacts co-occurred in deposits and which did not, as this arrangement would allow him to discern any trends that were exclusive to certain periods. In this way he discovered that stone tools did not co-occur with bronze or iron in the earliest deposits while subsequently bronze did not co-occur with iron – so that three periods could be defined by their available materials, stone, bronze and iron.

To Thomsen the find circumstances were the key to dating. In 1821 he wrote in a letter to fellow prehistorian Schröder:
nothing is more important than to point out that hitherto we have not paid enough attention to what was found together.

and in 1822:
we still do not know enough about most of the antiquities either; ... only future archaeologists may be able to decide, but they will never be able to do so if they do not observe what things are found together and our collections are not brought to a greater degree of perfection.

This analysis emphasizing co-occurrence and systematic attention to archaeological context allowed Thomsen to build a chronological framework of the materials in the collection and to classify new finds in relation to the established chronology, even without much knowledge of their provenience. In this way, Thomsen&#x27;s system was a true chronological system rather than an evolutionary or technological system. Exactly when his chronology was reasonably well established is not clear, but by 1825 visitors to the museum were being instructed in his methods. In that year also he wrote to J.G.G. Büsching:
To put artifacts in their proper context I consider it most important to pay attention to the chronological sequence, and I believe that the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.

By 1831 Thomsen was so certain of the utility of his methods that he circulated a pamphlet, &quot;Scandinavian Artefacts and Their Preservation&quot;, advising archaeologists to &quot;observe the greatest care&quot; to note the context of each artifact. The pamphlet had an immediate effect. Results reported to him confirmed the universality of the Three-age System. Thomsen also published in 1832 and 1833 articles in the &quot;Nordisk Tidsskrift for Oldkyndighed&quot;, &quot;Scandinavian Journal of Archaeology&quot;. He already had an international reputation when in 1836 the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries published his illustrated contribution to &quot;Guide to Scandinavian Archaeology&quot; in which he put forth his chronology together with comments about typology and stratigraphy.

Thomsen was the first to perceive typologies of grave goods, grave types, methods of burial, pottery and decorative motifs, and to assign these types to layers found in excavation. His published and personal advice to Danish archaeologists concerning the best methods of excavation produced immediate results that not only verified his system empirically but placed Denmark in the forefront of European archaeology for at least a generation. He became a national authority when C.C Rafn, secretary of the &quot;Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab&quot; (&quot;Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries&quot;), published his principal manuscript in &quot;Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed&quot; (&quot;Guide to Scandinavian Archaeology&quot;) in 1836. The system has since been expanded by further subdivision of each era, and refined through further archaeological and anthropological finds.

==Stone Age subdivisions==

===The savagery and civilization of Sir John Lubbock===
It was to be a full generation before British archaeology caught up with the Danish. When it did, the leading figure was another multi-talented man of independent means: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. After reviewing the Three-age System from Lucretius to Thomsen, Lubbock improved it and took it to another level, that of cultural anthropology. Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.

In his 1865 book, &quot;Prehistoric Times&quot;, Lubbock divided the Stone Age in Europe, and possibly nearer Asia and Africa, into the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic:
By &quot;drift&quot; Lubbock meant river-drift, the alluvium deposited by a river. For the interpretation of Palaeolithic artifacts, Lubbock, pointing out that the times are beyond the reach of history and tradition, suggests an analogy, which was adopted by the anthropologists. Just as the paleontologist uses modern elephants to help reconstruct fossil pachyderms, so the archaeologist is justified in using the customs of the &quot;non-metallic savages&quot; of today to understand &quot;the early races which inhabited our continent.&quot; He devotes three chapters to this approach, covering the &quot;modern savages&quot; of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Western Hemisphere, concluding:
Perhaps it will be thought... I have selected... the passages most unfavorable to savages... In reality the very reverse is the case... Their real condition is even worse and more abject than that which I have endeavoured to depict.

===The elusive Mesolithic of Hodder Westropp===

Sir John Lubbock&#x27;s use of the terms Palaeolithic (&quot;Old Stone Age&quot;) and Neolithic (&quot;New Stone Age&quot;) were immediately popular. They were applied, however, in two different senses: geologic and anthropologic. In 1867–68 Ernst Haeckel in 20 public lectures in Jena, entitled &quot;General Morphology&quot;, to be published in 1870, referred to the Archaeolithic, the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Caenolithic as periods in geologic history. He could only have got these terms from Hodder Westropp, who took Palaeolithic from Lubbock, invented Mesolithic (&quot;Middle Stone Age&quot;) and Caenolithic instead of Lubbock&#x27;s Neolithic. None of these terms appear anywhere, including the writings of Haeckel, before 1865. Haeckel&#x27;s use was innovative.

Westropp first used Mesolithic and Caenolithic in 1865, almost immediately after the publication of Lubbock&#x27;s first edition. He read a paper on the topic before the Anthropological Society of London in 1865, published in 1866 in the &quot;Memoirs&quot;. After asserting:
Man, in all ages and in all stages of his development, is a tool-making animal.

Westropp goes on to define &quot;different epochs of flint, stone, bronze or iron; ...&quot; He never did distinguish the flint from the Stone Age (having realized they were one and the same), but he divided the Stone Age as follows:
# &quot;The flint implements of the gravel-drift&quot;
# &quot;The flint implements found in Ireland and Denmark&quot;
# &quot;Polished stone implements&quot;
These three ages were named respectively the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Kainolithic. He was careful to qualify these by stating:
Their presence is thus not always an evidence of a high antiquity, but of an early and barbarous state; ...

Lubbock&#x27;s savagery was now Westropp&#x27;s barbarism. A fuller exposition of the Mesolithic waited for his book, &quot;Pre-Historic Phases&quot;, dedicated to Sir John Lubbock, published in 1872. At that time he restored Lubbock&#x27;s Neolithic and defined a Stone Age divided into three phases and five stages.

The First Stage, &quot;Implements of the Gravel Drift&quot;, contains implements that were &quot;roughly knocked into shape&quot;. His illustrations show Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools, basically Acheulean handaxes. Today they are in the Lower Palaeolithic.

The Second Stage, &quot;Flint Flakes&quot; are of the &quot;simplest form&quot; and were struck off cores. Westropp differs in this definition from the modern, as Mode 2 contains flakes for scrapers and similar tools. His illustrations, however, show Modes 3 and 4, of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. His extensive lithic analysis leaves no doubt. They are, however, part of Westropp&#x27;s Mesolithic.

The Third Stage, &quot;a more advanced stage&quot; in which &quot;flint flakes were carefully chipped into shape&quot;, produced small arrowheads from shattering a piece of flint into &quot;a hundred pieces&quot;, selecting the most suitable and working it with a punch. The illustrations show that he had microliths, or Mode 5 tools in mind. His Mesolithic is therefore partly the same as the modern.

The Fourth Stage is a part of the Neolithic that is transitional to the Fifth Stage: axes with ground edges leading to implements totally ground and polished. Westropp&#x27;s agriculture is removed to the Bronze Age, while his Neolithic is pastoral. The Mesolithic is reserved to hunters.

===Piette finds the Mesolithic===

In that same year, 1872, Sir John Evans produced a massive work, &quot;The Ancient Stone Implements&quot;, in which he in effect repudiated the Mesolithic, making a point to ignore it, denying it by name in later editions. He wrote:
Sir John Lubbock has proposed to call them the Archaeolithic, or Palaeolithic, and the Neolithic Periods respectively, terms which have met with almost general acceptance, and of which I shall avail myself in the course of this work.

Evans did not, however, follow Lubbock&#x27;s general trend, which was typological classification. He chose instead to use type of find site as the main criterion, following Lubbock&#x27;s descriptive terms, such as tools of the drift. Lubbock had identified drift sites as containing Palaeolithic material. Evans added to them the cave sites. Opposed to drift and cave were the surface sites, where chipped and ground tools often occurred in unlayered contexts. Evans decided he had no choice but to assign them all to the most recent. He therefore consigned them to the Neolithic and used the term &quot;Surface Period&quot; for it.

Having read Westropp, Sir John knew perfectly well that all the former&#x27;s Mesolithic implements were surface finds. He used his prestige to quell the concept of Mesolithic as best he could, but the public could see that his methods were not typological. The less prestigious scientists publishing in the smaller journals continued to look for a Mesolithic. For example, Isaac Taylor in &quot;The Origin of the Aryans&quot;, 1889, mentions the Mesolithic but briefly, asserting, however, that it formed &quot;a transition between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Periods&quot;. Nevertheless, Sir John fought on, opposing the Mesolithic by name as late as the 1897 edition of his work.

Meanwhile, Haeckel had totally abandoned the geologic uses of the -lithic terms. The concepts of Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic had originated in the early 19th century and were gradually becoming coin of the geologic realm. Realizing he was out of step, Haeckel started to transition to the -zoic system as early as 1876 in &quot;The History of Creation&quot;, placing the -zoic form in parentheses next to the -lithic form.

The gauntlet was officially thrown down before Sir John by J. Allen Brown, speaking for the opposition before the Anthropological Institute on 8 March 1892. In the journal he opens the attack by striking at a &quot;hiatus&quot; in the record:
It has been generally assumed that a break occurred between the period during which ... the continent of Europe was inhabited by Palaeolithic Man and his Neolithic successor ... No physical cause, no adequate reasons have ever been assigned for such a hiatus in human existence ...

The main hiatus at that time was between British and French archaeology, as the latter had already discovered the gap 20 years earlier and had already considered three answers and arrived at one solution, the modern. Whether Brown did not know or was pretending not to know is unclear. In 1872, the very year of Evans&#x27; publication, Gabriel de Mortillet had presented the gap to the Congrès international d&#x27;Anthropologie at Brussels:
Between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, there is a wide and deep gap, a large hiatus.

Apparently prehistoric man was hunting big game with stone tools one year and farming with domestic animals and ground stone tools the next. Mortillet postulated a &quot;time then unknown ()&quot; to fill the gap. The hunt for the &quot;unknown&quot; was on. On 16 April 1874, Mortillet retracted. &quot;That hiatus is not real (&#x27;),&quot; he said before the &quot;Société d&#x27;Anthropologie&quot;, asserting that it was an informational gap only. The other theory had been a gap in nature, that, because of the ice age, man had retreated from Europe. The information must now be found. In 1895 Édouard Piette stated that he had heard Édouard Lartet speak of &quot;the remains from the intermediate period (&#x27;)&quot;, which were yet to be discovered, but Lartet had not published this view. The gap had become a transition. However, asserted Piette:
I was fortunate to discover the remains of that unknown time which separated the Magdalenian age from that of polished stone axes ... it was, at Mas-d&#x27;Azil in 1887 and 1888 when I made this discovery.

He had excavated the type site of the Azilian Culture, the basis of today&#x27;s Mesolithic. He found it sandwiched between the Magdalenian and the Neolithic. The tools were like those of the Danish kitchen-middens, termed the Surface Period by Evans, which were the basis of Westropp&#x27;s Mesolithic. They were Mode 5 stone tools, or microliths. He mentions neither Westropp nor the Mesolithic, however. For him this was a &quot;solution of continuity (&quot;solution de continuité&quot;)&quot; To it he assigns the semi-domestication of dog, horse, cow, etc., which &quot;greatly facilitated the work of Neolithic man (&quot;a beaucoup facilité la tàche de l&#x27;homme néolithique&quot;).&quot; Brown in 1892 does not mention Mas-d&#x27;Azil. He refers to the &quot;transition or &#x27;Mesolithic&#x27; forms&quot; but to him these are &quot;rough hewn axes chipped over the entire surface&quot; mentioned by Evans as the earliest of the Neolithic. Where Piette believed he had discovered something new, Brown wanted to break out known tools considered Neolithic.

===The Epipaleolithic and Protoneolithic of Stjerna and Obermaier===

Sir John Evans never changed his mind, giving rise to a dichotomous view of the Mesolithic and a multiplication of confusing terms. On the continent, all seemed settled: there was a distinct Mesolithic with its own tools and both tools and customs were transitional to the Neolithic. Then in 1910, the Swedish archaeologist, Knut Stjerna, addressed another problem of the Three-Age System: although a culture was predominantly classified as one period, it might contain material that was the same as or like that of another. His example was the Gallery grave Period of Scandinavia. It was not uniformly Neolithic, but contained some objects of bronze and more importantly to him three different subcultures.

One of these &quot;civilisations&quot; (sub-cultures) located in the north and east of Scandinavia was rather different, featuring but few gallery graves, using instead stone-lined pit graves containing implements of bone, such as harpoon and javelin heads. He observed that they &quot;persisted during the recent Paleolithic period and also during the Protoneolithic.&quot; Here he had used a new term, &quot;Protoneolithic&quot;, which was according to him to be applied to the Danish kitchen-middens.

Stjerna also said that the eastern culture &quot;is attached to the Paleolithic civilization (&#x27;).&quot; However, it was not intermediary and of its intermediates he said &quot;we cannot discuss them here (&#x27;).&quot; This &quot;attached&quot; and non-transitional culture he chose to call the Epipaleolithic, defining it as follows:
With Epipaleolithic I mean the period during the early days that followed the age of the reindeer, the one that retained Paleolithic customs. This period has two stages in Scandinavia, that of Maglemose and that of Kunda. (&quot;&quot;)
There is no mention of any Mesolithic, but the material he described had been previously connected with the Mesolithic. Whether or not Stjerna intended his Protoneolithic and Epipaleolithic as a replacement for the Mesolithic is not clear, but Hugo Obermaier, a German archaeologist who taught and worked for many years in Spain, to whom the concepts are often erroneously attributed, used them to mount an attack on the entire concept of Mesolithic. He presented his views in , 1916, which was translated into English in 1924. Viewing the Epipaleolithic and the Protoneolithic as a &quot;transition&quot; and an &quot;interim&quot; he affirmed that they were not any sort of &quot;transformation:&quot;
But in my opinion this term is not justified, as it would be if these phases presented a natural evolutionary development – a progressive transformation from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the Capsian, the Tardenoisian, the Azilian and the northern Maglemose industries are the posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic ...

The ideas of Stjerna and Obermaier introduced a certain ambiguity into the terminology, which subsequent archaeologists found and find confusing. Epipaleolithic and Protoneolithic cover the same cultures, more or less, as does the Mesolithic. Publications on the Stone Age after 1916 include some sort of explanation of this ambiguity, leaving room for different views. Strictly speaking the Epipaleolithic is the earlier part of the Mesolithic. Some identify it with the Mesolithic. To others it is an Upper Paleolithic transition to the Mesolithic. The exact use in any context depends on the archaeological tradition or the judgement of individual archaeologists. The issue continues.

===Lower, middle and upper from Haeckel to Sollas===

The post-Darwinian approach to the naming of periods in earth history focused at first on the lapse of time: early (Palaeo-), middle (Meso-) and late (Ceno-). This conceptualization automatically imposes a three-age subdivision to any period, which is predominant in modern archaeology: Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age; Early, Middle and Late Minoan, etc. The criterion is whether the objects in question look simple or are elaborative. If a horizon contains objects that are post-late and simpler-than-late they are sub-, as in Submycenaean.

Haeckel&#x27;s presentations are from a different point of view. His &quot;History of Creation&quot; of 1870 presents the ages as &quot;Strata of the Earth&#x27;s Crust&quot;, in which he prefers &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;mid-&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; based on the order in which one encounters the layers. His analysis features an Upper and Lower Pliocene as well as an Upper and Lower Diluvial (his term for the Pleistocene). Haeckel, however, was relying heavily on Lyell. In the 1833 edition of &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (the first) Lyell devised the terms Eocene, Miocene and Pliocene to mean periods of which the &quot;strata&quot; contained some (Eo-, &quot;early&quot;), lesser (Mio-) and greater (Plio-) numbers of &quot;living Mollusca represented among fossil assemblages of western Europe.&quot; The Eocene was given Lower, Middle, Upper; the Miocene a Lower and Upper; and the Pliocene an Older and Newer, which scheme would indicate an equivalence between Lower and Older, and Upper and Newer.

In a French version, , in 1839 Lyell called the Older Pliocene the Pliocene and the Newer Pliocene the Pleistocene (Pleist-, &quot;most&quot;). Then in &quot;Antiquity of Man&quot; in 1863 he reverted to his previous scheme, adding &quot;Post-Tertiary&quot; and &quot;Post-Pliocene&quot;. In 1873 the Fourth Edition of &quot;Antiquity of Man&quot; restores Pleistocene and identifies it with Post-Pliocene. As this work was posthumous, no more was heard from Lyell. Living or deceased, his work was immensely popular among scientists and laymen alike. &quot;Pleistocene&quot; caught on immediately; it is entirely possible that he restored it by popular demand. In 1880 Dawkins published &quot;The Three Pleistocene Strata&quot; containing a new manifesto for British archaeology:
The continuity between geology, prehistoric archaeology and history is so direct that it is impossible to picture early man in this country without using the results of all these three sciences.

He intends to use archaeology and geology to &quot;draw aside the veil&quot; covering the situations of the peoples mentioned in proto-historic documents, such as Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; and the &quot;Agricola&quot; of Tacitus. Adopting Lyell&#x27;s scheme of the Tertiary, he divides Pleistocene into Early, Mid- and Late. Only the Palaeolithic falls into the Pleistocene; the Neolithic is in the &quot;Prehistoric Period&quot; subsequent. Dawkins defines what was to become the Upper, Middle and Lower Paleolithic, except that he calls them the &quot;Upper Cave-Earth and Breccia&quot;, the &quot;Middle Cave-Earth&quot;, and the &quot;Lower Red Sand&quot;, with reference to the names of the layers. The next year, 1881, Geikie solidified the terminology into Upper and Lower Palaeolithic:
In Kent&#x27;s Cave the implements obtained from the lower stages were of a much ruder description than the various objects detected in the upper cave-earth ... And a very long time must have elapsed between the formation of the lower and upper Palaeolithic beds in that cave.

The Middle Paleolithic in the modern sense made its appearance in 1911 in the 1st edition of William Johnson Sollas&#x27; &quot;Ancient Hunters&quot;. It had been used in varying senses before then. Sollas associates the period with the Mousterian technology and the relevant modern people with the Tasmanians. In the 2nd edition of 1915 he has changed his mind for reasons that are not clear. The Mousterian has been moved to the Lower Paleolithic and the people changed to the Australian aborigines; furthermore, the association has been made with Neanderthals and the Levalloisian added. Sollas says wistfully that they are in &quot;the very middle of the Palaeolithic epoch&quot;. Whatever his reasons, the public would have none of it. From 1911 on, Mousterian was Middle Paleolithic, except for holdouts. Alfred L. Kroeber in 1920, &quot;Three essays on the antiquity and races of man,&quot; reverting to Lower Paleolithic, explains that he is following Gabriel de Mortillet. The English-speaking public remained with Middle Paleolithic.

===Early and late from Worsaae through the three-stage African system===
Thomsen had formalized the Three-age System by the time of its publication in 1836. The next step forward was the formalization of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic by Sir John Lubbock in 1865. Between these two times Denmark held the lead in archaeology, especially because of the work of Thomsen&#x27;s at first junior associate and then successor, Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, rising in the last year of his life to Kultus Minister of Denmark. Lubbock offers full tribute and credit to him in &quot;Prehistoric Times&quot;.

Worsaae in 1862 in &quot;Om Tvedelingen af Steenalderen&quot;, previewed in English even before its publication by &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, concerned about changes in typology during each period, proposed a bipartite division of each age:Both for Bronze and Stone it was now evident that a few hundred years would not suffice. In fact, good grounds existed for dividing each of these periods into two, if not more.
He called them earlier or later. The three ages became six periods. The British seized on the concept immediately. Worsaae&#x27;s earlier and later became Lubbock&#x27;s palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but alternatively English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell&#x27;s 1883 edition of &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, with older and younger as synonyms. As there is no room for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which would have resulted in such terms as early early Stone Age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie&#x27;s upper and lower Paleolithic.

Amongst African archaeologists, the terms Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age are preferred.

===Wallace&#x27;s grand revolution recycled===
When Sir John Lubbock was doing the preliminary work for his 1865 &quot;magnum opus&quot;, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were jointly publishing their first papers &quot;On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection&quot;. Darwins&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; came out in 1859, but he did not elucidate the theory of evolution as it applies to man until the Descent of Man in 1871. Meanwhile, Wallace read a paper in 1864 to the Anthropological Society of London that was a major influence on Sir John, publishing in the very next year. He quoted Wallace:From the moment when the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, the first seed sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of the world&#x27;s history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe,—a being who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance in mind.
Wallace distinguishing between mind and body was asserting that natural selection shaped the form of man only until the appearance of mind; after then, it played no part. Mind formed modern man, meaning that result of mind, culture. Its appearance overthrew the laws of nature. Wallace used the term &quot;grand revolution&quot;. Although Lubbock believed that Wallace had gone too far in that direction he did adopt a theory of evolution combined with the revolution of culture. Neither Wallace nor Lubbock offered any explanation of how the revolution came about, or felt that they had to offer one. Revolution is an acceptance that in the continuous evolution of objects and events sharp and inexplicable disconformities do occur, as in geology. And so it is not surprising that in the 1874 Stockholm meeting of the International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archaeology, in response to Ernst Hamy&#x27;s denial of any &quot;break&quot; between Paleolithic and Neolithic based on material from dolmens near Paris &quot;showing a continuity between the paleolithic and neolithic folks,&quot; Edouard Desor, geologist and archaeologist, replied: &quot;that the introduction of domesticated animals was a complete revolution and enables us to separate the two epochs completely.&quot;

A revolution as defined by Wallace and adopted by Lubbock is a change of regime, or rules. If man was the new rule-setter through culture then the initiation of each of Lubbock&#x27;s four periods might be regarded as a change of rules and therefore as a distinct revolution, and so &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a reference work, in 1879 portrayed each of them as:...an advance in knowledge and civilization which amounted to a revolution in the then existing manners and customs of the world.
Because of the controversy over Westropp&#x27;s Mesolithic and Mortillet&#x27;s Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic–Neolithic boundary as an explanation of the gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a standard term, the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There are quite a large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a Neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same time. For that is the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.

===Vere Gordon Childe&#x27;s revolution for the masses===
In 1936 a champion came forward who would advance the Neolithic Revolution into the mainstream view: Vere Gordon Childe. After giving the Neolithic Revolution scant mention in his first notable work, the 1928 edition of &quot;New Light on the Most Ancient East&quot;, Childe made a major presentation in the first edition of &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot; in 1936 developing Wallace&#x27;s and Lubbock&#x27;s theme of the human revolution against the supremacy of nature and supplying detail on two revolutions, the Paleolithic–Neolithic and the Neolithic–Bronze Age, which he called the Second or Urban revolution.

Lubbock had been as much of an ethnologist as an archaeologist. The founders of cultural anthropology, such as Tylor and Morgan, were to follow his lead on that. Lubbock created such concepts as savages and barbarians based on the customs of then modern tribesmen and made the presumption that the terms can be applied without serious inaccuracy to the men of the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Childe broke with this view:The assumption that any savage tribe today is primitive, in the sense that its culture faithfully reflects that of much more ancient men is gratuitous.

Childe concentrated on the inferences to be made from the artifacts:But when the tools ... are considered ... in their totality, they may reveal much more. They disclose not only the level of technical skill ... but also their economy ... The archaeologists&#x27;s ages correspond roughly to economic stages. Each new &quot;age&quot; is ushered in by an economic revolution ...

The archaeological periods were indications of economic ones:Archaeologists can define a period when it was apparently the sole economy, the sole organization of production ruling anywhere on the earth&#x27;s surface.
These periods could be used to supplement historical ones where history was not available. He reaffirmed Lubbock&#x27;s view that the Paleolithic was an age of food gathering and the Neolithic an age of food production. He took a stand on the question of the Mesolithic identifying it with the Epipaleolithic. The Mesolithic was to him &quot;a mere continuance of the Old Stone Age mode of life&quot; between the end of the Pleistocene and the start of the Neolithic. Lubbock&#x27;s terms &quot;savagery&quot; and &quot;barbarism&quot; do not much appear in &quot;Man Makes Himself&quot; but the sequel, &quot;What Happened in History&quot; (1942), reuses them (attributing them to Morgan, who got them from Lubbock) with an economic significance: savagery for food-gathering and barbarism for Neolithic food production. Civilization begins with the urban revolution of the Bronze Age.

===The Pre-pottery Neolithic of Garstang and Kenyon at Jericho===
Even as Childe was developing this revolution theme the ground was sinking under him. Lubbock did not find any pottery associated with the Paleolithic, asserting of its to him last period, the Reindeer, &quot;no fragments of metal or pottery have yet been found.&quot; He did not generalize but others did not hesitate to do so. The next year, 1866, Dawkins proclaimed of Neolithic people that &quot;these invented the use of pottery...&quot; From then until the 1930s pottery was considered a sine qua non of the Neolithic. The term Pre-Pottery Age came into use in the late 19th century but it meant Paleolithic.

Meanwhile, the Palestine Exploration Fund founded in 1865 completing its survey of excavatable sites in Palestine in 1880 began excavating in 1890 at the site of ancient Lachish near Jerusalem, the first of a series planned under the licensing system of the Ottoman Empire. Under their auspices in 1908 Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger began excavation at Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) previously excavated for the first time by Sir Charles Warren in 1868. They discovered a Neolithic and Bronze Age city there. Subsequent excavations in the region by them and others turned up other walled cities that appear to have preceded the Bronze Age urbanization.

All excavation ceased for World War I. When it was over the Ottoman Empire was no longer a factor there. In 1919 the new British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem assumed archaeological operations in Palestine. John Garstang finally resumed excavation at Jericho 1930–1936. The renewed dig uncovered another 3000 years of prehistory that was in the Neolithic but did not make use of pottery. He called it the Pre-pottery Neolithic, as opposed to the Pottery Neolithic, subsequently often called the Aceramic or Pre-ceramic and Ceramic Neolithic.

Kathleen Kenyon was a young photographer then with a natural talent for archaeology. Solving a number of dating problems she soon advanced to the forefront of British archaeology through skill and judgement. In World War II she served as a commander in the Red Cross. In 1952–1958 she took over operations at Jericho as the Director of the British School, verifying and expanding Garstang&#x27;s work and conclusions. There were two Pre-pottery Neolithic periods, she concluded, A and B. Moreover, the PPN had been discovered at most of the major Neolithic sites in the near East and Greece. By this time her personal stature in archaeology was at least equal to that of V. Gordon Childe. While the three-age system was being attributed to Childe in popular fame, Kenyon became gratuitously the discoverer of the PPN. More significantly the question of revolution or evolution of the Neolithic was increasingly being brought before the professional archaeologists.

==Bronze Age subdivisions==
Danish archaeology took the lead in defining the Bronze Age, with little of the controversy surrounding the Stone Age. British archaeologists patterned their own excavations after those of the Danish, which they followed avidly in the media. References to the Bronze Age in British excavation reports began in the 1820s contemporaneously with the new system being promulgated by C.J. Thomsen. Mention of the Early and Late Bronze Age began in the 1860s following the bipartite definitions of Worsaae.

===The tripartite system of Sir John Evans===
In 1874 at the Stockholm meeting of the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, a suggestion was made by A. Bertrand that no distinct age of bronze had existed, that the bronze artifacts discovered were really part of the Iron Age. Hans Hildebrand in refutation pointed to two Bronze Ages and a transitional period in Scandinavia. John Evans denied any defect of continuity between the two and asserted there were three Bronze Ages, &quot;the early, middle and late Bronze Age&quot;.

His view for the Stone Age, following Lubbock, was quite different, denying, in &quot;The Ancient Stone Implements&quot;, any concept of a Middle Stone Age. In his 1881 parallel work, &quot;The Ancient Bronze Implements&quot;, he affirmed and further defined the three periods, strangely enough recusing himself from his previous terminology, Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age (the current forms) in favor of &quot;an earlier and later stage&quot; and &quot;middle&quot;. He uses Bronze Age, Bronze Period, Bronze-using Period and Bronze Civilization interchangeably. Apparently Evans was sensitive of what had gone before, retaining the terminology of the bipartite system while proposing a tripartite one. After stating a catalogue of types of bronze implements he defines his system:The Bronze Age of Britain may, therefore, be regarded as an aggregate of three stages: the first, that characterized by the flat or slightly flanged celts, and the knife-daggers ... the second, that characterized by the more heavy dagger-blades and the flanged celts and tanged spear-heads or daggers, ... and the third, by palstaves and socketed celts and the many forms of tools and weapons, ... It is in this third stage that the bronze sword and the true socketed spear-head first make their advent.

===Copper Age or Chalcolithic===
In chapter 1 of his work, Evans proposes for the first time a transitional Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze. He does not know how to classify this fourth age. On the one hand he distinguishes it from the Bronze Age. On the other hand, he includes it:In thus speaking of a bronze-using period I by no means wish to exclude the possible use of copper unalloyed with tin.

Evans goes into considerable detail tracing references to the metals in classical literature: Latin &quot;aer, aeris&quot; and Greek &quot;&quot; first for &quot;copper&quot; and then for &quot;bronze&quot;. He does not mention the adjective of &quot;aes&quot;, which is &quot;aēneus&quot;, nor is he interested in formulating New Latin words for the Copper Age, which is good enough for him and many English authors from then on. He offers literary proof that bronze had been in use before iron and copper before bronze.

In 1884 the center of archaeological interest shifted to Italy with the excavation of Remedello and the discovery of the Remedello culture by Gaetano Chierici. According to his 1886 biographers, Luigi Pigorini and Pellegrino Strobel, Chierici devised the term Età Eneo-litica to describe the archaeological context of his findings, which he believed were the remains of Pelasgians, or people that preceded Greek and Latin speakers in the Mediterranean. The age (Età) was:A period of transition from the age of stone to that of bronze (periodo di transizione dall&#x27;età della pietra a quella del bronzo)
Whether intentional or not, the definition was the same as Evans&#x27;, except that Chierici was adding a term to New Latin. He describes the transition by stating the beginning (litica, or Stone Age) and the ending (eneo-, or Bronze Age); in English, &quot;the stone-to-bronze period&quot;. Shortly after, &quot;Eneolithic&quot; or &quot;Aeneolithic&quot; began turning up in scholarly English as a synonym for &quot;Copper Age&quot;. Sir John&#x27;s own son, Arthur Evans, beginning to come into his own as an archaeologist and already studying Cretan civilization, refers in 1895 to some clay figures of &quot;aeneolithic date&quot; (quotes his).

==End of the Iron Age==

The three-age system is a way of dividing prehistory, and the Iron Age is therefore considered to end in a particular culture with either the start of its protohistory, when it begins to be written about by outsiders, or when its own historiography begins. Although iron is still the major hard material in use in modern civilization, and steel is a vital and indispensable modern industry, as far as archaeologists are concerned the Iron Age has therefore now ended for all cultures in the world.

The date when it is taken to end varies greatly between cultures, and in many parts of the world there was no Iron Age at all, for example in Pre-Columbian America and the prehistory of Australia. For these regions the three-age system is uncommon. By convention among archaeologists:

* In the Ancient Near East, the Iron Age is taken to end with the start of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC.
* In South Asia the start of the Maurya Empire about 320 BC is usually taken as the endpoint.
* In Greece, the Iron Age begins with the Greek Dark Ages and ends with the Greek Classical Age.
* In Western Europe, the Iron Age ends with the Roman conquest.
* In Scandinavia and other parts of northern Europe that the Romans did not reach, the Iron Age continues until the start of the Viking Age in about 800 AD.
* In China, the &quot;Iron Age&quot; ends with the start of the Qin dynasty and the beginning of the Imperial Era.

==Dating==

The question of the dates of the objects and events discovered through archaeology is the prime concern of any system of thought that seeks to summarize history through the formulation of ages or epochs. An age is defined through comparison of contemporaneous events. Increasingly, the terminology of archaeology is parallel to that of historical method. An event is &quot;undocumented&quot; until it turns up in the archaeological record. Fossils and artifacts are &quot;documents&quot; of the epochs hypothesized. The correction of dating errors is therefore a major concern.

In the case where parallel epochs defined in history were available, elaborate efforts were made to align European and Near Eastern sequences with the datable chronology of Ancient Egypt and other known civilizations. The resulting grand sequence was also spot checked by evidence of calculateable solar or other astronomical events. These methods are only available for the relatively short term of recorded history. Most prehistory does not fall into that category.

Physical science provides at least two general groups of dating methods, stated below. Data collected by these methods is intended to provide an absolute chronology to the framework of periods defined by relative chronology.

===Grand systems of layering===
The initial comparisons of artifacts defined periods that were local to a site, group of sites or region.
Advances made in the fields of seriation, typology, stratification and the associative dating of artifacts and features permitted even greater refinement of the system. The ultimate development is the reconstruction of a global catalogue of layers (or as close to it as possible) with different sections attested in different regions. Ideally once the layer of the artifact or event is known a quick lookup of the layer in the grand system will provide a ready date. This is considered the most reliable method. It is used for calibration of the less reliable chemical methods.

===Measurement of chemical change===
Any material sample contains elements and compounds that are subject to decay into other elements and compounds. In cases where the rate of decay is predictable and the proportions of initial and end products can be known exactly, consistent dates of the artifact can be calculated. Due to the problem of sample contamination and variability of the natural proportions of the materials in the media, sample analysis in the case where verification can be checked by grand layering systems has often been found to be widely inaccurate. Chemical dates therefore are only considered reliable used in conjunction with other methods. They are collected in groups of data points that form a pattern when graphed. Isolated dates are not considered reliable.

==Three-age system resumptive table==

* Formation of states starts during the Early Bronze Age in Egypt and Mesopotamia and during the Late Bronze Age first empires are founded.

==Criticism==
The Three-age System has been criticized since at least the 19th century. Every phase of its development has been contested. Some of the arguments that have been presented against it follow.

===Unsound epochalism===
In some cases criticism resulted in other, parallel three-age systems, such as the concepts expressed by Lewis Henry Morgan in &quot;Ancient Society&quot;, based on ethnology. These disagreed with the metallic basis of epochization. The critic generally substituted his own definitions of epochs. Vere Gordon Childe said of the early cultural anthropologists:Last century Herbert Spencer, Lewis H. Morgan and Tylor propounded divergent schemes ... they arranged these in a logical order ... They assumed that the logical order was a temporal one... The competing systems of Morgan and Tylor remained equally unverified – and incompatible – theories.
More recently, many archaeologists have questioned the validity of dividing time into epochs at all. For example, one recent critic, Graham Connah, describes the three-age system as &quot;epochalism&quot; and asserts:So many archaeological writers have used this model for so long that for many readers it has taken on a reality of its own. In spite of the theoretical agonizing of the last half-century, epochalism is still alive and well ... Even in parts of the world where the model is still in common use, it needs to be accepted that, for example, there never was actually such a thing as &#x27;the Bronze Age.&#x27;

===Over-simplification===
Some view the three-age system as overly simple; that is, it neglects vital detail and forces complex circumstances into a mold they do not fit. Rowlands argues that the division of human societies into epochs based on the presumption of a single set of related changes is not realistic:But as a more rigorous sociological approach has begun to show that changes at the economic, political and ideological levels are not &#x27;all of apiece&#x27; we have come to realise that time may be segmented in as many ways as convenient to the researcher concerned.
The three-age system is a relative chronology. The explosion of archaeological data acquired in the 20th century was intended to elucidate the relative chronology in detail. One consequence was the collection of absolute dates. Connah argues:As radiocarbon and other forms of absolute dating contributed more detailed and more reliable chronologies, the epochal model ceased to be necessary.

Peter Bogucki of Princeton University summarizes the perspective taken by many modern archaeologists:
Although modern archaeologists realize that this tripartite division of prehistoric society is far too simple to reflect the complexity of change and continuity, terms like &#x27;Bronze Age&#x27; are still used as a very general way of focusing attention on particular times and places and thus facilitating archaeological discussion.

===Eurocentrism===
Another common criticism attacks the broader application of the three-age system as a cross-cultural model for social change. The model was originally designed to explain data from Europe and West Asia, but archaeologists have also attempted to use it to explain social and technological developments in other parts of the world such as the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. Many archaeologists working in these regions have criticized this application as eurocentric. Graham Connah writes that:
... attempts by Eurocentric archaeologists to apply the model to African archaeology have produced little more than confusion, whereas in the Americas or Australasia it has been irrelevant, ...
Alice B. Kehoe further explains this position as it relates to American archaeology:
... Professor Wilson&#x27;s presentation of prehistoric archaeology was a European product carried across the Atlantic to promote an American science compatible with its European model.
Kehoe goes on to complain of Wilson that &quot;he accepted and reprised the idea that the European course of development was paradigmatic for humankind.&quot; This criticism argues that the different societies of the world underwent social and technological developments in different ways. A sequence of events that describes the developments of one civilization may not necessarily apply to another, in this view. Instead social and technological developments must be described within the context of the society being studied.

<doc id="31296" wikidata="Q41995" url="?curid=31296" title="Tachyon">
<text>A tachyon () or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always travels faster than light. Physicists believe that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are inconsistent with the known laws of physics. If such particles did exist they could be used to send signals faster than light and into the past. According to the theory of relativity this would violate causality, leading to logical paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox. Tachyons would exhibit the unusual property of increasing in speed as their energy decreases, and would require infinite energy to slow to the speed of light. No verifiable experimental evidence for the existence of such particles has been found.

In the 1967 paper that coined the term, Gerald Feinberg proposed that tachyonic particles could be made from excitations of a quantum field with imaginary mass. However, it was soon realized that Feinberg&#x27;s model did not in fact allow for superluminal (faster than light) particles or signals and that tachyonic fields merely give rise to instabilities, not causality violations. The term tachyonic field refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to faster-than-light particles.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;tachyon&quot; comes from the , &quot;tachus&quot;, meaning &quot;swift&quot;. The complementary particle types are called luxons (which always move at the speed of light) and bradyons (which always move slower than light); both of these particle types are known to exist.

== History ==
The first hypothesis regarding faster-than-light particles is sometimes attributed to physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, who, in 1904, named them &quot;meta-particles&quot;. The possibility of existence of faster-than-light particles was also proposed by in 1923.

The term &quot;tachyon&quot; was coined by Gerald Feinberg in a 1967 paper titled &quot;Possibility of faster-than-light particles&quot;. He had been inspired by the science-fiction story &quot;Beep&quot; by James Blish. Feinberg studied the kinematics of such particles according to special relativity. In his paper, he also introduced fields with imaginary mass (now also referred to as tachyons) in an attempt to understand the microphysical origin such particles might have.

Oleksa-Myron Bilanuik, Vijay Deshpande and E. C. George Sudarshan discussed this more recently in their 1962 paper on the topic and in 1969.

In September 2011, it was reported that a tau neutrino had traveled faster than the speed of light; however, later updates from CERN on the OPERA experiment indicate that the faster-than-light readings were due to a faulty element of the experiment&#x27;s fibre optic timing system.

== Special relativity ==
In special relativity, a faster-than-light particle would have spacelike four-momentum, unlike ordinary particles that have time-like four-momentum. While some theories suggest the mass of tachyons is imaginary, modern formulations often consider their mass to be real, with redefined formulas for momentum and energy. Additionally, since tachyons are confined to the spacelike portion of the energy–momentum graph, they cannot slow down to subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds.

=== Mass ===
In a Lorentz invariant theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called bradyons in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular, the energy–momentum relation:
:formula_1
(where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:
:formula_2
This equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the &quot;rest mass–energy&quot;) and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy. When formula_3 (the particle&#x27;s velocity) is larger than formula_4 (the speed of light), the denominator in the equation for the energy is imaginary, as the value under the square root is negative. Because the total energy of the particle must be real (and not a complex or imaginary number) in order to have any practical meaning as a measurement, the numerator must &quot;also&quot; be imaginary (i.e. the rest mass &quot;m&quot; must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number).

In some modern formulations of the theory, the mass of tachyons is regarded as real.

=== Speed ===
One curious effect is that, unlike ordinary particles, the speed of a tachyon &quot;increases&quot; as its energy decreases. In particular, formula_5 approaches zero when formula_3 approaches infinity. (For ordinary bradyonic matter, &quot;formula_5&quot; increases with increasing speed, becoming arbitrarily large as &quot;formula_3&quot; approaches formula_4, the speed of light.) Therefore, just as bradyons are forbidden to break the light-speed barrier, so are tachyons forbidden from slowing down to below &quot;c&quot;, because infinite energy is required to reach the barrier from either above or below.

As noted by Albert Einstein, Richard C. Tolman, and others, special relativity implies that faster-than-light particles, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time.

=== Neutrinos ===
In 1985, Chodos proposed that neutrinos can have a tachyonic nature. The possibility of standard model particles moving at faster-than-light speeds can be modeled using Lorentz invariance violating terms, for example in the Standard-Model Extension. In this framework, neutrinos experience Lorentz-violating oscillations and can travel faster than light at high energies. This proposal was strongly criticized.

=== Superluminal information ===
If tachyons can transmit information faster than light, then, according to relativity, they violate causality, leading to logical paradoxes of the &quot;kill your own grandfather&quot; type. This is often illustrated with thought experiments such as the &quot;tachyon telephone paradox&quot; or &quot;logically pernicious self-inhibitor.&quot;

The problem can be understood in terms of the relativity of simultaneity in special relativity, which says that different inertial reference frames will disagree on whether two events at different locations happened &quot;at the same time&quot; or not, and they can also disagree on the order of the two events. (Technically, these disagreements occur when the spacetime interval between the events is &#x27;space-like&#x27;, meaning that neither event lies in the future light cone of the other.)

If one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at another location, then, as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was received before it was sent, so that the signal could be said to have moved backward in time. Because one of the two fundamental postulates of special relativity says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every inertial frame, if it is possible for signals to move backward in time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves faster than light in A&#x27;s frame but backwards in time in B&#x27;s frame, and then B sends a reply which moves faster than light in B&#x27;s frame but backwards in time in A&#x27;s frame, it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the original signal, challenging causality in &quot;every&quot; frame and opening the door to severe logical paradoxes. This is known as the tachyonic antitelephone.

==== Reinterpretation principle ====
The reinterpretation principle asserts that a tachyon sent &quot;back&quot; in time can always be &quot;reinterpreted&quot; as a tachyon traveling &quot;forward&quot; in time, because observers cannot distinguish between the emission and absorption of tachyons. The attempt to &quot;detect&quot; a tachyon &quot;from&quot; the future (and violate causality) would actually &quot;create&quot; the same tachyon and send it &quot;forward&quot; in time (which is causal).

However, this principle is not widely accepted as resolving the paradoxes. Instead, what would be required to avoid paradoxes is that, unlike any known particle, tachyons do not interact in any way and can never be detected or observed, because otherwise a tachyon beam could be modulated and used to create an anti-telephone or a &quot;logically pernicious self-inhibitor&quot;. All forms of energy are believed to interact at least gravitationally, and many authors state that superluminal propagation in Lorentz invariant theories always leads to causal paradoxes.

== Fundamental models ==
In modern physics, all fundamental particles are regarded as excitations of quantum fields. There are several distinct ways in which tachyonic particles could be embedded into a field theory.

=== Fields with imaginary mass ===
In the paper that coined the term &quot;tachyon&quot;, Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass. Because the group velocity for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, the negative mass represents an instability to tachyon condensation, and all excitations of the field propagate subluminally and are consistent with causality. Despite having no faster-than-light propagation, such fields are referred to simply as &quot;tachyons&quot; in many sources.

Tachyonic fields play an important role in modern physics. Perhaps the most famous is the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, which has an imaginary mass in its uncondensed phase. In general, the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is closely related to tachyon condensation, plays an important role in many aspects of theoretical physics, including the Ginzburg–Landau and BCS theories of superconductivity. Another example of a tachyonic field is the tachyon of bosonic string theory.

Tachyons are predicted by bosonic string theory and also the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and NS-NS sectors, which are respectively the open bosonic sector and closed bosonic sector, of RNS superstring theory prior to the GSO projection. However such tachyons are not possible due to the Sen conjecture, also known as tachyon condensation. This resulted in the necessity for the GSO projection.

=== Lorentz-violating theories ===
In theories that do not respect Lorentz invariance, the speed of light is not (necessarily) a barrier, and particles can travel faster than the speed of light without infinite energy or causal paradoxes. A class of field theories of that type is the so-called Standard Model extensions. However, the experimental evidence for Lorentz invariance is extremely good, so such theories are very tightly constrained.

=== Fields with non-canonical kinetic term ===
By modifying the kinetic energy of the field, it is possible to produce Lorentz invariant field theories with excitations that propagate superluminally. However, such theories, in general, do not have a well-defined Cauchy problem (for reasons related to the issues of causality discussed above), and are probably inconsistent quantum mechanically.

== In fiction ==
Tachyons have appeared in many works of fiction. They have been used as a standby mechanism upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish faster-than-light communication, with or without reference to causality issues. The word &quot;tachyon&quot; has become widely recognized to such an extent that it can impart a science-fictional connotation even if the subject in question has no particular relation to superluminal travel (a form of technobabble, akin to &quot;positronic brain&quot;).

<text>The Starlost is a Canadian-produced science fiction television series created by writer Harlan Ellison and broadcast in 1973 on CTV in Canada and syndicated to local stations in the United States. The show&#x27;s setting is a huge generational colony spacecraft called &quot;Earthship Ark&quot;, which following an unspecified accident has gone off course. Centuries after its original launch however, most of the descendants of the original crew and colonists are unaware that they are even aboard a spaceship. The series experienced a number of production difficulties, and Ellison broke with the project before the airing of its first episode.

== Premise ==
Foreseeing the destruction of Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called &quot;Earthship Ark&quot;, wide and long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres, each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures. Their goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. In 2385, more than 100 years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the ship goes into emergency mode in which each biosphere is sealed off from the others.

In 2790, 405 years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident of Cypress Corners, an agrarian community with a culture resembling that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth (Robin Ward), Devon finds out that the Cypress Corners elders have been deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call &quot;The Voice of The Creator&quot;. The congregation pursues Devon for attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key to a dark mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship and accesses a computer data station, which explains the nature and the purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.

When Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them. When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon. Eventually they make their way to the ship&#x27;s bridge, containing the skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged, and its control systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun and realize that the only way to save the Ark and its passengers is to find the backup bridge at the other end of the Ark and to reactivate the navigation and propulsion systems.

Getting to the other end of the Ark, which is potentially hundreds of miles away, involves traveling through the many disparate communities on the starship, some of which are hostile to outsiders, and all of which have different social customs, belief systems and law enforcement practices. Generally, each episode will have Devon, Rachel, and Garth encountering a new society or group as they work their way through the ship. Occasionally, they are aided (or hindered) in their travels by the ship&#x27;s frustrating and only partially-functioning computer system interface, known as Mu Lambda 165 (portrayed by William Osler, who also provided the opening narration for each episode).

== Development and production ==
20th Century Fox was involved in the project with Douglas Trumbull as executive producer. The science fiction writer and editor Ben Bova was brought in as science advisor.

Harlan Ellison was approached by Robert Kline, a 20th Century Fox television producer, to come up with an idea for a science fiction TV series consisting of eight episodes, to pitch to the BBC as a co-production in February 1973. The BBC rejected the idea. Unable to sell &quot;The Starlost&quot; for prime time, Kline decided to pursue a low budget approach and produce it for syndication. By May, Kline had sold the idea to 48 NBC stations and the Canadian CTV network.

Ellison claimed that to get Canadian government subsidies, the production was shot in Canada, and Canadian writers produced the scripts from story outlines by Ellison. However, several produced episodes were written entirely by American writers.

Before Ellison could begin work on the show&#x27;s production bible, a writers&#x27; strike began, running from March 6 to June 24. Kline negotiated an exception with the Writer&#x27;s Guild, on the grounds that the production was wholly Canadian – and Ellison went to work on a bible for the series.

Originally, the show was to be filmed with a special effects camera system developed by Doug Trumbull called Magicam. The system comprised two cameras, the motion of which was controlled by servos. One camera would film actors against a blue screen, and the other would shoot a model background. The motion of both cameras was synchronized and scaled appropriately, allowing both the camera and the actors to move through model sets. The technology did not work reliably, however. In the end, simple blue screen effects were used, which forced static camera shots.

The failure of the Magicam system was a major blow, as the Canadian studio space that had been rented was too small to build the required sets. In the end, partial sets were built, but the lack of space hampered production.

As the filming went on, Ellison grew disenchanted with the budget cuts, details that were changed, and what he characterized as a progressive dumbing down of the story. Ellison&#x27;s dissatisfaction extended to the new title of the pilot episode; he had titled it &quot;Phoenix without Ashes&quot; but it was changed to &quot;Voyage of Discovery&quot;.

Before the production of the pilot episode was completed, Ellison invoked a clause in his contract to force the producers to use his alternative registered writer&#x27;s name of &quot;Cordwainer Bird&quot; on the end credits.

Sixteen episodes were made. Fox decided not to pick up the options for the remainder of the series.

== Reception and impact==
On March 31, 1974, Ellison received a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay for the original script (the pilot script as originally written, not the version that was filmed). A novelization of the script by Edward Bryant, &quot;Phoenix Without Ashes&quot;, was published in 1975 and contained a lengthy foreword by Ellison describing what had gone on in production. In 2010, the novel was adapted into comic book form by IDW Publishing.

Ben Bova, in an editorial in &quot;Analog Science Fiction&quot; (June 1974) and in interviews in fanzines, made it clear how disgruntled he had been as science adviser. In 1975, he published a novel entitled &quot;The Starcrossed&quot;, depicting a scientist taken on as a science adviser for a terrible science fiction series.

From contemporary reviews, Michael Walsh in &quot;The Province&quot; commented on the first episode, writing that he found the model work on the show impressive while concluding it was &quot;written, directed, acted, lit, photographed, recorded and edited like a church basement production&quot;.

&quot;The Starlost&quot; has received a generally negative reception from historians of science fiction television: &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; described &quot;The Starlost&quot; as &quot;dire&quot;, while &quot;The Best of Science Fiction TV&quot; included &quot;The Starlost&quot; in its list of the &quot;Worst Science Fiction Shows of All Time&quot;.

== Episodes ==
The &quot;Starlog Photo Guidebook TV Episode Guides Volume 1&quot; (1981) lists two unfilmed episodes, &quot;God That Died&quot; and &quot;People in the Dark.&quot; The latter episode, written by George Salverson, follows Devon, Rachel, and Garth as they discover a dome in which people have been living in the dark since the accident to the Ark.

Episodes of the original series were rebroadcast in 1978 and further in 1982. A number of episodes were also edited together to create movie-length installments that were sold to cable television broadcasters in the late 1980s.

== Commercial releases ==
All 16 episodes were at one time available in a VHS boxed set.

The first DVD release was limited to the five feature-length edited versions.

In September/October 2008, the full series was released on DVD by VCI Entertainment. Aside from the digitally remastered episodes, a &quot;presentation reel&quot; created for potential broadcasters is also included. Hosted by Dullea and Trumbull, and predating Ellison&#x27;s departure as he is credited under his own name with creating the series, the short feature includes sample footage using the later-abandoned Magicam technology, some filmed special effects footage taken from other productions along with model footage from the film &quot;Silent Running&quot; to represent the &quot;Earthship Ark&quot; concept, and a different series logo.

In early 2019, a Roku channel began airing &quot;The Starlost&quot; as its only program.

<text>Tora Bora (, &quot;Black Cave&quot;) is a cave complex, part of the Spin Ghar (White Mountains) mountain range of eastern Afghanistan. It is situated in the Pachir Aw Agam District of Nangarhar, approximately west of the Khyber Pass and north of the border of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Tora Bora and the surrounding Spin Ghar range had natural caverns formed by streams eating into the limestone, that had later been expanded into a CIA-financed complex built for the Afghan mujahideen. Tora Bora was known to be a stronghold location of the Afghan mujahideen, used by military forces against the Soviet Union during the 1980s. 

==Geology==
The geology of Tora Bora is predominantly metamorphic gneiss and schist.

==History==

===Military base===
In October and November 1980, during Operation &quot;Shkval&quot;, this complex was taken by the &quot;Kaskad&quot; special forces unit of the USSR KGB, together with the 66th motorized rifle brigade of the 40th Army of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. As Colonel Valentin Gerasimenko wrote about the first assault, “By that time, Tora Bora was still a little-known, but already covered with a veil of mystery, the base of the Dushmans. Only later will it surpass the Panjshir Valley in its glory and fame, in the number of assaults and destruction”.

June 18–19, 1981 - in the province of Nangarhar, 85 km south of Jalalabad, in the area of the Afghan-Pakistani border, units of the Soviet 66th motorized rifle brigade and part of the Afghan 11th Jalalabad infantry division take the fortified area of the Mujahideen Tora Bora.

July 22–29, 1983 - operation in Tora-Bora of the 66th motorized rifle brigade.

The base at Tora Bora was developed as a CIA-financed complex built for the Mujahideen following the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and has been described by the western media as an &quot;impregnable cave fortress&quot; housing 2,000 men complete with a hospital, a hydroelectric power plant, offices, a hotel, arms and ammunition stores, roads large enough to drive a tank into, and sophisticated tunnel and ventilation systems.
During the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the cave complex was one of the strongholds of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, according to United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. It was the location of the December 2001 Battle of Tora Bora, and suspected hideout of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden which led his escape into neighboring Pakistan in January 2002. bin Laden and his family moved to a new compound in the village of Chak Shah Muhammad, a wealthy suburb of Bilal Town near Abbottabad on 6 January 2006. It was reported that in 2007, U.S. intelligence suspected bin Laden planned to meet with top Al-Qaeda and Taliban commanders at Tora Bora prior to the launch of a possible attack on Europe or the United States.

Both the British and American press published detailed plans of the base. When shown a plan during an NBC interview, Rumsfeld said, &quot;This is serious business; there&#x27;s not one of those, there are many of those&quot;.

An elaborate military operation was planned which included deployment of the CIA-US Special Operations Forces team with laser markers to guide non-stop heavy air strikes during 72 hours. When Tora Bora was eventually captured by the U.S. and Afghan troops, no traces of the supposed &quot;fortress&quot; were found despite painstaking searches in the surrounding areas. Tora Bora turned out to be a system of small natural caves housing, at most, 200 fighters. While arms and ammunition stores were found, there were no traces of the advanced facilities claimed to exist.

In a 2002 interview with by PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot;, a Staff Sergeant from the U.S. Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 572 described the caves:

The complex later was retaken by the Taliban, and served as an important base for the Taliban insurgency. In 2017, Tora Bora was attacked and captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-K), though the Afghan National Army soon recaptured it.

<doc id="31302" wikidata="Q69564" url="?curid=31302" title="Taiga">
<text>Taiga or tayga ( ; , ), also known as boreal forest or snow forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces, and larches. The taiga, or boreal forest, is the world&#x27;s largest land biome. In North America, it covers most of inland Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northern contiguous United States. In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean (including much of Siberia), much of Norway and Estonia, some of the Scottish Highlands, some lowland/coastal areas of Iceland, and areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (on the island of Hokkaidō).

The principal tree species, depending on the length of the growing season and summer temperatures, vary across the world. The taiga of North America is mostly spruce; Scandinavian and Finnish taiga consists of a mix of spruce, pines and birch; Russian taiga has spruces, pines and larches depending on the region; and the Eastern Siberian taiga is a vast larch forest.

Taiga in its current form is a relatively recent phenomenon, having only existed for the last 12,000 years since the beginning of the Holocene epoch, covering land that had been mammoth steppe or under the Scandinavian Ice Sheet in Eurasia and under the Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America during the Late Pleistocene.

Although at high elevations taiga grades into alpine tundra through Krummholz, it is not exclusively an alpine biome, and unlike subalpine forest, much of taiga is lowlands.

The term &quot;taiga&quot; is not used consistently by all cultures. In the English language, &quot;boreal forest&quot; is used in the United States and Canada in referring to more southerly regions, while &quot;taiga&quot; is used to describe the more northern, barren areas approaching the tree line and the tundra. Hoffman (1958) discusses the origin of this differential use in North America and how this differentiation distorts established Russian usage.

Climate change is a threat to taiga, and how the carbon dioxide absorbed or emitted should be treated by carbon accounting is controversial.

==Climate and geography==

Taiga covers or 11.5% of the Earth&#x27;s land area, second only to deserts and xeric shrublands. The largest areas are located in Russia and Canada. In Sweden taiga is associated with the Norrland terrain.

===Temperature===
After the permanent ice caps and tundra, taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures, with mean annual temperature generally varying from . Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra. There are taiga areas of eastern Siberia and interior Alaska-Yukon where the mean annual temperature reaches down to , and the lowest reliably recorded temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded in the taiga of northeastern Russia.

Taiga has a subarctic climate with very large temperature range between seasons. would be a typical winter day temperature and an average summer day, but the long, cold winter is the dominant feature. This climate is classified as &quot;Dfc&quot;, &quot;Dwc&quot;, &quot;Dsc&quot;, &quot;Dfd&quot; and &quot;Dwd&quot; in the Köppen climate classification scheme, meaning that the short summers (24 h average or more), although generally warm and humid, only last 1–3 months, while winters, with average temperatures below freezing, last 5–7 months.

In Siberian taiga the average temperature of the coldest month is between and . There are also some much smaller areas grading towards the oceanic &quot;Cfc&quot; climate with milder winters, whilst the extreme south and (in Eurasia) west of the taiga reaches into humid continental climates (&quot;Dfb&quot;, &quot;Dwb&quot;) with longer summers.

According to some sources, the boreal forest grades into a temperate mixed forest when mean annual temperature reaches about . Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas with mean annual temperature below freezing, whilst in the &quot;Dfd&quot; and &quot;Dwd&quot; climate zones continuous permafrost occurs and restricts growth to very shallow-rooted trees like Siberian larch.

===Growing season===

The growing season, when the vegetation in the taiga comes alive, is usually slightly longer than the climatic definition of summer as the plants of the boreal biome have a lower temperature threshold to trigger growth than other plants. Some sources claim 130 days growing season as typical for the taiga.

In Canada and Scandinavia, the growing season is often estimated by using the period of the year when the 24-hour average temperature is or more. For the Taiga Plains in Canada, growing season varies from 80 to 150 days, and in the Taiga Shield from 100 to 140 days.

Other sources define growing season by frost-free days. Data for locations in southwest Yukon gives 80–120 frost-free days. The closed canopy boreal forest in Kenozersky National Park near Plesetsk, Arkhangelsk Province, Russia, on average has 108 frost-free days.

The longest growing season is found in the smaller areas with oceanic influences; in coastal areas of Scandinavia and Finland, the growing season of the closed boreal forest can be 145–180 days. The shortest growing season is found at the northern taiga–tundra ecotone, where the northern taiga forest no longer can grow and the tundra dominates the landscape when the growing season is down to 50–70 days, and the 24-hr average of the warmest month of the year usually is or less.

High latitudes mean that the sun does not rise far above the horizon, and less solar energy is received than further south. But the high latitude also ensures very long summer days, as the sun stays above the horizon nearly 20 hours each day, or up to 24 hours, with only around 6 hours of daylight, or none, occurring in the dark winters, depending on latitude. The areas of the taiga inside the Arctic Circle have midnight sun in mid-summer and polar night in mid-winter.

===Precipitation===
The taiga experiences relatively low precipitation throughout the year (generally annually, in some areas), primarily as rain during the summer months, but also as snow or fog. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months in the northernmost extensions of the taiga biome.

The fog, especially predominant in low-lying areas during and after the thawing of frozen Arctic seas, stops sunshine from getting through to plants even during the long summer days. As evaporation is consequently low for most of the year, annual precipitation exceeds evaporation, and is sufficient to sustain the dense vegetation growth including large trees. This explains the striking difference in biomass per square metre between the Taiga and the Steppe biomes, (in warmer climates), where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, restricting vegetation to mostly grasses.

In general, taiga grows to the south of the July isotherm, occasionally as far north as the July isotherm, with the southern limit more variable. Depending on rainfall, and taiga may be replaced by forest steppe south of the July isotherm where rainfall is very low, but more typically extends south to the July isotherm, and locally where rainfall is higher, such as in eastern Siberia and adjacent Outer Manchuria, south to the July isotherm.

In these warmer areas the taiga has higher species diversity, with more warmth-loving species such as Korean pine, Jezo spruce, and Manchurian fir, and merges gradually into mixed temperate forest or, more locally (on the Pacific Ocean coasts of North America and Asia), into coniferous temperate rainforests where oak and hornbeam appear and join the conifers, birch and Populus tremula.

===Glaciation===
The area currently classified as taiga in Europe and North America (except Alaska) was recently glaciated. As the glaciers receded they left depressions in the topography that have since filled with water, creating lakes and bogs (especially muskeg soil) found throughout the taiga.

==Soils==

Taiga soil tends to be young and poor in nutrients, lacking the deep, organically enriched profile present in temperate deciduous forests. The colder climate hinders development of soil, and the ease with which plants can use its nutrients. The relative lack of deciduous trees, which drop huge volumes of leaves annually, and grazing animals, which contribute significant manure, are also factors. The diversity of soil organisms in the boreal forest is high, comparable to the tropical rainforest.

Fallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil. Acids from evergreen needles further leach the soil, creating spodosol, also known as podzol, and the acidic forest floor often has only lichens and some mosses growing on it. In clearings in the forest and in areas with more boreal deciduous trees, there are more herbs and berries growing, and soils are consequently deeper.

==Flora==

Since North America and Eurasia were originally connected by the Bering land bridge, a number of animal and plant species, more animals than plants, were able to colonize both land masses, and are globally-distributed throughout the taiga biome (see Circumboreal Region). Others differ regionally, typically with each genus having several distinct species, each occupying different regions of the taiga. Taigas also have some small-leaved deciduous trees, like birch, alder, willow, and poplar. These grow mostly in areas further south of the most extreme winter weather.

The Dahurian larch tolerates the coldest winters of the Northern Hemisphere, in eastern Siberia. The very southernmost parts of the taiga may have trees such as oak, maple, elm and lime scattered among the conifers, and there is usually a gradual transition into a temperate, mixed forest, such as the eastern forest-boreal transition of eastern Canada. In the interior of the continents, with the driest climates, the boreal forests might grade into temperate grassland.

There are two major types of taiga. The southern part is the closed canopy forest, consisting of many closely-spaced trees and mossy groundcover. In clearings in the forest, shrubs and wildflowers are common, such as the fireweed and lupine. The other type is the lichen woodland or sparse taiga, with trees that are farther-spaced and lichen groundcover; the latter is common in the northernmost taiga. In the northernmost taiga, the forest cover is not only more sparse, but often stunted in growth form; moreover, ice-pruned, asymmetric black spruce (in North America) are often seen, with diminished foliage on the windward side.

In Canada, Scandinavia and Finland, the boreal forest is usually divided into three subzones: The high boreal (northern boreal/taiga zone), the middle boreal (closed forest), and the southern boreal, a closed-canopy, boreal forest with some scattered temperate, deciduous trees among the conifers. Commonly seen are species such as maple, elm and oak. This southern boreal forest experiences the longest and warmest growing season of the biome. In some regions, including Scandinavia and western Russia, this subzone is commonly used for agricultural purposes.

The boreal forest is home to many types of berries. Some species are confined to the southern and middle closed-boreal forest (such as wild strawberry and partridgeberry); others grow in most areas of the taiga (such as cranberry and cloudberry). Some berries can grow in both the taiga and the lower arctic (southern regions) tundra, such as bilberry, bunchberry and lingonberry.

The forests of the taiga are largely coniferous, dominated by larch, spruce, fir and pine. The woodland mix varies according to geography and climate; for example, the Eastern Canadian forests ecoregion (of the higher elevations of the Laurentian Mountains and the northern Appalachian Mountains) in Canada is dominated by balsam fir &quot;Abies balsamea&quot;, while further north, the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga (of northern Quebec and Labrador) is mostly black spruce &quot;Picea mariana&quot; and tamarack larch &quot;Larix laricina&quot;.

Evergreen species in the taiga (spruce, fir, and pine) have a number of adaptations specifically for survival in harsh taiga winters, although larch, which is extremely cold-tolerant, is deciduous. Taiga trees tend to have shallow roots to take advantage of the thin soils, while many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing, called &quot;hardening&quot;. The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, also help them shed snow.

Because the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Pine, spruce and fir do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The adaptation of evergreen needles limits the water lost due to transpiration and their dark green color increases their absorption of sunlight. Although precipitation is not a limiting factor, the ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so desiccation can be a severe problem in late winter for evergreens.

Although the taiga is dominated by coniferous forests, some broadleaf trees also occur, including birch, aspen, willow, and rowan. Many smaller herbaceous plants, such as ferns and occasionally ramps grow closer to the ground. Periodic stand-replacing wildfires (with return times of between 20 and 200 years) clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some, e.g. jack pine have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground; certain species of fungi (such as morels) are also known to do this. Grasses grow wherever they can find a patch of sun; mosses and lichens thrive on the damp ground and on the sides of tree trunks. In comparison with other biomes, however, the taiga has low botanical diversity.

Coniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. Very few species, in four main genera, are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir, and one or two species of spruce, are dominant. Across Scandinavia and western Russia, the Scots pine is a common component of the taiga, while taiga of the Russian Far East and Mongolia is dominated by larch. Rich in spruce and Scots pine (in the western Siberian plain), the taiga is dominated by larch in Eastern Siberia, before returning to its original floristic richness on the Pacific shores. Two deciduous trees mingle throughout southern Siberia: birch and &quot;Populus tremula&quot;.

==Fauna==
The boreal forest/taiga supports a relatively small variety of highly specialized and adapted animals, due to the harshness of the climate. Canada&#x27;s boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects play a critical role as pollinators, decomposers, and as a part of the food web. Many nesting birds, rodents, and small carnivorous mammals rely on them for food in the summer months.

The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures. There are only a few species in the boreal forest, including red-sided garter snake, common European adder, blue-spotted salamander, northern two-lined salamander, Siberian salamander, wood frog, northern leopard frog, boreal chorus frog, American toad, and Canadian toad. Most hibernate underground in winter.

Fish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include Alaska blackfish, northern pike, walleye, longnose sucker, white sucker, various species of cisco, lake whitefish, round whitefish, pygmy whitefish, Arctic lamprey, various grayling species, brook trout (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), chum salmon, Siberian taimen, lenok and lake chub.

The taiga is mainly home to a number of large herbivorous mammals, such as &quot;Alces alces&quot; (moose), and a few subspecies of &quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot; (reindeer in Eurasia; caribou in North America). Some areas of the more southern closed boreal forest have populations of other Cervidae species, such as the maral, elk, Sitka black-tailed deer, and roe deer. While normally a polar species, some southern herds of muskoxen reside in the taiga of Russia&#x27;s Far East and North America. The Amur-Kamchatka region of far eastern Russia also supports the snow sheep, the Russian relative of the American bighorn sheep, wild boar, and long-tailed goral. The largest animal in the taiga is the wood bison of northern Canada/Alaska; additionally, some numbers of the American plains bison have been introduced into the Russian far-east, as part of the taiga regeneration project called &quot;Pleistocene Park&quot;, in addition to Przewalski&#x27;s horse.

Small mammals of the taiga biome include rodent species such as the beaver, squirrel, chipmunk, marmot, lemming, North American porcupine and vole, as well as a small number of lagomorph species, such as the pika, snowshoe hare and mountain hare. These species have adapted to survive the harsh winters in their native ranges. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold.

Predatory mammals of the taiga must be adapted to travel long distances in search of scattered prey, or be able to supplement their diet with vegetation or other forms of food (such as raccoons). Mammalian predators of the taiga include Canada lynx, Eurasian lynx, stoat, Siberian weasel, least weasel, sable, American marten, North American river otter, European otter, American mink, wolverine, Asian badger, fisher, timber wolf, Mongolian wolf, coyote, red fox, Arctic fox, grizzly bear, American black bear, Asiatic black bear, Ussuri brown bear, polar bear (only small areas of northern taiga), Siberian tiger, and Amur leopard.

More than 300 species of birds have their nesting grounds in the taiga. Siberian thrush, white-throated sparrow, and black-throated green warbler migrate to this habitat to take advantage of the long summer days and abundance of insects found around the numerous bogs and lakes. Of the 300 species of birds that summer in the taiga, only 30 stay for the winter. These are either carrion-feeding or large raptors that can take live mammal prey, such as the golden eagle, rough-legged buzzard (also known as the rough-legged hawk), Steller&#x27;s sea eagle (in coastal northeastern Russia-Japan), great gray owl, snowy owl, barred owl, great horned owl, crow and raven. The only other viable adaptation is seed-eating birds, which include several species of grouse, capercaillie and crossbills.

==Fire==

Fire has been one of the most important factors shaping the composition and development of boreal forest stands; it is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the Canadian boreal forest. The fire history that characterizes an ecosystem is its &quot;fire regime&quot;, which has 3 elements: (1) fire type and intensity (e.g., crown fires, severe surface fires, and light surface fires), (2) size of typical fires of significance, and (3) frequency or return intervals for specific land units. The average time within a fire regime to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem is its &quot;fire rotation&quot; (Heinselman 1973) or &quot;fire cycle&quot; (Van Wagner 1978). However, as Heinselman (1981) noted, each physiographic site tends to have its own return interval, so that some areas are skipped for long periods, while others might burn two-times or more often during a nominal fire rotation.

The dominant fire regime in the boreal forest is high-intensity crown fires or severe surface fires of very large size, often more than 10,000 ha (100 km2), and sometimes more than 400,000 ha (4000 km2). Such fires kill entire stands. Fire rotations in the drier regions of western Canada and Alaska average 50–100 years, shorter than in the moister climates of eastern Canada, where they may average 200 years or more. Fire cycles also tend to be long near the tree line in the subarctic spruce-lichen woodlands. The longest cycles, possibly 300 years, probably occur in the western boreal in floodplain white spruce.

Amiro et al. (2001) calculated the mean fire cycle for the period 1980 to 1999 in the Canadian boreal forest (including taiga) at 126 years. Increased fire activity has been predicted for western Canada, but parts of eastern Canada may experience less fire in future because of greater precipitation in a warmer climate.

The mature boreal forest pattern in the south shows balsam fir dominant on well-drained sites in eastern Canada changing centrally and westward to a prominence of white spruce, with black spruce and tamarack forming the forests on peats, and with jack pine usually present on dry sites except in the extreme east, where it is absent. The effects of fires are inextricably woven into the patterns of vegetation on the landscape, which in the east favour black spruce, paper birch, and jack pine over balsam fir, and in the west give the advantage to aspen, jack pine, black spruce, and birch over white spruce. Many investigators have reported the ubiquity of charcoal under the forest floor and in the upper soil profile. Charcoal in soils provided Bryson et al. (1965) with clues about the forest history of an area 280 km north of the then-current tree line at Ennadai Lake, District Keewatin, Northwest Territories.
Two lines of evidence support the thesis that fire has always been an integral factor in the boreal forest: (1) direct, eye-witness accounts and forest-fire statistics, and (2) indirect, circumstantial evidence based on the effects of fire, as well as on persisting indicators. The patchwork mosaic of forest stands in the boreal forest, typically with abrupt, irregular boundaries circumscribing homogenous stands, is indirect but compelling testimony to the role of fire in shaping the forest. The fact is that most boreal forest stands are less than 100 years old, and only in the rather few areas that have escaped burning are there stands of white spruce older than 250 years.

The prevalence of fire-adaptive morphologic and reproductive characteristics of many boreal plant species is further evidence pointing to a long and intimate association with fire. Seven of the ten most common trees in the boreal forest—jack pine, lodgepole pine, aspen, balsam poplar (&quot;Populus balsamifera&quot;), paper birch, tamarack, black spruce – can be classed as pioneers in their adaptations for rapid invasion of open areas. White spruce shows some pioneering abilities, too, but is less able than black spruce and the pines to disperse seed at all seasons. Only balsam fir and alpine fir seem to be poorly adapted to reproduce after fire, as their cones disintegrate at maturity, leaving no seed in the crowns.

The oldest forests in the northwest boreal region, some older than 300 years, are of white spruce occurring as pure stands on moist floodplains. Here, the frequency of fire is much less than on adjacent uplands dominated by pine, black spruce and aspen. In contrast, in the Cordilleran region, fire is most frequent in the valley bottoms, decreasing upward, as shown by a mosaic of young pioneer pine and broadleaf stands below, and older spruce–fir on the slopes above. Without fire, the boreal forest would become more and more homogeneous, with the long-lived white spruce gradually replacing pine, aspen, balsam poplar, and birch, and perhaps even black spruce, except on the peatlands.

==Climate change==
During the last quarter of the twentieth century, the zone of latitude occupied by the boreal forest experienced some of the greatest temperature increases on Earth. Winter temperatures have increased more than summer temperatures. In summer, the daily low temperature has increased more than the daily high temperature. The number of days with extremely cold temperatures (e.g., ) has decreased irregularly but systematically in nearly all the boreal region, allowing better survival for tree-damaging insects. In Fairbanks, Alaska, the length of the frost-free season has increased from 60 to 90 days in the early twentieth century to about 120 days a century later.

It has been hypothesized that the boreal environments have only a few states which are stable in the long term - a treeless tundra/steppe, a forest with &gt;75% tree cover and an open woodland with ~20% and ~45% tree cover. Thus, continued climate change would be able to force at least some of the presently existing taiga forests into one of the two woodland states or even into a treeless steppe - but it could also shift tundra areas into woodland or forest states as they warm and become more suitable for tree growth.

In keeping with this hypothesis, several studies published in the early 2010s found that there was already a substantial drought-induced tree loss in the western Canadian boreal forests since the 1960s: although this trend was weak or even non-existent in the eastern forests, it was particularly pronounced in the western coniferous forests. However, in 2016, a study found no overall Canadian boreal forest trend between 1950 and 2012: while it also found improved growth in some southern boreal forests and dampened growth in the north (contrary to what the hypothesis would suggest), those patterns were statistically weak.

A 2018 Landsat reanalysis confirmed that there was a drying trend and a loss of forest in western Canadian forests and some greening in the wetter east, but it had also concluded that most of the forest loss attributed to climate change in the earlier studies had instead constituted a delayed response to anthropogenic disturbance. Subsequent research found that even in the forests where biomass trends did not change, there was a substantial shift towards the deciduous broad-leaved trees with higher drought tolerance over the past 65 years, and another Landsat analysis of 100,000 undisturbed sites found that the areas with low tree cover became greener in response to warming, but tree mortality (browning) became the dominant response as the proportion of existing tree cover increased.

While the majority of studies on boreal forest transitions have been done in Canada, similar trends have been detected in the other countries. Summer warming has been shown to increase water stress and reduce tree growth in dry areas of the southern boreal forest in central Alaska and portions of far eastern Russia. In Siberia, the taiga is converting from predominantly needle-shedding larch trees to evergreen conifers in response to a warming climate. This is likely to further accelerate warming, as the evergreen trees will absorb more of the sun&#x27;s rays. Given the vast size of the area, such a change has the potential to affect areas well outside of the region. In much of the boreal forest in Alaska, the growth of white spruce trees are stunted by unusually warm summers, while trees on some of the coldest fringes of the forest are experiencing faster growth than previously. Lack of moisture in the warmer summers are also stressing the birch trees of central Alaska.

In addition to these observations, there has also been work on projecting future forest trends. A 2018 study of the seven tree species dominant in the Eastern Canadian forests found that while 2 °C warming alone increases their growth by around 13% on average, water availability is much more important than temperature and further warming of up to 4 °C would result in substantial declines unless matched by increases in precipitation. A 2019 study suggested that the forest plots commonly used to evaluate boreal forest response to climate change tend to have less evolutionary competition between trees than the typical forest, and that with strong competition, there was little net growth in response to warming.

Climatic change only stimulated growth for trees under weak competition in central boreal forests. A 2021 paper had confirmed that the boreal forests are much more strongly affected by climate change than the other forest types in Canada and projected that most of the eastern Canadian boreal forests would reach a tipping point around 2080 under the RCP 8.5 scenario which represents the largest potential increase in anthropogenic emissions. Another 2021 study projected that under the &quot;moderate&quot; SSP2-4.5 scenario, boreal forests would experience a 15% worldwide increase in biomass by the end of the century, but this would be more than offset by the 41% biomass decline in the tropics.

In 2022, the results of a 5-year warming experiment in North America had shown that the juveniles of tree species which currently dominate the southern margins of the boreal forests fare the worst in response to even 1.5 °C or +3.1 °C of warming and the associated reductions in precipitation. While the temperate species which would benefit from such conditions are also present in the southern boreal forests, they are both rare and have slower growth rates.

A 2022 assessment of tipping points in the climate system designated two inter-related tipping points associated with climate change - the die-off of taiga at its southern edge and the area&#x27;s consequent reversion to grassland (similar to the Amazon rainforest dieback) and the opposite process to the north, where the rapid warming of the adjacent tundra areas converts them to taiga. While both of these processes can already be observed today, the assessment believes that they would likely not become unstoppable (and thus meet the definition of a tipping point) until global warming of around 4 °C. However, the certainty level is still limited and it is possible that 1.5 °C would be sufficient for either tipping point; on the other hand, the southern die-off may not be inevitable until 5 °C, while the replacement of tundra with taiga may require 7.2 °C.

Once the &quot;right&quot; level of warming is met, either process would take at least 40–50 years to finish, and is more likely to unfold over a century or more. While the southern die-off would involve the loss of around 52 billion tons of carbon, the net result is &quot;cooling&quot; of around 0.18 °C globally and between 0.5 °C to 2 °C regionally. Likewise, boreal forest expansion into tundra has a net global warming effect of around 0.14 °C globally and 0.5 °C to 1 °C regionally, even though new forest growth captures around 6 billion tons of carbon. In both cases, this is due to the snow-covered ground having a much greater albedo than the forests. According to a later study, disappearing of boreal forests can also increase warming despite the effect on albedo, while the conclusion about cooling from deforestation in these areas made by previous studies results from the failure of models to properly capture the effects of evapotranspiration.

Primary boreal forests hold 1,042 billion tonnes of carbon, more than currently found in the atmosphere, 2 times more than all human caused GHG emissions since the year 1870. In a warmer climate their ability to store carbon will be reduced.

==Other threats==

===Human activities===
Some of the larger cities situated in this biome are Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Yakutsk, Anchorage, Yellowknife, Tromsø, Luleå, and Oulu.

Large areas of Siberia&#x27;s taiga have been harvested for lumber since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Previously, the forest was protected by the restrictions of the Soviet Ministry of Forestry, but with the collapse of the Union, the restrictions regarding trade with Western nations have vanished. Trees are easy to harvest and sell well, so loggers have begun harvesting Russian taiga evergreen trees for sale to nations previously forbidden by Soviet law.

===Insects===
Recent years have seen outbreaks of insect pests in forest-destroying plagues: the spruce-bark beetle (&quot;Dendroctonus rufipennis&quot;) in Yukon and Alaska; the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia; the aspen-leaf miner; the larch sawfly; the spruce budworm (&quot;Choristoneura fumiferana&quot;); the spruce coneworm.

===Pollution===
The effect of sulphur dioxide on woody boreal forest species was investigated by Addison et al. (1984), who exposed plants growing on native soils and tailings to 15.2 μmol/m3 (0.34 ppm) of SO2 on CO2 assimilation rate (NAR). The Canadian maximum acceptable limit for atmospheric SO2 is 0.34 ppm. Fumigation with SO2 significantly reduced NAR in all species and produced visible symptoms of injury in 2–20 days. The decrease in NAR of deciduous species (trembling aspen [&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;], willow [&quot;Salix&quot;], green alder [&quot;Alnus viridis&quot;], and white birch [&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;]) was significantly more rapid than of conifers (white spruce, black spruce [&quot;Picea mariana&quot;], and jack pine [&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;]) or an evergreen angiosperm (Labrador tea) growing on a fertilized Brunisol.

These metabolic and visible injury responses seemed to be related to the differences in S uptake owing in part to higher gas exchange rates for deciduous species than for conifers. Conifers growing in oil sands tailings responded to SO2 with a significantly more rapid decrease in NAR compared with those growing in the Brunisol, perhaps because of predisposing toxic material in the tailings. However, sulphur uptake and visible symptom development did not differ between conifers growing on the 2 substrates.

Acidification of precipitation by anthropogenic, acid-forming emissions has been associated with damage to vegetation and reduced forest productivity, but 2-year-old white spruce that were subjected to simulated acid rain (at pH 4.6, 3.6, and 2.6) applied weekly for 7 weeks incurred no statistically significant (P 0.05) reduction in growth during the experiment compared with the background control (pH 5.6) (Abouguendia and Baschak 1987). However, symptoms of injury were observed in all treatments, the number of plants and the number of needles affected increased with increasing rain acidity and with time. Scherbatskoy and Klein (1983) found no significant effect of chlorophyll concentration in white spruce at pH 4.3 and 2.8, but Abouguendia and Baschak (1987) found a significant reduction in white spruce at pH 2.6, while the foliar sulphur content significantly greater at pH 2.6 than any of the other treatments.

==Protection==
The taiga stores enormous quantities of carbon, more than the world&#x27;s temperate and tropical forests combined, much of it in wetlands and peatland. In fact, current estimates place boreal forests as storing twice as much carbon per unit area as tropical forests. Wildfires could use up a significant part of the global carbon budget, so fire management at about 12 dollars per tonne of carbon not released is very cheap compared to the social cost of carbon.

Some nations are discussing protecting areas of the taiga by prohibiting logging, mining, oil and gas production, and other forms of development. Responding to a letter signed by 1,500 scientists calling on political leaders to protect at least half of the boreal forest, two Canadian provincial governments, Ontario and Quebec, offered election promises to discuss measures in 2008 that might eventually classify at least half of their northern boreal forest as &quot;protected&quot;. Although both provinces admitted it would take decades to plan, working with Aboriginal and local communities and ultimately mapping out precise boundaries of the areas off-limits to development, the measures were touted to create some of the largest protected areas networks in the world once completed. Since then, however, very little action has been taken.

For instance, in February 2010 the Canadian government established limited protection for 13,000 square kilometres of boreal forest by creating a new 10,700-square-kilometre park reserve in the Mealy Mountains area of eastern Canada and a 3,000-square-kilometre waterway provincial park that follows alongside the Eagle River from headwaters to sea.

==Natural disturbance==
One of the biggest areas of research and a topic still full of unsolved questions is the recurring disturbance of fire and the role it plays in propagating the lichen woodland. The phenomenon of wildfire by lightning strike is the primary determinant of understory vegetation, and because of this, it is considered to be the predominant force behind community and ecosystem properties in the lichen woodland. The significance of fire is clearly evident when one considers that understory vegetation influences tree seedling germination in the short term and decomposition of biomass and nutrient availability in the long term.

The recurrent cycle of large, damaging fire occurs approximately every 70 to 100 years. Understanding the dynamics of this ecosystem is entangled with discovering the successional paths that the vegetation exhibits after a fire. Trees, shrubs, and lichens all recover from fire-induced damage through vegetative reproduction as well as invasion by propagules. Seeds that have fallen and become buried provide little help in re-establishment of a species. The reappearance of lichens is reasoned to occur because of varying conditions and light/nutrient availability in each different microstate. Several different studies have been done that have led to the formation of the theory that post-fire development can be propagated by any of four pathways: self replacement, species-dominance relay, species replacement, or gap-phase self replacement.

Self-replacement is simply the re-establishment of the pre-fire dominant species. Species-dominance relay is a sequential attempt of tree species to establish dominance in the canopy. Species replacement is when fires occur in sufficient frequency to interrupt species dominance relay. Gap-Phase Self-Replacement is the least common and so far has only been documented in Western Canada. It is a self replacement of the surviving species into the canopy gaps after a fire kills another species. The particular pathway taken after fire disturbance depends on how the landscape is able to support trees as well as fire frequency. Fire frequency has a large role in shaping the original inception of the lower forest line of the lichen woodland taiga.

It has been hypothesized by Serge Payette that the spruce-moss forest ecosystem was changed into the lichen woodland biome due to the initiation of two compounded strong disturbances: large fire and the appearance and attack of the spruce budworm. The spruce budworm is a deadly insect to the spruce populations in the southern regions of the taiga. J.P. Jasinski confirmed this theory five years later stating, &quot;Their [lichen woodlands] persistence, along with their previous moss forest histories and current occurrence adjacent to closed moss forests, indicate that they are an alternative stable state to the spruce–moss forests&quot;.

<text>The Type II U-boat was designed by Nazi Germany as a coastal U-boat, modeled after the CV-707 submarine, which was designed by the Dutch front company NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw Den Haag (I.v.S) (set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine technology and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles) and built in 1933 by the Finnish Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku, Finland. It was too small to undertake sustained operations far away from the home support facilities. Its primary role was found to be in the training schools, preparing new German naval officers for command. It appeared in four sub-types.

==Background==
Germany was stripped of its U-boats by the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I, but in the late 1920s and early 1930s began to rebuild its armed forces. The pace of rearmament accelerated under Adolf Hitler, and the first Type II U-boat was laid down on 11 February 1935. Knowing that the world would see this step towards rearmament, Hitler reached an agreement with Britain to build a navy up to 35% of the size of the Royal Navy in surface vessels, but equal to the British in number of submarines. This agreement was signed on 18 June 1935, and was commissioned 11 days later.

==Design==
The defining characteristic of the Type II was the small size, its surfaced displacement being between half and one third that of the Type VII, and one third to one fourth of the Type IX&#x27;s (depending on the variants used for comparison).

Known as the &quot;Einbaum&quot; (&quot;dugout canoe&quot;), it had some advantages over larger boats, chiefly its ability to work in shallow water, dive quickly, and increased stealth due to the low conning tower. However, it had a shallower maximum depth, short range, cramped living conditions, and carried fewer torpedoes.

The boat had a single hull, with no watertight compartments. There were three torpedo tubes, all forward, with space for two spare torpedoes inside the pressure hull. Although the boats technically had a deck gun, it was a 20mm weapon best used for defense against aircraft.

Space inside was limited. The two spare torpedoes extended from just behind the torpedo tubes to just in front of the control room, and most of the 24-man crew lived in this forward area around the torpedoes, sharing 12 bunks. Four bunks were also provided aft of the engines for the engine room crew. Cooking and sanitary facilities were basic, and in this environment long patrols were very arduous.

Most Type IIs only saw operational service during the early years of the war, thereafter remaining in training bases. Six were stripped down to their hulls, transported by river and truck to Linz (on the Danube), and reassembled for use in the Black Sea against the Soviet Union.

In contrast to other German submarine types, few Type IIs were lost. This reflects their use as training boats, although accidents accounted for several vessels.

These boats were a first step towards re-armament, intended to provide Germany with experience in submarine construction and operation and lay the foundation for larger boats to build upon. Only one of these submarines survive; the prototype CV-707, renamed &quot;Vesikko&quot; by the Finnish Navy which later bought it.

On 3 February 2008, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;U-20&quot; had been discovered by Selçuk Kolay (a Turkish marine engineer) in of water off the coast of the Turkish city of Zonguldak. According to the report, Kolay knows where &quot;U-23&quot; and &quot;U-19&quot; are, scuttled in deeper water near &quot;U-20&quot;.

==Comparison of Finnish Crichton-Vulcan CV-707(U2A) to German Type II==
==Type IIA==
The Type IIA was a single hull, all welded boat with internal ballast tanks. Compared to the other variants, it had a smaller bridge and could carry the German G7a, G7e torpedoes as well as TM-type torpedo mines. There were separated net cutters in the bow. The net cutters were adopted from the First World War boats but were quickly discontinued during the Second World War.

Deutsche Werke AG of Kiel built six Type IIAs in 1934 and 1935.

==Type IIB==

The Type IIB was a lengthened version of the Type IIA. Three additional compartments were inserted amidships which were fitted with additional diesel tanks beneath the control room. The range was increased to 1,800 nautical miles at 12 knots. Diving time was also improved to 30 seconds.

Deutsche Werke AG of Kiel built four Type IIBs in 1935 and 1936; Germaniawerft of Kiel built fourteen in 1935 and 1936; and Flender Werke AG of Lübeck built two between 1938 and 1940. In total, twenty were built.

===List of Type IIB submarines===
There were 20 Type IIB submarines commissioned.

==Type IIC==
The Type IIC was a further lengthened version of the Type IIB with an additional two compartments inserted amidships to accommodate improved radio room facilities. The additional diesel tanks beneath the control room were further enlarged, extending the range to 1,900 nautical miles at 12 knots. Deutsche Werke AG of Kiel built eight Type IICs between 1937 and 1940.

===List of Type IIC submarines===
There were eight Type IIC submarines commissioned.

==Type IID==
The Type IID had additional saddle tanks fitted to the sides of the external hull. These saddle tanks were used to accommodate additional diesel storage tanks. The diesel oil would float atop the saddle tanks. As oil was consumed, water would gradually fill the tanks to compensate for the positive buoyancy. The range was nearly doubled to at and enabled the Type II to conduct longer operations around the British Isles. A further development was the propellers were fitted with Kort nozzles, intended to improve propulsion efficiency. Deutsche Werke AG of Kiel built sixteen Type IIDs in 1939 and 1940.

===List of Type IID submarines===
There were 16 Type IID submarines commissioned.

The tritium nucleus (t, sometimes called a &quot;triton&quot;) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of the common isotope hydrogen-1 (&quot;protium&quot;) contains one proton and no neutrons, and that of non-radioactive hydrogen-2 (&quot;deuterium&quot;) contains one proton and one neutron. Tritium is the heaviest particle-bound isotope of hydrogen. It is one of the few nuclides with a distinct name. The use of the name hydrogen-3, though more systematic, is much less common.

Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth. The atmosphere has only trace amounts, formed by the interaction of its gases with cosmic rays. It can be produced artificially by irradiation of lithium or lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles in a nuclear reactor and is a low-abundance byproduct in normal operations of nuclear reactors.

Tritium is used as the energy source in radioluminescent lights for watches, night sights for firearms, numerous instruments and tools, and novelty items such as self-illuminating key chains. It is used in a medical and scientific setting as a radioactive tracer. Tritium is also used as a nuclear fusion fuel, along with more abundant deuterium, in tokamak reactors and in hydrogen bombs. Tritium has also been used commercially in betavoltaic devices such as NanoTritium batteries.

== History ==
Tritium was first detected in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant and Paul Harteck after bombarding deuterium with deuterons (deuterium nuclei). Deuterium is another isotope of hydrogen, which occurs naturally with an abundance of 0.015%. Their experiment could not isolate tritium, which was first accomplished in 1939 by Luis Alvarez and Robert Cornog, who also realized tritium&#x27;s radioactivity. Willard Libby recognized in 1954 that tritium could be used for radiometric dating of water and wine.

== Decay ==
The half life of tritium is listed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as () – an annualized rate of approximately 5.5% per year. Tritium decays into helium-3 by beta-minus decay as shown in this nuclear equation:

releasing 18.6 keV of energy in the process. The electron&#x27;s kinetic energy varies, with an average of 5.7 keV, while the remaining energy is carried off by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino. Beta particles from tritium can penetrate only about of air, and they are incapable of passing through the dead outermost layer of human skin. Because of their low energy compared to other beta particles, the amount of bremsstrahlung generated is also lower. The unusually low energy released in the tritium beta decay makes the decay (along with that of rhenium-187) useful for absolute neutrino mass measurements in the laboratory.

The low energy of tritium&#x27;s radiation makes it difficult to detect tritium-labeled compounds except by using liquid scintillation counting.

== Production ==

=== Lithium ===
Tritium is most often produced in nuclear reactors by neutron activation of lithium-6. The release and diffusion of tritium and helium produced by the fission of lithium can take place within ceramics known as breeder ceramics. Production of tritium from lithium-6 in such breeder ceramics is possible with neutrons of any energy, though the cross section is higher when the incident neutrons have lower energy, reaching more than 900 barns for thermal neutrons. This is an exothermic reaction, yielding 4.8 MeV. In comparison, fusion of deuterium with tritium releases about 17.6 MeV. For applications in proposed fusion energy reactors, such as ITER, pebbles consisting of lithium bearing ceramics including LiTiO and LiSiO, are being developed for tritium breeding within a helium-cooled pebble bed, also known as a breeder blanket.

: + n → (2.05 MeV) + (2.75 MeV)

High-energy neutrons can also produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield. Prior to this test, it was incorrectly assumed that would absorb a neutron to become , which would beta-decay to , which in turn would decay to two nuclei on a total timeframe much longer than the duration of the explosion.

: + n → + + n

=== Boron ===
High-energy neutrons irradiating boron-10, also occasionally produce tritium:

: + n → 2 + 

A more common result of boron-10 neutron capture is Li and a single alpha particle.

Especially in pressurized water reactors which only partially thermalize neutrons, the interaction between relatively fast neutrons and the boric acid added as a chemical shim produces small but non-negligible quantities of tritium.

=== Deuterium ===

Tritium is also produced in heavy water-moderated reactors whenever a deuterium nucleus captures a neutron. This reaction has a small absorption cross section, making heavy water a good neutron moderator, and relatively little tritium is produced. Even so, cleaning tritium from the moderator may be desirable after several years to reduce the risk of its escaping to the environment. Ontario Power Generation&#x27;s &quot;Tritium Removal Facility&quot; is capable of processing up to of heavy water a year, and it separates out about of tritium, making it available for other uses.
CANDU reactors typically produce of tritium per year, which is recovered at the Darlington Tritium Recovery Facility (DTRF) attached to the 3,512 MW Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Ontario. The total production at DTRF between 1989 and 2011 was – with an activity of : an average of about per year.

Deuterium&#x27;s absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is about 0.52 millibarn, whereas that of oxygen-16 (O) is about 0.19 millibarn and that of oxygen-17 (O) is about 240 millibarns. While O is by far the most common isotope of oxygen in both natural oxygen and heavy water; depending on the method of isotope separation, heavy water may be slightly richer in O and O. Due to both neutron capture and (n,α) reactions (the latter of which produce C, an undesirable long-lived beta emitter, from O) they are net &quot;neutron consumers&quot; and are thus undesirable in a moderator of a natural uranium reactor which needs to keep neutron absorption outside the fuel as low as feasible. Some facilities that remove tritium also remove (or at least reduce the content of) O and O, which can – at least in principle – be used for isotope labeling.

India, which also has a large fleet of pressurized heavy water reactors (initially CANDU technology but since indigenized and further developed IPHWR technology), also removes at least some of the tritium produced in the moderator/coolant of its reactors but due to the dual use nature of tritium and the Indian nuclear bomb program, less information about this is publicly available than for Canada.

=== Fission ===
Tritium is an uncommon product of the nuclear fission of uranium-235, plutonium-239, and uranium-233, with a production of about one atom per 10 fissions. The main pathways of tritium production include ternary fission. The release or recovery of tritium needs to be considered in the operation of nuclear reactors, especially in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel and storage of spent nuclear fuel. The production of tritium is not a goal, but a side-effect. It is discharged to the atmosphere in small quantities by some nuclear power plants. Voloxidation is an optional additional step in nuclear reprocessing that removes volatile fission products (such as all isotopes of hydrogen) before an aqueous process begins. This would in principle enable economic recovery of the produced tritium but even if the tritium is only disposed and not used, it has the potential to reduce tritium contamination in the water used, reducing radioactivity released when the water is discharged since tritiated water cannot be removed from &quot;ordinary&quot; water except by isotope separation.

Given the specific activity of tritium at , one TBq is equivalent to roughly .

==== Fukushima Daiichi ====

In June 2016 the Tritiated Water Task Force released a report on the status of tritium in tritiated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as part of considering options for final disposal of the stored contaminated cooling water. This identified that the March 2016 holding of tritium on-site was 760 TBq (equivalent to 2.1 g of tritium or 14 mL of pure tritiated water) in a total of 860,000 m of stored water. This report also identified the reducing concentration of tritium in the water extracted from the buildings etc. for storage, seeing a factor of ten decrease over the five years considered (2011–2016), 3.3 MBq/L to 0.3 MBq/L (after correction for the 5% annual decay of tritium).

According to a report by an expert panel considering the best approach to dealing with this issue, &quot;Tritium could be separated theoretically, but there is no practical separation technology on an industrial scale. Accordingly, a controlled environmental release is said to be the best way to treat low-tritium-concentration water.&quot; After a public information campaign sponsored by the Japanese government, the gradual release into the sea of the tritiated water began on 24 August 2023 and is the first of four releases through March 2024. The entire process will take &quot;decades&quot; to complete. China reacted with protest.
The IAEA has endorsed the plan. The water released is diluted to reduce the tritium concentration to less than 1500 Bq/L, far below the limit recommended in drinking water by the WHO.

=== Helium-3 ===
Tritium&#x27;s decay product helium-3 has a very large cross section (5330 barns) for reacting with thermal neutrons, expelling a proton; hence, it is rapidly converted back to tritium in nuclear reactors.
: + n → + 

=== Cosmic rays ===
Tritium occurs naturally due to cosmic rays interacting with atmospheric gases. In the most important reaction for natural production, a fast neutron (which must have energy greater than 4.0 MeV) interacts with atmospheric nitrogen:
: + n → + 

Worldwide, the production of tritium from natural sources is 148 petabecquerels per year. The global equilibrium inventory of tritium created by natural sources remains approximately constant at 2,590 petabecquerels. This is due to a fixed production rate, and losses proportional to the inventory.

===Production history===
==== USA ====
Tritium for American nuclear weapons was produced in special heavy water reactors at the Savannah River Site until their closures in 1988. With the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) after the end of the Cold War, the existing supplies were sufficient for the new, smaller number of nuclear weapons for some time.

 of tritium was produced in the United States from 1955 to 1996. Since it continually decays into helium-3, the total amount remaining was about at the time of the report,
and about as of 2023.

Tritium production was resumed with irradiation of rods containing lithium (replacing the usual control rods containing boron, cadmium, or hafnium), at the reactors of the commercial Watts Bar Nuclear Plant from 2003 to 2005 followed by extraction of tritium from the rods at the Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site beginning in November 2006. Tritium leakage from the rods during reactor operations limits the number that can be used in any reactor without exceeding the maximum allowed tritium levels in the coolant.

== Properties ==
Tritium has an atomic mass of . Diatomic tritium ( or ) is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. Combined with oxygen, it forms tritiated water ().

Compared to hydrogen in its natural composition on Earth, tritium has a higher melting point (20.62 K vs. 13.99 K), a higher boiling point (25.04 K vs. 20.27 K), a higher critical temperature (40.59 K vs. 32.94 K) and a higher critical pressure (1.8317 MPa vs. 1.2858 MPa).

Tritium&#x27;s specific activity is .

Tritium figures prominently in studies of nuclear fusion due to its favorable reaction cross section and the large amount of energy (17.6 MeV) produced through its reaction with deuterium:
: + → + n

All atomic nuclei contain protons as their only charged particles. They therefore repel one another because like charges repel (Coulomb&#x27;s law). However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, in the core of the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such repulsion, and they can come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.

A tritium nucleus (triton), containing one proton and two neutrons, has the same charge as any hydrogen nucleus, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsion when close to another nucleus. However, the neutrons in the triton increase the attractive strong nuclear force when close enough to another nucleus. As a result, tritium can fuse more easily with other light atoms, than ordinary hydrogen can.

The same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, of deuterium. This is why brown dwarfs (&quot;failed&quot; stars) cannot fuse normal hydrogen, but they do fuse a small minority of deuterium nuclei.

Like the other isotopes of hydrogen, tritium is difficult to confine. Rubber, plastic, and some kinds of steel are all somewhat permeable. This has raised concerns that if tritium were used in large quantities, in particular for fusion reactors, it might contribute to radioactive contamination, though its short half-life should prevent significant long-term accumulation in the atmosphere.

The high levels of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing that took place prior to the enactment of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty proved to be unexpectedly useful to oceanographers. The high levels of tritium oxide introduced into upper layers of the oceans have been used in the years since then to measure the rate of mixing of the upper layers of the oceans with their lower levels.

== Health risks ==
Since tritium is a low energy beta (β) emitter, it is not dangerous externally (its β particles cannot penetrate the skin), but it can be a radiation hazard if inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin.

Organisms can take up HHO, as they would HO. Plants convert HHO into organically bound tritium (OBT), and are consumed by animals. HHO is retained in humans for around 12 days, with a small portion of it remaining in the body. Tritium can be passed along the food chain as one organism feeds on another, though the metabolism of OBT is less understood than that of HHO. Tritium can incorporate to RNA and DNA molecules within organisms which can lead to somatic and genetic impacts. These can emerge in later generations.

HHO has a short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14 days, which both reduces the total effects of single-incident ingestion and precludes long-term bioaccumulation of HHO from the environment. The biological half-life of tritiated water in the human body, which is a measure of body water turn-over, varies with the season. Studies on the biological half-life of occupational radiation workers for free water tritium in a coastal region of Karnataka, India, show that the biological half-life in winter is twice that of the summer. If tritium exposure is suspected or known, drinking uncontaminated water will help replace the tritium from the body. Increasing sweating, urination or breathing can help the body expel water and thereby the tritium contained in it. However, care should be taken that neither dehydration nor a depletion of the body&#x27;s electrolytes results, as the health consequences of those things (particularly in the short term) can be more severe than those of tritium exposure.

== Environmental contamination ==

Tritium has leaked from 48 of 65 nuclear sites in the US. In one case, leaking water contained of tritium per liter, which is 375 times the current EPA limit for drinking water, and 28 times the World Health Organization&#x27;s recommended limit. This is equivalent to or roughly 0.8 parts per trillion.

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission states that in normal operation in 2003, 56 pressurized water reactors released of tritium (maximum: ; minimum: ; average: ) and 24 boiling water reactors released (maximum: ; minimum: 0 Ci; average: ), in liquid effluents. of tritium weigh about .
=== Regulatory limits ===
The legal limits for tritium in drinking water vary widely from country to country. Some figures are given below:
The American limit results in a dose of 4.0 millirems (or 40 microsieverts in SI units) per year per EPA regulation 40CFR141, and is based on outdated dose calculation standards of National Bureau of Standards Handbook 69 circa 1963. Four millirem per year is about 1.3% of the natural background radiation (~3 mSv). For comparison, the banana equivalent dose (BED) is set at 0.1 μSv, so the statutory limit in the US is set at 400 BED. Updated dose calculation standards based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Report 30 and used in the NRC Regulation 10CFR20 results in a dose of 0.9 millirem (9 μSv) per year at 740 Bq/L (20 nCi/L).

== Use ==
=== Radiometric assays in biology and medicine ===

Tritiation of drug candidates allows detailed analysis of their absorption and metabolism. Tritium has also been used for biological radiometric assays, in a process akin to radiocarbon dating. For example, [3H] retinyl acetate was traced through the bodies of rats.

=== Self-powered lighting ===
The beta particles from small amounts of tritium cause chemicals called &quot;phosphors&quot; to glow. This radioluminescence is used in self-powered lighting devices called &quot;betalights&quot;, which are used for night illumination of firearm sights, watches, exit signs, map lights, navigational compasses (such as current-use M-1950 U.S. military compasses), knives and a variety of other devices. , commercial demand for tritium is per year and the cost is or more.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
Tritium is an important component in nuclear weapons; it is used to enhance the efficiency and yield of fission bombs and the fission stages of hydrogen bombs in a process known as &quot;boosting&quot; as well as in external neutron initiators for such weapons.

==== Neutron initiator ====
These are devices incorporated in nuclear weapons which produce a pulse of neutrons when the bomb is detonated to initiate the fission reaction in the fissionable core (pit) of the bomb, after it is compressed to a critical mass by explosives. Actuated by an ultrafast switch like a krytron, a small particle accelerator drives ions of tritium and deuterium to energies above the 15 keV or so needed for deuterium-tritium fusion and directs them into a metal target where the tritium and deuterium are adsorbed as hydrides. High-energy fusion neutrons from the resulting fusion radiate in all directions. Some of these strike plutonium or uranium nuclei in the primary&#x27;s pit, initiating a nuclear chain reaction. The quantity of neutrons produced is large in absolute numbers, allowing the pit to quickly achieve neutron levels that would otherwise need many more generations of chain reaction, though still small compared to the total number of nuclei in the pit.

==== Boosting ====

Before detonation, a few grams of tritium–deuterium gas are injected into the hollow &quot;pit&quot; of fissile material. The early stages of the fission chain reaction supply enough heat and compression to start deuterium–tritium fusion; then both fission and fusion proceed in parallel, the fission assisting the fusion by continuing heating and compression, and the fusion assisting the fission with highly energetic (14.1-MeV) neutrons. As the fission fuel depletes and also explodes outward, it falls below the density needed to stay critical by itself, but the fusion neutrons make the fission process progress faster and continue longer than it would without boosting. Increased yield comes overwhelmingly from the increased fission. The energy from the fusion itself is much smaller because the amount of fusion fuel is much smaller. Effects of boosting include:
* increased yield (for the same amount of fission fuel, compared to unboosted)
* the possibility of variable yield by varying the amount of fusion fuel
* allowing the bomb to require a smaller amount of the very expensive fissile material
* eliminating the risk of predetonation by nearby nuclear explosions
* not so stringent requirements on the implosion setup, allowing for a smaller and lighter amount of high explosives to be used

The tritium in a warhead is continually undergoing radioactive decay, becoming unavailable for fusion. Also, its decay product, helium-3, absorbs neutrons. This can offset or reverse the intended effect of the tritium, which was to generate many free neutrons, if too much helium-3 has accumulated. Therefore, boosted bombs need fresh tritium periodically. The estimated quantity needed is per warhead. To maintain constant levels of tritium, about per warhead per year must be supplied to the bomb.

One mole of deuterium-tritium gas contains about of tritium and of deuterium. In comparison, the 20 moles of plutonium in a nuclear bomb consists of about of plutonium-239.

==== Tritium in hydrogen bomb secondaries ====

Since tritium undergoes radioactive decay, and is also difficult to confine physically, the much larger secondary charge of heavy hydrogen isotopes needed in a true hydrogen bomb uses solid lithium deuteride as its source of deuterium and tritium, producing the tritium &quot;in situ&quot; during secondary ignition.

During the detonation of the primary fission bomb stage in a thermonuclear weapon (Teller–Ulam staging), the sparkplug, a cylinder of U/Pu at the center of the fusion stage(s), begins to fission in a chain reaction, from excess neutrons channeled from the primary. The neutrons released from the fission of the sparkplug split lithium-6 into tritium and helium-4, while lithium-7 is split into helium-4, tritium, and one neutron. As these reactions occur, the fusion stage is compressed by photons from the primary and fission of the U or U/U jacket surrounding the fusion stage. Therefore, the fusion stage breeds its own tritium as the device detonates. In the extreme heat and pressure of the explosion, some of the tritium is then forced into fusion with deuterium, and that reaction releases even more neutrons.

Since this fusion process requires an extremely high temperature for ignition, and it produces fewer and less energetic neutrons (only fission, deuterium-tritium fusion, and splitting are net neutron producers), lithium deuteride is not used in boosted bombs, but rather for multi-stage hydrogen bombs.

=== Controlled nuclear fusion ===
Tritium is an important fuel for controlled nuclear fusion in both magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion reactor designs. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses deuterium–tritium fuel, and the experimental fusion reactor ITER will also do so. The deuterium–tritium reaction is favorable since it has the largest fusion cross section (about 5.0 barns) and it reaches this maximum cross section at the lowest energy (about 65 keV center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel. As tritium is very rare on earth, concepts for fusion reactors often include the breeding of tritium. During the operation of envisioned breeder fusion reactors, Breeding blankets, often containing lithium as part of ceramic pebbles, are subjected to neutron fluxes to generate tritium to complete the fuel cycle.

The Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) was a facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory dedicated to the development and demonstration of technologies required for fusion-relevant deuterium–tritium processing.

=== Electrical power source ===
Tritium can be used in a betavoltaic device to create an atomic battery to generate electricity.

=== Use in Electron Tubes ===
Tritium is used in various electron tubes, such as the Zellweger ZE22/3 glow tube. These devices contain a small amount of tritium to ionize the fill gas, typically a noble gas like neon or argon. This ionization ensures reliable and consistent operation by providing a steady current when a high voltage is applied, enhancing the device&#x27;s performance and stability. The tritium is sealed within a glass envelope with two electrodes, one of which is coated with the radioactive material to create an ion path between the electrodes.

== Use as an oceanic transient tracer ==
Aside from chlorofluorocarbons, tritium can act as a transient tracer and can &quot;outline&quot; the biological, chemical, and physical paths throughout the world&#x27;s oceans because of its evolving distribution. Tritium has thus been used as a tool to examine ocean circulation and ventilation and, for such purposes, is usually measured in tritium units, where 1 TU is defined as 1 tritium atom per 10 hydrogen atoms, equal to about 0.118 Bq/liter. As noted earlier, nuclear tests, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitudes, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s introduced lots of tritium into the atmosphere, especially the stratosphere. Before these nuclear tests, there were only about 3-4 kg of tritium on the Earth&#x27;s surface; but these amounts rose by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the post-test period. Some sources reported natural background levels were exceeded by about 1,000 TU in 1963 and 1964 and the isotope is used in the northern hemisphere to estimate the age of groundwater and construct hydrogeologic simulation models. Estimated atmospheric levels at the height of weapons testing to approach 1,000 TU and pre-fallout levels of rainwater to be between 5 and 10 TU. In 1963 Valentia Island Ireland recorded 2,000 TU in precipitation.

=== North Atlantic Ocean ===
While in the stratosphere (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present in much of the rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the water cycle as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic.

Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic.

Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (HHO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes:
* precipitation
* vapor exchange
* river runoff
These processes make HHO a great tracer for time scales of up to a few decades.

Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1-TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000 meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000 meters south of the Gulf Stream due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, the isosurface deepens and reaches the floor of the abyssal plain which is directly related to the ventilation of the ocean floor over 10–20 year time-scales.

Also evident in the Atlantic Ocean is the tritium profile near Bermuda between the late 1960s and late 1980s. There is a downward propagation of the tritium maximum from the surface (1960s) to 400 meters (1980s), which corresponds to a deepening rate of about 18 meters per year. There are also tritium increases at 1,500 m depth in the late 1970s and 2,500 m in the middle of the 1980s, both of which correspond to cooling events in the deep water and associated deep water ventilation.

From a study in 1991, the tritium profile was used as a tool for studying the mixing and spreading of newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), corresponding to tritium increases to 4 TU. This NADW tends to spill over sills that divide the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic Ocean and then flows to the west and equatorward in deep boundary currents. This process was explained via the large-scale tritium distribution in the deep North Atlantic between 1981 and 1983. The sub-polar gyre tends to be freshened (ventilated) by the NADW and is directly related to the high tritium values (&gt;1.5 TU). Also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the Labrador Sea to the Tropics, which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to turbulent mixing and recirculation.

=== Pacific and Indian oceans ===
In a 1998 study, tritium concentrations in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10 meters above the surface) were sampled at the following locations: the Sulu Sea, Fremantle Bay, the Bay of Bengal, Penang Bay, and the Strait of Malacca. Results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (about 0.40 Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters. Typically, lower concentrations were found between 35 and 45° south, and near the equator. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the Indian Ocean. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was about one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15 Bq/L). Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium concentrations in the vapor were concluded to be a direct consequence of the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).

In the North Pacific Ocean, the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) spread in three dimensions. There were subsurface maxima in the middle and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (advection) and diffusion processes along lines of constant potential density (isopycnals) in the upper ocean. Some of these maxima even correlate well with salinity extrema. In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81). Results indicated that the tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7 TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the anticyclonic gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.

The depth penetration of bomb tritium can be separated into three distinct layers:
; Layer 1 : &quot;Layer 1&quot; is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; it has received tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to advection and/or vertical diffusion and contains about 28% of the total amount of tritium.
; Layer 2 : &quot;Layer 2&quot; is below the first layer but above the 26.81 isopycnal and is no longer part of the mixed layer. Its two sources are diffusion downward from the mixed layer and lateral expansions outcropping strata (poleward); it contains about 58% of the total tritium.
; Layer 3 : &quot;Layer 3&quot; is representative of waters that are deeper than the outcrop isopycnal and can only receive tritium via vertical diffusion; it contains the remaining 14% of the total tritium.

=== Mississippi River system ===
Trace amounts of radioactive materials from atomic weapons testing settled throughout the Mississippi River System. Tritium concentrations have been used to understand the residence times of continental hydrologic systems such as lakes, streams, and rivers. 
In a 2004 study, several rivers were taken into account during the examination of tritium concentrations (starting in the 1960s) throughout the Mississippi River Basin: Ohio River (largest input to the Mississippi River flow), Missouri River, and Arkansas River. The highest tritium concentrations were found in 1963 across locations throughout these rivers. The peak correlates with implementation of the US &amp; Soviet atmospheric test ban treaty in 1962. The overall highest concentrations occurred in the Missouri River (1963) and were greater than 1,200 TU while the lowest concentrations were found in the Arkansas River (never greater than 850 TU and less than 10 TU in the mid-1980s).

As for the mass flux of tritium through the main stem of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, data indicated that approximately 780 grams of tritium has flowed out of the River and into the Gulf between 1961 and 1997, an average of 21.7 grams/yr and 7.7 PBq/yr. Current fluxes through the Mississippi River are 1 to 2 grams, per year as opposed to the pre-bomb period fluxes of roughly 0.4 grams per year.

<text>Tau Ceti, Latinized from τ Ceti, is a single star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to the Sun, although it has only about 78% of the Sun&#x27;s mass. At a distance of just under from the Solar System, it is a relatively nearby star and the closest solitary G-class star. The star appears stable, with little stellar variation, and is metal-deficient (low in elements other than hydrogen and helium) relative to the Sun.

It can be seen with the unaided eye with an apparent magnitude of 3.5. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be in the northern hemisphere constellation Boötes with an apparent magnitude of about 2.6.

Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. Since December 2012, there has been evidence of at least four planets—all likely super-Earths—orbiting Tau Ceti, and two of these are potentially in the habitable zone. There is evidence of up to an additional four unconfirmed planets, one of which would be a Jovian planet between 3 and 20 AU from the star. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than present day Earth. Note that those planetary candidates have been contested and recent discoveries about the stellar inclination cast doubt about the terrestrial nature of these worlds. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

==Name==
The name &quot;Tau Ceti&quot; is the Bayer designation for this star, established in 1603 as part of German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; star catalogue: it is &quot;number T&quot; in Bayer&#x27;s sequence of constellation Cetus. In the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium&quot; of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, written at Cairo about 1650, this star was designated &quot;Thālith al Naʽāmāt&quot; (ثالث النعامات - &quot;thālith al-naʽāmāt&quot;), which was translated into Latin as &quot;Tertia Struthionum&quot;, meaning &quot;the third of the ostriches&quot;. This star, along with η Cet (Deneb Algenubi), θ Cet (Thanih Al Naamat), ζ Cet (Baten Kaitos), and υ Cet, were &quot;Al Naʽāmāt&quot; (النعامات), the Hen Ostriches.

In Chinese astronomy, the &quot;Square Celestial Granary&quot; () refers to an asterism consisting of τ Ceti, ι Ceti, η Ceti, ζ Ceti, θ Ceti and 57 Ceti. Consequently, the Chinese name for τ Ceti itself is &quot;the Fifth Star of Square Celestial Granary&quot; ().

==Motion==
The proper motion of a star is its rate of movement across the celestial sphere, determined by comparing its position relative to more distant background objects. Tau Ceti is considered to be a high-proper-motion star, although it only has an annual traverse of just under 2 arc seconds. Thus it will require about 2000 years before the location of this star shifts by more than a degree. A high proper motion is an indicator of closeness to the Sun. Nearby stars can traverse an angle of arc across the sky more rapidly than the distant background stars and are good candidates for parallax studies. In the case of Tau Ceti, the parallax measurements indicate a distance of . This makes it one of the closest star systems to the Sun and the next-closest spectral class-G star after Alpha Centauri A.

The radial velocity of a star is the component of its motion that is toward or away from the Sun. Unlike proper motion, a star&#x27;s radial velocity cannot be directly observed, but can be determined by measuring its spectrum. Due to the Doppler shift, the absorption lines in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is moving away from the observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about −17 km/s, with the negative value indicating that it is moving toward the Sun. The star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 43,000 years, when it comes to within .

The distance to Tau Ceti, along with its proper motion and radial velocity, together give the motion of the star through space. The space velocity relative to the Sun is . This result can then be used to compute an orbital path of Tau Ceti through the Milky Way. It has a mean galacto-centric distance of () and an orbital eccentricity of 0.22.

==Physical properties==

The Tau Ceti system is believed to have only one stellar component. A dim optical companion has been observed with magnitude 13.1. As of 2000, it was distant from the primary. It may be gravitationally bound, but it is considered more likely to be a line-of-sight coincidence.

Most of what is known about the physical properties of Tau Ceti and its system has been determined through spectroscopic measurements. By comparing the spectrum to computed models of stellar evolution, the age, mass, radius and luminosity of Tau Ceti can be estimated. However, using an astronomical interferometer, measurements of the radius of the star can be made directly to an accuracy of 0.5%. Through such means, the radius of Tau Ceti has been measured to be of the solar radius. This is about the size that is expected for a star with somewhat lower mass than the Sun.

===Rotation===

The rotation period for Tau Ceti was measured by periodic variations in the classic H and K absorption lines of singly ionized calcium (Ca II). These lines are closely associated with surface magnetic activity, so the period of variation measures the time required for the activity sites to complete a full rotation about the star. By this means the rotation period for Tau Ceti is estimated to be . Due to the Doppler effect, the rotation rate of a star affects the width of the absorption lines in the spectrum (light from the side of the star moving away from the observer will be shifted to a longer wavelength; light from the side moving towards the observer will be shifted toward a shorter wavelength). By analyzing the width of these lines, the rotational velocity of a star can be estimated. The projected rotation velocity for Tau Ceti is

where &quot;v&quot;eq is the velocity at the equator, and &quot;i&quot; is the inclination angle of the rotation axis to the line of sight. For a typical G8 star, the rotation velocity is about . The relatively low rotational velocity measurements may indicate that Tau Ceti is being viewed from nearly the direction of its pole.

More recently, a 2023 study has estimated a rotation period of and a &quot;v&quot;eq sin &quot;i&quot; of , corresponding to a pole-on inclination of .

===Metallicity===

The chemical composition of a star provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including the age at which it formed. The interstellar medium of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed &quot;metals&quot; by astronomers, and the portion of heavy elements is the metallicity. The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of iron (Fe), an easily observed heavy element, to hydrogen. A logarithm of the relative iron abundance is compared to the Sun. In the case of Tau Ceti, the atmospheric metallicity is

:formula_1 dex,

equivalent to about a third the solar abundance. Past measurements have varied from −0.13 to −0.60.

This lower abundance of iron indicates that Tau Ceti is almost certainly older than the Sun. Its age had previously been estimated to be , but is now thought to be around . This compares with for the Sun. However, age estimates for Tau Ceti can range from 4.4 to , depending on the model adopted.

Besides rotation, another factor that can widen the absorption features in the spectrum of a star is pressure broadening. The presence of nearby particles affects the radiation emitted by an individual particle. So the line width is dependent on the surface pressure of the star, which in turn is determined by the temperature and surface gravity. This technique was used to determine the surface gravity of Tau Ceti. The , or logarithm of the star&#x27;s surface gravity, is about 4.4, very close to the for the Sun.

===Luminosity and variability===
The luminosity of Tau Ceti is equal to only 55% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. A terrestrial planet would need to orbit this star at a distance of about to match the solar insolation level of Earth. This is approximately the same as the average distance between Venus and the Sun.

The chromosphere of Tau Ceti—the portion of a star&#x27;s atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One 9-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively it has been suggested that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder Minimum—a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun&#x27;s surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The star&#x27;s asteroseismological oscillations have an amplitude about half that of the Sun and a lower mode lifetime.

==Planetary system==




Principal factors driving research interest in Tau Ceti are its proximity, its Sun-like characteristics, and the implications for possible life on its planets. For categorization purposes, Hall and Lockwood report that &quot;the terms &#x27;solarlike star&#x27;, &#x27;solar analog&#x27;, and &#x27;solar twin&#x27; [are] progressively restrictive descriptions&quot;. Tau Ceti fits the second category, given its similar mass and low variability, but relative lack of metals. The similarities have inspired popular culture references for decades, as well as scientific examination. In 1988, radial-velocity observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11 m/s measured over a 5-year time span. This result excludes hot Jupiters and probably excludes any planets with minimal mass greater than or equal to Jupiter&#x27;s mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope&#x27;s resolving power.

However, these searches only excluded larger brown dwarf bodies and closer orbiting giant planets, so smaller, Earth-like planets in orbit around the star, like those discovered in 2012, were not precluded. If hot Jupiters were to exist in close orbit, they would likely disrupt the star&#x27;s habitable zone; their exclusion was thus considered positive for the possibility of Earth-like planets. General research has shown a positive correlation between the presence of planets and a relatively high-metallicity parent star, suggesting that stars with lower metallicity such as Tau Ceti have a lower chance of having planets.

===Discovery===
On December 19, 2012, evidence was presented that suggested a system of five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets&#x27; estimated minimum masses were between 2 and 6 Earth masses, with orbital periods ranging from 14 to 640 days. One of them, Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit about half as far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti&#x27;s luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and a distance from the star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth&#x27;s. Nevertheless, some research places it within the star&#x27;s habitable zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory has estimated that Tau Ceti f, which receives 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be within the star&#x27;s habitable zone, albeit narrowly.

New results were published in August 2017. They confirmed Tau Ceti e and f as candidates but failed to consistently detect planets b (which may be a false negative), c (whose weakly defined apparent signal was correlated to stellar rotation), and d (which did not show up in all data sets). Instead, they found two new planetary candidates, g and h, with orbits of 20 and 49 days. The signals detected from the candidate planets have radial velocities as low as 30 cm/s, and the experimental method used in their detection, as it was applied to HARPS, could in theory have detected down to around 20 cm/s. The updated 4-planet model is dynamically packed and potentially stable for billions of years.

However, with further refinements, even more candidate planets have been detected. In 2019, a paper published in &quot;Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&quot; suggested that Tau Ceti could have a Jupiter or super-Jupiter based on a tangential astrometric velocity of around 11.3 m/s. The exact size and position of this conjectured object have not been determined, though it is at most 5 Jupiter masses if it orbits between 3 and 20 AU. A 2020 &quot;Astronomical Journal&quot; study by astronomers Jamie Dietrich and Daniel Apai analyzed the orbital stability of the known planets and, considering statistical patterns identified from hundreds of other planetary systems, explored the orbits in which the presence of additional, yet-undetected planets are most likely. This analysis predicted three planet candidates at orbits coinciding with planet candidates b, c, and d. The close match between the independently predicted planet periods and the periods of the three planet candidates previously identified in radial velocity data supports the genuine planetary nature of candidates b, c, and d. Furthermore, the study also predicts at least one yet-undetected planet between planets e and f, i.e., within the habitable zone. This predicted exoplanet is identified as PxP-4.

All proposed planet candidates remain unconfirmed; studies of Tau Ceti&#x27;s radial velocity in 2019 and 2021 were unable to confirm any planets.

Since Tau Ceti is likely aligned in such a way that it is nearly pole-on to Earth (as indicated by its rotation), if its planets share this alignment and have nearly face-on orbits, they would be less similar to Earth&#x27;s mass and more to Neptune, Saturn, or Jupiter. For example, were Tau Ceti f&#x27;s orbit inclined 70 degrees from being face-on to Earth, its mass would be Earth masses, making it a middle-to-low end super-Earth. However, these scenarios aren&#x27;t necessarily true; since Tau Ceti&#x27;s debris disk has an inclination of , the planets&#x27; orbits could be similarly inclined. If the debris disk and f&#x27;s orbits were assumed to be equal, f would be between and Earth masses, making it slightly more likely to be a mini-Neptune. On top of that, the lower the inclination of the planetary orbits the less stable they tend to be over a given time period, as the planets would have greater masses and therefore more gravitational pull which would in turn disturb the orbital stability of neighbouring planets. So, for example, if as estimated in the Korolik et al 2023 study Tau Ceti has a pole-on inclination of around 7 degrees, and the postulated planets do as well, then those planets&#x27; orbits would be verging on instability within just a 10 million year timeframe, and therefore it is extremely unlikely they would have survived for the billions of years that make up the lifetime of the star system.

=== Tau Ceti e ===

Tau Ceti e is a candidate planet orbiting Tau Ceti that was first proposed in 2012 by statistical analyses of the data of the star&#x27;s variations in radial velocity that were obtained using HIRES, AAPS, and HARPS. Its possible properties were refined in 2017: if confirmed, it would orbit at a distance of 0.552 AU (between the orbits of Venus and Mercury in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses. If Tau Ceti e possessed an Earth-like atmosphere, the surface temperature would be around . Based upon the incident flux upon the planet, a study by Güdel et al. (2014) speculated that the planet may lie outside the habitable zone and closer to a Venus-like world.

=== Tau Ceti f ===

Tau Ceti f is a candidate planet orbiting Tau Ceti that was proposed in 2012 by statistical analyses of the star&#x27;s variations in radial velocity, and also recovered by further analysis in 2017. It is of interest because its orbit places it in Tau Ceti&#x27;s extended habitable zone. However, a 2015 study implies that it would have been in the temperate zone for less than one billion years, so there may not be a detectable biosignature.

Few properties of the planet are known other than its orbit and mass. It orbits Tau Ceti at a distance of 1.35 AU (near Mars&#x27;s orbit in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 642 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses.

However, a reanalysis of the data in 2021 provided an in-depth study of the HARPS spectrograph systematics, showing that the 600-day signal was likely a spurious combination of instrumental systematics with a potential 1000-day yet unknown signal.

===Debris disk===
In 2004, a team of UK astronomers led by Jane Greaves discovered that Tau Ceti has more than ten times the amount of cometary and asteroidal material orbiting it than does the Sun. This was determined by measuring the disk of cold dust orbiting the star produced by collisions between such small bodies. This result puts a damper on the possibility of complex life in the system, because any planets would suffer from large impact events roughly ten times more frequently than present day Earth. Greaves noted at the time of her research that &quot;it is likely that [any planets] will experience constant bombardment from asteroids of the kind believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs&quot;. Such bombardments would inhibit the development of biodiversity between impacts. However, it is possible that a large Jupiter-sized gas giant (such as the proposed planet &quot;i&quot;) could deflect comets and asteroids.

The debris disk was discovered by measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the system in the far infrared portion of the spectrum. The disk forms a symmetric feature that is centered on the star, and its outer radius averages . The lack of infrared radiation from the warmer parts of the disk near Tau Ceti implies an inner cut-off at a radius of . By comparison, the Solar System&#x27;s Kuiper belt extends from 30 to . To be maintained over a long period of time, this ring of dust must be constantly replenished through collisions by larger bodies. The bulk of the disk appears to be orbiting Tau Ceti at a distance of 35–, well outside the orbit of the habitable zone. At this distance, the dust belt may be analogous to the Kuiper belt that lies outside the orbit of Neptune in the Solar System.

Tau Ceti shows that stars need not lose large disks as they age, and such a thick belt may not be uncommon among Sun-like stars. Tau Ceti&#x27;s belt is only 1/20 as dense as the belt around its young neighbor, Epsilon Eridani. The relative lack of debris around the Sun may be the unusual case: one research-team member suggests the Sun may have passed close to another star early in its history and had most of its comets and asteroids stripped away. Stars with large debris disks have changed the way astronomers think about planet formation because debris disk stars, where dust is continually generated by collisions, appear to form planets readily.

===Habitability===

Tau Ceti&#x27;s habitable zone—the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-sized planet—spans a radius of 0.55–1.16 AU, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. Primitive life on Tau Ceti&#x27;s planets may reveal itself through an analysis of atmospheric composition via spectroscopy, if the composition is unlikely to be abiotic, just as oxygen on Earth is indicative of life.

The most optimistic search project to date was Project Ozma, which was intended to &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot; (SETI) by examining selected stars for indications of artificial radio signals. It was run by the astronomer Frank Drake, who selected Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani as the initial targets. Both are located near the Solar System and are physically similar to the Sun. No artificial signals were found despite 200 hours of observations. Subsequent radio searches of this star system have turned up negative.

This lack of results has not dampened interest in observing the Tau Ceti system for biosignatures. In 2002, astronomers Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter developed the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) under the auspices of Project Phoenix, another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample. The next year, Turnbull would further refine the list to the 30 most promising systems out of within 100 light-years from the Sun, including Tau Ceti; this will form part of the basis of radio searches with the Allen Telescope Array. She chose Tau Ceti for a final shortlist of just five stars suitable for searches by the (now cancelled) Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope system, commenting that &quot;these are places I&#x27;d want to live if God were to put our planet around another star&quot;.

<text>Tizocic (), or Tizocicatzin (), usually known in English as Tizoc, was the seventh &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Tenochtitlan. His name means, &quot;He who makes sacrifices&quot; or &quot;He who does penance.&quot; Either Tizoc or his successor Ahuitzotl was the first &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Tenochtitlan to assume the title &quot;Huey Tlatoani&quot; (&quot;supreme &quot;tlatoani&quot;&quot;) to make their superiority over the other cities in the Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire) clear.

==Biography==

=== Family ===
Tizoc was a son of the princess Atotoztli II and her cousin, prince Tezozomoc. He was a grandson of Emperors Moctezuma I and Itzcoatl. He was a descendant of the King Cuauhtototzin.

He was successor of his brother Axayacatl and was succeeded by his other brother, Ahuitzotl; his sister was the Queen Chalchiuhnenetzin, married to Moquihuix, tlatoani of Tlatelōlco. He was an uncle of Emperors Cuauhtémoc, Moctezuma II and Cuitláhuac and grandfather of Diego de San Francisco Tehuetzquititzin.

=== Reign ===
Most sources agree that Tizoc took power in 1481 (the Aztec year &quot;2 House&quot;), succeeding his older brother. Although Tizoc&#x27;s reign was relatively short, he began the rebuilding of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan (a task completed by his younger brother in 1487), and also put down a rebellion of the Matlatzincan peoples of the Toluca Valley.

According to the , during Tizoc&#x27;s reign the of Tonalimoquetzayan, Toxico, Ecatepec, Cillán, Tecaxic, Tolocan, Yancuitlan, Tlappan, Atezcahuacan, Mazatlán, Xochiyetla, Tamapachco, Ecatliquapechco and Miquetlan were conquered.

=== Death ===
Tizoc died in 1486, though it is still somewhat unclear how. Some sources suggest that he was poisoned, others that he fell to illness.

==In popular culture==
* The &quot;Obsidian and Blood&quot; series by Aliette de Bodard is set in the last year of the reign of Axayacatl and the first years of the reign of Tizoc, with their youngest brother Ahuitzotl appearing as a primary character. The second book, &quot;Harbinger of the Storm&quot; is primarily set during the election of Tizoc as tlatoani after the death of Axayacatl.

Born August 31, 1943, in St. Louis, Missouri, Berra credits his mother helping him with his career in science, by allowing him to read at the dinner table despite his father thinking it wasn&#x27;t a good idea. He dedicated his book &quot;Evolution and the Myth of Creationism&quot; to his mother saying &quot;For my mother for allowing me to read during meals&quot;. He acquired a love of fish because he kept tropical fish in his bedroom as a child, which led him to read about how to take care of them to keep them healthy. He said his, &quot;hobby education led to a career down the road&quot;.
Berra received his BS in biology at Saint Louis University and his MS and PhD in biology at Tulane University in Louisiana. He has received three Fulbright scholarships which allowed him to study abroad in Australia. He is a professorial fellow at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia.

==Career==
Berra has been called &quot;an international expert in freshwater fish, with a reputation for solving long-standing mysteries&quot;. His notable work includes the taxonomic separation of two species of Australian cod (the trout cod from Murray cod) in the Murray River, and solving the disappearance and reappearance of the salamanderfish in Southwestern Australia, discovering that they burrow when the pools dry only to reappear later when the water returns.

In 1988, Berra contributed to the preservation of a megamouth shark, a species witnessed rarely before that, described as &quot;one of the most important zoological finds of the decade&quot;.

Berra&#x27;s 1996 research on &quot;Galaxias maculatus&quot; proved that its freshwater distribution around the Southern Hemisphere was due to dispersal through the sea of salt-tolerant juveniles. He has also worked on other Chilean galaxiids.

Berra is a university professorial fellow at Charles Darwin University, a research associate at the Northern Territory Museum, and emeritus professor of evolution, ecology, and organismal biology at Ohio State University.

===Charles Darwin===
Fascinated as a child by the adventures of the HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; and the naturalist William Beebe, Berra has written several books on Charles Darwin, Darwin&#x27;s family and in 1977, Beebe. &quot;Charles Darwin: The Concise Story of an Extraordinary Man&quot; was published in 2009, timed for the 200th anniversary of Darwin&#x27;s birth in 1809. Berra became interested in the children of Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood. The children had often been mentioned in other books, but little had been written about their lives, Berra researched the ten children and published &quot;Darwin and His Children: His Other Legacy&quot; in 2013. Darwin and his wife were first cousins, which interested Berra on how this might have affected the family genetics. Their consanguine marriage possibly affected the children with &quot;reduced fertility&quot; compared with similar families of their class during that time. Seven children lived to adulthood, only three of those had children. Darwin himself suffered from ill-health, &quot;severe digestive problems and a skin disease that made shaving so painful that he grew his distinctive beard&quot;. Berra asked researchers in Spain who had used computer modeling to understand the genetics of the Habsburg family tree to look into the genetics of the Darwin family. The result was that there was an increased risk of low-fertility and bacterial infections, which at least two of Darwin&#x27;s children died of.

In 2016 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; contacted Berra to weigh in on the importance of finding a letter from Darwin that had been stolen 30-years prior by an intern at the Smithsonian. Berra explained that while Darwin was trained as a geologist and would have been &quot;interested in what was going on in America&quot;, this letter would be one of over 7,000 letters written by Darwin and anything by Darwin &quot;is of historical significance and scientific significance&quot;. Berra has pushed for the city of Darwin to fully embrace the man and legacy that they are named for. In 2014 Berra said that when he started coming to Darwin in 2001 he was &quot;struck by the fact that there was nothing visible about him [Darwin] to the public.&quot; Today, the &quot;Beagle&quot; ship bell chimes and bust of Darwin reside in Darwin&#x27;s Civic Center, and the former Northern Territory University is renamed Charles Darwin University. Berra gave the keynote address on Darwin in 2009 at the 200th anniversary of the birth of Darwin held at the Darwin Convention Center in Darwin.

===After retirement===

In 1995, Berra retired from teaching full time. In 2009 he won his third Fulbright Fellowship, and continued to publish books and scientific papers. In 2016 as a professorial fellow stationed at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia, Berra continued his work on nurseryfish. His research on the nurseryfish was to investigate the male&#x27;s unique adaptation, carrying thousands of fertilized eggs on a hook &quot;like a bunch of grapes&quot;. Berra wanted to know how the embryos attached to the hook, and if the male was the genetic father of the embryos. 

During one of the research trips in 2011 with Wedd on the Adelaide River they encountered a 5-metre crocodile locals call Agro eating the fish that Berra and Wedd had trapped in a net they were using in their research. Argo got his teeth into the net and before Berra and Wedd could attempt releasing it, Argo tore a &quot;humungous hole&quot; in the net. The rest of the day Argo followed them around the river.
In 2009 the Smithsonian Institution received Berra&#x27;s collection of 260 species of rare fishes. Berra and his wife Rita M. Berra endowed the first chair established at Ohio State&#x27;s regional campus. Berra hopes that the chair will be filled by a scientist that will do field work and return to teach at the Mansfield campus, also Berra made the bequest to honor his wife Rita, of whom he said &quot;She has made my life easier for all these years and has provided unselfish support, freeing me to pursue my research&quot;. The chair is called the Tim M. and Rita M. Berra Endowed Chair in Evolutionary Biology, in the Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology.

==Personal life==
Berra decided to apply his professional curiosity towards one of his other passions, bourbon. He attended Bourbon Academy and Moonshine University, read many books and in 2019 authored his own, &quot;Bourbon: What the Educated Drinker Should Know&quot;. Berra states that his &quot;scientific training and methods helped him find and organize information&quot;. 
Until 2022, Berra was spending winters as a resident of Anna Maria Island in Florida. Married to Rita M. Berra.

==Awards==
*National Center for Science Education (NCSE) presented Berra the 2022 &quot;Friend of Darwin&quot; award. Executive director Ann Reid stated, &quot;Tim Berra has helped to expose the flaws of creationism going back to the days of creation science&quot;.

<text>The Type IX U-boat was designed by Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1935 and 1936 as a large ocean-going submarine for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. Type IX boats were briefly used for patrols off the eastern United States in an attempt to disrupt the stream of troops and supplies bound for Europe. It was derived from the Type IA, and appeared in various sub-types.

Type IXs had six torpedo tubes; four at the bow and two at the stern. They carried six reloads internally and had five external torpedo containers (three at the stern and two at the bow) which stored ten additional torpedoes. The total of 22 torpedoes allowed U-boat commanders to follow a convoy and strike night after night. Some of the IXC boats were fitted for mine operations; as mine-layers they could carry 44 TMA or 60 TMB mines.

Secondary armament was provided by one deck gun with 180 rounds. Anti-aircraft armament differed throughout the war. They had two periscopes in the tower. Types IXA and IXB had an additional periscope in the control room, which was removed in Type IXC and afterward.
These long range boats were frequently equipped with Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 rotor kite towed rotary-wing aircraft.

==Type IXA==

===List of Type IXA submarines===
DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen built eight Type IXA U-boats.

* - scuttled 8 May 1945
* - scuttled 5 May 1945
* - sunk 14 September 1939
* - sunk on 13 October 1939 by a mine
*- sunk by depth charges on 5 February 1940
* - sunk on 13 October 1939 by depth charges
* - sunk on 30 July 1943
* - sunk by mine on 13 March 1940

==Type IXB==

Type IXB was an improved model with an increased range. It was the most successful version overall with each boat averaging a total of over sunk.

Notable IXB boats included commanded by Reinhard Hardegen, which opened up the attack in the US waters in early 1942 known as Operation Drumbeat, , which was bombed by a US aircraft while flying a Red Cross-flag and rescuing survivors of a torpedoed ship (Laconia incident), and operating off Freetown, Sierra Leone under the command of Günter Hessler, which had the most successful single mission of the war ever with close to sunk.

===List of Type IXB submarines===
DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen built 14 Type IXB U-boats. Thirteen were sunk in the course of the war.

==Type IXC==


The Type IXC was a further refinement of the class with storage for an additional 43 tonnes of fuel, increasing the boat&#x27;s range. This series omitted the control room periscope leaving the boats with two tower scopes.

As mine-layers they could carry 44 TMA or 66 TMB mines, though the 35 boats of through and through were not fitted for mine operations.

The only U-boat sunk in the Gulf of Mexico, , was a Type IXC.

&quot;U-505&quot; survives at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and was completely renovated after being moved in 2004 to a purpose-built indoor berth.

===List of Type IXC submarines===
DeSchiMAG AG Weser and Seebeckwerft of Bremen, and Deutsche Werft of Hamburg built 54 Type IXC submarines. Only four survived the war, one of which is preserved in the US.

==Type IXD==

Type IXD was significantly longer and heavier than the IXC/40. It was faster than the IXC but at the cost of slightly reduced maneuverability. It had three pairs of Daimler Benz diesels: two pairs for cruise and one for high speed or battery recharge. There were three variants: the IXD1, IXD2 and IXD/42. The IXD1 had unreliable engines and they were later converted for use in surface transport vessels.
The IXD2 comprised most of the class and had a range of . The IXD/42, was almost identical but with more engine power ( instead of ). 
In 1943 and 1944 the torpedo tubes were removed from some IXD boats converted for transport use. In their new role they could transport 252 tonnes of cargo. The range was extended to .

<text>The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (abbreviated IOCCC) is a computer programming contest for code written in C that is the most creatively obfuscated. Held semi-annually, it is described as &quot;celebrating [C&#x27;s] syntactical opaqueness&quot;. The winning code for the 27th contest, held in 2020, was released in July 2020. Previous contests were held in the years 1984–1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004–2006, 2011–2015 and 2018–2020.

Entries are evaluated anonymously by a panel of judges. The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines and consists of elimination rounds. By tradition, no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition. Winning entries are awarded with a category, such as &quot;Worst Abuse of the C preprocessor&quot; or &quot;Most Erratic Behavior&quot;, and then announced on the official IOCCC website. The contest states that being announced on the IOCCC website is the reward for winning.

==History==

The IOCCC was started by Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel in 1984 while employed at National Semiconductor&#x27;s Genix porting group. The idea for the contest came after they compared notes with each other about some poorly written code that they had to fix, notably the Bourne shell, which used macros to emulate ALGOL 68 syntax, and a buggy version of finger for BSD. The contest itself was the topic of a quiz question in the 1993 Computer Bowl. After a hiatus of five years starting in 2006, the contest returned in 2011.

Compared with other programming contests, the IOCCC is described as &quot;not all that serious&quot; by Michael Swaine, editor of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

==Rules==

Each year, the rules of the contest are published on the IOCCC website. All material is published under Creative Commons license BY-SA 3.0 Unported. Rules vary from year to year and are posted with a set of guidelines that attempt to convey the spirit of the rules.

The rules are often deliberately written with loopholes that contestants are encouraged to find and abuse. Entries that take advantage of loopholes can cause the rules for the following year&#x27;s contest to be adjusted.

==Obfuscations employed==

Entries often employ strange or unusual tricks, such as using the C preprocessor to do things it was not designed to do (in some cases &quot;spectacularly&quot;, according to &quot;Dr. Dobbs&quot;, with one entry creating an 11-bit ALU in the C preprocessor), or avoiding commonly used constructs in the C programming language in favor of much more obscure ways of achieving the same thing.

Contributions have included source code formatted to resemble images, text, etc., after the manner of ASCII art, preprocessor redefinitions to make code harder to read, and self-modifying code. In several years an entry was submitted that required a new definition of some of the rules for the next year, regarded as a high honor. An example is the world&#x27;s shortest self-reproducing program. The entry was a program designed to output its own source code, and which had zero bytes of source code. When the program ran, it printed out zero bytes, equivalent to its source code.

In the effort to take obfuscation to its extremes, contestants have produced programs which skirt around the edges of C standards, or result in constructs which trigger rarely used code path combinations in compilers. As a result, several of the past entries may not compile directly in a modern compiler, and some may cause crashes.

==Examples==
Within the code size limit of only a few kilobytes, contestants have managed to do complicated things – a 2004 winner turned out an operating system.

===Toledo Nanochess===
&quot;Toledo Nanochess&quot; is a chess engine created by Mexican software developer Oscar Toledo Gutiérrez, a five-time winner of the IOCCC. In accordance with IOCCC rules, it is 1255 characters long. The author claims that it is the world&#x27;s smallest chess program written in C.

The source code for &quot;Toledo Nanochess&quot; and other engines is available.
Because &quot;Toledo Nanochess&quot; is based on Toledo&#x27;s winning entry from the 18th IOCCC (Best Game), it is heavily obfuscated.

On February 2, 2014, the author published the book &quot;Toledo Nanochess: The commented source code&quot;, which contains the fully commented source code.

As of February 7, 2010, it appears to be one of only two chess engines written in less than 2 kilobytes of C that are able to play full legal chess moves, along with &quot;Micro-Max&quot; by Dutch physicist H. G. Muller. In 2014 the 1 kilobyte barrier was broken by &quot;Super Micro Chess&quot; – a derivative of Micro-Max – totaling 760 characters (spaces and newlines included). There is also a smaller version of Toledo&#x27;s engine, the &quot;Toledo Picochess&quot;, consisting of 944 non-blank characters.

This program needs the following command line on a Linux system to be compiled:

$ cc banks.c -o banks -DIT=XK_Page_Up -DDT=XK_Page_Down \
 -DUP=XK_Up -DDN=XK_Down -DLT=XK_Left -DRT=XK_Right \
 -DCS=XK_Return -Ddt=0.02 -lm -lX11 -L/usr/X11R6/lib
In order to run the binary file () it has to be supplied with a scenery file via  input:
$ cat pittsburgh.sc | ./banks

<text>Territorial integrity is the principle under international law where sovereign states have a right to defend their borders and all territory in them from another state. It is enshrined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and has been recognized as customary international law. Under this principle, forcible imposition of a border change is an act of aggression. 

In the post-World War years, there has been tension between this principle and the concept of humanitarian intervention under Article 73.b of the United Nations Charter &quot;to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement.&quot; 

Some of the strongest safeguards of territorial integrity are rule of law such as Charter of the United Nations and nuclear deterrence.

Scholars have debated the existence of a territorial integrity norm since the end of World War II. Conquest of large swaths of territory has been rare, but states have since 1945 continued to pursue (and often successfully) the violent annexation of small swaths of territory.

==History==
Prior to the modern era, there was not a clearly defined system of international boundaries. Rather, authority over territorial spaces was non-linear, often overlapping and shifting. According to Mark Zacher, &quot;precisely surveyed national borders only came into clear view in the eighteenth century&quot;. Guntram Herb dates the emergence of clearly defined political territories to the 15th century.

The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 is commonly considered to have established territorial integrity as a cornerstone of sovereignty, embodied in the concept of Westphalian sovereignty, but even this did not necessarily reflect any absolute right to particular territory. Even after Westphalia, territorial exchange remained common between states. In turn, these states were culturally diverse and politically disorganized, and people were not collectively identified by state borders.

The emergence of nationalism and self-determination in the 18th and 19th centuries began to alter people&#x27;s perception of the states in which they resided. Nationalism promoted the belief that territory belonged to a nation and that the territorial integrity of a nation should be respected. Guntram Herb argues national identity is &quot;dependent on territory because only territory provides tangible evidence of the nation&#x27;s existence and its historical roots, and a nation needs a clearly demarcated national territory to demand its own state&quot;. John Etherington agrees, stating: &quot;Underlying all nationalist claims over territory is the proposition that nation and territory ultimately belong to each other, to the extent that the characteristic features of each cannot be understood without making reference to the other&quot;. He observes how, because all nationalist movements necessarily make territorial claims in a world marked by competing claims over territory, this becomes an essential part of their self-justification.

Following World War I, the establishment of the League of Nations ushered in a new era of international cooperation. The League&#x27;s Covenant codified territorial integrity as a key principle of international law. However, the political conditions for maintaining the territorial status quo after the war were not always maintained and various post-war settlements involved exchanges of territory irrespective of local populations.

With the formation of the United Nations (UN) and, later, such organizations as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe), territorial integrity became a well-established part of international resolutions. The UN Charter of 1945 affirmed states’ obligation not to use force to alter state boundaries. Enforcement difficulties in the 21st century have led to controversy on possible re-emergence of the right of conquest as international law.

==In a changing world==
The recent (post-World War II) strict application of territorial integrity has given rise to a number of problems and, when faced with reality &quot;on the ground&quot;, can be seen as too artificial a construct.
At the 2005 World Summit, the world&#x27;s nations agreed on a &quot;Responsibility to Protect&quot;, allowing a right for humanitarian intervention. It has been argued that this could create a flexible application of concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity, easing the strict adherence and taking into account the &quot;de facto&quot; status of the territory and other factors present on a case by case basis. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on April 28, 2006, &quot;Reaffirm[ed] the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity&quot;.

However, this responsibility to protect refers only to the ability of external powers to override sovereignty and does not explicitly involve the changing of borders.

The International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence claims that territorial integrity is not violated as far as international law is concerned by declarations of independence in themselves.

Writing on the cross-border institutions created in Northern Ireland following the Good Friday Agreement, Cathal McCall observes how these configurations constituted a &quot;functional transterritorial model of governance for Northern Ireland based on the principles of interdependence, inclusion and consent&quot; as opposed to the previous &quot;exclusivist territorial political pillars of modern Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism&quot;. That is, the exclusivist assumptions of territorial integrity, embodied in Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism were blurred by the Agreement&#x27;s implementation of cross-border decision-making.

<doc id="31337" wikidata="Q120676" url="?curid=31337" title="Tachi">
<text>A is a type of sabre-like traditionally made Japanese sword worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan. &quot;Tachi&quot; and &quot;uchigatana&quot; generally differ in length, degree of curvature, and how they were worn when sheathed, the latter depending on the location of the , or signature, on the tang. The &quot;tachi&quot; style of swords preceded the development of the &quot;katana&quot;, which was not mentioned by name until near the end of the twelfth century. &quot;Tachi&quot; were the mainstream Japanese swords of the Kotō period between 900 and 1596. Even after the Muromachi period (1336–1573), when &quot;katana&quot; became the mainstream, &quot;tachi&quot; were often worn by high-ranking samurai.

== History ==


The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:

* (ancient swords, until around 900)
* (old swords, around 900–1596)
* (new swords, 1596–1780)
* (new new swords, 1781–1876)
* (modern or contemporary swords, 1876–present)

The predecessor of the Japanese sword has been called . In the middle of the Heian period (794–1185), samurai improved on the to develop (early Japanese sword). To be more precise, it is thought that the improved the and developed with a hole in the hilt and without decorations on the tip of the hilt, and the samurai developed based on these swords. , which was developed in the first half of the 10th century, has a three-dimensional cross-sectional shape of an elongated pentagonal or hexagonal blade called and a gently curved single-edged blade, typical features of Japanese swords. There is no wooden hilt attached to , and the tang (), integrated with the blade, is directly gripped and used. The term is derived from the fact the central part of tang is hollowed in the shape of ancient Japanese tweezers ().

In the developed after , a structure in which the hilt is fixed to the tang () with a pin called was adopted. As a result, a sword with three basic external elements of Japanese swords, the cross-sectional shape of , a gently curved single-edged blade, and the structure of , was completed. Its shape may reflect the changing form of warfare in Japan. Cavalry were now the dominant fighting unit, and the older straight were unsuitable for fighting from horseback. The curved sword is a far more efficient weapon wielded by a warrior on horseback; the curve of the blade adds considerably to the downward force of a cutting action. According to historian Karl Friday, before the 13th century, there are no written references or drawings showing swords of any kind were used from horseback. However, According to Yoshikazu Kondo, bow and arrows were certainly the main weapons used in cavalry battles, but from around the Genpei War in the 12th century, the use of on horseback increased. Early models had uneven curves with the deepest part of the curve at the hilt. As eras changed, the center of the curve tended to move up the blade.

By the 11th century during the Heian period, were exported to neighboring countries in Asia. For example, in the poem &quot;The Song of Japanese Swords&quot; Ouyang Xiu, a statesman of the Song dynasty in China, described Japanese swords as follows: &quot;It is a treasured sword with a scabbard made of fragrant wood covered with fish skin, decorated with brass and copper, and capable of exorcising evil spirits. It is imported at a great cost.&quot;

From the Heian period (794–1185), ordinary samurai wore swords of the style called (, ), which meant black lacquer . The hilt of a is wrapped in leather or ray skin, and it is wrapped with black thread or leather cord, and the scabbard is coated with black lacquer. On the other hand, court nobles wore decorated with precisely carved metal and jewels for ceremonial purposes. High-ranking court nobles wore swords of the style called or (), which meant decorative , and lower-ranking court nobles wore simplified swords of the style called , which meant thin . The and worn by nobles were initially straight like a , but since the Kamakura period they have had a gentle curve under the influence of . Since worn by court nobles were for ceremonial use, they generally had an iron plate instead of a blade.

In the Kamakura period (1185–1333), high-ranking samurai wore (, ), which meant a sword with chains in the arsenal. The scabbard of the was covered with a gilt copper plate and hung by chains at the waist. At the end of the Kamakura period, simplified came to be made as an offering to the of Shinto shrines and fell out of use as weapons. On the other hand, in the Kamakura period, there was a type of called () with a scabbard covered with metal, which was used as a weapon until the Muromachi period. The meaning was a sword wrapped around a leech, and its feature was that a thin metal plate was spirally wrapped around the scabbard, so it was both sturdy and decorative, and chains were not used to hang the scabbard around the waist.

The Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century during the Kamakura period facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. The swordsmiths of the Sōshū school represented by Masamune studied ruined – broken or bent in battle – to develop new production methods, and create innovative swords. They forged the blade using a combination of soft and hard steel to optimize the temperature and timing of the heating and cooling of the blade, resulting in a lighter and very robust blade. They also made the curve of the blade gentle, lengthened the tip linearly, widened the width from the cutting edge to the opposite side of the blade, and thinned the cross section to improve the penetration and cutting ability of the blade.

Historically in Japan, the ideal blade of a Japanese sword is considered to be the in the Kamakura period, and the swordsmiths from the Edo period to the present day after the period focused on reproducing the blade of a Japanese sword in the Kamakura period. There are more than 100 Japanese swords designated as National Treasures in Japan, of which the of the Kamakura period account for 80% and the account for 70%.

From the end of the Kamakura period to the end of the Muromachi period (1333–1573), (), which means a wrapped in leather, was popular. The was stronger than the because its hilt was wrapped in leather or ray skin, lacquer was painted on top of it, leather straps and cords were wrapped around it, and the scabbard and sometimes the (hand guard) were also wrapped in leather.

By the 15th century, Japanese swords, including , had already gained international fame by being exported to China and Korea. For example, Koreans learned how to make Japanese swords by sending swordsmiths to Japan and inviting Japanese swordsmiths to Korea. According to the record of June 1, 1430, in the &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, a Korean swordsmith who went to Japan and mastered the method of making Japanese swords presented a Japanese sword to the King of Korea and was rewarded for the excellent work which was no different from the swords made by the Japanese.

Traditionally, (bows) were the main weapon of war in Japan, and and were for close combat. The Ōnin War in the late 15th century in the Muromachi period expanded into a large-scale domestic war, in which employed farmers called were mobilized in large numbers. They fought on foot using shorter than . In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in the late Muromachi period, the war became bigger; fought in a close formation using (spears) lent to them. Furthermore, in the late 16th century, (matchlock arquebuses) were introduced from Portugal, and Japanese swordsmiths mass-produced improved products, with fighting with leased guns. On the battlefield in Japan, guns and spears became main weapons in addition to bows. Due to the changes in fighting styles in these wars, the and became obsolete among samurai, and the , which was easy to carry, became the mainstream. The dazzling-looking gradually became a symbol of the authority of high-ranking samurai.

From the 15th century, low-quality swords were mass-produced under the influence of the large-scale war. These swords, along with spears, were lent to recruited farmers called , while swords were exported. Such mass-produced swords are called , and swordsmiths of the Bisen school and Mino school produced them by division of labor. The export of Japanese sword reached its height during the Muromachi period—at least 200,000 swords were shipped to Ming dynasty China in official trade in an attempt to soak up the production of Japanese weapons and make it harder for pirates in the area to arm. In the Ming dynasty of China, Japanese swords and their tactics were studied to repel pirates, and and were developed based on Japanese swords.

From this period, the tang () of many old were cut and shortened into . This modification is called . For example, many of the Masamune forged during the Kamakura period were converted into , so his only existing works are and .

From around the 16th century, many Japanese swords, including , were exported to Thailand, where -style swords were made and prized for battle and art work, and some of them are in the collections of the Thai royal family.

In the Sengoku period (1467–1615) or the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), the (, , which means a wound with thread, appeared and became the mainstream of after that. was decorated with lacquer decorations with many and flashy colored threads, and was used as a gift, a ceremony, or an offering to the of Shinto shrines.

In later Japanese feudal history, during the Sengoku and Edo periods, certain high-ranking warriors of the ruling class wore their sword -style (edge-downward), rather than with the scabbard thrust through the belt with the edge upward. This style of swords is called , &quot;half &quot;. In , styles were often mixed, for example, fastening to the was style, but metalworking of the scabbard was style.

With the rise of statism in Shōwa Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy implemented swords called , worn style (cutting-edge down).

In the Shintō period from around 1596 in the Azuchi–Momoyama period, the traditional techniques of the Kotō period were lost, and no smith was able to reproduce the of the Kamakura period. However, in 2014, Kunihira Kawachi succeeded in reproducing a from the Kamakura period. He received the Masamune Prize, the highest honor as a swordsmith. On the he forged, (a pattern of hazy white shadows between and ), characteristic of the Bizen school in the Kamakura period.

With a few exceptions, and can be distinguished from each other, if signed, by the location of the signature () on the tang. In general, the signature should be carved into the side of the tang facing outward as the sword is worn on the wielder&#x27;s left waist. Since a was worn cutting edge down, and the was worn cutting edge up, the would be in opposite locations on the tang of both types of swords.

An authentic had an average cutting edge length () of 70–80 cm (– in), and compared to a katana, was generally lighter in proportion to its length, had a greater taper from hilt to point, was more curved and had a smaller point area for penetrating heavy clothing.

For instance, and closer in size to a were called . The longest (considered a 15th-century ) in existence is in total length with a blade, but is believed to be ceremonial. In the late 1500s and early 1600s, many blades were modified into , their cut tangs () removing the smiths&#x27; signatures from the swords.

Generally, the blade and the sword mounting of Japanese swords are displayed separately in museums, and this tendency is remarkable in Japan. For example, the Nagoya Japanese Sword Museum &quot;Nagoya Touken World&quot;, one of Japan&#x27;s largest sword museums, posts separate videos of the blade and the sword mounting on its official website and YouTube.

<doc id="31338" wikidata="Q744536" url="?curid=31338" title="The Adventures of Tintin">
<text>The Adventures of Tintin (; ) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé&#x27;s birth in 1907, &quot;Tintin&quot; had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies, and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.

The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in (&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;). The success of the series led to serialised strips published in Belgium&#x27;s leading newspaper (&quot;The Evening&quot;) and spun into a successful &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. In 1950, Hergé created Studios Hergé, which produced the canonical versions of ten &quot;Tintin&quot; albums. Following Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983, the final instalment of the series, &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot;, was released posthumously.

The series is set during a largely realistic 20th century. Its protagonist is Tintin, a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer aided by his faithful dog Snowy ( in the original French edition). Other allies include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock, the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (), incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (), and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore.

The series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé&#x27;s signature (&quot;clear line&quot;) style. Its well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of political or cultural commentary.

== History ==
===: 1929–1939===
Georges Prosper Remi, best known under the pen name Hergé, was employed as an illustrator at (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels. Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a &quot;Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information&quot; and disseminated a fascist viewpoint. Wallez appointed Hergé editor of a new Thursday youth supplement, titled (&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;). Propagating Wallez&#x27;s sociopolitical views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and antisemitic sentiment. In addition to editing the supplement, Hergé illustrated (&quot;The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet&quot;), a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper&#x27;s sport staff. Dissatisfied with this, Hergé wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.

He already had experience creating comic strips. From July 1926, he had written a strip about a Boy Scout patrol leader titled (&quot;The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers&quot;) for the Scouting newspaper (&quot;The Belgian Boy Scout&quot;). Totor was a strong influence on Tintin, with Hergé describing the latter as being like Totor&#x27;s younger brother. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were &quot;virtually identical&quot; except for the Scout uniform, also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus&#x27; &quot;Bringing up Father&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and Rudolph Dirks&#x27;s &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper&#x27;s reporter Léon Degrelle.

Although Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as antisocialist propaganda for children. The result, &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, was serialised in from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station, following which he organised the publication of the story in book form. The story&#x27;s popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants. At Wallez&#x27;s direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, but at the time was uncontroversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.

For the third adventure, &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, and used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper&#x27;s ultraconservative ideology. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; had been syndicated to a Catholic magazine named (&quot;Brave Hearts&quot;) since 1930, and Hergé was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers, too.

Hergé wrote a string of &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, United States, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state of Borduria—whose leader&#x27;s name, Müsstler, was a portmanteau of the names of the Nazi German Führer Adolf Hitler and the Italian Fascist Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.

===: 1940–1945===
In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II spread further across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and was considered a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to return to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down , leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium&#x27;s leading newspaper, (&quot;The Evening&quot;), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children&#x27;s supplement, , in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer politicize &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin&#x27;s role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.

===: 1946–1983===
In September 1944, the Allies entered Brussels and Hergé&#x27;s German employers fled. was shut down and &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; was put on hold.
Then in 1946, Hergé accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher Raymond Leblanc and his new publishing company to continue &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; in the new (&quot;Tintin&quot; magazine).
Hergé quickly learned that he no longer had the independence he preferred; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc&#x27;s magazine, a tall order.

In 1950, Hergé began to poach the better members of the &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling . Bob De Moor (who imitated Hergé&#x27;s style and did half the work), Guy Dessicy (colourist), and Marcel DeHaye (secretary) were the nucleus. To this, Hergé added Jacques Martin (imitated Hergé&#x27;s style), Roger Leloup (detailed, realistic drawings), Eugène Evany (later chief of the Studios), Michel Demaret (letterer), and Baudouin Van Den Branden (secretary).
As Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; into a &quot;veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Hergé conducting&quot;.
The studios produced eight new Tintin albums for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, and coloured and reformatted two old Tintin albums.
 continued to release additional publications until Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983. In 1986, a 24th unfinished album was released, the studios were disbanded, and the assets were transferred to the Hergé Foundation.

== Characters ==
=== Tintin and Snowy ===

Tintin is a young Belgian reporter and adventurer who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. The &quot;Adventures&quot; may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story.
Readers and critics have described Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent, and creative character, noting that his lack of backstory and neutral personality permits a reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness which surrounds him. The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Hergé&#x27;s own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin&#x27;s cartoonish representation against more realistic backgrounds enhances this aspect, with Scott McCloud noting that it &quot;allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world&quot;.

Snowy ( in Hergé&#x27;s original version), a white Wire Fox Terrier dog, is Tintin&#x27;s loyal companion. Like Captain Haddock, Snowy is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into unintentional trouble, as does his only fear: arachnids.

=== Captain Haddock ===
Captain Archibald Haddock ( in Hergé&#x27;s original version) is a Merchant Marine sea captain and Tintin&#x27;s best friend. Introduced in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, Haddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (). The Captain&#x27;s coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin&#x27;s often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. The hot-tempered Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as &quot;billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles!&quot; () or &quot;ten thousand thundering typhoons!&quot;

=== Professor Calculus ===
Professor Cuthbert Calculus ( in Hergé&#x27;s original version; is the French word for &#x27;sunflower&#x27;) is an absent-minded and partially deaf physicist and a regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, and based partially on Auguste Piccard, a Swiss physicist.

=== Supporting characters ===


Hergé&#x27;s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists&#x27; adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.

Thomson and Thompson ( in Hergé&#x27;s original version) are two incompetent detectives who look like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches. First introduced in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire which makes them stand apart. The detectives were based partly on Hergé&#x27;s father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.

Bianca Castafiore is an opera singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first introduced in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. Although amiable and strong-willed, she is also comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, talkative, and seemingly unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( / &quot;Ah! My beauty past compare, these jewels bright I wear&quot;) from Gounod&#x27;s opera &quot;Faust&quot;, which she sings at the least provocation. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; &quot;Haddock&quot; is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as &quot;Paddock&quot;, &quot;Stopcock&quot;, or &quot;Hopscotch&quot;, while Nestor, Haddock&#x27;s butler, is confused with &quot;Chestor&quot; and &quot;Hector&quot;. Her own name means &quot;white and chaste flower&quot;: a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Hergé&#x27;s perception), Hergé&#x27;s Aunt Ninie (who was known for her &quot;shrill&quot; singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.

Other recurring characters include Nestor the butler, Chang (or Chang-Chong-Chen) the loyal Chinese boy, Rastapopoulos the criminal mastermind, Jolyon Wagg the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, General Alcazar the South American freedom fighter and (on and off) President of San Theodoros, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab the Arab emir, and Abdullah his mischievous son, Dr. Müller the evil German psychiatrist, Oliveira da Figueira the friendly Portuguese salesman, Cutts the butcher whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock&#x27;s, and Allan the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock&#x27;s first mate.

== Settings ==

The settings within &quot;Tintin&quot; have also added depth to the strips. Hergé mixes real and fictional lands into his stories. In &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; (revisited once more in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;) Hergé creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline. Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros, São Rico, and Nuevo Rico in South America, as well as the kingdom of Gaipajama in India. Apart from these fictitious locations, Tintin also visits real places such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgian Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, Iceland, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.

Fictional settings include:
* Black Island, an island off the Scottish coast, &quot;The Black Island&quot; 
* / Borduria is the historical rival of Syldavia and attempts a fascist annexation similar to the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. Borduria is ruled by the military dictator Marshal Kûrvi-Tasch, who oppresses his own people and attempts to influence Third World conflicts by sending &quot;military advisors&quot; to countries such as San Theodoros.
* Gran Chapo, after the South American Chaco region. &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; is set in a war inspired by the Chaco War.
* Khemed, in Arabia. Khemed is subject to a revolution in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; and in the &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;.
* Nuevo Rico, bordering San Theodoros. The two countries go to war over oil in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, which is parallel to the 1930s Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia. The capital of Nuevo Rico is Sanfacion (a play on Asuncion, which indicates that it is modelled upon Paraguay).
* San Theodoros in South America, a prototypical banana republic where US-based companies and Borduria (meant as an allusion to the USSR or Cuba) vie for power, with &quot;advisors&quot; of local generals. The capital is Los Dopicos, which is later renamed Tapiocapolis.
* São Rico in South America. São Rico was added as a reference in a later versions of &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;. The original version had the villainous masterminds as stereotypical Jewish American puppet-masters; the later version darkens their skin tone and inserts São Rico as a reference.
* Most of the events of &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; take place on the island of Pulau-Pulau Bompa (&quot;pulau-pulau&quot; is Indonesian for &quot;islands&quot;) involving people Hergé calls the Sondonesians. Said to be undergoing a civil war or a war for independence and now rebels for hire, the people may be based on separatist fighters of the Republic of South Maluku. It was a self-proclaimed republic of seismically active islands in the Molucca Sea, whose residents fought for independence from Indonesia in the 1950s and 1960s. The inclusion of Jakarta&#x27;s Kemajoran Airport and the radio message from Makassar just before the plane is hijacked suggests that the location is within the Indonesian archipelago. The Sondonesians&#x27; conversations in the album are in Indonesian Malay (Indonesian). The Proboscis monkey, which appears in the album, is exclusive to Borneo.
* Syldavia in the Balkans is, by Hergé&#x27;s own admission modelled on Montenegro and is threatened by neighbouring Borduria (an attempted annexation appears in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;), a situation that parallels respectively Czechoslovakia or Austria and the expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II. Both Syldavia and Borduria are stereotyped Balkan countries. Syldavia is later home to Sprodj Atomic Centre, which launches the first rocket to the Moon.

== Research ==
Hergé&#x27;s extensive research began with &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;; Hergé said that &quot;it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers&quot;.

Hergé&#x27;s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Hergé&#x27;s lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Hergé saw monarchy as &quot;the legitimate form of government&quot;, noting that democratic &quot;values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip&quot;. Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Hergé creating a history, customs, and a language, which is actually a Slavic-looking transcript of Marols, a working-class Brussels dialect. He set the country in the Balkans, and it is, by his own admission, modelled after Albania. The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria, with an attempted annexation appearing in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania, and that of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II.

Hergé&#x27;s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin&#x27;s voyage to the Moon in the two-part storyline spread across &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;. His research for the storyline was noted in &quot;New Scientist&quot;: &quot;The considerable research undertaken by Hergé enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future Moon exploration, although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark&quot;. The Moon rocket is based on the German V-2 rockets.

== Influences ==
In his youth, Hergé admired Benjamin Rabier and suggested that a number of images within &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; reflected his influence, particularly the pictures of animals. René Vincent, the Art Deco designer, also affected early Tintin adventures: &quot;His influence can be detected at the beginning of the &quot;Soviets&quot;, where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an &#x27;S&#x27;&quot;. Hergé also readily adopted the image of round noses from George McManus, feeling they were &quot;so much fun that I used them, without scruples!&quot;

During the extensive research Hergé carried out for &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.

Hergé also declared Mark Twain an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;, an error T. F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray &quot;Incas in awe of a latter-day &#x27;Connecticut Yankee&#x27;&quot;.

== Translation into English ==

===British===
Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly British children&#x27;s comic &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1951 with the story &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. It was translated in conjunction with Casterman, Tintin&#x27;s publishers, and starts by describing Tintin as &quot;a French boy&quot;. Snowy was called by his French name .

The process of translating Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen, Hergé&#x27;s British publishers. It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, who worked closely with Hergé to attain a translation as true as possible to the original work. Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus&#x27; partial deafness, it was never the intention to translate literally; instead they strove to fashion a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé&#x27;s intentions.

The British translations were also Anglicised to appeal to British customs and values. Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators&#x27; discretion. Captain Haddock&#x27;s was renamed Marlinspike Hall.

When it came time to translate &quot;The Black Island&quot;, which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to redraw the entire book. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail which needed to be put right, such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring that scenes of the British countryside would be acceptable to British readers. The resulting 1966 album is the dramatically updated and redrawn version most commonly available today. Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

===American===
The &quot;Tintin&quot; books have had relatively limited popularity in the United States.

The works were first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, a branch of the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were translated from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races. The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.

From 1966 to 1979, &quot;Children&#x27;s Digest&quot; included monthly instalments of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. These serialisations served to increase Tintin&#x27;s popularity, introducing him to many thousands of new readers in the United States.

Atlantic Monthly Press, in cooperation with Little, Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s, republished the albums based on the British translations. Alterations were made to vocabulary not well known to an American audience (such as gaol, tyre, saloon, and spanner). Little, Brown and Company (owned by the Hachette Book Group USA) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States.

===Digital===
Moulinsart&#x27;s official Tintin app in Apple&#x27;s App Store, launched with the release of the digital version of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; on 5 June 2015, features brand new English language translations by journalist, writer and Tintin expert Michael Farr.

===Lettering and typography===

The English-language &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; books were originally published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958&#x27;s &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; was the first to be published with Hyslop&#x27;s lettering. Hyslop was given versions of Hergé&#x27;s artwork with blank panels. Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble. Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit. In the early 2000s, Tintin&#x27;s English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop&#x27;s handwritten lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé&#x27;s estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.

== Reception ==
=== Awards ===
On 1 June 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet&#x27;s Light of Truth Award upon the Hergé Foundation, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The award was in recognition of Hergé&#x27;s book &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, Hergé&#x27;s most personal adventure, which the executive director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was &quot;for many ... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet&quot;. In 2001, the Hergé Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work, which had been released with the title &quot;Tintin in Chinese Tibet&quot;. The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title. Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation, Hergé&#x27;s widow Fanny Rodwell said: &quot;We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later&quot;.

=== Literary criticism ===

The study of Tintin, sometimes referred to as &quot;Tintinology&quot;, has become the life work of some literary critics in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Belgian author Philippe Goddin has written (1986, later republished in English as &quot;Hergé and Tintin Reporters: From &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; to &quot;Tintin&quot; Magazine&quot; in 1987) and (1993) amongst other books on the series. In 1983, French author Benoît Peeters released , subsequently published in English as &quot;Tintin and the World of Hergé&quot; in 1988. English reporter Michael Farr has written works such as &quot;Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure&quot; (1989), &quot;Tintin: The Complete Companion&quot; (2001), &quot;Tintin &amp; Co.&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Adventures of Hergé&quot; (2007), while English television producer Harry Thompson authored &quot;Tintin: Hergé and his Creation&quot; (1991).

Literary critics, primarily in French-speaking Europe, have also examined &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolidès published his study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; from a more &quot;adult&quot; perspective as , published in English as &quot;The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults&quot; in 2010. In reviewing Apostolidès&#x27; book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of &quot;The New Republic&quot; thought that it was &quot;not for the faint of heart: it is packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon&quot;. Following Apostolidès&#x27;s work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books (&quot;Tintin and the Family Secrets&quot;), which was published in 1990, and (&quot;Tintin and Hergé&#x27;s Secret&quot;), published in 1993.

The first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was &quot;Tintin and the Secret of Literature&quot;, written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006. McCarthy compares Hergé&#x27;s work with that of Aeschylus, Honoré de Balzac, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself. McCarthy considered the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be &quot;stupendously rich&quot;, containing &quot;a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text&quot; which, influenced by Tisseron&#x27;s psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from bartering to implicit sexual intercourse that Hergé had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Toby Clements argued that McCarthy&#x27;s work, and literary criticism of Hergé&#x27;s comic strips in general, cut &quot;perilously close&quot; to simply feeding &quot;the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive&quot; in the Tintinological community.

=== Controversy ===


The earliest stories in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; have been criticised for animal cruelty; colonialism; violence; and ethnocentric, caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans. While the Hergé Foundation has presented such criticism as naïveté and scholars of Hergé such as Harry Thompson have said that &quot;Hergé did what he was told by the Abbé Wallez&quot;, Hergé himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice, stating: &quot;I was fed the prejudices of the bourgeois society that surrounded me&quot;.

In &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, the Bolsheviks were presented as villains. Hergé drew on &quot;Moscow Unveiled&quot;, a work given to him by Wallez and authored by Joseph Douillet, the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the Soviet regime, although Hergé contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout Catholic nation, &quot;anything Bolshevik was atheist&quot;. In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated by personal greed and a desire to deceive the world. Tintin discovers, buried, &quot;the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people&quot;. In 1999, the issue of Tintin&#x27;s politics was the subject of a debate in the French parliament; this event prompted the British weekly newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; to publish an editorial on the matter.

&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; has been criticised as presenting the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children: &quot;My dear friends. I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium&quot;. Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying: &quot;I portrayed these Africans according to ... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time&quot;. Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as &quot;all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals&quot;, although Thompson noted her quote may have been &quot;taken out of context&quot;.

Drawing on André Maurois&#x27; , Hergé presents Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led &quot;Tintin&quot;″s Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin&#x27;s rifle while he sleeps under a tree. In 2007, the UK&#x27;s Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating: &quot;It beggars belief that in this day and age Borders would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo.&quot; In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people. Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court. Belgium&#x27;s Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against &quot;over-reaction and hyper political correctness&quot;.

Hergé altered some of the early albums in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers. For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the African characters in &quot;Tintin in America&quot; were re-coloured to make their race Caucasian or ambiguous. &quot;The Shooting Star&quot; originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of &quot;Blumenstein&quot;. This proved controversial, as the character exhibited exaggerated, stereotypically Jewish characteristics. &quot;Blumenstein&quot; was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, Mr. Bohlwinkel, in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a fictional country São Rico. Hergé later discovered that &#x27;Bohlwinkel&#x27; was also a Jewish name. In recent years, even Tintin&#x27;s politics of peace have been investigated.

== Adaptations and memorabilia ==
&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections. Hergé encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films. After Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983, the Hergé Foundation and Moulinsart, the foundation&#x27;s commercial and copyright wing, became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.

=== Television and radio ===
Two animated television adaptations and one radio adaptation have been made.

&quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot; () (1957) was the first production of Belvision Studios. Ten of Hergé&#x27;s books were adapted, each serialised into a set of five-minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced. The series was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Belgian comic artist Greg, later editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, and produced by Raymond Leblanc. Most stories in the series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots.

&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; () (1991–92) was the more successful &quot;Tintin&quot; television series. An adaptation of twenty-one &quot;Tintin&quot; books, it was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi and was produced by Ellipse (France) and Canadian Nelvana on behalf of the Hergé Foundation. The series adhered closely to the albums to such an extent that panels from the original were often transposed directly to the screen. The series aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD. It aired in the US on HBO.

&quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (1992–93) radio series was produced by BBC Radio 5. The dramas starred Richard Pearce as Tintin and Andrew Sachs as Snowy. Captain Haddock was played by Leo McKern in Series One and Lionel Jeffries in Series Two, Professor Calculus was played by Stephen Moore and Thomson and Thompson were played by Charles Kay.

The &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; were also released as radio dramas on LP and compact cassette recordings in French language versions in Belgium, France and Canada, German language versions in Germany, Swedish language versions in Sweden, Danish language versions in Denmark and Norwegian language versions in Norway.

=== Cinema ===
Five feature-length &quot;Tintin&quot; films were made before Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983 and one more in 2011.

&quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; () (1947) was the first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film. Written and directed by Claude Misonne and João B Michiels, the film was a stop-motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio.

&quot;Tintin and the Golden Fleece&quot; () (1961), the first live-action &quot;Tintin&quot; film, was adapted not from one of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; but instead from an original script written by André Barret and Rémo Forlani. Directed by Jean-Jacques Vierne and starring Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin and Georges Wilson as Haddock, the plot involves Tintin travelling to Istanbul to collect the &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend, Themistocle Paparanic. Whilst in the city however, Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship, believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure.

&quot;Tintin and the Blue Oranges&quot; () (1964), the second live action &quot;Tintin&quot; film, was released due to the success of the first. Again based upon an original script, once more by André Barret, it was directed by Philippe Condroyer and starred Talbot as Tintin and Jean Bouise as Haddock. The plot reveals a new invention, the blue orange, that can grow in the desert and solve world famines, devised by Calculus&#x27; friend, the Spanish Professor Zalamea. An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus, and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them.

&quot;Tintin and the Temple of the Sun&quot; () (1969), the first traditional animation &quot;Tintin&quot; film, was adapted from two of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;: &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;. The first full-length, animated film from Raymond Leblanc&#x27;s Belvision, which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer François Rauber. The adaptation is mostly faithful, although the &quot;Seven Crystal Balls&quot; portion of the story was heavily condensed.

&quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot; () (1972), the second traditional animation &quot;Tintin&quot; film and the last Tintin release for nearly 40 years, it was based on an original script by Greg and directed by Raymond Leblanc. Belvision&#x27;s second feature takes Tintin to Syldavia to outwit his old foe Rastapopoulos. While the look of the film is richer, the story is less convincing. The movie was subsequently adapted into a comic album made up of stills from the film.

&quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (2011) was Steven Spielberg&#x27;s motion capture 3D film based on three Hergé albums: &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; (1941), &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943), and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (1944). Peter Jackson&#x27;s company Weta Digital provided the animation and special effects. The movie received positive reviews and was a box office success.

=== Documentaries ===

&quot;I, Tintin&quot; (, 1976) was produced by Belvision Studios and Pierre Film.

&quot;Tintin and I&quot; (, 2003), a documentary film directed by Anders Høgsbro Østergaard and co-produced by companies from Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, was based on a taped interview with Hergé by Numa Sadoul from 1971. Although the interview was published as a book, Hergé was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised. Years after Hergé&#x27;s death, the filmmaker returned to the original tapes and restored Hergé&#x27;s often personal, insightful thoughts—and in the process brought viewers closer to the world of Tintin and Hergé. It was broadcast in the US on the PBS network on 11 July 2006.

 (&quot;On the trail of Tintin&quot;, 2010) was a five-part documentary television series which recaps several albums of the book series by combining comic panels (motionless or otherwise) with live-action imagery, with commentary provided.

=== Theatre ===
Hergé himself helped to create two stage plays, collaborating with humourist Jacques Van Melkebeke. &quot;Tintin in the Indies: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond&quot; (1941) covers much of the second half of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; as Tintin attempts to rescue a stolen blue diamond. &quot;Mr. Boullock&#x27;s Disappearance&quot; (1941–1942) has Tintin, Snowy, and Thomson and Thompson travel around the world and back to Brussels again to unmask an impostor trying to lay claim to a missing millionaire&#x27;s fortune. The plays were performed at the in Brussels. The scripts of the plays are lost.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays were produced at the Arts Theatre in the West End of London, adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company. These were &quot;Tintin&#x27;s Great American Adventure&quot;, based on the comic &quot;Tintin in America&quot; (1976–1977) and &quot;Tintin and the Black Island&quot;, based on &quot;The Black Island&quot; (1980–81); this second play later toured.

A musical based on &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; and &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; premièred on 15 September 2001 at the (City Theatre) in Antwerp, Belgium. It was entitled (&quot;Tintin – Temple of the Sun (The Musical)&quot;) and was broadcast on Canal Plus, before moving on to Charleroi in 2002 as .

The Young Vic theatre company in London ran &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a musical version of &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, at the Barbican Arts Centre (2005–2006); the production was directed by Rufus Norris and was adapted by Norris and David Greig. The show was successfully revived at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End of London before touring (2006–2007) to celebrate the centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth in 2007.

=== Video games ===
Tintin began appearing in video games when Infogrames, a French game company, released the side scroller &quot;Tintin on the Moon&quot; in 1989. The same company released a platform game titled &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; in 1995 for the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis. Another platform game from Infogrames titled &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; was released the following year for the Super NES, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color.

In 2001, Tintin became 3D in &quot;&quot;, released by Infogrames for Windows and PlayStation. Then in 2011, an action-adventure game called &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, a tie-in to the 2011 movie, was released by Ubisoft in October. In 2020, a match-3 mobile game called &quot;Tintin Match&quot; was released by 5th Planet games. An adventure game, titled &quot;Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, was released by Microids in 2023.

=== Memorabilia and merchandise ===
Images from the series have long been licensed for use on merchandise, the success of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine helping to create a market for such items. Tintin&#x27;s image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors&#x27; items in their own right.

The Hergé Foundation has maintained control of the licenses, through Moulinsart (now Tintin Imaginatio), the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: &quot;We have to be very protective of the property. We don&#x27;t take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective ... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use&quot;. However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as &quot;trivialising the work of Hergé by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising&quot; in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.

Tintin memorabilia and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable. The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden, London. Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium, and in Montpellier, France. In 2014, a Tintin shop opened in Taguig, the Philippines, only the second of its kind in Southeast Asia. The first Tintin shop in Southeast Asia opened in Singapore in 2010.
The British bookstore chain, Ottakar&#x27;s, founded in 1987, was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise until their takeover by Waterstone&#x27;s in 2006.

=== Stamps and coins ===
Tintin&#x27;s image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions.
The first &quot;Tintin&quot; postage stamp was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th anniversary of the publication of Tintin&#x27;s first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps.
In 1999, a nine-stamp block celebrating ten years of the Belgian Comic Strip Center was issued, with the center stamp a photo of Tintin&#x27;s famous Moon rocket that dominates the Comic Strip Center&#x27;s entry hall.
To mark the end of the Belgian Franc and to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, two more stamps were issued by Belgian Post on 31 December 2001: Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center. The stamps were jointly issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
In 2004, Belgian Post celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Moon landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; adventure.
To celebrate the centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth in 2007, Belgian Post issued a sheet of 25 stamps depicting the album covers of all 24 &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; (in 24 languages) plus Hergé&#x27;s portrait in the center.
A souvenir sheet of ten stamps called &quot;Tintin on screen&quot;, issued 30 August 2011, depicts the &quot;Tintin&quot; film and television adaptations.

Tintin has also been commemorated by coin several times.
In 1995, the (Paris Mint) issued a set of twelve gold medallions, available in a limited edition of 5000.
A silver medallion was minted in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, again in a limited run, this time of 10,000. It quickly sold out.
In 2004, Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative euro coin featuring Tintin and Snowy celebrating the 75th anniversary of Tintin&#x27;s first adventure in January 2004. Although it has a face value of €10, it is, as with other commemorative euro coins, legal tender only in the country in which it was issued—in this case, Belgium.
In 2006–2012 France issued the Comic Strip Heroes commemorative coin series featuring famous Franco-Belgian comics, beginning in 2006 with &quot;Tintin&quot;.
It was a set of six different euro coins honouring Hergé: three 1½-euro silver coins featuring Tintin and the Professor, Tintin and Captain Haddock, and Tintin and Chang; a €10 (gold) featuring Tintin; and a €20 (silver) and a €50 (gold) featuring Tintin and Snowy. In 2007, on Hergé&#x27;s centenary, Belgium issued its €20 (silver) Hergé/Tintin coin.

=== Parody and pastiche ===


During Hergé&#x27;s lifetime, parodies were produced of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper &quot;La Patrie&quot; after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. Entitled (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Nazis&quot;), the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Hergé for working for a Nazi-run newspaper during the occupation.

Following Hergé&#x27;s death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres. Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: pornographic, political, and artistic. In a number of cases, the actual name &quot;Tintin&quot; is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books.

McCarthy&#x27;s first group, pornographic parodies, includes 1976&#x27;s (&quot;Tintin in Switzerland&quot;) and Jan Bucquoy&#x27;s 1992 work (&quot;Tintin&#x27;s Sex Life&quot;), featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts. Another such example was &quot;Tintin in Thailand&quot;, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.

Other parodies have been produced for political reasons: for instance, &quot;Tintin in Iraq&quot; lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century, with Hergé&#x27;s character General Alcazar representing President of the United States George W. Bush. Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels, &quot;Breaking Free&quot; (1989) is a revolutionary socialist comic set in Britain during the 1980s, with Tintin and his uncle (modelled after Captain Haddock) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the Conservative Party government of Margaret Thatcher. When first published in Britain, it caused an outrage in the mainstream press, with one paper issuing the headline that &quot;Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob!&quot;

Other comic creators have chosen to create artistic stories that are more like fan fiction than parody. The Swiss artist Exem created the irreverent comic adventures of Zinzin, what &quot;The Guardian&quot; calls &quot;the most beautifully produced of the pastiches.&quot; Similarly, Canadian cartoonist Yves Rodier has produced a number of Tintin works, none of which have been authorised by the Hergé Foundation, including a 1986 &quot;completion&quot; of the unfinished &quot;Tintin and Alph-art&quot;, which he drew in Hergé&#x27;s style.

The response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community. Many despise them, seeing them as an affront to Hergé&#x27;s work. Nick Rodwell of the Hergé Foundation took this view, declaring that &quot;none of these copyists count as true fans of Hergé. If they were, they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin&#x27;s adventures&quot;. Where possible, the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items. Others have taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Hergé, and collecting them has become a &quot;niche specialty&quot;.

As of 1 January 2025, Tintin and other characters appearing in the 1929 comic strips have entered the public domain in the United States, but not in Hergé&#x27;s native Belgium, which will be in 2054. The French artist Fabrice Sapolsky has announced his plans for a 1929 Tintin reboot.

However, for Alain Berenboom, lawyer for the Hergé Foundation, according to the Berne Convention, Tintin will enter the public domain in 2034.

=== Exhibitions ===
After Hergé&#x27;s death in 1983, his art began to be honoured at exhibitions around the world, keeping &quot;Tintin&quot; awareness at a high level.
The first major &quot;Tintin&quot; exhibition in London was &quot;Tintin: 60 years of Adventure&quot;, held in 1989 at the Town Hall in Chelsea. This early exhibition displayed many of Hergé&#x27;s original sketches and inks, as well as some original gouaches.
In 2001, an exhibition entitled (&quot;Billions of Blistering Barnacles!&quot;) was shown at the Musée national de la Marine in Paris.
In 2002, the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Tokyo staged an exhibition of original Hergé drawings as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus.
The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, hosted the exhibition &quot;The Adventures of Tintin at Sea&quot; in 2004, focusing on Tintin&#x27;s sea exploits, and in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin&#x27;s first adventure.
2004 also saw an exhibition in Halles Saint Géry in Brussels titled &quot;Tintin et la ville&quot; (&quot;Tintin and the City&quot;) showcasing all cities in the world Tintin had travelled.

The Belgian Comic Strip Center in the Brussels business district added exhibits dedicated to Hergé in 2004.
The Brussels&#x27; Comic Book Route in the center of Brussels added its first &quot;Tintin&quot; mural in July 2005.

The centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth in 2007 was commemorated at the largest museum for modern art in Europe, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, with &quot;Hergé&quot;, an art exhibition honouring his work. The exhibition, which ran from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007, featured some 300 of Hergé&#x27;s boards and original drawings, including all 124 original plates of &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;.
Laurent le Bon, organiser of the exhibit said: &quot;It was important for the Centre to show the work of Hergé next to that of Matisse or Picasso&quot;. Michael Farr claimed: &quot;Hergé has long been seen as a father figure in the comics world. If he&#x27;s now recognised as a modern artist, that&#x27;s very important&quot;.

2009 saw the opening of the Hergé Museum (), designed in contemporary style, in the town of Louvain-la-Neuve, south of Brussels. Visitors follow a sequence of eight permanent exhibit rooms covering the entire range of Hergé&#x27;s work, showcasing the world of Tintin and his other creations. In addition, the new museum has already seen many temporary exhibits, including &quot;Into Tibet With Tintin&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Hergé is recognised as one of the leading cartoonists of the twentieth century. Most notably, Hergé&#x27;s style has been influential to creators of other Franco-Belgian comics. Contributors to &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine have employed , and later artists Jacques Tardi, Yves Chaland, Jason Little, Phil Elliott, Martin Handford, Geof Darrow, Eric Heuvel, Garen Ewing, Joost Swarte, and others have produced works using it.

In the wider art world, both Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein have claimed Hergé as one of their most important influences. Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from &quot;Tintin&quot; comics, whilst Warhol used and even made a series of paintings with Hergé as the subject. Warhol, who admired Tintin&#x27;s &quot;great political and satirical dimensions&quot;, said, &quot;Hergé has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney. For me, Hergé was more than a comic strip artist&quot;.

Hergé has been lauded as &quot;creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century&#x27;s tortured history&quot; through his work on Tintin, whilst Maurice Horn&#x27;s &quot;World Encyclopedia of Comics&quot; declares him to have &quot;spear-headed the post-World War II renaissance of European comic art&quot;. French philosopher Michel Serres noted that the twenty-three completed Tintin albums constituted a &quot;&quot; (&quot;masterpiece&quot;) to which &quot;the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness&quot;.

In 1966, Charles de Gaulle said: &quot;Basically, you know, my only international rival is Tintin! We are the little ones who don&#x27;t let themselves be fooled by the big ones&quot;.

In March 2015, Brussels Airlines painted an Airbus A320-200 with registration OO-SNB in a special Tintin livery.

In 2015, a tall sculpture of the rocket featured in Tintin: Destination Moon was unveiled at Brussels Airport.

Tintin has become a symbol of Belgium and so was used in a variety of visual responses to the 2016 Brussels bombings.

In 2024, the Royal Belgian Football Association unveiled a Tintin-inspired kit for the Belgian national football team. The light blue and brown kit was used for the team&#x27;s away fixtures in the UEFA Euro 2024.

== List of titles ==
The following are the twenty-four canonical &quot;Tintin&quot; comic albums, with their English titles. Publication dates are for the original French-language versions.

The following are double albums with a continuing story arc:
* &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; (no. 4) &amp; &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; (no. 5)
* &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (no. 11) &amp; &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; (no. 12)
* &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; (no. 13) &amp; &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot; (no. 14)
* &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (no. 16) &amp; &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (no. 17)

Hergé attempted and then abandoned (1958). Outside the &quot;Tintin&quot; series, a 48-page comic album supervised (but not written) by Hergé, &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;, was released in 1972; it was based on the film .

<text>Tecumseh is a city in Lenawee County in the U.S. state of Michigan, near the River Raisin. Tecumseh is about southwest of Detroit, south of Ann Arbor, and north of Toledo, Ohio. The main street of downtown is Chicago Boulevard, also designated as M-50. It crosses the River Raisin a few miles east of M-52. 

The city is surrounded on three sides by Tecumseh Township, but the two are politically independent. Raisin Township borders the southern edge of the city. In 2009 the city was rated by CNNMoney as #93 among the 100 best small towns to live in.

==History==
The boundaries of Lenawee County were laid out by a proclamation of the Territorial Governor, Lewis Cass, on September 10, 1822. Lenawee remained attached to Monroe County, out of which it was formed, until an act of the Territorial Legislature passed on December 26, 1826, organized the county government.

The first Anglo-American settlement in the county was made two years earlier, on May 21, 1824, in Tecumseh. The settlers, consisting of fifteen men, eleven women, and six children, all came from Jefferson County, New York along Lake Erie. In 1823, Musgrove Evans had located the land and persuaded General Joseph W. Brown and the others to move to the site. Brown and Evans, along with Austin Eli Wing, purchased land there and platted the village of Tecumseh in 1824. 

These founders appealed to Governor Cass to locate the county seat of Lenawee at Tecumseh. This was accomplished by an act of the Territorial Legislature on June 30, 1824, although county government was not organized for another year and a half. The city was named after Shawnee chief Tecumseh, whose people had historically controlled that territory.

Tecumseh remained the county seat until 1838, when it was transferred to Adrian. The Township of Tecumseh was organized on April 12, 1837, initially encompassing the entire northern third of the county.
Just to the north of Tecumseh, the village of Brownville was established in 1823 by Austin Wing. It was annexed by Tecumseh in 1838.

==Economy==
One of the village&#x27;s best known manufacturers was Tecumseh Products. Founded by the Herrick family during the early part of the 20th century, Tecumseh Products initially began business manufacturing refrigeration compressors, leading Tecumseh to be known as the &quot;Refrigeration Capital of the World.&quot; The company moved out of Tecumseh in 2008. It moved its remaining production to a plant in Tupelo, Mississippi, where labor costs were lower because workers were unorganized. It moved its headquarters to Pittsfield Township, Michigan, just outside Ann Arbor, where the University of Michigan is based. 

Consolidated Biscuit Company of McComb, Ohio, agreed to buy the Products plant in 2008, pending an environmental review. But, the deal fell through after Consolidated Biscuit Company was sold. The site was found to be contaminated and cleanup begun in 2017. The land was purchased by a local developer - 100 E. Patterson LLC - with plans to clean up the land to brownfield status and develop mixed-use space for light industrial, commercial and retail. The State of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) awarded the City of Tecumseh $2,000,000 in funding to aid the developer in cleanup efforts. 

At the end of 2018 demolition at the site was nearly complete and cleanup efforts were underway with new industrial building construction planned for 2019.

Overall, the City of Tecumseh&#x27;s economy has more than 250 businesses, ranging from Tier 1 Automotive Suppliers to small, locally owned bakeries and shoe stores. The downtown along Chicago Boulevard is thriving with businesses ranging from antiques, breweries and wineries, retail, restaurants, customer jewelers, locally owned department stores and more.

<doc id="31340" wikidata="Q1192316" url="?curid=31340" title="The Mythical Man-Month">
<text>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that adding manpower to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer. This idea is known as Brooks&#x27;s law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.

Brooks&#x27;s observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360. He had added more programmers to a project falling behind schedule, a decision that he would later conclude had, counter-intuitively, delayed the project even further. He also made the mistake of asserting that one project—involved in writing an ALGOL compiler—would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). The tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led Brooks to quip that his book is called &quot;The Bible of Software Engineering&quot;, because &quot;everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it&quot;.

==Editions==

The work was first published in 1975 (),&lt;ref name=&quot;eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted with corrections in 1982, and republished in an anniversary edition with four extra chapters in 1995 (), including a reprint of the essay &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot; with commentary by the author.

== Ideas presented ==

=== The mythical man-month ===
Brooks discusses several causes of scheduling failures. The most enduring is his discussion of Brooks&#x27;s law:
&quot;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;. Man-month is a hypothetical unit of work representing the work done by one person in one month; Brooks&#x27;s law says that the possibility of measuring useful work in man-months is a myth, and is hence the centerpiece of the book.

Complex programming projects cannot be perfectly partitioned into discrete tasks that can be worked on without communication between the workers and without establishing a set of complex interrelationships between tasks and the workers performing them.

Therefore, assigning more programmers to a project running behind schedule will make it even later. This is because the time required for the new programmers to learn about the project and the increased communication overhead will consume an ever-increasing quantity of the calendar time available. When &quot;n&quot; people have to communicate among themselves, as &quot;n&quot; increases, their output decreases and when it becomes negative the project is delayed further with every person added.

* Group intercommunication formula: &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2.
* Example: 50 developers give 50 × (50 – 1)/2 = 1,225 channels of communication.

=== No silver bullet ===
Brooks added the chapter &quot;No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accidents in Software Engineering&quot; and further reflections on it in the chapter &quot;&#x27;No Silver Bullet&#x27; Refired&quot; to the anniversary edition of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;.

Brooks insists that there is no one silver bullet: &quot;there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.&quot;

The argument relies on the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity, similar to the way Amdahl&#x27;s law relies on the distinction between &quot;parallelizable&quot; and &quot;strictly serial&quot;.

=== The second-system effect ===

The second-system effect proposes that, when an architect designs a second system, it is the most dangerous system they will ever design, because they will tend to incorporate all of the additions they originally did not add to the first system due to inherent time constraints. Thus, when embarking on a second system, an engineer should be mindful that they are susceptible to over-engineering it.

=== The tendency toward irreducible number of errors ===

The author makes the observation that in a suitably complex system there is a certain irreducible number of errors. Any attempt to fix observed errors tends to result in the introduction of other errors.

=== Progress tracking ===
Brooks wrote &quot;Question: How does a large software project get to be one year late? Answer: One day at a time!&quot; Incremental slippages on many fronts eventually accumulate to produce a large overall delay. Continued attention to meeting small individual milestones is required at each level of management.

=== Conceptual integrity ===
To make a user-friendly system, the system must have conceptual integrity, which can only be achieved by separating architecture from implementation. A single chief architect (or a small number of architects), acting on the user&#x27;s behalf, decides what goes in the system and what stays out. The architect or team of architects should develop an idea of what the system should do and make sure that this vision is understood by the rest of the team. A novel idea by someone may not be included if it does not fit seamlessly with the overall system design. In fact, to ensure a user-friendly system, a system may deliberately provide &quot;fewer&quot; features than it is capable of. The point being, if a system is too complicated to use, many features will go unused because no one has time to learn them.

=== The manual ===
The chief architect produces a manual of system specifications. It should describe the external specifications of the system in detail, that is everything that the user sees. The manual should be altered as feedback comes in from the implementation teams and the users.

=== The pilot system ===
When designing a new kind of system, a team &quot;will&quot; design a throw-away system (whether it intends to or not). This system acts as a &quot;pilot plan&quot; that reveals techniques that will subsequently cause a complete redesign of the system. This second, &quot;smarter&quot; system should be the one delivered to the customer, since delivery of the pilot system would cause nothing but agony to the customer, and possibly ruin the system&#x27;s reputation and maybe even the company.

=== Formal documents ===
Every project manager should create a small core set of formal documents defining the project objectives, how they are to be achieved, who is going to achieve them, when they are going to be achieved, and how much they are going to cost. These documents may also reveal inconsistencies that are otherwise hard to see.

=== Project estimation ===
When estimating project times, it should be remembered that programming products (which can be sold to paying customers) and programming systems are both three times as hard to write as simple independent in-house programs. It should be kept in mind how much of the work week will actually be spent on technical issues, as opposed to administrative or other non-technical tasks, such as meetings, and especially &quot;stand-up&quot; or &quot;all-hands&quot; meetings.

=== Communication ===
To avoid disaster, all the teams working on a project should remain in contact with each other in as many ways as possible (e-mail, phone, meetings, memos, etc.). Instead of assuming something, implementers should ask the architect(s) to clarify their intent on a feature they are implementing, before proceeding with an assumption that might very well be completely incorrect. The architect(s) are responsible for formulating a group picture of the project and communicating it to others.

=== The surgical team ===
Much as a surgical team during surgery is led by one surgeon performing the most critical work, while directing the team to assist with less critical parts, it seems reasonable to have a &quot;good&quot; programmer develop critical system components while the rest of a team provides what is needed at the right time. Additionally, Brooks muses that &quot;good&quot; programmers are generally five to ten times as productive as mediocre ones.

=== Code freeze and system versioning ===
Software is invisible. Therefore, many things only become apparent once a certain amount of work has been done on a new system, allowing a user to experience it. This experience will yield insights, which will change a user&#x27;s needs or the perception of the user&#x27;s needs. The system should, therefore, be changed to fulfill the changed requirements of the user. This can only occur up to a certain point, otherwise the system may never be completed. At a certain date, no more changes should be allowed to the system and the code should be frozen. All requests for changes should be delayed until the &quot;next&quot; version of the system.

=== Specialized tools ===
Instead of every programmer having their own special set of tools, each team should have a designated tool-maker who may create tools that are highly customized for the job that team is doing (e.g. a code generator tool that creates code based on a specification). In addition, system-wide tools should be built by a common tools team, overseen by the project manager.

=== Lowering software development costs ===
There are two techniques for lowering software development costs that Brooks writes about:

* Implementers may be hired only after the architecture of the system has been completed (a step that may take several months, during which time prematurely hired implementers may have nothing to do).
* Another technique Brooks mentions is not to develop software at all, but simply to buy it &quot;off the shelf&quot; when possible.

<doc id="31341" wikidata="Q6107" url="?curid=31341" title="Tupac Shakur">
<text>Tupac Amaru Shakur (; born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper and actor. He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. Academics regard him as one of the most influential music artists of the 20th century and a prominent political activist for Black America. In addition to his music career, Shakur also wrote poetry and starred in films. He is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. His lyrical content has been noted for addressing social injustice, political issues, and the marginalization of other African-Americans, but he was also synonymous with gangsta rap and violent lyrics.

Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his conscious rap and political rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial multi-platinum success with his follow-up albums &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...&quot; (1993) and &quot;Me Against the World&quot; (1995). His Diamond certified album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur starred roles in &quot;Juice&quot; (1992), &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; (1993), &quot;Above the Rim&quot; (1994), &quot;Bullet&quot; (1996), &quot;Gridlock&#x27;d&quot; (1997), and &quot;Gang Related&quot; (1997). Shakur&#x27;s most notable songs include &quot;California Love,&quot; &quot;Changes,&quot; &quot;Dear Mama,&quot; &quot;Hail Mary,&quot; &quot;Keep Ya Head Up,&quot; &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up,&quot; &quot;Ambitionz az a Ridah,&quot; &quot;All Eyez on Me,&quot; &quot;Ghetto Gospel,&quot; &quot;Do for Love,&quot; &quot;So Many Tears,&quot; &quot;To Live &amp; Die in L.A.,&quot; &quot;How Do U Want It,&quot; &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,&quot; &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot; and &quot;I Get Around.&quot; Alongside his solo career, Shakur was part of the group Thug Life and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Outlawz.

During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. He served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction in 1995. Following his release, he signed to Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight&#x27;s label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Paradise, Nevada; he died six days later. Following his murder, the Notorious B.I.G. was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud; he was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997, while visiting Los Angeles. On September 22, 1996, a peace summit was convened at Mosque Maryam by Louis Farrakhan in response to his assassination.

Shakur&#x27;s double-length posthumous album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip-hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States. Five more albums have been released since Shakur&#x27;s death, including his critically acclaimed posthumous album &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot; (1996) under his stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified multi-platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2023, he was awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His influence in music, activism, songwriting, and other areas of culture has been the subject of academic studies.

==Early life==
Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. While born Lesane Parish Crooks, at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur. He was named after Túpac Amaru II, a descendant of the last Incan ruler, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his revolt against Spanish rule. Shakur&#x27;s mother Afeni Shakur explained, &quot;I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood.&quot; Tupac&#x27;s surname came from Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim, whom his mother married in November 1968. Their marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not Tupac&#x27;s biological father.

Shakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme &quot;Komani&quot; Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur, two years his junior.

===Panther heritage===
Shakur&#x27;s parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams (January 10, 1947 – May 2, 2016), in North Carolina—and his biological father, William &quot;Billy&quot; Garland (born March 14, 1949), had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A month before Shakur&#x27;s birth, his mother was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges.

Other family members who were involved in the Black Panthers&#x27; Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned, including Shakur&#x27;s stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years as one of the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Mutulu Shakur was apprehended in 1986 and subsequently convicted for a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed.

Shakur&#x27;s godfather, Elmer &quot;Geronimo&quot; Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was wrongly convicted of murdering a schoolteacher during a 1968 robbery. After he spent 27 years in prison, his conviction was overturned due to the prosecution&#x27;s having concealed evidence that proved his innocence.

Shakur&#x27;s godmother, Assata Shakur, is a former member of the Black Liberation Army who was convicted in 1977 of the first-degree murder of a New Jersey State Trooper. Since 2013, she has been in the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list after she escaped prison in 1979.

===Education===
In the 1980s, Shakur&#x27;s mother found it difficult to find work and struggled with drug addiction. In 1984, his family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland. Beginning in 1984 when Shakur was 13, he lived in the Pen Lucy neighborhood with his mother and younger sister at 3955 Greenmount Ave. The home was a two-story rowhouse that had been subdivided into two separate rental units; the Shakur family lived on the first floor. After his death, the block was renamed Tupac Shakur Way.

While living in Baltimore, Shakur attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then ninth grade at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. He transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts in the tenth grade, where he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare plays—the themes of which he identified in patterns of gang warfare—and as the Mouse King in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet.

At the Baltimore School for the Arts, Shakur befriended actress Jada Pinkett, who became the subject of some of his poems (&quot;Jada&quot; and &quot;The Tears in Cupid&#x27;s Eyes&quot;). With his friend Dana &quot;Mouse&quot; Smith as a beatbox, he won competitions for the school&#x27;s best rapper. Known for his humor, he was popular with all crowds of students. He listened to a diverse range of music that included Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, and U2.

Upon connecting with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA, Shakur dated Mary Baldridge, who was the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA.

In 1988, Shakur moved to Marin City, California, an impoverished community in the San Francisco Bay Area. In nearby Mill Valley, he attended Tamalpais High School, where he performed in several theater productions. Shakur did not graduate from high school, but later earned his GED.

==Music career==

=== MC New York ===
Shakur began recording under the stage name MC New York in 1988. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg, and she soon became his manager. Steinberg organized a concert for Shakur and his rap group Strictly Dope. Steinberg managed to get Shakur signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the rap group Digital Underground. In 1990, Gregory placed him with the Underground as a roadie and backup dancer.

===Digital Underground===
Shakur debuted under the stage name 2Pac on Digital Underground, under a new record label, Interscope Records, on the group&#x27;s January 1991 single &quot;Same Song&quot;. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 1991 film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot;, starring Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Chevy Chase, and Demi Moore. The song opened the group&#x27;s January 1991 EP titled &quot;This Is an EP Release&quot;, while Shakur appeared in the music video.

At the request of Steinberg, Digital Underground co-founder Jimi &quot;Chopmaster J&quot; Dright worked with Shakur, Ray Luv and Dize, a DJ, on their earliest studio recordings. Dright recalls that Shakur did not work well as part of a group, and added, &quot;this guy was on a mission. From day one. Maybe he knew he wasn&#x27;t going to be around seven years later.&quot;

From 1988 to 1991, Dright and Digital Underground produced Shakur&#x27;s earliest work with his crew at the time, Strictly Dope. The recordings were rediscovered in 2000 and released as &quot;The Lost Tapes: Circa 1989.&quot; Afeni Shakur sued to stop the sale of the recordings but the suit was settled in June 2001 and rereleased as &quot;.&quot;

Shakur&#x27;s early days with Digital Underground made him acquainted with Randy &quot;Stretch&quot; Walker, who along with his brother, dubbed Majesty, and a friend debuted with an EP as a rap group and production team, Live Squad, in Queens, New York. Stretch was featured on a track of the Digital Underground&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Sons of the P&quot;. Becoming fast friends, Shakur and Stretch recorded and performed together often.

=== &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; ===

Shakur&#x27;s debut album, &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot;—alluding to the 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;—arrived in November 1991. Some prominent rappers—like Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli—cite it as an inspiration. Aside from &quot;If My Homie Calls&quot;, the singles &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot; poetically depict individual struggles under socioeconomic disadvantage.

U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle said, &quot;There&#x27;s no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.&quot; Tupac, finding himself misunderstood, explained, in part:

&quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; was certified Gold, half a million copies sold. The album addresses urban Black concerns said to remain relevant to the present day.

=== &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...&quot; ===
Shakur&#x27;s second album, &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...&quot;, was released in February 1993. A critical and commercial success, it debuted at No. 24 on the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200. An overall more hardcore album, it emphasizes Tupac&#x27;s sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality. The song &quot;Last Wordz&quot; features Ice Cube, co-writer of N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, who in his own solo albums had newly gone militantly political, and gangsta rapper Ice-T, who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band Body Count&#x27;s track &quot;Cop Killer&quot;.

In its vinyl release, side A, tracks 1 to 8, is labeled the &quot;Black Side&quot;, while side B, tracks 9 to 16, is the &quot;Dark Side&quot;. The album carries the single &quot;I Get Around&quot;, a party anthem featuring Digital Underground&#x27;s Shock G and Money-B, which became Shakur&#x27;s breakthrough, reaching No. 11 on the pop singles chart, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album also carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot;, an anthem for women&#x27;s empowerment. The album was certified Platinum, with a million copies sold. As of 2004, among Shakur albums, including posthumous and compilation albums, &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...&quot; was 10th in sales at about 1,366,000 copies.

=== Thug Life ===

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with Tyrus &quot;Big Syke&quot; Himes, Diron &quot;Macadoshis&quot; Rivers, his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and Walter &quot;Rated R&quot; Burns. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Tupac.

Thug Life released its only album, &quot;Thug Life, Volume I&quot;, on October 11, 1994, which is certified Gold. It carries the single &quot;Pour Out a Little Liquor&quot;, produced by Johnny &quot;J&quot; Jackson, who would also produce much of Shakur&#x27;s album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. The track also appears on the &quot;Above the Rim&quot; soundtrack. Due to gangsta rap being under heavy criticism at the time, the album&#x27;s original version was scrapped, and the album redone with mostly new tracks. Still, along with Stretch, Tupac would perform the first planned single, &quot;Out on Bail&quot;, which was never released, at the 1994 Source Awards.

=== The Notorious B.I.G. and Junior M.A.F.I.A. ===

In 1993, while visiting Los Angeles, the Notorious B.I.G. asked a local drug dealer to introduce him to Shakur and they quickly became friends. The pair would socialize when Shakur went to New York or B.I.G. to Los Angeles. During this period, at his own live shows, Shakur would call B.I.G. onto stage to rap with him and Stretch. Together, they recorded the songs &quot;Runnin&#x27; from tha Police&quot; and &quot;House of Pain&quot;.

Reportedly, B.I.G. asked Shakur to manage him, whereupon Shakur advised him that Sean Combs would make him a star. Yet in the meantime, Shakur&#x27;s lifestyle was comparatively lavish to B.I.G. who had not yet established himself. Shakur welcomed B.I.G. to join his side group Thug Life, but he would instead form his own side group, the Junior M.A.F.I.A., with his Brooklyn friends Lil&#x27; Cease and Lil&#x27; Kim. Shakur had a falling out with B.I.G. after Shakur was shot at Quad Studios in 1994.

=== &quot;Me Against the World&quot; ===

Shakur&#x27;s third album, &quot;Me Against the World,&quot; was released while he was incarcerated in March 1995. It is now hailed as his magnum opus, and commonly ranks among the greatest, most influential rap albums. The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a then record for highest first-week sales for a solo male rapper.

The lead single, &quot;Dear Mama&quot;, was released in February 1995 with &quot;Old School&quot; as the B-side. It is the album&#x27;s most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaking at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In July, it was certified Platinum. It ranked No. 51 on the year-end charts. The second single, &quot;So Many Tears&quot;, was released in June 1995, reaching No. 6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and No. 44 on Hot 100. The final single, &quot;Temptations&quot;, was released in August 1995. It reached No. 68 on the Hot 100, No. 35 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, and No. 13 on the Hot Rap Singles. Several celebrities showed their support for Shakur by appearing in the music video for &quot;Temptations&quot;.

Shakur won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2001, it ranked 4th among his total albums in sales, with about 3 million copies sold in the U.S.

=== &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; ===

While Shakur was imprisoned in 1995, his mother was about to lose her house. Shakur had his wife Keisha Morris contact Death Row Records founder Suge Knight in Los Angeles. Reportedly, Shakur&#x27;s mother promptly received $15,000. After an August visit to Clinton Correctional Facility in northern New York state, Knight traveled southward to New York City to attend the 2nd Annual Source Awards ceremony. Meanwhile, an East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry was brewing between Death Row and Bad Boy Records. In October 1995, Knight visited Shakur in prison again and posted $1.4 million bond. Shakur returned to Los Angeles and joined Death Row with the appeal of his December 1994 conviction pending.

Shakur&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, arrived on February 13, 1996. It was rap&#x27;s first double album—meeting two of the three albums due in Shakur&#x27;s contract with Death Row—and bore five singles. The album shows Shakur rapping about the gangsta lifestyle, leaving behind his previous political messages. With standout production, the album has more party tracks and often a triumphant tone. Music journalist Kevin Powell noted that Shakur, once released from prison, became more aggressive, and &quot;seemed like a completely transformed person&quot;.

As Shakur&#x27;s second album to hit No. 1 on both the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the pop albums chart, the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it sold 566,000 copies in its first week and was it was certified 5× Multi-Platinum in April. The singles &quot;How Do U Want It&quot; and &quot;California Love&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Death Row released Shakur&#x27;s diss track &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot; as the non-album B-side to &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;. In this venomous tirade, the proclaimed &quot;Bad Boy killer&quot; threatens violent payback on all things Bad Boy — B.I.G., Sean Combs, Junior M.A.F.I.A., the company — and on any in the East Coast rap scene, like rap duo Mobb Deep and rapper Chino XL, who allegedly had commented against Shakur about the dispute.

&quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; won R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year at the 1997 Soul Train Music Awards. At the 1997 American Music Awards, Shakur won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist. The album was certified 9× Multi-Platinum in June 1998, and 10× in July 2014.

===Posthumous albums===

At the time of his death, a fifth solo album was already finished, &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot;, under the stage name Makaveli. It had been recorded during the summer of 1996 and released that year. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days, and mixing took another four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked &quot;The 7 Day Theory&quot; at No. 9 among hip-hop&#x27;s greatest albums ever, and by 2006 a classic album. Its singular poignance, through hurt and rage, contemplation and vendetta, resonate with many fans.

According to George &quot;Papa G&quot; Pryce, Death Row Records&#x27; then director of public relations, the album was meant to be &quot;underground&quot;, and was not intended for release before the artist was murdered. It peaked at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. On June 15, 1999, it was certified 4× Multi-Platinum.

Later posthumous albums are archival productions, these albums are:

* &quot;R U Still Down?&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Still I Rise&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Until the End of Time&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Better Dayz&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Pac&#x27;s Life&quot; (2006)

==Poetry collection==
Before and during his hip-hop career, Shakur wrote dozens of poems. Some of the most notable are &quot;Can U C The Pride in The Panther&quot;, &quot;If I fail&quot;, &quot;Family Tree&quot;, and &quot;The Rose that grew from the concrete&quot;. In 1993 Tupac played a character named “Lucky” in the film titled Poetic Justice alongside Janet Jackson. Poet and activist Maya Angelou, whom worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X during the civil rights movement, wrote the poems used in the 1993 film.

In April 2022, handwritten poems written by Tupac when he was 11 years old were up for sale for US$300,000 but only sold for $90,000. The poems were for Jamal Joseph and three other Black Panther Party members while they were incarcerated at Leavenworth Prison. Even at his young age, Shakur&#x27;s writing dealt with themes such as black liberation, mass incarceration, race, and masculinity. The poems feature a self-portrait of Shakur sleeping, pen in hand, dreaming of the Black Panthers being freed from prison, and signed with a heart and the phrase &quot;Tupac Shakur, Future Freedom Fighter&quot;.

In October, 2023, sexually explicit poems he wrote to Jada Pinkett Smith while in prison went public in the book &quot;Tupac Shakur: The Authorized Biography.&quot; Pinkett Smith celebrated Shakur&#x27;s 50th birthday by showing an unreleased poem on Instagram called &quot;Lost Soulz.&quot; According to Rolling Stone writer Andy Green: “He was also a poet and activist who became one of his era’s most revolutionary voices.&quot; Tupac had passion for theater and admiration of William Shakespeare. Years after Tupac&#x27;s death, Nas said &quot;I put Tupac beyond Shakespeare.&quot;

==Film career==
Shakur&#x27;s first film appearance was in the 1991 film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot;, a cameo by the Digital Underground. In 1992, he starred in &quot;Juice&quot;, in which he plays the fictional Roland Bishop, a militant and haunting individual. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Peter Travers calls him &quot;the film&#x27;s most magnetic figure&quot;.

In 1993, Shakur starred alongside Janet Jackson in John Singleton&#x27;s romance film, &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. Singleton later fired Shakur from the 1995 film &quot;Higher Learning&quot; because the studio would not finance the film following his arrest. For the lead role in the eventual 2001 film &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, a role played by Tyrese Gibson, Singleton originally had Shakur in mind. Ultimately, the set design includes a Shakur mural in the protagonist&#x27;s bedroom, and the film&#x27;s score includes Shakur&#x27;s song &quot;Hail Mary&quot;.

Director Allen Hughes had cast Shakur as Sharif in the 1993 film &quot;Menace II Society&quot; but replaced him once Shakur assaulted him on set due to a discrepancy with the script. Nonetheless, in 2013, Hughes appraises that Shakur would have outshone the other actors &quot;because he was bigger than the movie&quot;.

Shakur played a gangster called Birdie in the 1994 film &quot;Above the Rim&quot;. By some accounts, that character had been modeled after former New York drug dealer Jacques &quot;Haitian Jack&quot; Agnant, who managed and promoted rappers. Shakur was introduced to him at a Queens nightclub. Reportedly, B.I.G. advised Shakur to avoid him, but Shakur disregarded the warning. Through Haitian Jack, Shakur met James &quot;Jimmy Henchman&quot; Rosemond, also a drug dealer who doubled as music manager.

Soon after Shakur&#x27;s death, three more films starring him were released, &quot;Bullet&quot; (1996), &quot;Gridlock&#x27;d&quot; (1997), and &quot;Gang Related&quot; (1997).

=== Posthumous rumored roles and &quot;Star Wars&quot; ===

It was rumored that Shakur was being considered by George Lucas to portray Jedi Master Mace Windu in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel films (1999–2005). According to former Death Row Records chief engineer Rick Clifford, George Lucas was eyeing Tupac to star in his return to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga. Clifford talked about how excited Tupac was for the role, &quot;&#x27;Pac found out that I worked for Brian Austin Green, who was on &quot;90210&quot;, then he found out I [worked on] some movies, so we always talked about his film career and stuff. [...] He was telling me that he was supposed to read for George Lucas and them. They wanted him to be a Jedi. I&#x27;m serious. Samuel L. [Jackson] got Tupac&#x27;s part. [Tupac] said [to me], &#x27;Old man, keep your fingers crossed.&#x27; He said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got three movies coming up. One of them, I&#x27;ve got to read for George Lucas.&quot;

&quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; script had begun being written in 1996 and the eventual film seeing release in 1999. Lucas had asked Jackson to ask Shakur to audition but due to Shakur&#x27;s untimely death the role ultimately went to Samuel L. Jackson. The two had worked on the film &quot;Juice&quot; together.

==Personal life==
In his 1995 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, Shakur listed Jada Pinkett, Jasmine Guy, Treach and Mickey Rourke among the people who were looking out for him while he was in prison. Shakur also mentioned that Madonna was a supportive friend. Madonna later revealed that they had dated in 1994.

Shakur became close friends with Jada Pinkett while attending the Baltimore School for the Arts. He helped Pinkett land her first movie role in the film &quot;Menace II Society&quot; (1993). In turn, Pinkett secured Shakur a guest starring role on the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1993. She appeared in his music videos &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; and &quot;Temptations&quot;. She also came up with the concept for his &quot;California Love&quot; music video and had intended to direct it, but removed herself from the project. In 1995, Pinkett contributed $100,000 towards Shakur&#x27;s bail as he awaited an appeal on his sexual abuse conviction. Pinkett later revealed that she turned down his marriage proposal while he was incarcerated at Rikers Island in 1995. Speaking about Pinkett, Shakur stated: &quot;Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life. We&#x27;ll be old together. Jada can ask me to do anything and she can have it.&quot; Pinkett said Shakur was &quot;one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime&quot;.

After Shakur was shot in 1994, he recuperated at Jasmine Guy&#x27;s home. They had met during his guest appearance on the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1993. Guy appeared in his music video &quot;Temptations&quot; and later wrote his mother&#x27;s 2004 biography, &quot;Afeni Shakur: Evolution of a Revolutionary&quot;.

Shakur befriended Treach when they were both roadies on Public Enemy&#x27;s tour in 1990. He made a cameo in Naughty by Nature&#x27;s music video &quot;Uptown Anthem&quot; in 1992. Treach collaborated on Shakur&#x27;s song &quot;5 Deadly Venomz&quot; and appeared in the music video for Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Temptations&quot;. Treach was also a speaker at a public memorial service for Shakur in 1996.

In 1993, during a police raid of Shakur&#x27;s room at New York City&#x27;s Parker Meridian Hotel, a videotape was confiscated which showed Shakur having sex with his then-girlfriend Desiree Smith. Officers were attempting to build their case against Shakur for the alleged sodomy of Ayanna Jackson. In 2022, Smith insisted she was neither underage nor intoxicated at the time of their tryst. In 2011, a sex tape featuring Shakur receiving oral sex from a groupie while rapping and dancing along to one of his own unreleased songs, was sold to a private collector. The video, which was filmed in 1993, also features rapper Money B from Digital Underground.

Shakur and Mickey Rourke formed a bond while filming the movie &quot;Bullet&quot; in 1994. Rourke recalled that Shakur &quot;was there for me during some very hard times.&quot;

Shakur had friendships with other celebrities, including Mike Tyson Chuck D, Jim Carrey, and Alanis Morissette. In April 1996, Shakur said that he, Morissette, Snoop Dogg, and Suge Knight were planning to open a restaurant together.

On April 29, 1995, Shakur married his girlfriend Keisha Morris, a pre-law student. Their marriage was annulled ten months later.

In a 1993 interview published in &quot;The Source&quot;, Shakur criticized record producer Quincy Jones for his interracial marriage to actress Peggy Lipton. Their daughter Rashida Jones responded with an irate open letter. Shakur later apologized to her sister Kidada Jones, whom he began dating in 1996. Shakur and Jones attended Men&#x27;s Fashion Week in Milan and walked the runway together for a Versace fashion show. Jones was at their hotel in Las Vegas when Shakur was shot.

==Legal issues==

=== Sexual assault case, prison sentence, appeal and release ===

In November 1993, Shakur and two other men were charged in New York with sodomizing a woman in Shakur&#x27;s hotel room. The woman, Ayanna Jackson, alleged that after she performed oral sex on Shakur at the public dance floor of a Manhattan nightclub, she went to his hotel room on a later day, when Shakur, record executive Jacques &quot;Haitian Jack&quot; Agnant, Shakur&#x27;s road manager Charles Fuller and an unidentified fourth man apprehended and forced her to perform non-consensual oral sex on each of them. Shakur was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm as two guns were found in the hotel room. Interviewed on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, Shakur said he was hurt that &quot;a woman would accuse me of taking something from her&quot;, as he had been raised in a female household and surrounded by women his whole life.

On December 1, 1994, Shakur was acquitted of three counts of sodomy and the associated gun charges, but convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse for &quot;forcibly touching the woman&#x27;s buttocks&quot; in his hotel room. Jurors have said the lack of evidence stymied a sodomy conviction. Shakur&#x27;s lawyer characterized the sentence as &quot;out of line&quot; with the groping conviction and the setting of bail at $3 million as &quot;inhumane&quot;. Shakur&#x27;s accuser later filed a civil suit against Shakur seeking $10 million for punitive damages which was subsequently settled.

After Shakur had been convicted of sexual abuse, Jacques Agnant&#x27;s case was separated and closed via misdemeanor plea without incarceration. A. J. Benza reported in &quot;New York Daily News&quot; Shakur&#x27;s new disdain for Agnant who Shakur theorized had set him up with the case. Shakur reportedly believed his accuser was connected to and had sexual relations with Agnant and James &quot;Henchman&quot; Rosemond, who he considered to be behind the 1994 Quad Studios shooting.

Shakur was unable to post the $3 million bond to keep himself free until sentencing so he surrendered himself to authorities at the Bellevue Hospital Jail Ward in New York City on December 23, 1994. At the time, he was still recovering from injuries he received on November 30, when he was shot five times and robbed at Quad Studios. In January 1995, Shakur was moved to the North Infirmary Command (NIC) on Rikers Island in the Bronx. On February 7, 1995, he was sentenced to 18 months to years in prison by a judge who decried &quot;an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman&quot;.

In March 1995, Shakur was transferred to Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. While imprisoned, he began reading again, which he had been unable to do as his career progressed due to his marijuana and alcohol habits. Works such as &quot;The Prince&quot; by Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli and &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu sparked Shakur&#x27;s interest in philosophy, philosophy of war and military strategy. On April 29, 1995, Shakur married his girlfriend Keisha Morris; the marriage was later annulled. While in prison, Shakur exchanged letters with celebrities such as Jim Carrey and Tony Danza among others. He was also visited by Al Sharpton, who helped Shakur get released from solitary confinement. 
By October 1995, pending judicial appeal, Shakur was incarcerated in New York. On October 12, he bonded out of the maximum security Dannemora Clinton Correctional Facility in the process of appealing his conviction, once Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row Records, arranged for the posting of his $1.4 million bond.

=== 1993 shooting in Atlanta ===
On October 31, 1993, Shakur was arrested in Atlanta for shooting two off-duty police officers, brothers Mark Whitwell and Scott Whitwell. The Atlanta police claimed the shooting occurred after the brothers were almost struck by a car carrying Shakur while they were crossing the street with their wives. As they argued with the driver, Shakur&#x27;s car pulled up and he shot the Whitwells in the buttocks and the abdomen. However, there are conflicting accounts that the Whitwells were harassing a black motorist and uttered racial slurs. According to some witnesses, Shakur and his entourage had fired in self-defense as Mark Whitwell shot at them first.

Shakur was charged with two counts of aggravated assault. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur&#x27;s car and later with making false statements to investigators. Scott Whitwell admitted to possessing a gun he had taken from a Henry County police evidence room. Prosecutors ultimately dropped all charges against both parties. Mark Whitwell resigned from the force seven months after the shooting. Both brothers filed civil suits against Shakur; Mark Whitwell&#x27;s suit was settled out of court, while Scott Whitwell&#x27;s $2 million lawsuit resulted in a default judgment entered against the rapper&#x27;s estate in 1998.

===1994 Quad Studios shooting===
On November 30, 1994, while in New York recording verses for a mixtape of Ron G, Shakur was repeatedly distracted by his beeper. Music manager James &quot;Jimmy Henchman&quot; Rosemond reportedly offered Shakur $7,000 to stop by Quad Studios, in Times Square, that night to record a verse for his client Little Shawn. Shakur was unsure, but agreed to the session as he needed the cash to offset legal costs. He arrived with Stretch and one or two others. In the lobby, three men robbed and beat him at gunpoint; Shakur resisted and was shot. Shakur speculated that the shooting had been a set-up.

Against medical advice, Shakur checked out of Metropolitan Hospital Center a few hours after surgery and secretly went to the house of the actress Jasmine Guy to recuperate. The next day, Shakur arrived at a Manhattan courthouse bandaged in a wheelchair to receive the jury&#x27;s verdict for his sexual abuse case. Shakur spent the next few weeks being cared for by his mother and a private doctor at Guy&#x27;s home. The Fruit of Islam and former members of the Black Panther Party stood guard to protect him.

=== Setup accusations involving the Notorious B.I.G. ===
In a 1995 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot;, Shakur accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and the Notorious B.I.G. – who were at Quad Studios at the time – among others, of setting up or being privy to the November 1994 robbery and shooting. The accusations were significant to the East–West Coast rivalry in hip-hop; in 1995, months after the robbery, Combs and B.I.G. released the track &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot;, which Shakur took as a mockery of his shooting and thought they could be responsible, so he released a diss song, &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot;, in which he targeted B.I.G., Combs, their record label, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and at the end of &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot;, he mentions rivals Mobb Deep and Chino XL.

In March 2008, Chuck Philips, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, reported on the 1994 ambush and shooting. The newspaper later retracted the article since it relied partially on FBI documents later discovered forged, supplied by a man convicted of fraud. In June 2011, convicted murderer Dexter Isaac, incarcerated in Brooklyn, issued a confession that he had been one of the gunmen who had robbed and shot Shakur at Henchman&#x27;s order.

=== Other criminal or civil cases ===

==== 1991 Oakland Police Department lawsuit ====

On October 17, 1991, two Oakland Police Department officers stopped Shakur for jaywalking at a downtown intersection. According to Shakur, officers Alex Boyovic and Kevin Rogers asked him for his ID and pressed him about his name before choking him, throwing him to the ground and slamming his head on the concrete. Shakur filed a $10 million lawsuit against the officers for police brutality. The case was settled for about $43,000. It was later revealed that this incident was the onset of Shakur&#x27;s autoimmune disease alopecia, which led him to shave his head bald.

==== Misdemeanor assault convictions ====
On April 5, 1993, charged with felonious assault, Shakur allegedly threw a microphone and swung a baseball bat at rapper Chauncey Wynn, of the group M.A.D., at a concert at Michigan State University. Shakur claimed the bat was a part of his show, that he never swung it, and that there was no criminal intent. Nonetheless, on September 14, 1994, Shakur pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, twenty of them suspended on condition that he complete 35 hours of community service.

Slated to star as Sharif in the 1993 Hughes Brothers&#x27; film &quot;Menace II Society&quot;, Shakur was replaced by actor Vonte Sweet after allegedly assaulting one of the film&#x27;s directors, Allen Hughes. In early 1994, Shakur served 15 days in jail after being found guilty of the assault. The prosecution&#x27;s evidence included a &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; interview in which Shakur boasted that he had &quot;beat up the director of &quot;Menace II Society&quot;&quot;.

==== Concealed weapon case ====
In 1994, Shakur was arrested in Los Angeles, when he was stopped by police on suspicion of speeding. Police found a semiautomatic pistol in the car, a felony offense because a prior conviction in 1993 in Los Angeles for carrying a concealed firearm. On April 4, 1996, Shakur was sentenced to 120 days in jail for violating his release terms and failing to appear for a road cleanup job, but was allowed to remain free awaiting appeal. On June 7, his sentence was deferred via appeals pending in other cases.

==== 1995 wrongful death suit ====
On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed outdoors at a festival. For about an hour after the performance, he signed autographs and posed for photos. A conflict broke out and Shakur allegedly drew a legally carried Colt Mustang but dropped it on the ground. Shakur claimed that someone with him then picked it up when it accidentally discharged.

About 100 yards (90 meters) away in a schoolyard, Qa&#x27;id Walker-Teal, a boy aged 6 on his bicycle, was fatally shot in the forehead. Police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur. His stepbrother Maurice Harding was arrested in suspicion of having fired the gun, but no charges were filed. Lack of witnesses stymied prosecution. In 1995, Qa&#x27;id&#x27;s mother filed a wrongful death suit against Shakur, which was settled for about $300,000 to $500,000.

==== C. Delores Tucker lawsuit ====
Civil rights activist and fierce rap critic C. Delores Tucker sued Shakur&#x27;s estate in federal court, claiming that lyrics in &quot;How Do U Want It&quot; and &quot;Wonda Why They Call U Bitch&quot; inflicted emotional distress, were slanderous, and invaded her privacy. The case was later dismissed.

==Murder and aftermath==
On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur was in Paradise, Nevada to attend the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand. Afterward in the lobby one of Knight&#x27;s associates spotted Orlando &quot;Baby Lane&quot; Anderson, a Southside Compton Crip, and told Shakur he had tried to rob them earlier that year. The hotel&#x27;s surveillance footage shows the ensuing assault on Anderson. Shakur soon stopped by his hotel room and then headed with Knight to his Death Row nightclub, Club 662, in a black BMW 750iL sedan, part of a larger convoy.

At about 11 p.m. on Las Vegas Boulevard, bicycle-mounted police stopped the car for its loud music and lack of license plates. The plates were found in the trunk, and the car was released without a ticket. At about 11:15 p.m. at a stop light, a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac sedan pulled up to the passenger side and an occupant rapidly fired into the car. Shakur was struck four times: once in the arm, once in the thigh, and twice in the chest with one bullet entering his right lung. Shards hit Knight&#x27;s head. Frank Alexander, Shakur&#x27;s bodyguard, was not in the car at the time. He would say he had been tasked to drive the car of Shakur&#x27;s girlfriend, Kidada Jones.

Shakur was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where he was heavily sedated and put on life support. In the intensive-care unit on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding. He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. The official causes of death are respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest associated with multiple gunshot wounds. Shakur&#x27;s body was cremated the next day. Members of the Outlawz, recalling a line in his song &quot;Black Jesus&quot;, (although uncertain of the artist&#x27;s attempt at a literal meaning chose to interpret the request seriously) smoked some of his body&#x27;s ashes after mixing them with marijuana.

In 2002, investigative journalist Chuck Philips, after a year of work, reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that Anderson, a Southside Compton Crip, having been attacked by Suge and Shakur&#x27;s entourage at the MGM Hotel after the boxing match, had fired the fatal gunshots, but that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police had interviewed him only once, briefly, before his death in an unrelated shooting. Philips&#x27;s 2002 article also alleges the involvement of Christopher &quot;Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace and several within New York City&#x27;s criminal underworld. Both Anderson and Wallace denied involvement, while Wallace offered a confirmed alibi. Music journalist John Leland, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the evidence &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

In 2011, via the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents related to its investigation which described an extortion scheme by the Jewish Defense League (classified as &quot;a right wing terrorist group&quot; by the FBI) that included making death threats against Shakur and other rappers, but did not indicate a direct connection to his murder.

On July 18, 2023, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department executed a search warrant in connection with Shakur&#x27;s murder.

On September 29, 2023, the AP reported that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, Duane &quot;Keefe D&quot; Davis, in Shakur&#x27;s murder. Police had two months previously served a search warrant at his wife&#x27;s home in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson. Davis pleaded not guilty on November 2, 2023, in Las Vegas. As of February 2025, Davis&#x27; trial is set to start on February 9, 2026. As of January 2025, Davis remains in prison.

== Artistry ==

=== Musical style ===
Shakur&#x27;s music and philosophical outlook were deeply influenced by a wide range of American, African American, and global influences, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and the concept of liberty. Moreover, Shakur&#x27;s artistic sensibilities were enriched by his passion for theater and admiration for the works of William Shakespeare. Notably, he honed his theatrical skills as a student at the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he delved into the psychological complexities inherent in inter-gang warfare and inter-cultural conflicts, reflecting themes explored in Shakespearean dramas.

&quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; (1991), showcased his socially conscious perspective. Through powerful tracks like &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot;, and &quot;Part Time Mutha&quot;, Shakur addressed social injustice, poverty, and police brutality. In doing so, he contributed to the ongoing success of rap groups such as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, while establishing himself as one of the pioneering socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.

Continuing his focus on the social challenges faced by African American people, Shakur&#x27;s second album featured songs like &quot;The Streetz R Deathrow&quot; and &quot;Last Wordz&quot;. Simultaneously, he showcased his compassionate side with the empowering anthem &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot;, and his legendary intensity with the title track from the album &quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...&quot; Additionally, he paid homage to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track &quot;I Get Around&quot;. Throughout his career, Shakur&#x27;s subsequent albums reflected a growing assertiveness in his approach.

Shakur&#x27;s body of work encompassed contrasting themes, including social inequality, injustice, compassion, playfulness, and hope. These elements continued to shape his artistry, exemplified by his explosive 1995 album &quot;Me Against the World&quot;. The release of &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; in 1996 further solidified his reputation, with tracks like &quot;Ambitionz az a Ridah&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Mad at Cha&quot;, &quot;California Love&quot;, &quot;Life Goes On&quot;, and &quot;Picture Me Rollin being hailed as classics by critics. Shakur described &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; as a celebration of life, and the album achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success. According to Eminem, Tupac is the greatest songwriter of all time. Nas said in 2002: &quot;I put Tupac beyond Shakespeare.&quot;

=== Vocal style ===
Singers can manipulate different parts of their body to create various sounds. For instance, the &quot;head voice&quot; involves singing high-pitched tones resonating from the head, while the &quot;chest voice&quot; utilizes the chest area. In the documentary &quot;Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel,&quot; Greg &quot;Shock G&quot; Jacobs, one of Shakur&#x27;s early producers, discusses how rappers also utilize different bodily areas to project their voices. According to him, &quot;Slick Rick rhymed from the nasal palate, Nas from the back of his throat, and Pac from the pit of his stomach, which is where his power came from.&quot; Shakur&#x27;s influences stemmed from powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Despite not being physically imposing, Shakur&#x27;s voice carried immense weight and power, reminiscent of these influential speakers.

Shakur was also known for his technique of stacking or layering vocals, adding depth and rawness to his voice. This approach, demonstrated notably on tracks like &quot;Dear Mama&quot; from his 1995 album &quot;Me Against the World&quot;, involves overlaying multiple vocal lines to highlight rhythms and emphasize words and phrases. Mastering this technique requires precision to maintain flow and clarity, as heard in the lyrics &quot;and even though I act crazy/I gotta thank the Lord that you made me,&quot; where Shakur&#x27;s voice transitions from full to husky, underscoring the emotional depth of the lyrics. Despite its difficulty, Shakur&#x27;s background in jazz, poetry, and theater endowed him with exceptional rhythm control, enabling him to layer vocals seamlessly while preserving cohesion and flow.

==Legacy and remembrance==
Shakur is considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. He was listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He is widely credited as an important figure in hip-hop culture, and his prominence in pop culture in general has been noted. Dotdash, formerly About.com, while ranking him fifth among the greatest rappers, nonetheless notes, &quot;Tupac Shakur is the most influential hip-hop artist of all time. Even in death, 2Pac remains a transcendental rap figure.&quot; Yet to some, he was a &quot;father figure&quot; who, said rapper YG, &quot;makes you want to be better—at every level.&quot; In 2023, Billboard ranked Tupac at number 4 among the top 50 rappers of all time.

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Shakur as &quot;the unlikely martyr of gangsta rap&quot;, with Shakur paying the ultimate price of a criminal lifestyle. Shakur was described as one of the top two American rappers in the 1990s, along with Snoop Dogg. The online rap magazine &quot;AllHipHop&quot; held a 2007 roundtable at which New York rappers Cormega, citing tour experience with New York rap duo Mobb Deep, commented that B.I.G. ran New York, but Shakur ran America. Shakur emerged as a celebrated artist, earning recognition for his astonishingly prolific output and unwavering commitment to his craft. According to Rolling Stone writer Andy Green: “He was also a poet and activist who became one of his era’s most revolutionary voices.&quot;

In 2017, American rapper Snoop Dogg called Tupac “the greatest rapper of all time” during his Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame tribute. In 2021, Saweetie told Complex that Tupac was “the greatest rapper that ever lived”.

According to British writer Rob Marriott, he deemed the act of tying a bandana into rabbit ears as one of the most distinctive and instantly recognizable style choices in the world of hip-hop. Regarded as a sex symbol, his unique style helped shape the fashion landscape of the 1990s and continues to influence artists and fashion enthusiasts to this day.

In 2010, writing &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s entry on Shakur at No. 86 among the &quot;100 greatest artists&quot;, New York rapper 50 Cent appraised:
According to music journalist Chuck Philips, Shakur &quot;had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon.&quot; Philips writes, &quot;The slaying silenced one of modern music&#x27;s most eloquent voices—a ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds.&quot; Via numerous fans perceiving him, despite his questionable conduct, as a martyr, &quot;the downsizing of martyrdom cheapens its use&quot;, academic Michael Eric Dyson concedes. But Dyson adds, &quot;Some, or even most, of that criticism can be conceded without doing damage to Tupac&#x27;s martyrdom in the eyes of those disappointed by more traditional martyrs.&quot;

In 2014, BET explained that &quot;his confounding mixture of ladies&#x27; man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival B.I.G., it&#x27;s easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world&#x27;s attention the way Tupac did and still does.&quot; More simply, his writings, published after his death, inspired rapper YG to return to school and get his GED. In 2020, former California Senator and current vice-president Kamala Harris called Shakur the &quot;best rapper alive&quot;, which she explained as being because &quot;West Coast girls think 2Pac lives on&quot;. According to writer Kevin Powell: &quot;He deserves to be put in the same category as Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, as John Lennon, in terms of his global impact.&quot; Tupac is regarded as one of the most influential artists in music and popular culture in general and an icon of activism.

Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar, leader and a founding member of DAM, became passionate about hip-hop by listening to Tupac, saying, &quot;The imagery in Shakur&#x27;s videos was similar to our reality in Lod.&quot;

=== Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation ===
In 1997, Shakur&#x27;s mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation. Later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, or TASF, it launched with a stated mission to &quot;provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.&quot; The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers, and undergraduate scholarships. In June 2005, the TASF opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, or TASCA, in Stone Mountain, Georgia. It closed in 2015.

=== Academic appraisal ===
In 1997, the University of California, Berkeley, offered a course led by a student titled &quot;History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur&quot;. In April 2003, Harvard University cosponsored the symposium &quot;All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero&quot;, where Shakur&#x27;s influence as both an artist and an activist was analyzed.
The papers presented cover his ranging influence from entertainment to sociology. Calling him a &quot;Thug Nigga Intellectual&quot;, an &quot;organic intellectual&quot;, English scholar Mark Anthony Neal assessed his death as leaving a &quot;leadership void amongst hip-hop artists&quot;, as this &quot;walking contradiction&quot; helps, Neal explained, &quot;make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.&quot;

Tracing Shakur&#x27;s mythical status, Murray Forman discussed him as &quot;O.G.&quot;, or &quot;Ostensibly Gone&quot;, with fans, using digital mediums, &quot;resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.&quot; Music scholar Emmett Price, calling him a &quot;Black folk hero&quot;, traced his persona to Black American folklore&#x27;s tricksters, which, after abolition, evolved into the urban &quot;bad-man&quot;. Yet in Shakur&#x27;s &quot;terrible sense of urgency&quot;, Price identified instead a quest to &quot;unify mind, body, and spirit.&quot; According to Price, Tupac had surpassed the legacies of John Coltrane and Mahalia Jackson within the tradition of black music.

In 2012, the Norwegian University of Oslo organized the course: &quot;Tupac, hiphop og kulturhistorie (Tupac, hip-hop and cultural history).&quot; As Knut Aukrust, Norwegian professor and academic scholar of cultural studies at the University of Oslo, puts it: &quot;Tupac Amaru Shakur (1971-1996) is one of the most famous and controversial representatives of hip-hop culture. He has become an icon with saint status far beyond his fans. References to him and his message appear all over the world, from Barack Obama&#x27;s slogan about &quot;changes&quot;, to Palestinians and Israelis longing for peace in the Middle East, to the people of Groruddalen who want their experiences to be taken on board serious. The course highlights how a single person can fit into a wider network of cultural models and how a local storytelling tradition has become an international cultural phenomenon.&quot;

Jeffrey Ogbonna Green Ogbar, professor of History and Popular Music at the University of Connecticut, described Shakur as &quot;one of the most iconic and influential music artists of the 20th century&quot;, and also a &quot;politically conscious activist voice for Black America.&quot;

=== Multimedia releases ===
In 2005, Death Row released on DVD, &quot;&quot;, his final recorded live performance, an event on July 4, 1996. In August 2006, &quot;Tupac Shakur Legacy&quot;, an &quot;interactive biography&quot; by Jamal Joseph, arrived with previously unpublished family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 detachable copies of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other papers. In 2006, the Shakur album &quot;Pac&#x27;s Life&quot; was released and, like the previous, was among the recording industry&#x27;s most popular releases. In 2008, his estate made about $15 million.

On April 15, 2012, at the Coachella Music Festival, rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre joined a Shakur &quot;hologram&quot; (Although the media referred to the technology as a hologram, technically it was a projection created with the Musion Eyeliner), and, as a partly virtual trio, performed the Shakur songs &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;. There were talks of a tour, but Dre refused. Meanwhile, the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, released in 1998, and which in 2000 had left the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200, returned to the chart and reached No. 129, while also other Shakur albums and singles drew sales gains.

=== Film and stage ===
The documentary film &quot;&quot; was released in November 2003. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards.

In 2014, the play &quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot;, based on Shakur&#x27;s lyrics, played on Broadway, but, among Broadway&#x27;s worst-selling musicals in recent years, ran only six weeks. In development since 2013, a Shakur biopic, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, began filming in Atlanta in December 2015. It was released on June 16, 2017, on Shakur&#x27;s 46th birthday, albeit to generally negative reviews.

In August 2019, a docuseries directed by Allen Hughes, &quot;Outlaw: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur&quot;, was announced.

===Awards and honors===

In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2004, Shakur was among the honorees at the first Hip Hop Honors.

In 2006, Shakur&#x27;s close friend and classmate Jada Pinkett Smith donated $1 million to their high school alma mater, the Baltimore School for the Arts, and named the new theater in his honor. In 2021, Pinkett Smith honored Shakur&#x27;s 50th birthday by releasing a never before seen poem she had received from him.

In 2009, drawing praise, the Vatican added &quot;Changes&quot;, a 1998 posthumous track, to its online playlist. On June 23, 2010, the Library of Congress added &quot;Dear Mama&quot; to the National Recording Registry, the third rap song.

In 2015, the Grammy Museum opened an exhibition dedicated to Shakur.

In his first year of eligibility, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 7, 2017.

In January 2022, the exhibition &quot;Tupac Shakur: Wake Me When I&#x27;m Free&quot; opened at The Canvas at L.A. Live in Los Angeles.

On May 16, 2023, Oakland City Council voted to name the section of MacArthur Boulevard between Grand Avenue and Van Buren Avenue &quot;Tupac Shakur Way&quot;.

On June 7, 2023, Shakur received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His half-sister, Sekyiwa &quot;Set&quot; Shakur, accepted the award in his honor.

== Final resting place in Soweto ==
In 2006, on the 10th anniversary of Tupac Shakur&#x27;s passing, his ashes were laid to rest in Soweto. Shakur&#x27;s mother Afeni transported them to the &quot;birthplace of his ancestors&quot; and conducted a memorial service in what&#x27;s considered as one of the most renowned South African townships. Afeni Shakur explained that Soweto had been selected due to its significance as the &quot;birthplace of the South African struggle for democracy and against apartheid.&quot; The City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality donated a five-acre plot of undeveloped land in the Zola area of Soweto to build a memorial honoring Shakur. A portion of the land was designated to be transformed into a park for the benefit of local children as well as aimed at promoting environmental education, pathways, orphanages, bridges, skateboard ramps and a golf range while plans also included the construction of an amphitheater and a museum showcasing South African music and arts. The project was funded by Johannesburg city authorities and the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation. The memorial was hosted by South African musician and actor Zola 7. Singer Macy Gray and members of the Outlawz were amongst the attendees who paid their respects.

<doc id="31342" wikidata="Q82464" url="?curid=31342" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray">
<text>The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical fiction and gothic horror novel by Irish writer Oscar Wilde. A shorter novella-length version was published in the July 1890 issue of the American periodical &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;. The novel-length version was published in April 1891. It is regarded as a classic of Gothic literature and has been adapted for films and stage performances.

The story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray painted by Basil Hallward, a friend of Dorian&#x27;s and an artist infatuated with Dorian&#x27;s beauty. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton and is soon enthralled by the aristocrat&#x27;s hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. Knowing that he will lose his beauty with time, Dorian impulsively chooses to sell his soul and asks for the portrait, rather than himself, to age and fade. His wish granted, Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and visually records every one of Dorian&#x27;s sins.

Wilde&#x27;s only novel, it was subject to much controversy and criticism in its time but has come to be recognised as a classic of Gothic literature.

==Origins==
In 1882, Oscar Wilde met Frances Richards in Ottawa, where he visited her studios. In 1887, Richards moved to London where she renewed her acquaintance with Wilde and painted his portrait. Wilde described that incident as being the inspiration for the novel:
In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and T. P. Gill at the Langham Hotel, and commissioned novellas from each writer. Doyle promptly submitted &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, which was published in the February 1890 edition of &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s&quot;. Stoddart received Wilde&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; on 7 April 1890, seven months after having commissioned the novel from him.

In July 1889, Wilde published &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot;, a very different story but one that has a similar title to &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; and has been described as &quot;a preliminary sketch of some of its major themes&quot;, including homosexuality.

== Publication and versions ==

=== 1890 novella ===
The literary merits of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; impressed Stoddart, but he told the publisher, George Lippincott, &quot;in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to.&quot; Fearing that the story was indecent, Stoddart deleted around five hundred words without Wilde&#x27;s knowledge prior to publication. Among the pre-publication deletions were: (i) passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire; (ii) all references to the fictional book title &quot;Le Secret de Raoul&quot; and its author, Catulle Sarrazin; and (iii) all &quot;mistress&quot; references to Gray&#x27;s lovers, Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton.

It was published in full as the first 100 pages in both the American and British editions of the July 1890 issue, first printed on 20 June 1890. Later in the year the publisher of Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine, Ward, Lock and Company, published a collection of complete novels from the magazine, which included Wilde&#x27;s.

=== 1891 novel ===

For the fuller 1891 novel, Wilde retained Stoddart&#x27;s edits and made some of his own, while expanding the text from thirteen to twenty chapters and added the book&#x27;s famous preface. Chapters 3, 5, and 15–18 are new, and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided into chapters 19 and 20 for the novel. Revisions include changes in character dialogue as well as the addition of the preface, more scenes and chapters, and Sibyl Vane&#x27;s brother, James Vane.

The edits have been construed as having been done in response to criticism, but Wilde denied this in his 1895 trials, only ceding that critic Walter Pater, whom Wilde respected, did write several letters to him &quot;and in consequence of what he said I did modify one passage&quot; that was &quot;liable to misconstruction&quot;. A number of edits involved obscuring homoerotic references, to simplify the moral message of the story. In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he &quot;worships&quot; Dorian, and begs him not to &quot;take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me.&quot; In the magazine edition, Basil focuses upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), he focuses upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, &quot;the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him.&quot;

Wilde&#x27;s textual additions were about the &quot;fleshing out of Dorian as a character&quot; and providing details of his ancestry that made his &quot;psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing.&quot; The introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian&#x27;s selfishness and foreshadowing James&#x27;s accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorian&#x27;s dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane&#x27;s dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle.

In April 1891 Ward, Lock and Company published the revised version of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. In the decade after Wilde&#x27;s death, the authorised edition of the novel was published by Charles Carrington.

=== 2011 &quot;uncensored&quot; novella ===
The original typescript submitted to &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, now housed at UCLA, had been largely forgotten except by professional Wilde scholars until the 2011 publication of &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition&quot; by the Belknap Press. This edition includes the roughly 500 words of text deleted by J. M. Stoddart, the story&#x27;s initial editor, prior to its publication in &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s&quot; in 1890. For instance, in one scene, Basil Hallward confesses that he has worshipped Dorian Gray with a &quot;romance of feeling&quot;, and has never loved a woman.

== Preface ==
Following the criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, Wilde wrote a preface in which he indirectly addressed the criticisms in a series of epigrams. The preface was first published in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; and then, a month later, in the book version of the novel. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right as a literary and artistic manifesto in support of artists&#x27; rights and art for art&#x27;s sake.

To communicate how the novel should be read, Wilde used aphorisms to explain the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde&#x27;s cultural exposure to Taoism and to the philosophy of Chuang Tsǔ (Zhuang Zhou). Before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of Herbert Giles&#x27;s translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou, and in the essay &quot;The Critic as Artist&quot;, Oscar Wilde said:

==Summary==
In Victorian England, Lord Henry Wotton observes artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a wealthy young man who is Basil&#x27;s ultimate muse. The hedonistic Lord Henry thinks that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.

Under Lord Henry&#x27;s influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian courts her and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. Her brother, James, warns that if &quot;Prince Charming&quot; harms her, he will murder him.

Dorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in a play. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, saying that acting is her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. Returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish came true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.

Conscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but is too late; she has killed herself. Rationalizing his cruelty, the young man decides that he has no need for love since his immortality protects him from any consequence. Dorian locks the portrait up, and for eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry gave him.

One night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian&#x27;s house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent sensualism. Dorian does not deny his debauchery and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil can only identify it as his by the signature on it. Horrified, Basil beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation; angered by Basil&#x27;s reaction, Dorian stabs him to death. Dorian then blackmails an old friend, scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy Basil&#x27;s body. Alan later kills himself.

To escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where, unbeknownst to him, an older James Vane is present. James has been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl&#x27;s death but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the nickname she called him. There, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. James accosts Dorian, who deceives him into believing he is too young to have known Sibyl, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian but is then approached by a woman from the den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms Dorian&#x27;s identity and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years.

James begins to stalk Dorian, who starts to fear for his life. During a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells the elderly Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that he can never be truly redeemed as he only wishes to be absolved of his sins, without truly believing that what he has done is wrong.

Deciding that only a full confession will suffice, Dorian finds the knife with which he murdered Basil and stabs the picture in a bout of fury.

His servants awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard it calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. They identify the corpse as Dorian only by the rings on the fingers, while the portrait beside him is beautiful again.

==Characters==

*Dorian Gray – a handsome, selfish young man enthralled by Lord Henry&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; hedonism. He indulges in every pleasure and virtually every &#x27;sin&#x27;, studying its effect upon him.
* Basil Hallward – a deeply moral man, the painter of the portrait, and infatuated with Dorian, whose patronage realises his potential as an artist. The picture of Dorian Gray is Basil&#x27;s masterpiece.
* Lord Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Wotton – an imperious aristocrat and a decadent dandy who espouses a philosophy of self-indulgent hedonism. Initially Basil&#x27;s friend, he neglects him for Dorian&#x27;s beauty. The character of witty Lord Harry is a critique of Victorian culture at the &quot;Fin de siècle&quot; – of Britain at the end of the 19th century. Lord Harry&#x27;s libertine world view corrupts Dorian, who then successfully emulates him. To the aristocrat Harry, the observant artist Basil says, &quot;You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.&quot; Lord Henry takes pleasure in impressing, influencing, and even misleading his acquaintances (to which purpose he bends his considerable wit and eloquence) but appears not to observe his own hedonistic advice, preferring to study himself with scientific detachment. His distinguishing feature is total indifference to the consequences of his actions.
* Sibyl Vane – a talented actress and singer, she is a beautiful girl from a poor family with whom Dorian falls in love. Her love for Dorian ruins her acting ability, because she no longer finds pleasure in portraying fictional love as she is now experiencing real love in her life. She commits suicide with poison on learning that Dorian no longer loves her; at that, Lord Henry likens her to Ophelia, in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
* James Vane – Sibyl&#x27;s younger brother, a sailor who leaves for Australia. He is very protective of his sister, especially as their mother cares only for Dorian&#x27;s money. Believing that Dorian means to harm Sibyl, James hesitates to leave, and promises vengeance upon Dorian if any harm befalls her. After Sibyl&#x27;s suicide, James becomes obsessed with killing Dorian, and stalks him, but a hunter accidentally kills James. The brother&#x27;s pursuit of vengeance upon the lover (Dorian Gray), for the death of the sister (Sibyl) parallels that of Laertes&#x27; vengeance against Prince Hamlet.
* Alan Campbell – chemist and one-time friend of Dorian who ended their friendship when Dorian&#x27;s libertine reputation devalued such a friendship. Dorian blackmails Alan into destroying the body of the murdered Basil Hallward; Campbell later shoots himself dead.
* Lord Fermor – Lord Henry&#x27;s uncle, who tells his nephew, Lord Henry Wotton, about the family lineage of Dorian Gray.
* Adrian Singleton – A youthful friend of Dorian&#x27;s, whom he evidently introduced to opium addiction, which induced him to forge a cheque and made him a total outcast from his family and social set.
* Victoria, Lady Henry Wotton – Lord Henry&#x27;s wife, whom he treats disdainfully; she later divorces him.

== Major themes ==
=== Morality and societal influence ===
Throughout the novel, Wilde delves into the themes of morality and influence, exploring how societal values, individual relationships, and personal choices intersect to shape one&#x27;s own moral compass. Dorian initially falls under Lord Henry&#x27;s influence and &quot;narcissistic perspective on art and life&quot;, despite Basil&#x27;s warnings, but &quot;eventually recognizes its limitations&quot;. Through Lord Henry&#x27;s dialogue, Wilde is suggesting, as professor Dominic Manganiello pointed out, that creating art enacts the innate ability to conjure criminal impulses. Dorian&#x27;s immersion in the elite social circles of Victorian London exposes him to a culture of superficiality and moral hypocrisy. Supporting this idea, Sheldon W. Liebman offered the example of Wilde&#x27;s inclusion of a great psychological intellect held by Lord Henry. Before Sybil&#x27;s death, Henry was also a firm believer in vanity as the origin of a human being&#x27;s irrationality. This concept is broken for Henry after Sybil is found dead, the irony being that Dorian is the cause of her death and his motives are exactly as Lord Henry has taught them to him.

The novel presents other relationships that influence Dorian&#x27;s way of life and his perception of the world, proving the influence of society and its values on a person. While Lord Henry is clearly a persona that fascinates and captures Dorian&#x27;s attention, Manganiello also suggests that Basil is also a person that may &quot;evoke a change of heart&quot; in Dorian. However, at this point in the novel, Dorian has spent far too much time under Lord Henry&#x27;s wing and brushes Basil off in &quot;appositeness&quot;, leading Basil to claim that man has no soul but art does. Dorian&#x27;s journey serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of hedonism and moral relativism, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility and moral accountability in navigating the complexities of human existence.

=== Homoeroticism and gender roles ===
The novel&#x27;s representation of homoeroticism is subtle yet present by manifesting itself through interactions between male characters in a way that challenges the strict social norms of Victorian England. The novel begins with a conversation between Lord Henry and Basil, where Basil reveals his artistic admiration for Dorian, setting the scene for a story with themes such as beauty, art, and the consequences of vanity. The interaction introduces the characters and foreshadows the complicated relationship between the artist and his muse.

It has been noted by scholars that Wilde possibly chose the protagonist&#x27;s name, Dorian, in reference to the Dorians of ancient Greece, argued to have been the first to introduce male same-sex initiation rituals to ancient Greek culture, being an allusion to Greek love.

Similarly, gender roles influence the relationships between characters and form their expectations and behaviors; in particular, the expectations of masculinity and the critique of the Victorian ideal of manhood are seen throughout the narrative. Dorian, with his eternal youth and beauty, challenges traditional male roles and the slow decay of his portrait reflects the deception of societal expectations. Additionally, the few female characters in the story, such as Sybil, are portrayed in ways that critique the limited roles and harsh judgments reserved for women during that era. The novel&#x27;s exploration of these themes provides commentary on the structures of Victorian society, revealing the performative side of gender roles that restrict and define both men and women.

==Influences and allusions==

=== Wilde&#x27;s own life ===
Wilde wrote in an 1894 letter:

Hallward is supposed to have been formed after painter Charles Haslewood Shannon. Scholars generally accept that Lord Henry is partly inspired by Wilde&#x27;s friend Lord Ronald Gower. It was purported that Wilde&#x27;s inspiration for Dorian Gray was the poet John Gray, but Gray distanced himself from the rumour. Some believe that Wilde used Robert de Montesquiou in creating &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;.

===&quot;Faust&quot;===
Wilde is purported to have said, &quot;in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust.&quot; In both the legend of &quot;Faust&quot; and in &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel, Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is &quot;old in the history of literature&quot;, but was a thematic subject to which he had &quot;given a new form&quot;.

Unlike the academic &quot;Faust&quot;, the gentleman Dorian makes no deal with the Devil, who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the virtue and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that &quot;the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing.&quot; As such, the devilish Lord Henry is &quot;leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity.&quot;

===Shakespeare===
In the preface, Wilde speaks of the sub-human Caliban character from &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In chapter seven, when he goes to look for Sibyl but is instead met by her manager, he writes: &quot;He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban&quot;.

When Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. In the 1891 version, Dorian describes his portrait by quoting &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which the eponymous character impels his potential suitor (Ophelia) to madness and possibly suicide, and Ophelia&#x27;s brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.

===Joris-Karl Huysmans===
The anonymous &quot;poisonous French novel&quot; that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of &quot;À rebours&quot; (1884), by Joris-Karl Huysmans. In the biography &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; (1989), the literary critic Richard Ellmann said: Wilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans&#x27;s &quot;À rebours&quot; ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a &quot;fantastic variation&quot; upon &quot;À rebours&quot;, and someday must write it down. The references in &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.

===Possible Disraeli influence===

Some commentators have suggested that &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; was influenced by the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s (anonymously published) first novel &quot;Vivian Grey&quot; (1826), as &quot;a kind of homage from one outsider to another&quot;. The name of Dorian Gray&#x27;s love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli&#x27;s best known novel (&quot;Sybil&quot;) and Vivian Grey&#x27;s love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically. There is also a scene in &quot;Vivian Grey&quot; in which the eyes in the portrait of a &quot;beautiful being&quot; move when its subject dies.

== Reactions ==

=== Contemporary response ===
Even after the removal of controversial text, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, to the extent, in some cases, of saying that Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality.

In the 30 June 1890 issue of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, the book critic said that Wilde&#x27;s novel contains &quot;one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it.&quot; In the 5 July 1890 issue of the &quot;Scots Observer&quot;, a reviewer asked &quot;Why must Oscar Wilde &#x27;go grubbing in muck-heaps?&#x27;&quot; The book critic of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; was &quot;first published to some scandal.&quot; Such book reviews achieved for the novel a &quot;certain notoriety for being &#x27;mawkish and nauseous&#x27;, &#x27;unclean&#x27;, &#x27;effeminate&#x27; and &#x27;contaminating&#x27;.&quot; Such moralistic scandal arose from the novel&#x27;s homoeroticism, which offended the sensibilities (social, literary, and aesthetic) of Victorian book critics. Most of the criticism was, however, personal, attacking Wilde for being a hedonist with values that deviated from the conventionally accepted morality of Victorian Britain.

In response to such criticism, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and the sanctity of art in his correspondence with the British press. Wilde also obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters in the 1891 book edition.

Due to controversy, retailing chain W H Smith, then Britain&#x27;s largest bookseller, withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; from its bookstalls in railway stations.

At Wilde&#x27;s 1895 trials, the book was called a &quot;perverted novel&quot; and passages (from the magazine version) were read during cross-examination. The book&#x27;s association with Wilde&#x27;s trials further hurt the book&#x27;s reputation. In the decade after Wilde&#x27;s death in 1900, the authorized edition of the novel was published by Charles Carrington, who specialized in literary erotica.

=== Modern response ===
The novel was considered a poorly written novel and unworthy of critical attention until about the 1980s. Richard Ellmann wrote that &quot;parts of the novel are wooden, padded, self-indulgent&quot;; Édouard Roditi held a similarly negative opinion about the novel. Afterwards, critics began to view is it as a masterpiece of Wilde&#x27;s oeuvre. Joyce Carol Oates wrote of the book &quot;it is exceptionally good – in fact, one of the strongest and most haunting of English novels&quot;, while noting that the reputation of the novel was still questionable.

In a 2009 review, critic Robin McKie considers the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full. On the other hand, in March 2014, Robert McCrum of &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed it among the 100 best novels ever written in English, calling it &quot;an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic&quot;.

==Legacy and adaptations==

Though not initially a widely appreciated component of Wilde&#x27;s body of work following his death in 1900, &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; has come to attract a great deal of academic and popular interest, and has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage.

In 1913, it was adapted to the stage by writer G. Constant Lounsbery at London&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre. In the same decade, it was the subject of several silent film adaptations. Perhaps the best-known and most critically praised film adaptation is 1945&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, which earned an Academy Award for best black-and-white cinematography, as well as a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Angela Lansbury, who played Sibyl Vane.

In 2003, Stuart Townsend played Dorian Gray in the film &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. In 2009, the novel was loosely adapted into the film &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;, starring Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as Lord Henry.
Alexander Vlahos played the character in a series of audio dramas scripted by David Llewellyn in 2013.
Reeve Carney portrays Dorian Gray in John Logan&#x27;s &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;, which aired on Showtime from 2014 to 2016. 

The Dorian Award is named in honor of Wilde, in reference to &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;; the original award was a simple certificate with an image of Wilde along with a graphic of hands holding a black bow tie. The first Dorian Awards were announced in January 2010 (nominees were revealed the previous month).

<doc id="31347" wikidata="Q149010" url="?curid=31347" title="Trilogy">
<text>A trilogy is a set of three distinct works that are connected and can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, and video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term &quot;trilogy&quot;.

Most trilogies are works of fiction involving the same characters or setting, such as &quot;The Deptford Trilogy&quot; of novels by Robertson Davies, &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; of films by Satyajit Ray, and &quot;The Kingdom Trilogy&quot; of television miniseries from 1994 to 2022 by Lars von Trier. Other fiction trilogies are connected only by theme: for example, each film of Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s Three Colours trilogy explores one of the political ideals of the French Republic (liberty, equality, fraternity). Trilogies can also be connected in less obvious ways, such as &quot;The Nova Trilogy&quot; of novels by William S. Burroughs, each written using cut-up technique.

The term is seldom applied outside media. One example is the &quot;Marshall Trilogy&quot;, a common term for three rulings written by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall from 1823 to 1832 concerning the legal status of Native Americans under U.S. law.

Trilogies—and series in general—are common in speculative fiction.

== History ==
Trilogies ( &quot;trilogia&quot;) date back to ancient times. In the Dionysia festivals of ancient Greece, for example, trilogies of plays were performed followed by a fourth satyr play. &quot;The Oresteia&quot; is the only surviving trilogy of these ancient Greek plays, originally performed at the festival in Athens in 458 BC. The three Theban plays, or Oedipus cycle, by Sophocles, originating in 5th century BC, is not a true example of a trilogy because the plays were written at separate times and with different themes/purposes.

Technical changes in printing and film in the mid-to-late 20th century made the creation of trilogies more feasible, while the development of mass media and modern global distribution networks has made them more likely to be lucrative. Examples of trilogies in modern fiction include the Wayfarers trilogy by Knut Hamsun, the Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz, The Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy, and His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. A pivotal example is J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–1955), which was written as a three-volume novel but published (for economic reasons) as a trilogy, thus helping to popularize the trilogy format.

== In media ==

=== Films ===

* Lars von Trier has occasionally referred to his films as falling into thematic and stylistic trilogies; about the apocalyptic subject matters in &quot;Europa&quot; trilogy (&quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (1984), &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1987), and &quot;Europa&quot; (1991)); the heroine&#x27;s tragedies in &quot;Golden Heart&quot; trilogy (&quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996), &quot;The Idiots&quot; (1998), and &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000)); the anti-American culture in &quot;Land of Opportunities&quot; trilogy (&quot;Dogville&quot; (2003) and &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005)); and the artistic imagery portrays graphic sexuality and disturbing violence in &quot;Depression&quot; trilogy (&quot;Antichrist&quot; (2009), &quot;Melancholia&quot; (2011), and &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013)).
* The &quot;Before&quot; trilogy consists of three American romance films created by Richard Linklater and starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, who both co-wrote the two sequels. It begins with &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995), and continues with &quot;Before Sunset&quot; (2004) and &quot;Before Midnight&quot; (2013).
* The &quot;Death&quot; trilogy consists of three psychological drama films about the human condition and intertwined plots with different characters: &quot;Amores perros&quot; (2000), &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003) and &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), all directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and written by Guillermo Arriaga.
* &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy is an adaption of the novel &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; by J.R.R Tolkien&quot;.&quot; It follows Frodo Baggins as he embarks on a journey alongside the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring in order to defeat its creator, the Dark Lord Sauron. Each of the three films are titled identically to the three volumes of the novel: &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003).
* The animated &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; trilogy chronicles the adventures of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III and his dragon Toothless as they grow up and attempt to bring peace between their kinds. It consists of &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; (2010), &quot;How to Train Your Dragon 2&quot; (2014), and &quot;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World&quot; (2019).

=== Music ===
The term is less often applied to music. One example is the &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; of David Bowie, which is linked together by musical sound and lyrical themes, all having been recorded at least partly in Berlin, Germany. Another example can be found in the Guns N&#x27; Roses songs &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Estranged&quot;, whose videos are considered a trilogy. Tyler, the Creator&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Trilogy&quot; (named by fans) consists of his first three albums; &quot;Bastard&quot;, &quot;Goblin&quot;, and &quot;Wolf&quot;. The Weeknd&#x27;s 2012 compilation album &quot;Trilogy&quot; is a remastered and remixed collection of his 2011 mixtapes &quot;House of Balloons&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, and &quot;Echoes of Silence&quot;. Taylor Swift&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Folklore&quot;, contains the songs &quot;Cardigan&quot;, &quot;August&quot; and &quot;Betty&quot;, a trilogy that tells a story of a love triangle.

=== Video games ===
* The &quot;N. Sane Trilogy&quot;, released between 1996 and 1999, consists of &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; (1996), &quot;Cortex Strikes Back&quot; (1997), and &quot;Warped&quot; (1998), which were originally developed by Naughty Dog for the PlayStation. This resulted to remaster into a collection titled &quot;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&quot;, but not affiliated with Naughty Dog.
* The &quot;Lisa&quot; Trilogy was released between 2012 and 2015, developed by Dingaling Productions, with each of the three games (&quot;The First&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Joyful&quot;) having different apocalyptic settings and playable protagonists, and themes of transgenerational trauma and child abuse.
* The &quot;Mother&quot; trilogy is a video game series that consists of three role-playing video games: &quot;Mother&quot; (1989), known as &quot;EarthBound Beginnings&quot; outside Japan, for the Family Computer; &quot;Mother 2&quot; (1994), known as &quot;EarthBound&quot; outside Japan, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; and &quot;Mother 3&quot; (2006) for the Game Boy Advance.

== Adding works to an existing trilogy ==
Creators of trilogies may later add more works. In such a case, the original three works may or may not keep the title &quot;trilogy&quot;.

* The first three novels in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series were dubbed a trilogy and even after he extended the series, author Douglas Adams continued to use the term for humorous effectfor example, calling &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; &quot;the fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named trilogy.&quot;
* Kevin Smith&#x27;s films &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Mallrats&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; were often marketed as &quot;The New Jersey Trilogy&quot; because they had overlapping characters, events and locations. After the release of a fourth film, &quot;Dogma&quot;, the series is referred to as &quot;the View Askewniverse&quot;.
* The &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, released between 1977 and 1983, has since been expanded into a trilogy of trilogies, which have since been titled the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;: the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy released between 2015 and 2019. More movies and television series in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise were also developed.
* The &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series began with the first three films released between 2003 and 2007, &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;, and &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;. Although the &quot;Pirates&quot; series continued with fourth and fifth films, &quot;On Stranger Tides&quot; and &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, the term &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy&quot; was still used in most media and reports online, notably by an interview with director Gore Verbinski.

<text>Thomas McKean (; March 19, 1734June 24, 1817) was an American lawyer, politician, and Founding Father. During the American Revolution, he was a Delaware delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where he signed the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation. McKean served as a President of Congress.

McKean was at various times a member of the Federalist and the Democratic-Republican parties. McKean served as president of Delaware, chief justice of Pennsylvania, and the second governor of Pennsylvania. He also held numerous other public offices.

==Early life and education==


McKean was born on March 19, 1734, in New London Township in the Province of Pennsylvania to William McKean and Letitia Finney. His father, William, immigrated to the colony of Pennsylvania in 1720, and was later listed as a tavern keeper. 

When his mother, Letitia died in the fall of 1742, it took a strain on Thomas&#x27;s, father, William. He quickly became an alcoholic, and because of that, was incapable of raising his family. Thomas&#x27;s younger sister, went to go live with their aunt and uncle, while eight- year-old Thomas, and ten-year-old, Robert began their education under Reverend Francis Alison at his school in New Castle, Delaware

During his education, McKean took on a boyhood attitude, beyond his studies. By the time he reached his adolescence, he had learned how to ride a horse and shoot a gun. Though the school was simply for boys, McKean did interact with some females, which included Reverend Alison&#x27;s wife, Hannah Armitage, and her toddler half-sister, Sarah Armitage, though McKean gave her little attention, preferring to be with his friends, Charles Thomson and George Read. After a decade studying at Dr. Alison&#x27;s academy, McKean&#x27;s brother, Robert, left for London to study medicine This was the first time the two were separated. 

In the year 1750, McKean finally finished his studies with Dr. Alison, and shortly thereafter moved in with his uncle, John Finney, who was a wealthy lawyer at the time. During this, McKean studied with his cousin, David Finney, and after four years, in 1754, he was finally admitted to the Bar (law). 

At some point, McKean met Mary Borden, the daughter of Colonel Joseph Borden of New Jersey. They would marry on July 21, 1763 in Mary&#x27;s hometown of Bordentown. Together, they had six children, two boys, and four girls, one of whom died in childhood. Mary Borden would die on March 12, 1773, in Delaware of an unknown cause. 

Shortly after the death of Mary Borden, at some point, McKean reconnected with Sarah Armitage, who he&#x27;d marry on September 16, 1774, and would live at the northeast corner of Third and Pine Streets in Philidelphia. Together they would have four children, one of whom married the Spanish diplomat, Carlos Martínez de Irujo, who was appointed to his position in 1796.

==Career==
In 1755, he was admitted to the bar of the Lower Counties, as Delaware was then known, and likewise in the Province of Pennsylvania the following year. In 1756, he was appointed deputy attorney general for Sussex County. From the 1762–1763 session to the 1775–1776 session, he was a member of the General Assembly of the Lower Counties, serving as its speaker in 1772–1773. From July 1765, he also served as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas and began service as the customs collector at New Castle in 1771. In November 1765, his Court of Common Pleas became the first such court in the colonies to establish a rule for all the proceedings of the court to be recorded on unstamped paper. In 1768, McKean was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society.

Eighteenth-century Delaware was politically divided into loose political factions known as the &quot;Court Party&quot; and the &quot;Country Party&quot;. The majority Court Party was generally Anglican, was strongest in Kent and Sussex counties, worked well with the colonial Proprietary government, and supported reconciliation with the British government. The minority Country Party was largely Irish Presbyterian (also referred to as &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; in America), was centered in New Castle County, and quickly advocated independence from the British. The revolutionary slogan &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; had originated in the north of Ireland under the British Penal Laws, which denied Presbyterians and Catholics the right to vote for members of the parliament. McKean was the epitome of the Country Party politician and was, as much as anyone else, its leader. As such, he generally worked in partnership with Caesar Rodney from Kent County and in opposition to his friend and neighbor, George Read.

At the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, McKean and Caesar Rodney represented Delaware. McKean proposed the voting procedure that the Continental Congress later adopted: each colony, regardless of size or population, would have one vote. That decision set the precedent, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation adopted the practice, and the principle of state equality has continued in the composition of the United States Senate.

McKean quickly became one of the most influential members of the Stamp Act Congress. He was on the committee that drew the memorial to parliament and, with John Rutledge and Philip Livingston, revised its proceedings. On the last day of its session, when the business session ended, Timothy Ruggles, the president of the body, and a few other more cautious members refused to sign the memorial of rights and grievances. McKean arose and addressing the chair insisted that the president give his reasons for his refusal. After refusing at first, Ruggles remarked that &quot;it was against his conscience.&quot; McKean then disputed his use of the word &quot;conscience&quot; so loudly and so long that a challenge was given by Ruggles and accepted in the presence of the Congress. However, Ruggles left the next morning at daybreak, and so the duel did not take place.

==American Revolution==

In spite of his primary residence in Philadelphia, McKean remained the effective leader for American independence in Delaware. Along with Read and Caesar Rodney, he was one of Delaware&#x27;s delegates to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and 1776.

Being an outspoken advocate of independence, McKean was a key voice in persuading others to vote for a split with Great Britain. When Congress began debating a resolution of independence in June 1776, Rodney was absent. Read was against independence, which meant that the Delaware delegation was split between McKean and Read and therefore could not vote in favor of independence. McKean requested that the absent Rodney ride all night from Dover to break the tie. After the vote in favor of independence on July 2, McKean participated in the debate over the wording of the official Declaration of Independence, which was approved on July 4.

A few days after McKean cast his vote, he left Congress to serve as colonel in command of the Fourth Battalion of the Pennsylvania Associators, a militia unit created by Benjamin Franklin in 1747. They joined General George Washington&#x27;s defense of New York City at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Being away, McKean was not available when most of the signers placed their signatures on the Declaration of Independence on August 2, 1776. Since his signature did not appear on the printed copy that was authenticated on January 17, 1777, it is assumed that he signed after that date, possibly as late as 1781.

In a conservative reaction against the advocates of American independence, the 1776-1777 Delaware General Assembly did not reelect either McKean or Rodney to the Continental Congress in October 1776. However, the British occupation after the Battle of Brandywine swung opinions enough that McKean was returned to Congress in October 1777 by the 1777–1778 Delaware General Assembly. During that time, he was constantly pursued by British forces. Over the course of the following years, he was forced to relocate his family five times.

He served continuously in the Congress until February 1, 1783. McKean helped draft the Articles of Confederation and voted for their adoption on March 1, 1781. When poor health caused Samuel Huntington to resign as president of Congress in July 1781, McKean was elected as his successor. He served from July 10 to November 4, 1781. The position was mostly ceremonial with no real authority, but the office required McKean to handle a good deal of correspondence and sign official documents. During his time in office, Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s British army surrendered at Yorktown, which effectively ended the war.

==Government of Delaware==

Meanwhile, McKean led the effort in the General Assembly of Delaware to declare its separation from the British government, which it did on June 15, 1776. In August, he was elected to the special convention to draft a new state constitution. Upon hearing of it, McKean made the long ride to Dover, Delaware, from Philadelphia in a single day, went to a room in an inn, and that night, virtually by himself, drafted the document. It was adopted September 20, 1776. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 became the first state constitution to be produced after the Declaration of Independence.

McKean was elected to Delaware&#x27;s first House of Assembly for both the 1776–1777 and the 1778–1779 sessions, succeeding John McKinly as speaker on February 12, 1777, when McKinly became president of Delaware. Shortly after President McKinly&#x27;s capture and imprisonment, McKean served as the president of Delaware for a month, from September 22 to October 20, 1777. That was the time needed for the successor George Read to return from the Continental Congress in Philadelphia and to assume the duties.

Immediately after the Battle of Brandywine, the British Army occupied Wilmington and much of northern New Castle County. Its navy also controlled the lower Delaware River and Delaware Bay. As a result, the state capital, New Castle, was unsafe as a meeting place, and the Sussex County seat, Lewes, was sufficiently disrupted by Loyalists that it was unable to hold a valid general election that autumn. As president, McKean was primarily occupied with recruitment of the militia and with keeping some semblance of civic order in the portions of the state still under his control.

==Government of Pennsylvania==
McKean started his long tenure as chief justice of Pennsylvania on July 28, 1777, and served in that capacity until 1799. There, he largely set the rules of justice for revolutionary Pennsylvania. According to the biographer John Coleman, &quot;only the historiographical difficulty of reviewing court records and other scattered documents prevents recognition that McKean, rather than John Marshall, did more than anyone else to establish an independent judiciary in the United States. As chief justice under a Pennsylvania constitution he considered flawed, he assumed it the right of the court to strike down legislative acts it deemed unconstitutional, preceding by ten years the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s establishment of the doctrine of judicial review. He augmented the rights of defendants and sought penal reform, but on the other hand was slow to recognize expansion of the legal rights of women and the processes in the state&#x27;s gradual elimination of slavery.&quot;

He was a member of the convention of Pennsylvania that ratified the Constitution of the United States. In the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention of 1789/90, he argued for a strong executive and was himself a Federalist. Nevertheless, in 1796, dissatisfied with the Federalists&#x27; domestic policies and compromises with Great Britain, he became an outspoken Jeffersonian Republican, or Democratic-Republican.
While chief justice of Pennsylvania, McKean played a role in the Whiskey Rebellion. On August 2, 1794, he took part in a conference on the rebellion. In attendance were Washington, his Cabinet, the governor of Pennsylvania, and other officials. Washington interpreted the rebellion to be a grave threat could mean &quot;an end to our Constitution and laws.&quot; Washington advocated &quot;the most spirited and firm measure&quot; but held back on what that meant. McKean argued that the matter should be left up to the courts, not the military, to prosecute and punish the rebels. Alexander Hamilton insisted upon the &quot;propriety of an immediate resort to Military force.&quot; Some weeks later, Mckean and General William Irvine wrote to Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin and discussed the mission of federal committees to negotiate with the Rebels, describing them as &quot;well disposed.&quot; However, McKean and Irvine felt the government must suppress the insurrection to prevent it from spreading to nearby counties.

McKean was elected governor of Pennsylvania and served three terms from December 17, 1799, to December 20, 1808. In the 1799 election, he defeated the Federalist Party nominee James Ross and again more easily in the 1802 election. At first, McKean ousted Federalists from state government positions and so he has been called the father of the spoils system. However, in seeking a third term in 1805, McKean was at odds with factions of his own Democratic-Republican Party, and the Pennsylvania General Assembly instead nominated Speaker Simon Snyder for governor. McKean then forged an alliance with Federalists, called &quot;the Quids,&quot; and defeated Snyder. Afterwards, he began removing Jeffersonians from state positions.

The governor&#x27;s beliefs in stronger executive and judicial powers were bitterly denounced by the influential &quot;Aurora&quot; newspaper publisher William P. Duane and the Philadelphia populist Michael Leib. After they led public attacks calling for his impeachment, McKean filed a partially successful libel suit against Duane in 1805. The Pennsylvania House of Representatives impeached the governor in 1807, but, for the rest of his term, his friends prevented an impeachment trial from being held, and the matter was dropped. When the suit was settled after McKean left office, his son Joseph angrily criticized Duane&#x27;s attorney for alleging out of context that McKean referred to the people of Pennsylvania as &quot;clodpoles&quot; (clodhoppers).

Some of McKean&#x27;s other accomplishments included expanding free education for all and, at age eighty, leading a Philadelphia citizens group to organize a strong defense during the War of 1812. He spent his retirement in Philadelphia in writing, discussing political affairs, and enjoying the considerable wealth that he had earned through investments and real estate.

==Death, honors, and legacy==
McKean was a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati in 1785 and was subsequently its vice president.

McKean was also bestowed honorary LL.D. degrees (a) in 1781 by College of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton University), (b) in 1782 by Dartmouth College, and (c) in 1785 by his alma mater, University of Pennsylvania.

With University of Pennsylvania law professor James Wilson (Founding Father), McKean published &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot; in 1790.

McKean died in Philadelphia and was buried in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery there. In 1843, his body was moved to Laurel Hill Cemetery.

McKean County, Pennsylvania is named in his honor, as is Thomas McKean High School in New Castle County, also McKean Street in Philadelphia, and the McKean Hall dormitory at the University of Delaware. Penn State University also has a residence hall and a campus road named for him.

Oddly, the name of &quot;Keap Street&quot; in Brooklyn, New York, is the result of an erroneous effort to name a street after him. Many Brooklyn streets are named after signers of the Declaration of Independence, and &quot;Keap Street&quot; is the result of planners being unable to accurately read his signature. In some accounts the &quot;M&quot; of McKean was mistaken for a middle initial, and the flourish on the &quot;n&quot; in McKean led to the &quot;n&quot; being misread as a &quot;p&quot;.

McKean was over six feet tall, and he typically wore a large cocked hat and carried a gold-headed cane. He was a man of quick temper and vigorous personality, &quot;with a thin face, hawk nose and hot eyes.&quot; John Adams described him as &quot;one of the three men in the Continental Congress who appeared to me to see more clearly to the end of the business than any others in the body.&quot; As chief justice and governor of Pennsylvania he was frequently the center of controversy.

==In popular culture==
In the 1969 Broadway musical, &quot;1776&quot;, McKean is portrayed as a gun-toting cantankerous old Scot who cannot get along with the wealthy and conservative planter George Read. In truth, McKean and Read belonged to opposing political factions in Delaware, but McKean was not a Scottish immigrant. His parents were Irish Presbyterians (referred to as &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; in America and &quot;Ulster Scots&quot; in Northern Ireland). His surname is pronounced mc-CANE but was mispronounced as mc-KEEN in the film adaptation of the musical. McKean was portrayed by Bruce MacKay in the original Broadway cast and Ray Middleton in the 1972 film version.

==Almanac==
Delaware elections were held October 1, and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term and the State President for a three-year term. Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas were also selected by the General Assembly for the life of the person appointed. McKean served as state president only temporarily, filling the vacancy created by John McKinly&#x27;s capture and resignation and awaiting the arrival of George Read.

Pennsylvania elections were held in October as well. The Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council was created in 1776 and counsellors were popularly elected for three-year terms. A joint ballot of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the council chose the president from among the twelve counsellors for a one-year term. The chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was also selected by the General Assembly and Council for the life of the person appointed.

<text>-Tyrosine or tyrosine (symbol Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins. It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word &quot;tyrosine&quot; is from the Greek &quot;tyrós&quot;, meaning &quot;cheese&quot;, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA.

The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic t&quot;Y&quot;rosine was also proposed.

==Functions==
Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes.

Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids&#x27; moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties—which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions—by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine.

Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure.

Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding.

A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters.

==Dietary requirements and sources==
The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition.
Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500–1000 mg per portion.

== Biosynthesis ==
In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give &quot;p&quot;-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate.

Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine.

==Metabolism==

=== Phosphorylation and sulfation ===
Some of the tyrosine residues can be &quot;tagged&quot; (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine.

===Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones===
In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).

The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine.
=== Precursor to other compounds ===
The latex of &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms -tyrosine into &quot;p&quot;-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment &quot;melanin&quot;. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10.

=== Degradation ===

The decomposition of -tyrosine (syn. &quot;para&quot;-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to &quot;para&quot;-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description &quot;para&quot;, abbreviated &quot;p&quot;, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below).
The next oxidation step catalyzes by &quot;p&quot;-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created.

Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate &quot;cis&quot;-&quot;trans&quot;-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This &quot;cis-trans&quot;-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule.

Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis.

Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats.

==Ortho- and meta-tyrosine==
Three structural isomers of -tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid -tyrosine, which is the para isomer (&quot;para&quot;-tyr, &quot;p&quot;-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely &quot;meta&quot;-tyrosine (also known as , L-&quot;m&quot;-tyrosine, and &quot;m&quot;-tyr) and &quot;ortho&quot;-tyrosine (&quot;o&quot;-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The &quot;m&quot;-tyr and &quot;o&quot;-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress.

==Medical use==

Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects.

A 2015 systematic review found that &quot;tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load&quot; and therefore &quot;tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions&quot;.

==Industrial synthesis==
-Tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture -tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of &quot;E. coli&quot;.

<text>Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki (; born 18 June 1942) is a South African politician who served as the 2nd democratic president of South Africa from 14 June 1999 to 24 September 2008, when he resigned at the request of his party, the African National Congress (ANC). Before that, he was deputy president under Nelson Mandela from 1994 to 1999.

The son of Govan Mbeki, an ANC intellectual, Mbeki has been involved in ANC politics since 1956, when he joined the ANC Youth League, and has been a member of the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee since 1975. Born in the Transkei, he left South Africa aged twenty to attend university in England, and spent almost three decades in exile abroad, until the ANC was unbanned in 1990. He rose through the organisation in its information and publicity section and as Oliver Tambo&#x27;s protégé, but he was also an experienced diplomat, serving as the ANC&#x27;s official representative in several of its African outposts. He was an early advocate for and leader of the diplomatic engagements which led to the negotiations to end apartheid. After South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections in 1994, he was appointed national deputy president. In subsequent years, it became apparent that he was Mandela&#x27;s chosen successor, and he was elected unopposed as ANC president in 1997, enabling his rise to the presidency as the ANC&#x27;s candidate in the 1999 elections.

While deputy president, Mbeki had been regarded as a steward of the government&#x27;s Growth, Employment and Redistribution policy, introduced in 1996, and as president he continued to subscribe to relatively conservative, market-friendly macroeconomic policies. During his presidency, South Africa experienced falling public debt, a narrowing budget deficit, and consistent, moderate economic growth. However, despite his retention of various social democratic programmes, and notable expansions to the black economic empowerment programme, critics often regarded Mbeki&#x27;s economic policies as neoliberal, with insufficient consideration for developmental and redistributive objectives. On these grounds, Mbeki grew increasingly alienated from the left wing of the ANC, and from the leaders of the ANC&#x27;s Tripartite Alliance partners, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and South African Communist Party. It was these leftist elements which supported Jacob Zuma over Mbeki in the political rivalry that erupted after Mbeki removed the latter from his post as deputy president in 2005.

As president, Mbeki had an apparent predilection for foreign policy and particularly for multilateralism. His pan-Africanism and vision for an &quot;African renaissance&quot; are central parts of his political persona, and commentators suggest that he secured for South Africa a role in African and global politics that was disproportionate to the country&#x27;s size and historical influence. He was the central architect of the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development and, as the inaugural chairperson of the African Union, spearheaded the introduction of the African Peer Review Mechanism. After the IBSA Dialogue Forum was launched in 2003, his government collaborated with India and Brazil to lobby for reforms at the United Nations, advocating for a stronger role for developing countries. Among South Africa&#x27;s various peacekeeping commitments during his presidency, Mbeki was the primary mediator in the conflict between ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwean opposition in the 2000s. However, he was frequently criticised for his policy of &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; in Zimbabwe, under which he refused to condemn Robert Mugabe&#x27;s regime or institute sanctions against it.

Also highly controversial worldwide was Mbeki&#x27;s HIV/AIDS policy. His government did not introduce a national mother-to-child transmission prevention programme until 2002, when it was mandated by the Constitutional Court, nor did it make antiretroviral therapy available in the public healthcare system until late 2003. Subsequent studies have estimated that these delays caused hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. Mbeki himself, like his Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, has been described as an AIDS denialist, &quot;dissident&quot;, or sceptic. Although he did not explicitly deny the causal link between HIV and AIDS, he often posited a need to investigate alternate causes of and alternative treatments for AIDS, frequently suggesting that immunodeficiency was the indirect result of poverty.

His political descent began at the ANC&#x27;s Polokwane conference in December 2007, when he was replaced as ANC president by Zuma. Although his term as national president was not due to expire until June 2009, he announced on 20 September 2008 that he would resign at the request of the ANC National Executive Committee. The ANC&#x27;s decision to &quot;recall&quot; Mbeki was understood to be linked to a High Court judgement, handed down earlier that month, in which judge Chris Nicholson had alleged improper political interference in the National Prosecuting Authority and specifically in the corruption charges against Zuma. Nicholson&#x27;s judgement was overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal in January 2009, by which time Mbeki had been replaced as president by Kgalema Motlanthe.

==Early life and education==

=== 1942–60: Eastern Cape ===
Mbeki was born on 18 June 1942 in Mbewuleni, a small village in the former homeland of Transkei, now part of the Eastern Cape. The second of four siblings, he had one sister, Linda (born 1941, died 2003), and two brothers, Moeletsi (born 1945) and Jama (born 1948, died 1982).&#x27; His parents were Epainette (died 2014), a trained teacher, and Govan (died 2001), a shopkeeper, teacher, journalist, and senior activist in the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both Epainette and Govan came from educated, Christian, land-owning families, and Govan&#x27;s father was Sikelewu Mbeki, a colonially appointed headman.&#x27; The couple had met in Durban, where Epainette had become the second black woman to join the SACP (then still called the Communist Party of South Africa); however, while Mbeki was a child, his family was separated when Govan moved alone to Ladismith for a teaching job. Mbeki has said that he was &quot;born into the struggle&quot;, and recalls that his childhood home was decorated with portraits of Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi. Govan named him after senior South African communist Thabo Mofutsanyana.

Mbeki began attending school in 1948, the same year that the National Party was elected with a mandate to legislate apartheid.&#x27; The Bantu Education Act was implemented towards the end of his school career, and in 1955 he arrived at the Lovedale Institute, an eminent mission school outside Alice, as part of the last class which would be permitted to follow the same curriculum as white students. At Lovedale, he was a year behind Chris Hani, his future colleague and rival in the ANC.&#x27; Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at age fourteen and in 1958 became the secretary of its Lovedale branch. Shortly afterwards, at the start of his final year of high school, he was identified as one of the leaders of a March 1959 boycott of classes, and was summarily expelled from Lovedale.&#x27; He nonetheless sat for matric examinations and obtained a second-class pass.&#x27;

=== 1960–62: Johannesburg ===
In June 1960, Mbeki moved to Johannesburg, where he lived in the home of ANC secretary general Duma Nokwe and where he intended to sit for A-level examinations. The ANC had recently been banned in the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, but Mbeki remained highly politically active, becoming national secretary of the African Students&#x27; Association, a new (and short-lived) youth movement envisaged as replacing the now illegal ANC Youth League. It was also during this period that Nokwe recruited Mbeki into the SACP.

Thus the ANC instructed him to join the growing cohort of cadres who were leaving South Africa to evade police attention, receive training, and establish the overt ANC structures that were now illegal inside the country. Mbeki was detained twice by the police while attempting to leave the country, first in Rustenberg, when the group he was travelling with failed to pass themselves off as a touring football team, and then in Rhodesia.&#x27; He arrived at the ANC&#x27;s new headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in November 1962, and left shortly afterwards for England.&#x27;

== Exile and early career ==
=== 1962–69: England ===
While at Sussex, Mbeki was involved in ANC work and in broader organising for the English Anti-Apartheid Movement. Months after his arrival, his father was arrested during a Security Branch raid at Liliesleaf Farm in July 1963. During the ensuing Rivonia Trial, Mbeki appeared before the United Nations (UN) Special Committee on Apartheid and later led a student march from Brighton to London, a distance of fifty miles. At the conclusion of the trial, Govan and seven other ANC leaders, among them Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Mbeki completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in May 1965 but, at the exhortation of O. R. Tambo, enrolled for a Master&#x27;s in economics and development instead of returning to Africa to join Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the ANC&#x27;s armed wing. His Master&#x27;s dissertation was in economic geography.&#x27; In addition to this and his political organising, he developed a deep fondness for Yeats, Brecht, Shakespeare, and blues music.&#x27;After completing his Master&#x27;s, in October 1966 he moved to London to work full-time for the propaganda section of the ANC&#x27;s English headquarters.&#x27;He remained active in the SACP, which was very closely allied to the ANC, and in 1967 he was appointed to the editorial board of its official magazine, the &quot;African Communist&quot;.&#x27;

Throughout his time in England, Mbeki was the ward of O. R. Tambo and his wife Adelaide Tambo – in the absence of his parents, it was Adelaide and senior communist Michael Harmel who attended Mbeki&#x27;s graduation ceremony in 1965.&#x27; O. R. Tambo later became the ANC&#x27;s longest-serving president, and he acted as Mbeki&#x27;s &quot;political mentor and patron&quot; until his death in 1993. Other friends Mbeki made in England, including Ronnie Kasrils and brothers Essop Pahad and Aziz Pahad, were also among his key political allies in his later career.&#x27;

=== 1969–71: Soviet Union ===
In February 1969, Mbeki was sent to Moscow in the Soviet Union to receive Marxist–Leninist political and ideological training – a fairly common practice, and even a rite of passage, among young people identified as belonging to the future generation of ANC and SACP political leaders. He was educated at the Lenin Institute, where, because of the secrecy required, he went by the alias &quot;Jack Fortune&quot;.&#x27; He excelled at the institute and in June 1970 was appointed to the Central Committee of the SACP, alongside Chris Hani.&#x27; The last part of his training entailed military training, also a rite of passage, including in intelligence, guerrilla tactics, and weaponry. However, his biographer Mark Gevisser adduces that he was &quot;not the ideal candidate for military life&quot;, and Max Sisulu, who trained alongside him, says that he always regarded Mbeki as better suited to political leadership than military leadership.

=== 1971–75: Lusaka ===
In April 1971, having been pulled out from military training, Mbeki was sent to Lusaka, Zambia, where the ANC-in-exile had set up its new headquarters under acting president Tambo. He was to fill the post of administrative secretary to the ANC Revolutionary Council, a body newly established to coordinate the political and military efforts of the ANC and SACP.&#x27; He was later moved to the propaganda section, but continued to attend the council&#x27;s meetings, and in 1975 he (again alongside Hani) was elected onto the ANC&#x27;s top decision-making organ, the National Executive Committee.&#x27; It was during this period that he began to ghostwrite some of Tambo&#x27;s speeches and reports, and he accompanied Tambo on important occasions, such as to the infamous December 1972 meeting with Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the head of Inkatha, in London.&#x27; In 1973, he helped to establish the ANC&#x27;s office in Botswana, considered a &quot;frontline&quot; country because of its shared border with South Africa, where the ANC was attempting to re-establish its underground.&#x27; However, although he travelled frequently in subsequent years, the ANC&#x27;s Lusaka headquarters remained his central base.
=== 1975–76: Swaziland ===
Between 1975 and 1976, Mbeki was instrumental in establishing the ANC&#x27;s frontline base in Swaziland. He was first sent there to assess the political landscape in January 1975, under the cover of attending a UN conference. As part of this reconnaissance trip, he and his colleague Max Sisulu spent time with S&#x27;bu Ndebele, Max&#x27;s sister Lindiwe Sisulu, and their associates in the Black Consciousness movement, which at the time was ascendent in neighbouring South Africa.&#x27; Mbeki made a positive report to the ANC executive, and he was sent back to Swaziland to begin establishing the base. In Swaziland, he lived at Stanley Mabizela&#x27;s family home in Manzini. Working with Albert Dhlomo, Mbeki was responsible for helping to re-establish underground ANC networks in the South African provinces of Natal and Transvaal, which shared a border with Swaziland. His counterpart inside South Africa was MK operative Jacob Zuma, who ran the Natal underground. According to Gevisser, the pair developed &quot;an unlikely rapport&quot;.&#x27; Mbeki was also responsible for recruiting new MK operatives, for liaising with South African student and labour activists, and for liaising with Inkatha, which was becoming dominant in Natal.

However, still another part of his duties was to act as the ANC&#x27;s official representative in the country, and to maintain good diplomatic relations with the Swazi government. In March 1976, the government discovered that Mbeki was involved in military activity inside Swaziland, and he and Dhlomo – as well as Zuma, who was in the country illegally – were detained and then deported, though they managed to negotiate their deportation to the neutral territory of Mozambique rather than to South Africa.&#x27; Mbeki&#x27;s management of the Swaziland base later became a point of contention between him and Mac Maharaj, with whom his relationship has remained acrimonious decades later. In 1978, Maharaj and Mbeki argued at a top-level strategic meeting in Luanda, Angola, when Maharaj, who had been tasked with running the political underground, claimed that Mbeki&#x27;s records from the Swaziland office were in fact &quot;just an empty folder&quot;.&#x27;

=== 1976–78: Nigeria ===
After being deported, Mbeki returned to Lusaka, where he was made Duma Nokwe&#x27;s deputy in the ANC&#x27;s Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP). In January 1977, he was posted to Lagos, Nigeria, where he was to be – as in Swaziland – the ANC&#x27;s first representative to the country. Although there was some debate about whether the appointment was a signal that he had been sidelined, Gevisser says that Mbeki performed well in Lagos, establishing good relations with Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s regime and establishing an ANC presence to eclipse that of its rival Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).

=== 1978–80: Political secretary ===
When he returned to Lusaka from Lagos in 1978, he was promoted again: he replaced Nokwe as head of DIP, and simultaneously was appointed Tambo&#x27;s political secretary, an extremely influential position in which he became one of Tambo&#x27;s closest advisors and confidantes. He also continued to ghostwrite for Tambo, now in a formal capacity.&#x27; At DIP, his approach was encapsulated by the change he made to the department&#x27;s name, replacing &quot;propaganda&quot; with &quot;publicity&quot;. He eschewed the secrecy of earlier years and openly gave interviews and access to American journalists, to the disapproval of some hardline communists. According to various sources, he was responsible for reforming the public image of the ANC from that of a terrorist organisation to that of a &quot;government-in-waiting&quot;.&#x27;

He established some of his own high-level intelligence networks, with key underground operatives reporting directly to him, and Gevisser claims that these led to the initiation of relationships with many of the domestic activists who later became his political allies. Moreover, he was responsible for innovating some of the vocabulary which became emblematic of the 1980s anti-apartheid struggle, which burgeoned in the aftermath of the 1976 Soweto uprising. Such phrases as &quot;mass democratic movement&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s power&quot;, and the exhortation to &quot;make the country ungovernable&quot; are attributed to Mbeki, and gained widespread popularity inside South Africa through Radio Freedom broadcasts written by DIP or by Mbeki personally.&#x27; Zuma has said that it was Mbeki&#x27;s &quot;drafting skills&quot; which enabled his ascendancy in the ANC and ultimately to the presidency.&#x27;

In 1980, Mbeki led the ANC&#x27;s delegation to Zimbabwe, where the party hoped to establish relations with Robert Mugabe&#x27;s newly elected government. This was a sensitive mission, because the ANC had historically been strongly allied to the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union, the arch rival of Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU-PF. Working primarily through Mugabe&#x27;s righthand man, future Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mbeki negotiated an extraordinarily congenial agreement between ZANU-PF and the ANC. The agreement allowed the ANC to open an office in Zimbabwe and to move MK weapons and cadres over Zimbabwean borders; moreover, it committed the Zimbabwean military to assisting the ANC, and the government to providing MK cadres with Zimbabwean identity documents. However, Mbeki handed the running of the Salisbury office over to another ANC official, and the deal later collapsed.

=== 1980s: Negotiations ===
In 1985, PW Botha declared a State of Emergency and gave the army and police special powers. In 1986, the South African Army sent a captain in the South African Defence Force (SADF) to kill Mbeki. The plan was to put a bomb in his house in Lusaka, but the assassin was arrested by the Zambian police before he could go through with the plan. Also in 1985, Mbeki became the ANC&#x27;s director of the Department of Information and Publicity and coordinated diplomatic campaigns to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid activities. In 1989, he rose in the ranks to head the ANC&#x27;s Department of International Affairs and was involved in the ANC&#x27;s negotiations with the South African government. Mbeki played a major role in turning the international media against apartheid. Raising the diplomatic profile of the ANC, Mbeki acted as a point of contact for foreign governments and international organisations and he was extremely successful in this position. Mbeki also played the role of ambassador to the steady flow of delegates from the elite sectors of white South Africa. These included academics, clerics, business people and representatives of liberal white groups who travelled to Lusaka to assess the ANC&#x27;s views on a democratic, free South Africa.

Mbeki was seen as pragmatic, eloquent, rational, and urbane. He was known for his diplomatic style and sophistication. In the early 1980s, Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Aziz Pahad were appointed by Tambo to conduct private talks with representatives of the National Party government. Twelve meetings between the parties took place between November 1987 and May 1990, most of them held at Mells Park House, a country house near Bath in Somerset, England. By September 1989, the team secretly met with Maritz Spaarwater and Mike Louw in a hotel in Switzerland. Known as &quot;Operation Flair&quot;, PW Botha was kept informed of all the meetings. At the same time, Mandela and Kobie Coetzee, the Minister of Justice, were also holding secret talks. When Mbeki finally was able to return home to South Africa and was reunited with his own father, the elder Mbeki told a reporter, &quot;You must remember that Thabo Mbeki is no longer my son. He is my comrade!&quot; A news article pointed out that this was an expression of pride, explaining, &quot;For Govan Mbeki, a son was a mere biological appendage; to be called a comrade, on the other hand, was the highest honour.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Mbeki made a number of trips to the United States in search of support among US corporations. Literate and funny, he made a wide circle of friends in New York City. Mbeki was appointed head of the ANC&#x27;s information department in 1984 and then became head of the international department in 1989, reporting directly to Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC. Tambo was Mbeki&#x27;s long-time mentor. In 1985, Mbeki was a member of a delegation that began meeting secretly with representatives of the South African business community, and in 1989, he led the ANC delegation that conducted secret talks with the South African government. These talks led to the unbanning of the ANC and the release of political prisoners. He also participated in many of the other important negotiations between the ANC and the government that eventually led to the democratisation of South Africa. As a sign of goodwill, de Klerk set free a few of the ANC&#x27;s top leadership at the end of 1989, among them Govan Mbeki.

== Rise to the presidency ==
On 2 February 1990, Botha&#x27;s successor as state president, F. W. de Klerk, announced that the ANC and other political organisations would be unbanned, and ANC exiles began to return to South Africa. At the same time that it was to negotiate the end of apartheid, the ANC had to implement a significant internal reorganisation, absorbing into its official exile bodies the domestic ANC underground, released political prisoners, and other activists from the trade unions and the United Democratic Front. It also had an ageing leadership, meaning that a new generation of leaders had to be prepared for succession.

=== 1993: ANC chairperson ===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mbeki&#x27;s key role in the early negotiations made him a likely contender for top leadership positions in the party, and he was even considered to be in line for the ANC presidency. However, at the ANC&#x27;s 48th National Conference in July 1991, its first national elective conference since 1960, Mbeki was not elected to any of the &quot;Top Six&quot; leadership positions. Sisulu was elected ANC deputy president, almost certainly as a compromise candidate, and trade unionist Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general. According to historian Tom Lodge, Ramaphosa&#x27;s election was a putsch carried out by the party&#x27;s &quot;internal wing&quot;, in defiance of the former exiles and political prisoners who had hitherto dominated the ANC&#x27;s leadership. Over the next three years, Ramaphosa also came to eclipse Mbeki as the party&#x27;s central negotiator when he, not Mbeki, was appointed to lead the ANC&#x27;s delegation to the CODESA talks. Once SACP leader Chris Hani was assassinated in April 1993, Ramaphosa became Mbeki&#x27;s primary competition in the ANC succession battle. When Tambo died later the same month, Mbeki succeeded him as ANC national chairperson.

=== 1994: Deputy president ===

Following the 1994 elections, South Africa&#x27;s first under universal suffrage, Mbeki became one of the two national deputy presidents in the ANC-led Government of National Unity, in which Mandela was president. At the ANC&#x27;s next national conference, held in December that year, Mbeki was elected unopposed to the ANC deputy presidency, also under Mandela. In June 1996, the National Party withdrew from the Government of National Unity and, with the second deputy, de Klerk, having thereby resigned, Mbeki became the sole deputy president.

The same year, as deputy president, Mbeki acted as a peace broker in what was then known as Zaire, following the First Congo War and the deposition of Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko. Mbeki also took on increasing domestic responsibilities, including executive powers delegated to him by Mandela, to such an extent that Mandela called him &quot;a &quot;de facto&quot; president&quot;. Mandela had made it clear publicly since early 1995 or earlier that he intended to retire after one term in office, and by then Mbeki was already seen as his most likely successor.

=== 1997: ANC president ===

In December 1997, the ANC&#x27;s 50th National Conference elected Mbeki unopposed to succeed Mandela as ANC president. On some accounts, the election was not contested because the top leadership had prepared assiduously for the conference, lobbying and negotiating on Mbeki&#x27;s behalf in the interest of unity and continuity. Pursuant to the 1999 national elections, which the ANC won by a significant majority, Mbeki was elected president of South Africa. He was re-elected for a second term in 2002.

== Presidency of South Africa ==
=== Economic policy ===
Mbeki had been highly involved in economic policy as deputy president, especially in spearheading the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) programme, which was introduced in 1996 and remained a cornerstone of Mbeki&#x27;s administration after 1999. In comparison to the Reconstruction and Development Programme policy which had been the basis of the ANC&#x27;s platform in 1994, GEAR placed less emphasis on developmental and redistributive imperatives, and subscribed to elements of the liberalisation, deregulation, and privatisation at the centre of Washington Consensus-style reforms. It was therefore viewed by some as a &quot;policy reversal&quot; and embrace of neoliberalism, and thus as an abandonment of the ANC&#x27;s socialist principles. Mbeki also emphasised communication between government, business, and labour, establishing four working groups – for big business, black business, trade unions, and commercial agriculture – under which ministers, senior officials, and Mbeki himself met regularly with business and union leaders to build trust and explore solutions to structural economic problems. 

Conservative groups such as the Cato Institute commended Mbeki&#x27;s macroeconomic policies, which reduced the budget deficit and public debt and which according to them likely played a role in increasing economic growth. According to the Free Market Foundation, during the Mbeki presidency, average annualised quarter-on-quarter GDP growth was 4.2%, and average annual inflation was 5.7%. On the other hand, the shift alienated leftists, including inside in the ANC and its Tripartite Alliance. Zwelinzima Vavi of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) was an outspoken critic of Mbeki&#x27;s &quot;market-friendly&quot; economic policies, claiming that Mbeki&#x27;s &quot;flirtation&quot; with neoliberalism had been &quot;absolutely disastrous&quot; for development, and especially for the labour-intensive development required to address South Africa&#x27;s high unemployment rate. The discord between Mbeki and the left was on public display by December 2002, when Mbeki attacked what he called divisive &quot;ultra-leftists&quot; in a speech to the ANC&#x27;s 51st National Conference.

However, Mbeki clearly never subscribed to undiluted neoliberalism. He retained various social democratic programmes and principles, and generally endorsed a mixed economy in South Africa. One of the ANC&#x27;s slogans in the campaign for his 2004 re-election was, &quot;A people&#x27;s contract for growth and development.&quot; He popularised the concept of a dual or two-track economy in South Africa, with severe underdevelopment in one segment of the population, and, for example in a 2003 newsletter, argued that high growth alone would only benefit the developed segment, without significant trickle-down benefits for the rest of the population. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, he explicitly advocated state support for the creation of a black capitalist class in South Africa. The government&#x27;s black economic empowerment policy, which was expanded and consolidated under his administration, was criticised precisely for benefitting only a small black elite and thereby failing to address inequality.

=== Foreign policy ===
According to academic and diplomat Gerrit Olivier, during his presidency Mbeki &quot;succeeded in placing Africa high on the global agenda.&quot; He was known for his pan-Africanism, having emphasised related themes both in his famous &quot;I am an African&quot; speech in 1996 and in his first speech to Parliament as president in June 1999, when he foregrounded his trademark ideal of an &quot;African renaissance&quot;. He advocated for greater solidarity among African countries and, in place of reliance on Western intervention and aid, for greater self-sufficiency for the African continent. Simultaneously, however, he argued for increased developmental aid to Africa. He called for Western leaders to address global apartheid and unequal development, most memorably in a speech to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August 2002.

==== Africa ====
Although Mbeki also forged strategic individual relationships with key African leaders, especially the heads of state of Nigeria, Algeria, Mozambique, and Tanzania, perhaps his central foreign policy instrument was multilateral cooperation. Mbeki&#x27;s government, and Mbeki personally, are frequently cited as the single most significant driving force behind the creation in 2001 of the New Partnership for Africa&#x27;s Development (NEPAD), which aims to develop a framework for accelerating economic development and cooperation in Africa. Olivier calls Mbeki the &quot;seminal thinker&quot; behind NEPAD and its &quot;principal author and articulator&quot;. According to academic Chris Landsberg, NEPAD&#x27;s central principle – &quot;African leaders holding one another accountable in exchange for the recommitment of the industrialised world to Africa&#x27;s development&quot; – epitomised Mbeki&#x27;s strategy in Africa. Mbeki was also involved in the dissolution of the Organisation of African Unity and its replacement by the African Union (AU), of which he became the inaugural chairperson in 2002, and his government spearheaded the introduction of the AU&#x27;s African Peer Review Mechanism in 2003. He was twice chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), first from 1999 to 2000 and second, briefly, in 2008. Through these multilateral organisations and by contributing forces to various United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions, Mbeki and his government were involved in peacekeeping initiatives in African countries including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi.

==== Global South ====
Outside Africa, Mbeki was the chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement between 1999 and 2003 and the chairperson of the Group of 77 + China in 2006. He also pursued South-South solidarity in a coalition with India and Brazil under the IBSA Dialogue Forum, which was launched in June 2003 and held its first summit in September 2006. The IBSA countries together pressed for changes in the agricultural subsidy regimes of developed countries at the 2003 World Trade Organisation conference, and also pressed for reforms at the UN which would allow developing countries a stronger role. Indeed, Mbeki had called for reform at the UN as early as 1999 and 2000. In 2007, following a prolonged diplomatic campaign, South Africa secured a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for a two-year term. Controversially, in February 2007, South Africa followed Russia and China in voting against a draft resolution calling for an end to political detentions and military attacks against ethnic minorities in Myanmar. Mbeki later told the media that the resolution exceeded the Security Council&#x27;s mandate, and that its tabling had been illegal in terms of international law.

===Quiet diplomacy in Zimbabwe===
Mbeki&#x27;s presidency coincided with an escalating political and economic crisis in South Africa&#x27;s neighbour, Zimbabwe, under president Mugabe of ZANU-PF. Problems included land invasions under the &quot;fast-track&quot; land reform programme, political violence and state-sponsored human rights violations, and hyperinflation. With SADC&#x27;s endorsement, Mbeki frequently acted as a mediator between ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwean opposition. However, controversially, his policy towards the Mugabe regime was one of non-confrontational &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; and &quot;constructive engagement&quot;: he refused to condemn Mugabe and instead attempted to persuade him to accept gradual political reforms. He was firmly opposed to forcible or manufactured regime change in Zimbabwe, and also opposed the use of sanctions. The &quot;Economist&quot; posited an &quot;Mbeki doctrine&quot; holding that South Africa &quot;cannot impose its will on others, but it can help to deal with instability in African countries by offering its resources and its leadership to bring rival groups together, and to keep things calm until an election is safely held.&quot; Mbeki said in 2004:The motives behind Mbeki&#x27;s Zimbabwe policy have been interpreted in various ways: for example, some suggest that he was attempting to maintain economic stability in Zimbabwe and therefore to protect South African economic interests, while others cite his attachment to ideals of African solidarity and opposition to what he perceived as quasi-imperial Western interference in Africa. In any case, Mbeki&#x27;s policy on Zimbabwe attracted widespread criticism both domestically and internationally. Some also questioned Mbeki&#x27;s neutrality in his role as mediator. After a South African observer mission endorsed the result of the Zimbabwean presidential election of 2002, in which Mugabe was re-elected, Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Mbeki of being a &quot;dishonest broker&quot; and his government of becoming &quot;part of the Zimbabwe problem because its actions are worsening the crisis.&quot; Commentators later said that Mbeki&#x27;s soft stance on Mugabe during this period permanently damaged relations between South Africa and the Zimbabwean opposition. A South African government observer mission also endorsed the result of the Zimbabwean parliamentary elections of 2005, apparently leading Tsvangirai&#x27;s party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), to effectively sever relations with Mbeki&#x27;s administration. 

==== Power-sharing negotiations ====

Following another contested election in Zimbabwe – after which Mbeki controversially denied that there was a &quot;crisis&quot; in Zimbabwe – the MDC and ZANU-PF entered into negotiations towards the formation of a power-sharing government, with talks beginning in July 2008. Mbeki mediated the negotiations and brokered the resulting power-sharing agreement, signed on 15 September 2008, which retained Mugabe as president but diluted his executive power across posts to be held by opposition leaders.

=== HIV/AIDS ===
==== Policy and treatment ====
According to political scientist Jeffrey Herbst, Mbeki&#x27;s HIV/AIDS policies were &quot;bizarre at best, severely negligent at worst.&quot; In 2000, amid a burgeoning HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, Mbeki&#x27;s government launched the &quot;HIV/AIDS/STD Strategic Plan for South Africa, 2000–2005&quot;, a &quot;multi-sectoral&quot; plan which was criticised by HIV/AIDS activists for lacking concrete timeframes and failing to commit to antiretroviral treatment programmes. Indeed, according to economist Nicoli Nattrass, resistance to the roll-out of antiretroviral drugs for prevention and treatment became central to the HIV/AIDS policy of Mbeki&#x27;s government in subsequent years. A national mother-to-child transmission prevention programme was not introduced until 2002, when it was mandated by the Constitutional Court in response to a successful legal challenge by the Treatment Action Campaign. Similarly, chronic highly active antiretroviral therapy for AIDS-sick people was not introduced in the public healthcare system until late 2003, reportedly at the insistence of some members of Mbeki&#x27;s cabinet. According to Nattrass, better access to antiretroviral drugs in South Africa could have prevented about 171,000 HIV infections and 343,000 deaths between 1999 and 2007. In November 2008, a Harvard University study estimated that more than 330,000 people died between 2000 and 2005 due to insufficient antiretroviral programmes under Mbeki&#x27;s government.

Even after these programmes were introduced, Mbeki&#x27;s appointee as Minister of Health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, continued to advocate publicly for unproven alternative treatments in place of antiretrovirals, leading to continual calls by civil society for her dismissal. In late 2006, the cabinet transferred responsibility for AIDS policy from Tshabalala-Msimang to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who subsequently spearheaded a new draft National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS.

==== Association with denialism ====

While president, Mbeki was also criticised for his public messaging on HIV/AIDS. He was viewed as sympathetic to or influenced by the views of a small minority of scientists who challenged the scientific consensus that HIV caused AIDS and that antiretroviral drugs were the most effective means of treatment. In an April 2000 letter to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and the heads of state of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, Mbeki pointed to differences in how the AIDS epidemic had manifested in Africa and in the West, and committed to &quot;the search for specific and targeted responses to the specifically African incidence of HIV-AIDS.&quot; He also defended scientists who had challenged the scientific consensus on AIDS: The letter was leaked to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and caused controversy. During the same period, Mbeki convened a panel to investigate the cause of AIDS, staffed by researchers who believed that AIDS was caused by malnutrition and parasites as well as by orthodox researchers. In July 2000, opening the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, he proposed that the &quot;disturbing phenomenon of the collapse of immune systems among millions of our people&quot; was the result of various factors, especially poverty, and that &quot;we could not blame everything on a single virus.&quot; It was characteristic of Mbeki&#x27;s stance on HIV/AIDS to draw attention to socioeconomic differences between the West and Africa, emphasising the importance of poverty in poor health outcomes in Africa, and to insist that African countries should not be asked blindly to accept Western scientific theories and policy models. Commentators speculate that his stance was motivated by suspicion of the West and was a response to what he perceived as racist stereotypes of the continent and its people. For example, in October 2001, in a speech at the University of Fort Hare, he said of the West: &quot;Convinced that we are but natural-born, promiscuous carriers of germs, unique in the world, they proclaim that our continent is doomed to an inevitable mortal end because of our unconquerable devotion to the sin of lust.&quot;

Mbeki announced in October 2000 that he would withdraw from the public debate on HIV/AIDS science, and in 2002 his cabinet staunchly affirmed that HIV causes AIDS. However, critics claimed that he continued to influence – and impede – HIV/AIDS policy, a charge which Mbeki denied. AIDS activist Zackie Achmat said in 2002 that &quot;Mbeki epitomizes leadership in denial and his stand has fuelled government inaction.&quot; Gevisser writes that in 2007 Mbeki continued to defend his position on HIV/AIDS, and directed Gevisser to a controversial and anonymous ANC discussion document titled &quot;Castro Hlongwane, Caravans, Cats, Geese, Foot &amp; Mouth and Statistics: HIV/Aids and the Struggle for the Humanisation of the African&quot;. The Gevisser biography also says that, while Mbeki never explicitly denied the link between HIV and AIDS, he is a &quot;profound sceptic&quot; – as Mbeki himself wrote in 2016, in a newsletter cautioning &quot;great care and caution&quot; in the use of antiretrovirals, he had not denied that HIV caused AIDS but that &quot;a virus [could] cause a syndrome.&quot; He is generally referred to as an HIV/AIDS &quot;dissident&quot; rather than an outright denialist, although Nattrass questions the value of that distinction.

=== FIFA World Cup bid ===

As president, Mbeki spearheaded South Africa&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Commentators, and Mbeki himself, frequently linked the bid to his vision for an African renaissance. In 2015, amid an American investigation into corruption at FIFA, soccer administrator Chuck Blazer testified that, between 2004 and 2011, he and other FIFA executives had received bribes in connection with South Africa&#x27;s bid. Mbeki denied any knowledge of the bribes.
=== Electricity crisis ===
In late 2007, Mbeki&#x27;s government announced that the public power utility, Eskom, would introduce electricity rationing or rolling blackouts, commonly known in South Africa as loadshedding. In subsequent months, Mbeki publicly apologised, acknowledging that the government had failed to heed Eskom&#x27;s warnings, offered regularly for several consecutive years, that infrastructure investments were required to avoid energy shortages – in his words, &quot;Eskom was right and government was wrong.&quot; However, some analysts suggested that insufficient investment was not the hindrance to electricity supply, and that other policy decisions by government and at Eskom, including the implementation of black economic empowerment criteria in coal procurement contracts, had contributed to the crisis. In his last State of the Nation address in February 2008, Mbeki repeated the apology and devoted nearly three pages of his speech to government&#x27;s plans for addressing the energy crisis.

===2008 xenophobic attacks===

In May 2008, a series of riots took place in a number of South African townships, mainly in Gauteng province, when South African residents violently attacked migrants from other African countries. At least 62 people were killed, several hundred injured, and many thousand displaced. To contain the violence, Mbeki deployed the army to affected areas – the first such deployment to a civilian area since the end of apartheid. In a televised address towards the end of the saga, Mbeki called the attacks &quot;an absolute disgrace&quot;, saying, &quot;Never since the birth of our democracy have we witnessed such callousness.&quot;

Some commentators argued that Mbeki&#x27;s government had failed to acknowledge or sufficiently to address growing xenophobia in South Africa in the years preceding the attacks. Indeed, the AU&#x27;s African Peer Review Mechanism had reported in 2006 that xenophobia was an urgent concern in South Africa. These criticisms were often linked to criticisms of Mbeki&#x27;s policy in Zimbabwe, because a large proportion of South Africa&#x27;s growing foreign-born population were Zimbabwean refugees. Moreover, when Mbeki argued that the attacks had other motives, both economic and &quot;criminal&quot;, some critics accused him of &quot;xenophobia denialism&quot; and of refusing to acknowledge the genuine xenophobic sentiment in parts of the population.

==Succession==
=== Polokwane conference ===

In June 2005, Mbeki removed Zuma from his post as national deputy president, after Zuma&#x27;s associate Schabir Shaik was convicted of making corrupt payments to Zuma in relation to the 1999 Arms Deal. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) charged Zuma with corruption later that year. However, Zuma remained deputy president of the ANC, and in subsequent years, the rivalry between Zuma and Mbeki and their allies intensified, with Zuma supporters frequently alleging that the charges against Zuma were politically motivated.

By 2007, Zuma had emerged as an apparent contender in the ANC&#x27;s next presidential elections, to be held at the party&#x27;s 52nd National Conference in Polokwane, Limpopo. By April of that year, it was also clear that Mbeki intended to stand for a third term as ANC president. Mbeki&#x27;s term as national president would expire in 2009, and he had said in 2006 that he had no intention of having the Constitution changed to permit him a third term in office, saying, &quot;By the end of 2009, I will have been in a senior position in government for 15 years. I think that&#x27;s too long.&quot; However, the ANC lacked internal term limits, and some suspected that he intended to continue to exert substantial influence over the government through the ANC presidency.

Zuma drew substantial support from the left wing of the party, especially through the ANC Youth League and the ANC&#x27;s partners in the Tripartite Alliance, the South African Communist Party and COSATU, with whom Mbeki&#x27;s relationship was extremely poor. At the elective conference, on 18 December, Mbeki lost the presidential election to Zuma, gaining less than 40% of the vote. According to ANC tradition, as ANC president Zuma would become the party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 2009 general election, and therefore, given the ANC&#x27;s substantial electoral majority, was overwhelmingly likely to succeed Mbeki as national president in 2009.

===High court finding and appeal===

On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg High Court judge Chris Nicholson set aside the corruption charges against Zuma. He found that the charges were unlawful on the procedural grounds that the NPA had not given Zuma adequate opportunity to make representations. Nicholson also lent his support to allegations that Zuma&#x27;s charges had been politically motivated, saying that he was &quot;not convinced that [Zuma] was incorrect when he averred political meddling in his prosecution&quot; and that the case seemed to be part of &quot;some great political contest or game.&quot; Mbeki later applied to the Constitutional Court to appeal the judgement, calling Nicholson&#x27;s findings about political interference &quot;vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial.&quot; The NPA also appealed, and in January 2009 the Supreme Court of Appeal found in its favour and overturned Nicholson&#x27;s ruling. Partially redeeming Mbeki, the appellate court said that Nicholson&#x27;s allegations of political interference had been irrelevant to Nicholson&#x27;s decision and had apparently derived from Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;own conspiracy theory.&quot;

=== Resignation ===
However, shortly after Nicholson delivered his judgement and months before the appeal was heard, the Zuma-aligned ANC National Executive Committee, as elected at the Polokwane conference, &quot;recalled&quot; Mbeki, asking him to resign as national president. The National Executive Committee is a party political body and therefore lacked the constitutional authority to remove Mbeki directly, but the ANC-controlled Parliament could have effected his removal had he not acquiesced voluntarily. On 20 September 2008, a spokesman announced that Mbeki would resign. In court papers filed later that week, Mbeki said that it was Nicholson&#x27;s findings which had &quot;led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC – a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years.&quot;

In the aftermath of his announcement, at least 11 cabinet ministers and three deputy ministers – including Deputy President Mlambo-Ngcuka and Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel – announced that they would also resign. Mbeki&#x27;s resignation took effect on 25 September, and he was replaced as national president by Kgalema Motlanthe, who had been elected ANC deputy president at the Polokwane conference.

==Post-presidency==

=== Party politics ===
After his resignation from the presidency, Mbeki retained his ANC membership but retreated from party politics. In the meantime, the Congress of the People (Cope) was founded as a breakaway party, composed largely of former ANC members known to be Mbeki loyalists. There were rumours that Mbeki was involved in Cope and would perhaps defect to it, especially after his mother Epainette, widow of ANC stalwart Govan, began attending Cope election rallies in the family&#x27;s native Eastern Cape. According to political analyst Susan Booysen, although Mbeki &quot;would never emerge from the silent, invisible wings onto centre stage... the whole Cope plot carried the &#x27;Mbeki&#x27; stamp.&quot;

Mbeki began again to appear at ANC events and to comment on ANC politics from around 2011. Although he has since said that he continued to vote for the ANC in the interim, he did not campaign on its behalf at any time during the Zuma presidency, which lasted between 2009 and 2018. In more recent years, he has been fairly vocal in reflecting publicly about perceived problems in the ANC and its leadership and about the country&#x27;s economic problems and policies.

=== International mediation ===
Motlanthe asked Mbeki to remain in his role as mediator in Zimbabwe after his resignation in 2008, and he later returned to Zimbabwe, in 2020, to mediate a further political dispute. He also continued to chair the long-serving AU High-level Implementation Panel for Sudan and South Sudan, which in 2016 brokered an agreement between warring Sudanese parties to begin peace negotiations. Although he remained critical of the UN&#x27;s interventions in Africa, he also chaired the UN Economic Commission for Africa High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, which was established in collaboration with the AU in 2011.

=== Philanthropy ===
The Thabo Mbeki Foundation was launched on 10 October 2010, ahead of a three-day conference. Its mission centres around Mbeki&#x27;s trademark &quot;African renaissance&quot;, and the objective of promoting Africa&#x27;s political, social, economic, and cultural development. It was launched in tandem with the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute, which aims to train leaders capable of contributing to the foundation&#x27;s objectives.

==Personality and public image==

Mbeki has sometimes been characterised as remote and academic, although in his second campaign for the Presidency in 2004, many observers described him as finally relaxing into more traditional ways of campaigning, sometimes dancing at events and even kissing babies. Mbeki used his weekly column in the ANC newsletter &quot;ANC Today&quot;, to produce discussions on a variety of topics. He sometimes used his column to deliver pointed invective against political opponents, and at other times used it as a kind of professor of political theory, educating ANC cadres on the intellectual justifications for African National Congress policy. Although these columns were remarkable for their dense prose, they often were used to influence news. Although Mbeki did not generally make a point of befriending or courting reporters, his columns and news events often yielded good results for his administration by ensuring that his message is a primary driving force of news coverage. Indeed, in initiating his columns, Mbeki stated his view that the bulk of South African media sources did not speak for or to the South African majority, and stated his intent to use &quot;ANC Today&quot; to speak directly to his constituents rather than through the media.

Mbeki appears to have been at ease with the Internet and willing to quote from it. For instance, in a column discussing Hurricane Katrina, he cited Wikipedia, quoted at length a discussion of Katrina&#x27;s lessons on American inequality from the Native American publication &quot;Indian Country Today&quot;, and then included excerpts from a David Brooks column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a discussion of why the events of Katrina illustrated the necessity for global development and redistribution of wealth.

His penchant for quoting diverse and sometimes obscure sources, both from the Internet and from a wide variety of books, made his column an interesting parallel to political blogs although the ANC does not describe it in these terms. His views on AIDS were supported by Internet searching which led him to so-called &quot;AIDS denialist&quot; websites; in this case, Mbeki&#x27;s use of the Internet was roundly criticised and even ridiculed by opponents.

== Controversies ==

=== 1999 Arms Deal ===

There have been rumours and allegations, never proven or prosecuted and denied by Mbeki, that Mbeki was involved in or aware of corruption in the 1999 Arms Deal, a major defence procurement package negotiated while he was deputy president.

===Crime===
In 2004 President Thabo Mbeki made an attack on commentators who argued that violent crime was out of control in South Africa, calling them white racists who want the country to fail. He alleged that crime was falling and some journalists were distorting reality by depicting black people as &quot;barbaric savages&quot; who liked to rape and kill. Annual statistics published in September 2004 showed that most categories of crime were down, but some had challenged the figures&#x27; credibility and said that South Africa remained extremely dangerous, especially for women. In a column for the African National Congress website, the president rebuked the doubters. Mr Mbeki did not name journalist Charlene Smith who had championed victims of sexual violence since writing about her own rape, but quoted a recent article in which she said South Africa had the highest rate of rape and referred (apparently sarcastically) to her as an &quot;internationally recognised expert on sexual violence&quot;. He said: &quot;She was saying our cultures, traditions and religions as Africans inherently make every African man a potential rapist ... [a] view which defines the African people as barbaric savages.&quot; Mr Mbeki also described the newspaper &quot;The Citizen&quot;, and other commentators who challenged the apparent fall in crime, as pessimists who did not trust black rule.

In January 2007, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) &quot;draft&quot; report on South Africa was released. This noted that South Africa had the world&#x27;s second-highest murder rate, with about 50 people a day being killed, and that although serious crime was reported as falling, security analysts said that the use of violence in robberies, and rape, were more common. Mbeki in response said in an interview that fears of crime were exaggerated.

In December 2007 the final African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) report on South Africa, again suggested that there was an unacceptably high level of violent crime in the country. President Mbeki said the suggestion of unacceptably high violent crime appeared to be an acceptance by the panel of what he called &quot;a populist view&quot;. He challenged some of the statistics on crime, which he noted may have resulted from a weak information base, leading to wrong conclusions. Although rape statistics had been obtained from the South African Police Service, &quot;this only denotes the incidents of rape that were reported, some of which could have resulted in acquittals&quot; Mbeki indicated.

=== Debate with Archbishop Tutu ===
In 2004 the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, criticised President Mbeki for surrounding himself with &quot;yes-men&quot;, not doing enough to improve the position of the poor and for promoting economic policies that only benefited a small black elite. He also accused Mbeki and the ANC of suppressing public debate. Mbeki responded that Tutu had never been an ANC member and defended the debates that took place within ANC branches and other public forums. He also asserted his belief in the value of democratic discussion by quoting the Chinese slogan &quot;let a hundred flowers bloom&quot;, referring to the brief Hundred Flowers Campaign within the Chinese Communist Party in 1956–57.

The &quot;ANC Today&quot; newsletter featured several analyses of the debate, written by Mbeki and the ANC. The latter suggested that Tutu was an &quot;icon&quot; of &quot;white elites&quot;, thereby suggesting that his political importance was overblown by the media; and while the article took pains to say that Tutu had not sought this status, it was described in the press as a particularly pointed and personal critique of Tutu. Tutu responded that he would pray for Mbeki as he had prayed for the officials of the apartheid government.

== Political commentary post-presidency ==
On 10 October 2024, Mbeki wrote a letter to Mr Matome Chiloane, Member of the Executive for the Gauteng Education Department (GED), criticizing the GED&#x27;s handling of an incident of alleged racism at Pretoria High School for Girls. The letter was copied to the Gauteng Premier, Mr Phanyaza Lesufi. The GED had been criticized in the South African media for claiming that there was racism at Pretoria High School for Girls without proof of such.

== Personal life and family ==

In October 1959, Mbeki had a son, Monwabisi Kwanda, with Olive Mpahlwa, a childhood friend which whom he had struck up a romance while at Lovedale. Kwanda was raised by his mother and later by Mbeki&#x27;s mother, Epainette.&#x27; He was last seen by his family in 1981 and is presumed to have died in exile, but the circumstances of his death remain unknown. Olive testified about his disappearance at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996, making an impassioned plea for those with information to step forward.&#x27;

Mbeki&#x27;s youngest brother, Jama, also disappeared in exile. He had spent his adolescence in Lesotho and was an activist in the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and its Lesotho Liberation Army. BCP was much closer to the PAC than to the ANC, and later became an avowed enemy of the latter. Jama disappeared in March 1982, after he skipped bail.&#x27; According to an investigation commissioned by his family in the early 1990s, he was informed upon by a comrade, entrapped by security police, and killed on the side of a highway later in 1982.&#x27; Mbeki&#x27;s only living sibling, Moeletsi, was also educated abroad and is now a prominent economist. He often publicly criticised the policies of his brother&#x27;s government.

Mbeki married Zanele Dlamini Mbeki in 1974, a social worker from Alexandra whom he met in London before his departure for Moscow. The wedding ceremony was held on 23 November at Farnham Castle in Surrey, England. Adelaide Tambo and Mendi Msimang stood &quot;in loco parentis&quot; for Mbeki, and Essop Pahad was his best man. They have no children together.

==Recognition==
===Honorary degrees===
Mbeki has received many honorary degrees from South African and foreign universities. Mbeki received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the Arthur D Little Institute, Boston, in 1994. In 1995, he received honorary doctorate from the University of South Africa and an honorary doctorate of laws from Sussex University. Mbeki was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rand Afrikaans University in 1999. In 2000 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from Glasgow Caledonian University. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in commercial sciences by the University of Stellenbosch.

===Orders and decorations===
During Mbeki&#x27;s official visit to Britain in 2001, he was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyannis, awarded Mbeki with the City of Athens Medal of Honour in 2005. During Mbeki&#x27;s official visit to Sudan in 2005, he was awarded Sudan&#x27;s Insignia of Honour in recognition of his role in resolving conflicts and working for development in the Continent. In 2007, Mbeki was made a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem at St George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town by the current grand prior, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

===Awards===
Mbeki was awarded the Good Governance Award in 1997 by the US-based Corporate Council on Africa. He received the Newsmaker of the year award from Pretoria News Press Association in 2000 and repeated the honour in 2008, this time under the auspices of media research company Monitoring South Africa. In honour of his commitment to democracy in the new South Africa, Mbeki was awarded the Oliver Tambo/Johnny Makatini Freedom Award in 2000. Mbeki was awarded the Peace and Reconciliation Award at the Gandhi Awards for Reconciliation in Durban in 2003. In 2004, Mbeki was awarded the Good Brother Award by Washington, D.C.&#x27;s National Congress of Black Women for his commitment to gender equality and the emancipation of women in South Africa. In 2005, he was also awarded the Champion of the Earth Award by the United Nations. During the European-wide Action Week Against Racism in 2005, Mbeki was awarded the Rotterdamse Jongeren Raad (RJR) Antidiscrimination Award by the Netherlands. In 2006, he was awarded the Presidential Award for his outstanding service to economic growth and investor confidence in South Africa and Africa and for his role in the international arena by the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In 2007 Mbeki was awarded the Confederation of African Football&#x27;s Order of Merit for his contribution to football on the continent.

<text>The Straight Story (stylised as the Straight story) is a 1999 biographical road drama film directed by David Lynch. It was edited and produced by Mary Sweeney, Lynch&#x27;s longtime partner and collaborator, who also co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. It is based on the true story of Alvin Straight&#x27;s 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. The film is generally regarded as one of Lynch&#x27;s more accessible and mainstream works, alongside &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980).

Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly World War II veteran who lives with his daughter. When he hears that his estranged brother has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin&#x27;s legs and eyes are too impaired for him to receive a driver&#x27;s license, he hitches a trailer to his recently purchased thirty-year-old John Deere 110 Lawn Tractor, which has a maximum speed of about , and sets off on the 240-mile (390 km) journey from Laurens, Iowa, to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.

&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was released by Walt Disney Pictures in the United States. The film grossed $6.2 million in a limited theatrical release in the United States and sold 516,597 tickets nationwide during France&#x27;s theatrical release. The film was a critical success; reviewers praised the intensity of the character performances, particularly the realistic dialogue which film critic Roger Ebert compared to the works of Ernest Hemingway. It received a nomination for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and Farnsworth received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the oldest nominee in the category at the time. 
==Plot==
In Laurens, Iowa, Alvin Straight fails to show up to his regular bar meeting with friends and is eventually found lying on his kitchen floor. His daughter, Rose, takes her reluctant father to see a doctor, who sternly admonishes Alvin to give up tobacco and use a walker; Alvin refuses and instead opts to use two canes. Shortly after, Alvin learns that his brother, Lyle, has suffered a stroke. Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel 240 miles to Mount Zion, Wisconsin on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way. This stirs doubt and worry in the minds of his family, friends, and neighbors.

Alvin&#x27;s first attempt fails: after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower&#x27;s motor, he does not get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he later shoots it with a shotgun out of frustration. At the John Deere dealership, he purchases a used 1966 JD 110 lawn tractor.

On the side of the highway, Alvin passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together. Later, a huge group of RAGBRAI cyclists raced past him. He arrives at the cyclists&#x27; camp and is greeted with applause. That night, he speaks with a pair of friendly cyclists around the campfire about growing old.

The next day, Alvin encounters a distraught woman who has just hit a deer in front of him. She drives away after a tearful rant, and Alvin cooks and eats the deer, mounting the antlers on his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it provided. Alvin&#x27;s brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; after an intense speedy descent, he manages to stop. A man named Danny helps Alvin get his tractor and trailer off the main road, discovering that the mower has transmission problems. Danny invites Alvin to camp in his backyard until his tractor is repaired. 

Now beginning to run low on cash, Alvin calls Rose to ask her to send him his Social Security check. Danny offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle&#x27;s, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. Verlyn, an elderly war veteran, takes Alvin into town for a drink. As Alvin does not drink alcohol, he orders a glass of milk, and the two men exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in World War II.

Alvin&#x27;s tractor is fixed, and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission to help his brother. Alvin crosses the Mississippi River and makes camp in a cemetery. He chats with a Catholic priest who recognizes Lyle&#x27;s name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin responds that all he wants is to make peace with Lyle after their falling out ten years prior.

Finally arriving in Mount Zion, Alvin stops at a bar to ask for directions to Lyle&#x27;s house and to have a beer: his first drink in years. Alvin experiences engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle&#x27;s house and stops in the middle of the road. A tractor driver stops to help, then leads the way to Lyle&#x27;s house. When he arrives, Alvin finds the house dilapidated. He calls for his brother, who is using a walker and invites Alvin to sit down on the porch. Lyle asks if Alvin had ridden the lawnmower all the way just to see him, to which Alvin simply responds, &quot;I did, Lyle.&quot; The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.

==Cast==
==Production==

=== Development ===
In 1994, 73-year-old Alvin Straight rode a lawnmower across roughly 250 miles of the American Midwest to visit his ailing brother. Mary Sweeney, David Lynch&#x27;s frequent collaborator, read about Straight&#x27;s story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that summer. Said Sweeney, &quot;Growing up in Wisconsin, I easily connected with that kind of stoic, non-verbal, stubborn, idiosyncratic American character. I get how hard it is to have quiet pride and dignity when you&#x27;re old and poor and are living in the middle of nowhere. I understand what these people&#x27;s dreams and frustrations are. And I loved how much his journey captured the national imagination, so, wearing my producer&#x27;s hat, I started trying to secure the rights.&quot;

Producer Ray Stark had already acquired the rights to Straight&#x27;s story and envisioned the project as a potential star vehicle for Paul Newman. Straight died in 1996, and the rights to his story became available again. Sweeney co-wrote the script with John Roach, a childhood friend; the two retraced Straight&#x27;s route in the process of writing. When Lynch saw the finished script he immediately took to it, saying &quot;it became, for me, very real.&quot;

=== Casting ===
For the role of Alvin Straight, producers cast their first choice, Richard Farnsworth. Though he was reluctant to commit to the role as he was then terminally ill with metastatic prostate cancer, he took the role out of admiration for Straight. Sissy Spacek, a longtime friend of Lynch&#x27;s who had helped to finance his earlier film &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, was cast as Alvin&#x27;s daughter, Rose. Harry Dean Stanton was cast as Alvin&#x27;s ailing brother.

=== Filming ===
&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was independently shot along the actual route taken by Straight, and all scenes were shot in chronological order in the autumn of 1998. Lynch would later call the film &quot;my most experimental movie&quot;.

During production, Farnsworth&#x27;s cancer had spread to his bones, but he astonished his co-workers with his tenacity during production. The paralysis of his legs as shown in the film was real. Farnsworth died by suicide on October 6, 2000, at the age of 80.

&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was acquired by Walt Disney Pictures in the United States after a successful debut at Cannes and was given a G rating by the MPAA (the only Lynch film to receive such a rating). It was Peter Schneider, Disney&#x27;s president of production at the time, that got the idea to have the studio acquire the film after seeing it at Cannes, calling it &quot;a beautiful movie about values, forgiveness and healing and celebrates America. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a Walt Disney film.&quot; October Films also negotiated for the rights, but a deal never materialized.

===Music===

The musical score for &quot;The Straight Story&quot; was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, continuing a 13-plus year collaboration with Lynch that began with &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. A soundtrack album was released on October 12, 1999, by Windham Hill Records.

===Soundtrack===
All music composed and conducted by Angelo Badalamenti.

==Home media==
&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was released on DVD on November 7, 2000 by Walt Disney Home Entertainment. As with many of Lynch&#x27;s films, there are no chapter markers on the original North American DVD release, with a note written by Lynch inside the DVD case that reads, &quot;It is my opinion that a film is not a book – it should not be broken up. It is a continuum and should be seen as such.&quot; On April 3, 2020, the film became available to stream on Disney+.

On September 17, 2021, &quot;The Straight Story&quot; received a limited edition Blu-ray release from Imprint Films.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was critically acclaimed upon its release, with critics lauding Lynch&#x27;s uncharacteristic subject matter. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film as a &quot;celestial piece of Americana&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote of the film, &quot;we see something American studio movies usually don&#x27;t give us: the simple, unsentimentalized beauty of the rural American Midwestern landscape.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the same bellwether quality that left &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; looking so prescient, and ushered in a whole cinematic wave of taboo-shattering, is at work once again. When a born unnaturalist like Lynch can bring such interest and emotion to one man&#x27;s simple story, the realm of the ordinary starts looking like a new frontier.&quot; Of Farnsworth&#x27;s performance, Maslin wrote, &quot;he automatically frees the film from any sense of artifice and delivers an amazingly stalwart performance that will not soon be forgotten.&quot; Her review concluded, &quot;&quot;The Straight Story&quot; is...about gazing at the sky, about experiencing each encounter to the fullest, than it is about getting anywhere in a hurry. It&#x27;s been too long since a great American movie dared to regard life that way.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, the first positive review he had given to a film by Lynch. He wrote: &quot;The first time I saw &quot;The Straight Story&quot; I focused on the foreground and liked it. The second time I focused on the background, too, and loved it. The movie isn&#x27;t just about the old Alvin Straight&#x27;s odyssey through the sleepy towns and rural districts of the Midwest, but about the people he finds to listen and care for him.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With strong performances and director David Lynch at the helm, &quot;The Straight Story&quot; steers past sentimental byways on its ambling journey across the American heartland.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. 

===Awards and honors===
&quot;The Straight Story&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Richard Farnsworth earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Alvin Straight. For 21 years he held the record as the oldest person (at 79) to be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Farnsworth also won the 1999 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.

<text>Theophan the Recluse (), also known as Theophanes the Recluse or the Enlightener Theophan the Recluse of Vysha (; January 10, 1815 – January 6, 1894), was a Russian Orthodox bishop and theologian, recognized as a saint in 1988. Born as Georgy Vasilievich Govorov, he became a monk in 1841, taking the name Theophan.

He is best known through the books and letters he wrote concerning spiritual life, especially on the subjects of the Christian life and the training of youth in the faith. He also played an important role in translating the &quot;Philokalia&quot; from Church Slavonic into Russian. The &quot;Philokalia&quot; is a classic of Orthodox spirituality, composed of the collected works of a number of Church Fathers which were edited and placed in a four volume set in the 17th and 18th centuries. In his works, a persistent theme was developing an interior life of continuous prayer and learning to &quot;pray without ceasing&quot; as St. Paul teaches in his first letter to the Thessalonians.

==Early life==
He was born on January 10, 1815, as Georgy Vasilievich Govorov (), in the village of Chernavsk, in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father was a Russian Orthodox priest.

In 1823, he was sent to study at the Theological College in Livny. The moral and spiritual beliefs in the school was favorable to him. In 1829, Govorov was found among the best students and was transferred to the Oryol Theological Seminary. At the time, Archimandrite Isidore (Nikolsky) was the rector of the seminary, the philosophical sciences were taught by Evfimy Ostromyslensky and the literature teacher was Hieromonk Platon (Gorodetsky), later Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia. He found success in his studies, and he began to consciously work on himself. Already at this time, his characteristic feature was a love of seclusion. The seminary bulletin noted that Govorov was distinguished by &quot;a penchant for solitude; edifying in his treatment of comrades; sets an example of diligence and good morals; meek and silent.&quot; After graduating from the seminary, considered the best of the pupils of his course, he was sent to the Kiev Theological Academy in 1837.

==Career==
During his studies in Kiev, in 1838, his mother died, and a year later, his father died as well, influencing Govorov&#x27;s life. On October 1, 1840, he submitted a petition to the academic authorities for monastic tonsure; at the age of 26, he received monastic tonsure from the rector of the Kiev Theological Academy, Archimandrite Jeremiah Solovyov with the name Theophanes in honor of Theophanes the Confessor. On April 6 of the same year, on the day of his episcopal consecration, Jeremiah ordained him to the office of hierodeacon, and also to the office of hieromonk on July 1 of the same year.

In 1841, Hieromonk Theophan was among the first to graduate from the Academy with a master&#x27;s degree in theology for a course essay &quot;Review of Sublaw Religion&quot; (Обозрение подзаконной религии), which, being found among the best works, was sent to the Most Holy Synod. Metropolitan Philaret Drozdov of Moscow, a permanent member of the Most Holy Synod, stated in his review: &quot;This work contains so much information and considerations about the law of Moses that they serve as sufficient evidence of the knowledge of the writer, giving him the right to a master&#x27;s degree.&quot; Immediately after graduating from the Academy, Theophan was appointed rector of the Kiev-Sofia Theological College, where he began to teach Latin.

On December 7, 1842, he was appointed an inspector and teacher of psychology and logic at the Novgorod Theological Seminary. He received the degree of Master of Divinity on December 18 of the same year.

On October 16, 1844, he was appointed teacher of the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy in the Department of Moral and Pastoral Theology and Hieromonk Theophan became an assistant inspector of the Academy from March 22, 1845. On July 3, 1845, he was appointed as a member of the committee to review the summaries of academic subjects taught at the seminary.

At this time, he was interested a solitary monastic life; in a letter to his spiritual father Jeremiah, who tonsured and ordained him, he wrote: &quot;I am beginning to be burdened by my academic position to the point of unbearability. I would like to go to church, and sit there&quot;. On August 21, 1847, at his request, he was appointed as a member of the Russian Orthodox Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, headed by Archimandrite Porphyrius (Uspensky). In Jerusalem. Theophan learned iconography and studied Greek, French, Hebrew and Arabic. In Palestine, he became acquainted with the ancient asceticism of the Eastern monasteries and the monuments of ascetic writing of the past centuries. He also engaged in the translation of the works of the holy fathers of the Philokalia. In addition, he became intimately acquainted with the non-Orthodox Christian beliefs. For his works, on May 5, 1851, Theophan was awarded the gold pectoral cross.

In 1853, the Crimean War began; on May 3, 1854, the mission was withdrawn to Russia. The return took place through Western Europe; Theophan visited many cities, churches, museums, libraries, and educational institutions. Notably, Archimandrite Porphyrius and Hieromonk Theophan had an audience with Pope Pius IX.

Upon his return to Russia, he was appointed a teacher of canon law at the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy; on April 14, 1855, he was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. In September of the same year, he was appointed rector of the Olonets Theological Seminary, which was located in the building of the Petrozavodsk Theological College; Archimandrite Theophan had to organize the construction of his own building for the seminary. At this time he wrote the following: &quot;We don&#x27;t have a seminary. By right of the strong, we live in a building bought for a school, and it is in an apartment. The seminary bursa is also in the apartment, which is very, very inconvenient&quot;. In October 1855, he was appointed a member of the Olonets Ecclesiastical Consistory. At the suggestion of Archbishop Arcadius (Fyodorov), he was appointed censor of the sermons of the Olonets diocese. At the seminary, he organized an anti-schismatic library.

On May 21, 1856, he was appointed rector of the Russian embassy church in Constantinople (Ottoman Empire), as he was well acquainted with the Orthodox East. Theophan was charged with collecting information about the Greco-Bulgarian Schism that was brewing at that time. For his labors, on April 17, 1857, he was awarded the 2nd degree of the Order of St. Anna.

In May 1857, he was appointed rector of the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy. In addition to the rector&#x27;s office, he was entrusted with overseeing the teaching of the Law of God in secular educational institutions of the St. Petersburg district. He was chairman of the committee at the Academy of Sciences for the publication of works of Byzantine historians; in 1858, he became a chairman of the committee for the translation of Holy Scripture into Russian.

On May 29, 1859, Archimandrite Theophan was elected Bishop of Tambov and Shatsk, and on June 1, in the Trinity Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, he was consecrated bishop. On July 5, he took over the diocese. The Tambov diocese was one of the most extensive and popular; there were 1,172 priests, 681 deacons, several hundred monastics, and many sectarians and Old Believers among the population. Bishop Theophan paid special attention to preaching; he accompanied almost every service with a sermon. Bishop Theophan and the clergy were convinced, as they stated, &quot;that preaching is his first, direct and sacred duty, and at the same time should be an internal need, if only to properly and consciously treat his high ministry&quot;. The Tambov male monastery of Our Lady of Kazan at the bishop&#x27;s house became the center of preaching. In the Tambov Diocesan Gazette, Bishop Theophan published his homiletic treatise &quot;How to compose a sermon&quot;, in which he stated the features of the sermon: &quot;the peculiarity of my sermons is that they are not composed […] These are written impromptu.&quot;

On July 22, 1863, Bishop Theophan was moved to the ancient Vladimir diocese. At the Diocese of Vladimir, where at the time there were many schismatics and sectarians, Theophan&#x27;s fame as a preacher strengthened. He authored &quot;Instruction for Preaching the Word of God&quot;, published on November 27, 1864 in the Vladimir Diocesan Gazette. In the same year he sent Hieromonk Moses to Moscow to verify old printed books. In Vyazniki county he opened the &quot;Epiphany Orthodox Brotherhood&quot;. In 1865, a women&#x27;s diocesan school was opened under his care. For his archpastoral activity, on April 19, 1864, he was awarded the 1st degree of Order of St. Anna.

== In retirement ==

The petition for his retirement was granted on June 17, 1866, with his appointment as rector in the Vysha Hermitage in the Tambov Governorate. On September 19, at his request, he was dismissed from the management of the monastery. While living in Vysha, he spent his time reading and writing.

He suffered from rheumatism, neuralgia, cardiac arrhythmia and dizziness, as well as progressive cataracts, as a result of which he became blind in his right eye in 1888.

==Death==
Theophan the Recluse died on January 6, 1894. He was buried in the Kazan church of the Vysha Monastery.

==&quot;The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned To It&quot;==
&quot;The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned To It&quot; was originally written in response to Theophan&#x27;s encounter with a young woman. While at a ball, a Moscow woman began having thoughts she believed irrational about the meaning of life and the mortality of humans. After contacting Theophan, the two began corresponding through letters, the lady writing on her spiritual difficulties and Theophan responding with spiritual advice. She later became a nun. The Saint Herman Press, the publisher of the illustrated edition of &quot;The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned to It&quot;, notes that it was of great importance to Theophan that the young woman should &quot;be able to keenly hear the right &#x27;tone&#x27; of spiritual life&quot;.

==Veneration as a saint==

Theophan was canonized by the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church of 1988. The act of canonization declared that his &quot;deep theological understanding of the Christian teaching, as well as its performance in practice, and, as a consequence of this, the loftiness and holiness of the life of the &quot;sviatitel&quot;&#x27; allow for his writings to be regarded as a development of the teaching of the Holy Fathers, preserving the same Orthodox purity and Divine enlightenment.&quot; His feast day is celebrated January 6 or January 10.

==Quotes==
* &quot;He who believes in God, but does not confess Him as the Father of the Son, does not believe in a god that is the true God, but in some personal invention.&quot;
* &quot;Baptism gives us what nothing else on earth can give us: it unites and combines our natural being divine grace... some new element, a supernatural one is added to our composition, and will remain inside us hidden and secretly acting.&quot;
*&quot;You ask, will the heterodox be saved... Why do you worry about them? They have a Saviour Who desires the salvation of every human being. He will take care of them. You and I should not be burdened with such a concern. Study yourself and your own sins... I will tell you one thing, however: should you, being Orthodox and possessing the Truth in its fullness, betray Orthodoxy, and enter a different faith, you will lose your soul forever.&quot;
*&quot;Where there is no prayer and fasting there are the demons.&quot;

<text>The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction franchise created by Douglas Adams. Originally, a radio sitcom broadcast over two series on BBC Radio 4 between 1978 and 1980. It was soon adapted to other formats, including print, as both novels and comic books; a 1981 BBC television series; later as a 1984 text adventure game; stage shows; and a 2005 feature film.

&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is an international multimedia phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005. The first novel, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (1979), has been ranked fourth on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll. The sixth novel, &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, was written by Eoin Colfer with additional unpublished material by Douglas Adams. In 2017, BBC Radio 4 announced a 40th-anniversary celebration with Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, in charge. The first of six new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018.

The broad narrative of &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; follows the misadventures of the last surviving man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from Earth&#x27;s destruction by Ford Prefect—a human-like alien writer for the eccentric, electronic travel guide &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;—by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian, another human who had been taken from Earth (before its destruction) by the self-centred President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and the depressed Marvin the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed among the various adaptations.

==Spelling==
The different versions of the series spell the title differently — thus &quot;Hitch-Hiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;Hitch Hiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; are used in different editions (UK or US), formats (audio or print), and compilations of the book, with some omitting the apostrophe. Some editions use different spellings on the spine and title page. The h2g2&#x27;s &quot;English Usage in Approved Entries&quot; claims that &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; is the spelling that Adams preferred. At least two reference works make note of the inconsistency in the titles. Both, however, repeat the statement that Adams decided in 2000 that &quot;everyone should spell it the same way [one word, no hyphen] from then on.&quot;

== Synopsis ==
The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, a hapless Englishman, following the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons (a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens) to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent&#x27;s adventures intersect with several other characters: Ford Prefect (an alien and researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth&#x27;s destruction), Zaphod Beeblebrox (Ford&#x27;s eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President who has stolen the &quot;Heart of Gold,&quot; a spacecraft equipped with Infinite Improbability Drive), the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Trillian (formerly known as Tricia McMillan) who is a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and who—thanks to Beeblebrox&#x27;s intervention—is the only other human survivor of Earth&#x27;s destruction.

In their travels, Arthur comes to learn that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer, created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built by its creators to give the answer to the &quot;Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot;, which, after eons of calculations, was given simply as &quot;42&quot;. Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the Question actually is. The Earth was subsequently destroyed by the Vogons moments after its calculations were completed but before they could be communicated, and Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends&#x27; help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, before embarking on further adventures.

==Background==

The original, first radio series comes from a proposal called &quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot;: six self-contained episodes, all ending with Earth being destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there. Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a &quot;wholly remarkable book&quot; named &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. As the first radio episode&#x27;s writing progressed, the &quot;Guide&quot; became the centre of his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over.

Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the &quot;Hitch-hiker&#x27;s Guide to Europe&quot; book: while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker&#x27;s guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only knew of it because he&#x27;d told the story of it so many times. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of &quot;hitch-hiking around the galaxy&quot; to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.

Adams&#x27;s fictional &quot;Guide&quot; is an electronic guidebook to the entire universe, originally published by Megadodo Publications, one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The narrative of the various versions of the story is frequently punctuated with excerpts from the &quot;Guide&quot;. The voice of the &quot;Guide&quot; (Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions, later William Franklyn in the third, fourth and fifth radio series, and Stephen Fry in the movie version), also provides general narration.

===Overview===
===Original radio series===
The first radio series of six episodes (called &quot;Fits&quot; after the names of the sections of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s nonsense poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot;) was broadcast in 1978 on BBC Radio 4. Despite a low-key launch of the series (the first episode was broadcast at 10:30 pm on Wednesday, 8 March 1978), it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio. A one-off episode (a &quot;Christmas special&quot;) was broadcast later in the year. The BBC had a practice at the time of commissioning &quot;Christmas Special&quot; episodes for popular radio series, and while an early draft of this episode of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; had a Christmas-related plotline, it was decided to be &quot;in slightly poor taste&quot; and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series. This episode was released as part of the second radio series and, later, &quot;The Secondary Phase&quot; on cassettes and CDs. The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired, in a slightly edited version, in the United States on &quot;NPR Playhouse&quot;.

The first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more times in the next few years. This led to an LP re-recording, produced independently of the BBC for sale, and a further adaptation of the series as a book. A second radio series, which consisted of a further five episodes, and bringing the total number of episodes to 12, was broadcast in 1980.

The radio series (and the LP and TV versions) were narrated by comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book. Jones was cast after a three-month-long casting search and after at least three actors (including Michael Palin) turning down the role.

The series was also notable for its use of sound, being the first comedy series to be produced in stereo. Adams said that he wanted the programme&#x27;s production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album. Much of the programme&#x27;s budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for the pilot episode and the complete second series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining episodes (2–6) of the first series). The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into four-channel Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series.

The theme tune used for the radio, television, LP, and film versions is &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot;, an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon and recorded by the Eagles on their 1975 album &quot;One of These Nights&quot;. Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a sound-alike cover by Tim Souster was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement, this time by Philip Pope, was recorded to be released with the CDs of the last three radio series. Apparently, Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give an &quot;on the road, hitch-hiking feel&quot; to it.

The twelve episodes were released (in a slightly edited form, removing the Pink Floyd music and two other tunes &quot;hummed&quot; by Marvin when the team land on Magrathea) on CD and cassette in 1988, becoming the first CD release in the BBC Radio Collection. They were re-released in 1992, and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First to Sixth as &quot;The Primary Phase&quot; and Fits the Seventh to Twelfth as &quot;The Secondary Phase&quot; instead of just &quot;the first series&quot; and &quot;the second series&quot;. It was at about this time that a &quot;Tertiary Phase&quot; was first discussed with Dirk Maggs, adapting &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, but this series would not be recorded for another ten years.

=== Radio series 3–5 ===
On 21 June 2004, the BBC announced in a press release that a new series of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; based on the third novel would be broadcast as part of its autumn schedule, produced by Above the Title Productions Ltd. The episodes were recorded in late 2003, but actual transmission was delayed while an agreement was reached with The Walt Disney Company over Internet re-broadcasts, as Disney had begun pre-production on the film. This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the fourth and fifth novels.

The third series was broadcast in September and October 2004. The fourth and fifth were broadcast in May and June 2005, with the fifth series following immediately after the fourth. CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each series.

The adaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series in comparison to the second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in a different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; are now foreshadowed in the adaptation of &quot;So Long and Thanks For All The Fish&quot;, while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.

The core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement of Peter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book, and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast, since both had died. (Homage to Jones&#x27; iconic portrayal of the Book was paid twice: the gradual shift of voices to a &quot;new&quot; version in episode 13, launching the new productions, and a blend of Jones and Franklyn&#x27;s voices at the end of the final episode, the first part of Maggs&#x27; alternative ending.) Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the TV series, here played Tricia McMillan, an English-born, American-accented alternate-universe version of Trillian, while David Dixon, the television series&#x27; Ford Prefect, made a cameo appearance as the &quot;Ecological Man&quot;. Jane Horrocks appeared in the new semi-regular role of Fenchurch, Arthur&#x27;s girlfriend, and Samantha Béart joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian&#x27;s daughter, Random Dent. Also reprising their roles from the original radio series were Jonathan Pryce as Zarniwoop (here blended with a character from the final novel to become Zarniwoop Vann Harl), Rula Lenska as Lintilla and her clones (and also as the Voice of the Bird), and Roy Hudd as Milliways compere Max Quordlepleen, as well as the original radio series&#x27; announcer, John Marsh.

The series also featured guest appearances by such noted personalities as Joanna Lumley as the Sydney Opera House Woman, Jackie Mason as the East River Creature, Miriam Margolyes as the Smelly Photocopier Woman, BBC Radio cricket legends Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman as themselves, June Whitfield as the Raffle Woman, Leslie Phillips as Hactar, Saeed Jaffrey as the Man on the Pole, Sir Patrick Moore as himself, and Christian Slater as Wonko the Sane. Finally, Adams himself played the role of Agrajag, a performance adapted from his book-on-tape reading of the third novel, and edited into the series created some time after the author&#x27;s death.

=== Radio series 6 ===

The first of six episodes in a sixth series, the &quot;Hexagonal Phase&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 8 March 2018 and featured Professor Stephen Hawking introducing himself as the voice of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Mk II&quot; by saying: &quot;I have been quite popular in my time. Some even read my books.&quot;

== Novels ==
The novels are described as &quot;a trilogy in five parts&quot;, having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book, and then a &quot;trilogy in four parts&quot; on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend &quot;The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker&#x27;s Trilogy&quot; on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore the legend &quot;The [first, second, third, fourth] book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker&#x27;s Trilogy&quot;. In addition, the blurb on the fifth book describes it as &quot;the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word &#x27;trilogy.

The plots of the television and radio series are more or less the same as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here. Many consider the books&#x27; version of events to be definitive because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced.

Before his death from a heart attack on 11 May 2001, Adams was considering writing a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s series. He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, under the working title &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, but felt that the book was not working and abandoned it. In an interview, he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s series, and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series. He described &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; as &quot;a very bleak book&quot; and said he &quot;would love to finish &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; on a slightly more upbeat note&quot;. Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment, he would at least start with all the characters in the same place. Eoin Colfer, who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s series in 2008–09, used this latter concept but none of the plot ideas from &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;.

=== &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; ===

The first book was adapted from the first four radio episodes (the Primary Phase), with Arthur being rescued from Earth&#x27;s destruction by Ford, meeting Zaphod and Trillian, coming to the planet of Magrathea and discovering the true purpose of Earth, and ending with the group preparing to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelisation, an action they would later regret. The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,000 copies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the United States in October 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to build word of mouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books re-released the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. As of 2005, the book version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; has sold over 14 million copies.

A photo-illustrated edition of the first novel appeared in 1994.

=== &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; ===
In &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from the others and finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for &quot;The Guide&quot;, who knows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to be a stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no automatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat.

Ford and Arthur, meanwhile, end up on a spacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilisation. The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth; Ford and Arthur are stranded, and it becomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans, having displaced the Earth&#x27;s indigenous hominids. This has disrupted the Earth&#x27;s programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from Arthur&#x27;s subconscious mind by pulling lettered tiles from a Scrabble set, it is &quot;What do you get if you multiply six by nine?&quot;
The book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio series—covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre-historic Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted), and most of the Brontitall incident was omitted, instead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted—this having first been introduced in the LP version. Adams himself considered &quot;Restaurant&quot; to be his best novel of the five.

=== &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; ===
In &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; (published in 1982), Ford and Arthur travel through the space-time continuum from prehistoric Earth to Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. There they run into Slartibartfast, who enlists their aid in preventing galactic war. Long ago, the people of Krikkit attempted to wipe out all life in the Universe, but they were stopped and imprisoned on their home planet; now they are poised to escape. With the help of Marvin, Zaphod, and Trillian, our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go their separate ways.

This was the first Hitchhiker&#x27;s book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio. Its story was based on a treatment Adams had written for a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theatrical release, with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast (to begin with), and later Trillian and Arthur.

In 2004, it was adapted for radio as the Tertiary Phase of the radio series.

=== &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; ===
In &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; (published in 1984), Arthur returns home to Earth, rather surprisingly since it was destroyed when he left. He meets and falls in love with a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually, he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God&#x27;s Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring.

This was the first &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; novel which was not an adaptation of any previously written story or script. In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quandary Phase of the radio series.

=== &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; ===
Finally, in &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; (published in 1992), Vogons take over &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; (under the name of InfiniDim Enterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After abruptly losing Fenchurch and travelling around the galaxy despondently, Arthur&#x27;s spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella, where he settles in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of simple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into &quot;The Guide&#x27;s&quot; offices, gets himself an infinite expense account from the computer system, and then meets &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II&quot;, an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast power and a hidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine&#x27;s aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for safety (&quot;Oh yes, whose?&quot;—Arthur).

Trillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for travelling money to have a daughter, and when she goes to cover a war, she leaves her daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent with Arthur. Random, a more than typically troubled teenager, steals &quot;The Guide Mark II&quot; and uses it to get to Earth. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Tricia McMillan (Trillian in this alternate universe) follow her to a crowded club, where an anguished Random becomes startled by a noise and inadvertently fires her gun at Arthur. The shot misses Arthur and kills a man (the ever-unfortunate Agrajag). Immediately afterwards, &quot;The Guide Mark II&quot; causes the removal of all possible Earths from probability. All of the main characters, save Zaphod, were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed, bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons.

In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quintessential Phase of the radio series, with the final episode first transmitted on 21 June 2005.

=== &quot;And Another Thing...&quot; ===

It was announced in September 2008 that Eoin Colfer, author of &quot;Artemis Fowl,&quot; had been commissioned to write the sixth instalment entitled &quot;And Another Thing...&quot; with the support of Jane Belson, Adams&#x27;s widow. The book was published by Penguin Books in the UK and Hyperion in the US in October 2009.

The story begins as death rays bear down on Earth, and the characters awaken from a virtual reality. Zaphod picks them up shortly before they are killed, but completely fails to escape the death beams. They are then saved by Bowerick Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged, whom they agree to help kill. Zaphod travels to Asgard to get Thor&#x27;s help. In the meantime, the Vogons are heading to destroy a colony of people who also escaped Earth&#x27;s destruction, on the planet Nano. Arthur, Wowbagger, Trillian and Random head to Nano to try to stop the Vogons, and on the journey, Wowbagger and Trillian fall in love, making Wowbagger question whether or not he wants to be killed. Zaphod arrives with Thor, who then signs up to be the planet&#x27;s God. With Random&#x27;s help, Thor almost kills Wowbagger. Wowbagger, who merely loses his immortality, then marries Trillian.

Thor then stops the first Vogon attack and apparently dies. Meanwhile, Constant Mown, son of Prostetnic Jeltz, convinces his father that the people on the planet are not citizens of Earth, but are, in fact, citizens of Nano, which means that it would be illegal to kill them. As the book draws to a close, Arthur is on his way to check out a possible university for Random, when, during a hyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where he would want to be. And then the Vogons turn up again.

In 2017 it was adapted for radio as the &quot;Hexagonal Phase&quot; of the radio series, with its premiere episode first transmitted on 8 March 2018 (exactly forty years, to the day, from the first episode of the first series, the Primary Phase).

=== Omnibus editions ===
Two omnibus editions were created by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to &quot;set the record straight&quot;. The stories came in so many different formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself. Therefore, he stated in the introduction of &quot;The More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; that &quot;anything I put down wrong here is, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, wrong for good.&quot; The two omnibus editions were &quot;The More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, Complete and Unabridged&quot; (published in 1987) and &quot;The Ultimate Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, Complete and Unabridged&quot; (published in 1997).

====&quot;The More Than Complete Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;====
Published in 1987, this 624-page leatherbound omnibus edition contains &quot;wrong for good&quot; versions of the four &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; series novels at the time, and also includes one short story:
* &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;
* &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;
* &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;
* &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;
* &quot;Young Zaphod Plays it Safe&quot;

====&quot;The Ultimate Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;====
Published in 1997, this 832-page leatherbound final omnibus edition contains five &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; series novels and one short story:
* &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;
* &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;
* &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;
* &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;
* &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;
* &quot;Young Zaphod Plays it Safe&quot;
Also appearing in &quot;The Ultimate Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, at the end of Adams&#x27;s introduction, is a list of instructions on &quot;How to Leave the Planet&quot;, providing a humorous explanation of how one might replicate Arthur and Ford&#x27;s feat at the beginning of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;.

== Television series ==
===1981 series===
The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by Alan J. W. Bell, which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First to Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey that would have come from Adams&#x27;s abandoned &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made. Elements of &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; were instead used in the third novel, &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;.

The main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern, and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.

===Planned television series===
A new television series for Hulu was announced in July 2019. Carlton Cuse was named as the showrunner alongside Jason Fuchs, who would also be writing for the show. The show would be produced by ABC Signature and Genre Arts. The series was set to premiere in 2021. Production was slated to begin in the summer of 2020 and air on Fox in international markets. The series has reportedly been renewed for a second season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production on the series has most likely been delayed. However, a production outlet claimed that the series began production in May 2021. Hulu receives no updates since then, and Cuse and Fuchs appeared to have moved on.

=== Other television appearances ===
Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Read&quot; survey and programme, broadcast in late 2003. The film, directed by Deep Sehgal, starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent, alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect, Nigel Planer as the voice of Marvin, Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought, Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide, Roger Lloyd-Pack as Slartibartfast, and Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg.

After several years of setbacks and renewed efforts to start production and a quarter of a century after the first book was published, the big-screen adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was finally shot. Pre-production began in 2003, filming began on 19 April 2004 and post-production began in early September 2004. Adams died during the film&#x27;s production but had still helped with early screenplays and concepts introduced with the film.

After a London premiere on 20 April 2005, it was released on 28 April in the UK and Australia and on 29 April in the United States and Canada. The movie stars Martin Freeman as Arthur, Yasiin Bey as Ford, Sam Rockwell as President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian, with Alan Rickman providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android (and Warwick Davis acting in Marvin&#x27;s costume), and Stephen Fry as the voice of the Guide/Narrator.

The plot of the film adaptation of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; differs widely from that of the radio show, book and television series. The romantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the film; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (which, in the books, was already abandoned), and Viltvodle VI are inserted. The film covers roughly events in the first four radio episodes, and ends with the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving the opportunity for a sequel open. A unique appearance is made by the Point-of-View Gun, a device specifically created by Adams himself for the movie.

Commercially the film was a modest success, taking $21 million in its opening weekend in the United States, and nearly £3.3 million in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom.

The film was released on DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on 5 September 2005. Both a standard double-disc edition and a UK-exclusive numbered limited edition &quot;Giftpack&quot; were released on this date. The &quot;Giftpack&quot; edition includes a copy of the novel with a &quot;movie tie-in&quot; cover, and collectible prints from the film, packaged in a replica of the film&#x27;s version of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; prop. A single-disc widescreen or full-screen edition (Region 1, NTSC) were made available in the United States and Canada on 13 September 2005. Single-disc releases in the Blu-ray format and UMD format for the PlayStation Portable were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.

== Stage shows ==

There have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Three early professional productions were staged in 1979 and 1980.

The first of these was performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, between 1 and 19 May 1979, starring Chris Langham as Arthur Dent (Langham later returned to &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; as Prak in the final episode of 2004&#x27;s Tertiary Phase) and Richard Hope as Ford Prefect. This show was adapted from the first series&#x27; scripts and was directed by Ken Campbell, who went on to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series. The show ran 90 minutes, but had an audience limited to eighty people per night. Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms, and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar, 1/2000th of an inch above the floor. This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large costume. The narration of &quot;The Book&quot; was split between two usherettes, an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of &quot;H2G2&quot;. One of these usherettes, Cindy Oswin, went on to voice Trillian for the LP adaptation.

The second stage show was performed throughout Wales between 15 January and 23 February 1980. This was a production of Theatr Clwyd, and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations of complete radio episodes, at times doing two episodes in a night, and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three-hour sessions. This adaptation was performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981, the Bristol Hippodrome, Plymouth&#x27;s Theatre Royal in May–June 1982, the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, in July 1983 and La Boite in Brisbane, November 1983.

The third and least successful stage show was held at the Rainbow Theatre in London, in July 1980. This was the second production directed by Ken Campbell. The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of rock operas in the 1970s, and both reference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this, coupled with incidental music throughout the performance, caused some reviewers to label it as a &quot;musical&quot;. This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the &quot;Dish of the Day&quot; sequence. The production ran for over three hours, and was widely panned for this, as well as for the music, laser effects, and the acting. Despite attempts to shorten the script, and make other changes, it closed three or four weeks early (accounts differ), and lost a lot of money. Despite the bad reviews, there were at least two stand-out performances: Michael Cule and David Learner both went on from this production to appearances in the TV adaptation.

In December 2011 a new stage production was announced to begin touring in June 2012. This included members of the original radio and TV casts such as Simon Jones, Geoff McGivern, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey and Stephen Moore with VIP guests playing the role of the Book. It was produced in the form of a radio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed. This production was based on the first four Fits in the first act, with the second act covering material from the rest of the series. The show also featured a band, who performed the songs &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot;, the Krikkit song &quot;Under the Ink Black Sky&quot;, Marvin&#x27;s song &quot;How I Hate The Night&quot;, and &quot;Marvin&quot;, which was a minor hit in 1981.

The production featured a series of &quot;VIP guests&quot; as the voice of The Book including Billy Boyd, Phill Jupitus, Rory McGrath, Roger McGough, Jon Culshaw, Christopher Timothy, Andrew Sachs, John Challis, Hugh Dennis, John Lloyd, Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The tour started on 8 June 2012 at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow and continued through the summer until 21 July when the final performance was at Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh. The production started touring again in September 2013, but the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled due to poor ticket sales.

==Other adaptations==
=== Vinyl LPs ===

The first four radio episodes were adapted for a double LP, also entitled &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (appended with &quot;Part One&quot; for the subsequent Canadian release), first by mail-order only, and later into stores. The double LP and its sequel were originally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979 and 1980, with the catalogue numbers ORA042 and ORA054 respectively. They were first released by Hannibal Records in 1982 (as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307, respectively) in the United States and Canada, and later re-released in a slightly abridged edition by Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Audioworks in the mid-1980s. Both were produced by Geoffrey Perkins and featured cover artwork by Hipgnosis.

The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing. Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when the original scripts from the radio series were eventually published can be heard in the LP version. The Simon &amp; Schuster cassettes omit the Veet Voojagig narration, the cheerleader&#x27;s speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half-million-year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the second LP of the set.
Most of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, who was recording a voice for the character of Princess Eilonwy in &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures. Cindy Oswin voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place. Other casting changes in the first double LP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman, and Valentine Dyall as the voice of Deep Thought. Adams&#x27;s voice can be heard making the public address announcements on Magrathea.

Because of copyright issues, the music used during the first radio series was either replaced, or in the case of the title it was re-recorded in a new arrangement. Composer Tim Souster did both duties (with Paddy Kingsland contributing music as well), and Souster&#x27;s version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.

The sequel LP was released, singly, as &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; in the UK, and simply as &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; in the USA. The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth, but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant (&quot;Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo&quot;), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to &quot;Disaster Area&quot;.

As the result of a misunderstanding, the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended to make. Perkins has said, &quot;[I]t is far too long on each side. It&#x27;s just a rough cut. [...] I felt it was flabby, and I wanted to speed it up.&quot; The Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its original release. The scene with Ford Prefect and Hotblack Desiato&#x27;s bodyguard is omitted.

Sales for the first double-LP release were primarily through mail order. Total sales reached over 60,000 units, with half of those being mail order, and the other half through retail outlets. This is in spite of the facts that Original Records&#x27; warehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time, and that Paul Neil Milne Johnstone complained about his name and then-current address being included in the recording. This was corrected for a later pressing of the double-LP by &quot;cut[ting] up that part of the master tape and reassembl[ing] it in the wrong order&quot;. The second LP release (&quot;Part Two&quot;) also only sold a total of 60,000 units in the UK. The distribution deals for the United States and Canada with Hannibal Records and Simon and Schuster were later negotiated by Douglas Adams and his agent, Ed Victor, after gaining full rights to the recordings from Original Records, which went bankrupt.

All five phases were released on LP in 2018 by Demon Records, and for its 42nd anniversary, the original &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; and &quot;Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; were combined into a three-record set that was released in August 2020 for Record Store Day, also by Demon Records. It is available in three versions: Translucent Vogon Green, Translucent Magrathean Blue and Translucent Pan-Galactic Purple.

=== Audiobooks ===
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition (), recorded in the mid-1980s for the EMI label Music For Pleasure by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition for Dove Audiobooks (), later re-released by New Millennium Audio () in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by arrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams () in 1994. To tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film&#x27;s voice of the Guide, recorded a second abridged edition ().

In addition, unabridged versions of books 2-5 of the series were recorded by Martin Freeman for Random House Audio. Freeman plays Arthur in the 2005 film adaptation. Audiobooks 2-5 follow in order and include: &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; (); &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; (); &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; (); and &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; ().

=== Video games ===
Sometime between 1982 and 1984 (accounts differ), the British company Supersoft published a text-based adventure game based on the book, which was released in versions for the Commodore PET and Commodore 64. One account states that there was a dispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted, and following legal action the game was withdrawn and all remaining copies were destroyed. Another account states that the programmer, Bob Chappell, rewrote the game to remove all &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; references, and republished it as &quot;Cosmic Capers&quot;.

Officially, the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best-selling &quot;interactive fiction&quot;, or text-based adventure game, distributed by Infocom. It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular Steve Meretzky and was one of Infocom&#x27;s most successful games. As with many Infocom games, the box contained a number of &quot;feelies&quot; including a &quot;Don&#x27;t panic&quot; badge, some &quot;pocket fluff&quot;, a pair of peril-sensitive sunglasses (made of cardboard), an order for the destruction of the Earth, a small, clear plastic bag containing &quot;a microscopic battle fleet&quot; and an order for the destruction of Arthur Dent&#x27;s house (signed by Adams and Meretzky).

In September 2004, it was revived by the BBC on the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase, and is still available to play online. This new version uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom-written interpreter, by Sean Sollé, and Flash programming by Shimon Young, both of whom used to work at The Digital Village (TDV). The new version includes illustrations by Rod Lord, who was head of Pearce Animation Studios in 1980, which produced the guide graphics for the TV series. On 2 March 2005 it won the Interactive BAFTA in the &quot;best online entertainment&quot; category.

A sequel to the original Infocom game was never made. An all-new, fully graphical game was designed and developed by a joint venture between The Digital Village and PAN Interactive (no connection to Pan Books / Pan MacMillan). This new game was planned and developed between 1998 and 2002, but like the sequel to the Infocom game, it also never materialised. In April 2005, Starwave Mobile released two mobile games to accompany the release of the film adaptation. The first, developed by Atatio, was called &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor&quot;. It was a typical top-down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story. The second game, developed by TKO Software, was a graphical adventure game named &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game&quot;. Despite its name, the newly designed puzzles by TKO Software&#x27;s Ireland studio were different from the Infocom ones, and the game followed the movie&#x27;s script closely and included the new characters and places. The &quot;Adventure Game&quot; won the IGN&#x27;s &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice Award&quot; in May 2005.

On 25 May 2011, Hothead Games announced they were working on a new edition of The Guide. Along with the announcement, Hothead Games launched a teaser web site made to look like an announcement from Megadodo Publications that The Guide will soon be available on Earth. It has since been revealed that they are developing an iOS app in the style of the fictional Guide.

=== Comic books ===
In 1993, DC Comics, in conjunction with Byron Preiss Visual Publications, published a three-part comic book adaptation of the novelisation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. This was followed up with three-part adaptations of &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; in 1994, and &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; in 1996. There was also a series of collectors&#x27; cards with art from and inspired by the comic adaptations of the first book, and a graphic novelisation (or &quot;collected edition&quot;) combining the three individual comic books from 1993, itself released in May 1997. Douglas Adams was deeply opposed to the use of American English spellings and idioms in what he felt was a very British story, and had to be talked into it by the American publishers, although he remained very unhappy with the compromise.

The adaptations were scripted by John Carnell. Steve Leialoha provided the art for &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; and the layouts for &quot;Restaurant&quot;. Shepherd Hendrix did the finished art for &quot;Restaurant&quot;. Neil Vokes and John Nyberg did the finished artwork for &quot;Life&quot;, based on breakdowns by Paris Cullins (Book 1) and Christopher Schenck (Books 2–3). The miniseries were edited by Howard Zimmerman and Ken Grobe.

===Live radio===
On Saturday 29 March 2014, Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live audience, featuring many members of the original cast including Stephen Moore, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey, Simon Jones and Geoff McGivern, with John Lloyd as the book.

The adaptation was adapted by Dirk Maggs primarily from Fit the First, including material from the books and later radio Fits as well as some new jokes. It formed part of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Character Invasion&quot; series.

== Legacy ==
=== Future predictions ===
While Adams&#x27; writing in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; was mostly to poke fun at scientific advance, such as through the artificial personalities built into the work&#x27;s robots, Adams had predicted some concepts that have since come to be reality. The Guide itself, described as a small book-sized object that held a great volume of information, predated computer laptops and is comparable to tablet computers. The idea of being able to instantaneously translate between any language, a function provided by the Babel Fish, has since become possible with several software products that work in near real-time. In the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, Adams also mentions computers being controlled by voice, touch and gesture, a reality for humans today.

=== &quot;Hitch-Hikeriana&quot; ===

Many merchandising and spin-off items (or &quot;Hitch-Hikeriana&quot;) were produced in the early 1980s, including towels in different colours, all bearing the Guide entry for towels. Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books, Touchstone Pictures / Disney for the 2005 movie, and different towels made for ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, the official &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; Appreciation society. Other items that first appeared in the mid-1980s were T-shirts, including those made for Infocom (such as one bearing the legend &quot;I got the Babel Fish&quot; for successfully completing one of that game&#x27;s most difficult puzzles), and a Disaster Area tour T-shirt. Other official items have included &quot;Beeblebears&quot; (teddy bears with an extra head and arm, named after &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; character Zaphod Beeblebrox, sold by the official Appreciation Society), an assortment of pin-on buttons and a number of novelty singles. Many of the above items are displayed throughout the 2004 &quot;25th Anniversary Illustrated Edition&quot; of the novel, which used items from the personal collections of fans of the series.

Stephen Moore recorded two novelty singles in character as Marvin, the Paranoid Android: &quot;Marvin&quot;/&quot;Metal Man&quot; and &quot;Reasons To Be Miserable&quot;/&quot;Marvin I Love You&quot;. The last song has appeared on a Dr. Demento compilation. Another single featured the re-recorded &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot; (arranged by Tim Souster) backed with &quot;Reg Nullify In Concert&quot; by Reg Nullify, and &quot;Only the End of the World Again&quot; by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar) . These discs have since become collector&#x27;s items.

The 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles, mostly through the National Entertainment Collectibles Association. These included three prop replicas of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld (a mug, a pen and a stapler), sets of &quot;action figures&quot; with a height of either 3 or 6 inches (76 or 150 mm), a gun—based on a prop used by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, that shoots foam darts—a crystal cube, shot glasses, a ten-inch (254 mm) high version of Marvin with eyes that light up green, and &quot;yarn doll&quot; versions of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Also, various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie, notably re-recordings of &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Reasons To Be Miserable&quot;, sung by Stephen Fry, along with some of the &quot;Guide Entries&quot;, newly written material read in-character by Fry.

===Towel Day===
Celebrated on 25 May, Towel Day is a fan-created event in which they carry a towel with them throughout the day, in reference to the importance of towels as a tool of a galactic hitchhiker described in the work. The annual event was started in 2001, two weeks after Adams&#x27; death.

===42, or The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything ===

In the works, the number 42 is given as The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything by the computer Deep Thought. The absurdly simple answer to a complex philosophical question became a frequent reference in popular culture in homage to &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, particularly within works of science fiction and in video games, such as in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

2020 was the 42nd anniversary of HG2G appearing on Radio 4. The book &quot;Hitchhiking: Cultural Inroads&quot; was dedicated to the memory of British actor Stephen V. Moore who died in Oct 2019 and played the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the original BBC Radio and Television Series.

===Other references in popular culture===

Two asteroids, &quot;18610 Arthurdent&quot; and &quot;25924 Douglasadams&quot; were named after Arthur Dent and Douglas Adams, as both had been discovered shortly after Adams&#x27; death in 2001. The fish species &quot;Bidenichthys beeblebroxi&quot; and moth species &quot;Erechthias beeblebroxi&quot; were both named after the character of Zaphod Beeblebrox.

Radiohead&#x27;s song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; was named after the character of Marvin the Paranoid Android. The band&#x27;s singer Thom Yorke used the character&#x27;s name jokingly, as the song was not about depression, but Yorke knew many of his fans felt that he should seem to be depressed. The album &quot;OK Computer&quot; which &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; appears on is also taken from &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot;, referencing how Zaphod would address the Heart of Gold&#x27;s onboard computer Eddie, and was selected by the band after listening to the radio plays while travelling on tour.

== Other &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot;-related books and stories ==
=== Related stories ===
A short story by Adams, &quot;Young Zaphod Plays It Safe&quot;, first appeared in 1986, in &quot;The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book&quot;, a special large-print compilation of different stories and pictures that raised money for the then-new Comic Relief charity in the UK. The story also appears in some of the omnibus editions of the trilogy, and in &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;. There are two versions of this story, one of which is slightly more explicit in its political commentary.

A novel, &quot;Douglas Adams&#x27; Starship Titanic: A Novel&quot;, written by Terry Jones, is based on Adams&#x27;s computer game of the same name, &quot;Douglas Adams&#x27;s Starship Titanic&quot;, which in turn is based on an idea from &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;. The idea concerns a luxury passenger starship that suffers &quot;sudden and gratuitous total existence failure&quot; on its maiden voyage.

Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, a character from &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;, also appears in a short story by Adams titled &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot; which appears in some early editions of &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;.

=== Published radio scripts ===
Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins collaborated on &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts&quot;, first published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. A tenth-anniversary (of the script book publication) edition was printed in 1995, and a twenty-fifth-anniversary (of the first radio series broadcast) edition was printed in 2003.

The 2004 series was produced by Above The Title Productions and the scripts were published in July 2005, with production notes for each episode. This second radio script book is entitled &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases&quot;. Douglas Adams gets the primary writer&#x27;s credit (as he wrote the original novels), and there is a foreword by Simon Jones, introductions by the producer and the director, and other introductory notes from other members of the cast.

<text>The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph written by the computer scientist Donald Knuth presenting programming algorithms and their analysis. Volumes 1–5 are intended to represent the central core of computer programming for sequential machines.

When Knuth began the project in 1962, he originally conceived of it as a single book with twelve chapters. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work began in earnest on Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting prompted by the second edition of Volume 2. Writing of the final copy of Volume 4A began in longhand in 2001, and the first online pre-fascicle, 2A, appeared later in 2001. The first published installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as Fascicle 2 in 2005.
The hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0–4, was published in 2011. Volume 4, Fascicle 6 (&quot;Satisfiability&quot;) was released in December 2015; Volume 4, Fascicle 5 (&quot;Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Backtracking; Dancing Links&quot;) was released in November 2019.

Volume 4B consists of material evolved from Fascicles 5 and 6. The manuscript was sent to the publisher on August 1, 2022, and the volume was published in September 2022.
Fascicle 7 (Constraint Satisfaction), planned for Volume 4C, was the subject of Knuth&#x27;s talk on August 3, 2022 and was published on February 5, 2025.

==History==
After winning a Westinghouse Talent Search scholarship, Knuth enrolled at the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University), where his performance was so outstanding that the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his completion of the bachelor&#x27;s degree. During his summer vacations, Knuth was hired by the Burroughs Corporation to write compilers, earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an entire year. Such exploits made Knuth a topic of discussion among the mathematics department, which included Richard S. Varga.

In January 1962, when he was a graduate student in the mathematics department at Caltech, Knuth was approached by Addison-Wesley to write a book about compiler design, and he proposed a larger scope. He came up with a list of twelve chapter titles the same day. In the summer of 1962 he worked on a FORTRAN compiler for UNIVAC, considering that he had &quot;sold my soul to the devil&quot; to develop a FORTRAN compiler after ALGOL developments with Burroughs. He remained as a consultant to Burroughs over the period 1960 to 1968 while writing Volume 1 &quot;Fundamental Algorithms&quot;.

During this time, he also developed a mathematical analysis of linear probing, which convinced him to present the material with a quantitative approach. After receiving his Ph.D. in June 1963, he began working on his manuscript, of which he finished his first draft in June 1965, at hand-written pages. He had assumed that about five hand-written pages would translate into one printed page, but his publisher said instead that about hand-written pages translated to one printed page. This meant he had approximately printed pages of material, which closely matches the size of the first three published volumes.

The first volume of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;, &quot;Fundamental Algorithms&quot;, took five years to complete between 1963 and 1968 while working at both Caltech and Burroughs.

Knuth&#x27;s dedication in Volume 1 reads:

This series of books is affectionately dedicated&lt;br&gt;to the Type 650 computer once installed at&lt;br&gt;Case Institute of Technology,&lt;br&gt;in remembrance of many pleasant evenings.

In the preface, he thanks first his wife Jill, then Burroughs for the use of B220 and B5500 computers in testing most of the programs, and Caltech, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.

Section 2.5 of &quot;Fundamental Algorithms&quot; is on Dynamic Storage Allocation. Parts of this are used in the Burroughs approach to memory management. Knuth claims credit for “The “boundary-tag” method, introduced in Section 2.5, was designed by the author in 1962 for use in a control program for the B5000 computer.”

Knuth received support from Richard S. Varga, who was the scientific adviser to the publisher. Varga was visiting Olga Taussky-Todd and John Todd at Caltech. With Varga&#x27;s enthusiastic endorsement, the publisher accepted Knuth&#x27;s expanded plans. In its expanded version, the book would be published in seven volumes, each with just one or two chapters. Due to the growth in Chapter 7, which was fewer than 100 pages of the 1965 manuscript, per Vol. 4A p. vi, the plan for Volume 4 has since expanded to include Volumes 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and possibly more.

In 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be typeset again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called hot type) was no longer available. In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with TEX, which is currently used for all volumes.

Another characteristic of the volumes is the variation in the difficulty of the exercises including a numerical rating varying from 0 to 50, where 0 is trivial, and 50 is an open question in contemporary research.

==Bounty for finding errors==
The offer of a so-called Knuth reward check worth &quot;one hexadecimal dollar&quot; (100HEX base 16 cents, in decimal, is $2.56) for any errors found, and the correction of these errors in subsequent printings, has contributed to the highly polished and still-authoritative nature of the work, long after its first publication.

==Assembly language in the book==
All examples in the books use a hypothetical language called &quot;MIX assembly language&quot; (MIXAL), which runs on &quot;a mythical computer called MIX&quot;. Currently, the MIX computer is being replaced by the MMIX computer, which is a RISC version. The conversion from MIX to MMIX was a large ongoing project for which Knuth solicited volunteers for help. Software such as GNU MDK exists to provide emulation of the MIX architecture. Knuth considers the use of assembly language necessary for the speed and memory usage of algorithms to be judged.

MIX was much like any computer then in existence, but nicer. The name ‘MIX’ is 1009 in Roman numerals and this is given by a formula involving series numbers of several computers of the time: (360 + 650 + 709 + U3 + SS80 + 1107 + 1604 + G2- + B220 + S2000 + 920 + 601 + H800 + PDP-4 + 11)/16 = 1009 or MIX. The name MMIX is 2009 in Roman numerals and Knuth claims MMIX is even nicer than MIX.

==Critical response==
Knuth was awarded the 1974 Turing Award &quot;for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms […], and in particular for his contributions to the &#x27;art of computer programming&#x27; through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title.&quot; &quot;American Scientist&quot; has included this work among &quot;100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science&quot;, referring to the twentieth century. Covers of the third edition of Volume 1 quote Bill Gates as saying, &quot;If you think you&#x27;re a really good programmer… read (Knuth&#x27;s) &quot;Art of Computer Programming&quot;… You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to it as &quot;the profession&#x27;s defining treatise&quot;.

<text>Tapas () are appetisers or snacks in Spanish cuisine. They can be combined to make a full meal and are served cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or hot (such as , which are battered, fried baby squid; or , spicy potatoes). In some bars and restaurants in Spain and across the globe, tapas have evolved into a sophisticated cuisine. In some Central American countries, such snacks are known as . In parts of Mexico, similar dishes are called &quot;botanas&quot;.

An individual appetizer (or single order of an item) is a .

== History ==
The word &quot;tapas&quot;, a plural, is derived from the Spanish verb &quot;tapar&quot;, &quot;to cover&quot;, a cognate of the English &quot;top&quot;. Multiple theories for the term&#x27;s use for appetizers exist.

One theory holds that in pre-19th-century Spain few innkeepers at &quot;posadas&quot;, &quot;albergues&quot; or &quot;bodegas&quot; offering meals and rooms for travellers could write and few travellers read, so guests were offered a sample of the dishes available on a &quot;tapa&quot; (“pot cover” in Spanish).

In another theory, offered by the &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;, the original tapas were thin slices of bread or meat which sherry drinkers in Andalusian taverns used to cover their glasses between sips. This was a practical measure meant to prevent fruit flies from hovering over the sweet sherry (see below for more explanations). The meat used to cover the sherry was normally ham or chorizo, which are both very salty and activate thirst. Because of this, bartenders and restaurant owners created a variety of snacks to serve with sherry, thus increasing their alcohol sales. The tapas eventually became as important as the sherry.

Tapas have evolved through Spanish history by incorporating new ingredients and influences. Most of the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by the Romans in 218 B.C., who introduced more extensive cultivation of the olive and irrigation methods following their arrival. The discovery of the New World brought the introduction of tomatoes, sweet and chili peppers, maize (corn), and potatoes, which were readily accepted and easily grown in Spain&#x27;s microclimates.

It has also been claimed that tapas originated in the south of Spain during the time of the Spanish Inquisition as a means of publicly identifying &quot;conversos&quot;, Jews who had converted to Christianity. Since tapas often consist in part of ham or other non-kosher foodstuffs, the reluctance of the &quot;conversos&quot; to eat whatever tapas dish was offered to them could be taken as a tacit admission that they had not abandoned their Jewish faith, thus tapas were a tool of the Spanish Inquisition.

There are many tapas competitions throughout Spain. Beginning in 2005 the city of Valladolid in Northwest Spain has hosted a national tapas competition each November. Interest in this event outside of Spain spurred the International School of Culinary Arts to hold an International Tapas Competition for Culinary Schools, starting in 2009. Various schools from around the world come to Spain annually to compete in it for the best tapa concept.

== Origin ==
Though the primary meaning of &quot;tapa &quot;is cover or lid&quot;,&quot; in Spain it has also become a term for this style of food. The origin of this new meaning is uncertain but there are several theories:

* The tapas tradition may have begun when king Alfonso X of Castile (1221–1284) recovered from an illness by drinking wine with small dishes between meals. After regaining his health, the king ordered that taverns would not be allowed to serve wine to customers unless it was accompanied by a small snack or &quot;tapa&quot;.
* Another popular and more modern explanation says that King Alfonso XIII (1886–1941) stopped by a famous tavern in Cádiz (an Andalusian city) where he ordered a glass of wine. The waiter covered the glass with a slice of cured ham before offering it to the king, in order to protect the wine from the blowing beach sand, as Cádiz is a windy place. The king, after drinking the wine and eating the ham, ordered another wine &quot;con la tapa&quot; (&quot;with the cover&quot;).
