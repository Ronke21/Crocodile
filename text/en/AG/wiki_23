<text>The Americas, sometimes collectively called America, are a landmass comprising the totality of North America and South America. When viewed as a single continent, the Americas or America is the 2nd largest continent right after Asia, and is the 3rd largest continent by population. The Americas make up most of the land in Earth&#x27;s Western Hemisphere and comprise the New World.

Along with their associated islands, the Americas cover 8% of Earth&#x27;s total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated by the American Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the Amazon, St. Lawrence River–Great Lakes, Mississippi, and La Plata basins. Since the Americas extend from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic tundra of Northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska, to the tropical rainforests in Central America and South America.

Humans first settled the Americas from Asia between 20,000 and 16,000 years ago. A second migration of Na-Dene speakers followed later from Asia. The subsequent migration of the Inuit into the neoarctic completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the Norse explorer Leif Erikson. However, the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned. The Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus from 1492 to 1504 resulted in permanent contact with European (and subsequently, other Old World) powers, which eventually led to the Columbian exchange and inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization whose effects and consequences persist to the present.

The Spanish presence involved the enslavement of large numbers of the indigenous population of America. Diseases introduced from Europe and West Africa devastated the indigenous peoples, and the European powers colonized the Americas. Mass emigration from Europe, including large numbers of indentured servants, and importation of African slaves largely replaced the indigenous peoples in much of the Americas. Decolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution in the 1770s and largely ended with the Spanish–American War in the late 1890s. Currently, almost all of the population of the Americas resides in independent countries; however, the legacy of the colonization and settlement by Europeans is that the Americas share many common cultural traits, most notably Christianity and the use of West European languages: primarily Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and, to a lesser extent, Dutch.

The Americas are home to more than a billion inhabitants, two-thirds of whom reside in the United States, Brazil, and Mexico. It is home to eight megacities (metropolitan areas with 10 million inhabitants or more): Greater Mexico City (21.2 million), São Paulo (21.2 million), New York City (19.7 million), Los Angeles (18.8 million), Buenos Aires (15.6 million), Rio de Janeiro (13.0 million), Bogotá (10.4 million), and Lima (10.1 million).

==Etymology and naming==

The name &quot;America&quot; was first recorded in 1507. A two-dimensional globe created by Martin Waldseemüller was the earliest recorded use of the term. The name was also used (together with the related term &quot;Amerigen&quot;) in the &quot;Cosmographiae Introductio&quot;, apparently written by Matthias Ringmann, in reference to South America. It was applied to both North and South America by Gerardus Mercator in 1538. &quot;America&quot; derives from , the Latin version of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci&#x27;s first name. 

The feminine form &quot;America&quot; was originally used to refer to the newly discovered continent, which is why it was accorded with the feminine names of the other continents: Asia, Africa, and Europa.

Since the 1950s, however, North America and South America have generally been considered by English speakers as separate continents, and taken together are called &quot;the Americas&quot;, or more rarely &quot;America&quot;. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally &quot;the continent of America&quot; in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular &quot;America&quot; in English commonly refers to the United States of America.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian era===

The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization during the Early Modern period. The term &quot;Pre-Columbian&quot; is used especially often in the context of the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas, such as those of Mesoamerica (Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacano, Zapotec, Mixtec, Aztec, Maya) and the Andean civilizations (Inca, Moche, Chavín, Muisca, Cañari).

Many pre-Columbian civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (–early 16th centuries), and are known only through archeological investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya, had their own written records. However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan, and much was destroyed in Christian pyres. Only a few hidden documents remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

====Settlement====

The first inhabitants migrated into the Americas from Asia. Habitation sites are known in Alaska and Yukon from at least 20,000 years ago, with suggested ages of up to 40,000 years. Beyond that, the specifics of the Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion. Widespread habitation of the Americas occurred after the Late Glacial Maximum, from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago.

The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the Beringia land bridge between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000–17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered during the Quaternary glaciation. These people are believed to have followed herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along &quot;ice-free corridors&quot; that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America. Evidence of the latter would since have been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of meters following the last ice age. Both routes may have been taken, although the genetic evidences suggests a single founding population. The micro-satellite diversity and distributions specific to South American Indigenous peoples indicates that certain populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.

A second migration occurred after the initial peopling of the Americas; Na Dene speakers found predominantly in North American groups at varying genetic rates with the highest frequency found among the Athabaskans at 42% derive from this second wave. Linguists and biologists have reached a similar conclusion based on analysis of Amerindian language groups and ABO blood group system distributions. Then the people of the Arctic small tool tradition, a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait moved into North America. The Arctic small tool tradition, a Paleo-Eskimo culture branched off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions of Greenland. The descendants of the Pre-Dorset cultural group, the Dorset culture was displaced by the final migrants from the Bering sea coast line, the Thule people (the ancestors of modern Inuit), by 1000 CE.

====Norse colonization====
Around the same time as the Inuit migrated into Greenland, Viking settlers began arriving in Greenland in 982 and Vinland shortly thereafter, establishing a settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, near the northernmost tip of Newfoundland. Contact between the Norse colonies and Europe was maintained, as James Watson Curran states:

===Large-scale European colonization===

Although there had been previous trans-oceanic contact, large-scale European colonization of the Americas began with the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The first Spanish settlement in the Americas was La Isabela in northern Hispaniola. This town was abandoned shortly after in favor of Santo Domingo de Guzmán, founded in 1496, the oldest American city of European foundation. This was the base from which the Spanish monarchy administered its new colonies and their expansion. Santo Domingo was subject to frequent raids by English and French pirates.

On the continent, Panama City on the Pacific coast of Central America, founded on August 15, 1519, played an important role, being the base for the Spanish conquest of South America. Conquistador Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón established San Miguel de Guadalupe, the first European settlement in what is now the United States, on the Pee Dee River in South Carolina. During the first half of the 16th century, Spanish colonists conducted raids throughout the Caribbean Basin, bringing captives from Central America, northern South America, and Florida back to Hispaniola and other Spanish settlements.

France, led by Jacques Cartier and Giovanni da Verrazzano, focused primarily on North America. English explorations of the Americas were led by Giovanni Caboto and Sir Walter Raleigh. The Dutch in New Netherland confined their operations to Manhattan Island, Long Island, the Hudson River Valley, and what later became New Jersey. The spread of new diseases brought by Europeans and African slaves killed many of the inhabitants of North America and South America, with a general population crash of Native Americans occurring in the mid-16th century, often well ahead of European contact. One of the most devastating diseases was smallpox.

European immigrants were often part of state-sponsored attempts to found colonies in the Americas. Migration continued as people moved to the Americas fleeing religious persecution or seeking economic opportunities. Millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas as slaves, prisoners or indentured servants.

Decolonization of the Americas began with the American Revolution and the Haitian Revolution in the late 1700s. This was followed by numerous Latin American wars of independence in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Gran Colombia, the United Provinces of Central America, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti, it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the Dominican Restoration War. The last violent episode of decolonization was the Cuban War of Independence which became the Spanish–American War, which resulted in the independence of Cuba in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States.

Peaceful decolonization began with the United States&#x27;s purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803, Florida from Spain in 1819, of Alaska from Russia in 1867, and the Danish West Indies from Denmark in 1916. Canada became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the Balfour Declaration of 1926, Statute of Westminster 1931, and ending with the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982. The Dominion of Newfoundland similarly achieved independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but relinquished self-rule in 1934. It was subsequently confederated with Canada in 1949.

The remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after World War II. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962, and Guyana and Barbados both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the Bahamas, Grenada, Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines all became independent of the United Kingdom, and Suriname became independent of the Netherlands. Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

==Geography==

===Extent===
The Americas make up most of the land in Earth&#x27;s Western Hemisphere. The northernmost point of the Americas is Kaffeklubben Island, which is the most northerly point of land on Earth. The southernmost undisputed point is Águila Islet, although the Antarctic islands of Southern Thule are sometimes taken into account. The mainland of the Americas is the world&#x27;s longest north-to-south landmass. The distance between its two polar extremities, Murchison Promontory on the Boothia Peninsula in northern Canada and Cape Froward in Chilean Patagonia, is roughly . The mainland&#x27;s most westerly point is the end of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska; Attu Island, further off the Alaskan coast to the west, is considered the westernmost point of the Americas. Ponta do Seixas in northeastern Brazil forms the easternmost extremity of the mainland, while Nordostrundingen, in Greenland, is the most easterly point of the continental shelf.

===Geology===
South America broke off from the west of the supercontinent Gondwana around 135 million years ago, forming its own continent. Around 15 million years ago, the collision of the Caribbean Plate and the Pacific Plate resulted in the emergence of a series of volcanoes along the border that created a number of islands. The gaps in the archipelago of Central America filled in with material eroded off North America and South America, plus new land created by continued volcanism. By three million years ago, the continents of North America and South America were linked by the Isthmus of Panama, thereby forming the single landmass of the Americas. The Great American Interchange resulted in many species being spread across the Americas, such as the cougar, porcupine, opossums, armadillos, and hummingbirds.

===Topography===
The geography of the western Americas is dominated by the American Cordillera, with the Andes running along the west coast of South America and the Rocky Mountains and other North American Cordillera ranges running along the western side of North America. The Appalachian Mountains run along the east coast of North America from Alabama to Newfoundland. North of the Appalachians, the Arctic Cordillera runs along the eastern coast of Canada.

The largest mountain ranges are the Andes and Rocky Mountains. The Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range reach similar altitudes as the Rocky Mountains, but are significantly smaller. In North America, the greatest number of fourteeners are in the United States, and more specifically in the US state of Colorado. The highest peaks of the Americas are located in the Andes, with Aconcagua of Argentina being the highest; in North America Denali (Mount McKinley) in the US state of Alaska is the tallest.

Between its coastal mountain ranges, North America has vast flat areas. The Interior Plains spread over much of the continent, with low relief. The Canadian Shield covers almost 5 million km2 of North America and is generally quite flat. Similarly, the north-east of South America is covered by the flat Amazon basin. The Brazilian Highlands on the east coast are fairly smooth but show some variations in landform, while farther south the Gran Chaco and Pampas are broad lowlands.

===Climate===
The climate of the Americas varies significantly from region to region. Tropical rainforest climate occurs in the latitudes of the Amazon, American cloud forests, southeastern Florida and Darién Gap. In the Rocky Mountains and Andes, dry and continental climates are observed. Often the higher altitudes of these mountains are snow-capped.

Southeastern North America is well known for its occurrence of tornadoes and hurricanes, of which the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the United States&#x27; Tornado Alley, as well as in the southerly Dixie Alley in the North American late-winter and early spring seasons. Often parts of the Caribbean are exposed to the violent effects of hurricanes. These weather systems are formed by the collision of dry, cool air from Canada and wet, warm air from the Atlantic.

===Hydrology===
With coastal mountains and interior plains, the Americas have several large river basins that drain the continents. The largest river basin in North America is that of the Mississippi, covering the second-largest watershed on the planet. The Mississippi–Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the United States, most of the Great Plains, and large areas between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. The Mississippi–Missouri is the fourth-longest river system and has the tenth-greatest discharge in the world.

In North America, to the east of the Appalachian Mountains, there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean, such as the Hudson, Saint John, and Savannah rivers. A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into Hudson Bay; the largest being the Churchill River. On the west coast of North America, the main rivers are the Colorado, Columbia, Yukon, Fraser, and Sacramento rivers.

The Colorado River drains much of the Southern Rockies and parts of the Basin and Range Province. The river flows approximately into the Gulf of California, during which over time it has carved out natural phenomena such as the Grand Canyon and created phenomena such as the Salton Sea. The Columbia is a large river, long, in central western North America and is the most powerful river on the West Coast of the Americas. In the far northwest of North America, the Yukon drains much of the Alaskan peninsula and flows from parts of Yukon and the Northwest Territory to the Pacific. Draining to the Arctic Ocean of Canada, the Mackenzie River drains waters from the Arctic Great Lakes of Arctic Canada, as opposed to the St Lawrence River that drains the Great Lakes of southern Canada into the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie River is the largest in Canada and drains .

The largest river basin in South America is that of the Amazon, which has the highest volume flow of any river on Earth. The second largest watershed of South America is that of the Paraná River, which covers about .

===Ecology===
North America and South America began to develop a shared population of flora and fauna around 2.5 million years ago, when continental drift brought the two continents into contact via the Isthmus of Panama. Initially, the exchange of biota was roughly equal, with North American genera migrating into South America in about the same proportions as South American genera migrated into North America. This exchange is known as the Great American Interchange. The exchange became lopsided after roughly a million years, with the total spread of South American genera into North America far more limited in scope than the spread of North American genera into South America.

==Countries and territories==
There are 35 sovereign states in the Americas, as well as an autonomous country of Denmark, three overseas departments of France, three overseas collectivities of France, and one uninhabited territory of France, eight overseas territories of the United Kingdom, three constituent countries of the Netherlands, three public bodies of the Netherlands, two unincorporated territories of the United States, and one uninhabited territory of the United States.

==Demography==

===Population===
In 2021 the total population of the Americas was about 1.03 billion people, divided as follows:
* North America: 596.6 million (includes Central America and the Caribbean)
* South America: 434.3 million

===Largest urban centers===
There are three urban centers that each hold titles for being the largest population area based on the three main demographic concepts:
* City proper
:A city proper is the locality with legally fixed boundaries and an administratively recognized urban status that is usually characterized by some form of local government.
* Urban area
:An urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it. Urban areas may be cities, towns or conurbations, but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets. Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization and do not include large swaths of rural land, as do metropolitan areas.
* Metropolitan area
:Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities &quot;plus intervening rural land&quot; that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.

In accordance with these definitions, the three largest population centers in the Americas are: Mexico City, anchor to the largest metropolitan area in the Americas; New York City, anchor to the largest urban area in the Americas; and São Paulo, the largest city proper in the Americas. All three cities maintain Alpha classification and large scale influence.

=== Ethnology ===
The population of the Americas is made up of the descendants of four large ethnic groups and their combinations.
* The Indigenous peoples of the Americas, being Amerindians and Inuit-Yupik-Unangan.
* Those of European ancestry, mainly Spanish, English, Irish, Portuguese, German, Italian, French, and Dutch.
* Those of African ancestry, mainly of West African descent.
* Asians, that is, those of East Asian, South Asian, and Southeast Asian ancestry.
* Mestizos (Métis people in Canada), those of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry.
* Mulattoes, people of mixed African and European ancestry.
* Zambos (Spanish) or Cafuzos (Portuguese), those of mixed African and Indigenous ancestry.

The majority of the population lives in Latin America, named for its predominant cultures, rooted in Latin Europe (including the two dominant languages, Spanish and Portuguese, both Romance languages), more specifically in the Iberian nations of Portugal and Spain (hence the use of the term Ibero-America as a synonym). Latin America is typically contrasted with Anglo-America, where English, a Germanic language, is prevalent, and which comprises Canada (with the exception of Francophone Canada rooted in Latin Europe [France]—see Quebec and Acadia) and the United States. Both countries are located in North America, with cultures deriving predominantly from British and other Germanic roots.

===Black population===
The transatlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to the territories of the Americas under the colonial rule of European powers. In South America, Portugal played a significant role in the trafficking of enslaved Africans, with estimates suggesting that around 40% of all Africans forcibly brought to the Americas were taken to Brazil alone, to work primarily in sugar cane plantations, mining, and agricultural endeavors. In North America, the British Empire was heavily involved in the transatlantic slave trade, with the establishment of colonies such as Virginia, where enslaved Africans were primarily used as labor in tobacco plantations and later in other agricultural and domestic sectors. This system perpetuated for centuries, shaping the socio-economic landscape of all nations of the hemisphere.

After the Haitian Revolution led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, which started in 1791 and was the only successful slave revolt in history, the world&#x27;s first black republic was established. It started with the massacre of the white population, between 3,000 and 5,000 white men and women of all ages were killed. Dessalines declared:
===Religion===
The most prevalent faiths in the Americas are as follows:
* Christianity (86 percent)
** Roman Catholicism: Practiced by 69 percent of the Latin American population (61 percent in Brazil whose Roman Catholic population of 134 million is the greatest of any nation&#x27;s), approximately 24 percent of the United States&#x27; population and about 39 percent of Canada&#x27;s.
** Protestantism: Practiced mostly in the United States, where half of the population are Protestant, Canada, with slightly more than a quarter of the population, and Greenland; there is a growing contingent of Evangelical and Pentecostal movements in predominantly Catholic Latin America.
** Eastern Orthodoxy: Found mostly in the United States (1 percent) and Canada; this Christian group is growing faster than many other Christian groups in Canada and now represents roughly 3 percent of the Canadian population.
** Non-denominational Christians and other Christians (some 1,000 different Christian denominations and sects practiced in the Americas).
* Irreligion: About 12 percent, including atheists and agnostics, as well as those who profess some form of spirituality but do not identify themselves as members of any organized religion.
* Islam: Together, Muslims constitute about 1 percent of the North American population and 0.3 percent of all Latin Americans. It is practiced by 3 percent of Canadians and 0.6 percent of the U.S. population. Argentina has the largest Muslim population in Latin America with up to 600,000 persons, or 1.5 percent of the population.
* Judaism: Practiced by 2 percent of North Americans—approximately 2.5 percent of the U.S. population and 1.2 percent of Canadians—as well as 0.23 percent of Latin Americans. Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America with 200,000 members.

Other faiths include Buddhism; Hinduism; Sikhism; Baháʼí Faith; a wide variety of indigenous religions, many of which can be categorized as animistic; new age religions and many African and African-derived religions. Syncretic faiths can also be found throughout the Americas.


===Languages===

Various languages are spoken in the Americas. Some are of European origin, others are spoken by indigenous peoples or are the mixture of various languages like the different creoles.

The most widely spoken first language in the Americas is Spanish, followed by English and Portuguese. The dominant language of Latin America is Spanish, though the most populous nation in Latin America, Brazil, speaks Portuguese. Small enclaves of French-, Dutch- and English-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in French Guiana, Suriname, and Belize and Guyana respectively. Haitian Creole is dominant in the nation of Haiti, where French is also spoken. Native languages are more prominent in Latin America than in Anglo-America, with Nahuatl, Quechua, Aymara, and Guaraní as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. Creole languages other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.

The dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in Canada, where it is the predominant language in Quebec and an official language in New Brunswick along with English. It is also an important language in Louisiana, and in parts of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the Southwestern United States, which formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, especially in California and New Mexico, where a distinct variety of Spanish spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the United States because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.

The nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.

Most of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as Papiamento, which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native Arawak, various African languages, and, more recently English. The lingua franca Portuñol, a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries. More specifically, Riverense Portuñol is spoken by around 100,000 people in the border regions of Brazil and Uruguay. Because of immigration, there are many communities where other languages are spoken from all parts of the world, especially in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay—very important destinations for immigrants.

== Culture ==
=== Sports ===

Baseball is one of the most popular sports in the Americas, having spread through the hemisphere after the growth of US influence in the late 19th century. It overtook cricket, a fellow bat-and-ball sport spread by earlier British influence, in most places outside of the Commonwealth Caribbean. Other American sports, such as basketball, have grown throughout the region over time.

==Terminology==

=== History ===

The region was initially termed America or New India on the Mercator maps.

===English===
Speakers of English generally refer to the landmasses of North America and South America as &quot;the Americas&quot;, the &quot;Western Hemisphere&quot;, or the &quot;New World&quot;. The adjective &quot;American&quot; may be used to indicate something pertaining to the Americas, but this term is primarily used in English to indicate something pertaining to the United States. Some non-ambiguous alternatives exist, such as the adjective &quot;Pan-American&quot;, or &quot;New Worlder&quot; as a demonym for a resident of the closely related New World. Use of &quot;America&quot; in the hemispherical sense is sometimes retained, or can occur when translated from other languages. For example, the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) in Paris maintains a single continental association for &quot;America&quot;, represented by one of the five Olympic rings.

American essayist H. L. Mencken said, &quot;The Latin-Americans use Norteamericano in formal writing, but, save in Panama, prefer nicknames in colloquial speech.&quot; To avoid &quot;American&quot; one can use constructed terms in their languages derived from &quot;United States&quot; or even &quot;North America&quot;. In Canada, its southern neighbor is often referred to as &quot;the United States&quot;, &quot;the U.S.A.&quot;, or (informally) &quot;the States&quot;, while U.S. citizens are generally referred to as &quot;Americans&quot;. Most Canadians resent being referred to as &quot;Americans&quot;.

===Spanish===
In Spanish, &quot;América&quot; is a single continent composed of the subcontinents of &quot;América del Sur&quot; and &quot;América del Norte&quot;, the land bridge of &quot;América Central&quot;, and the islands of the &quot;Antillas&quot;. &quot;Americano&quot; or &quot;americana&quot; in Spanish refers to a person from &quot;América&quot; in a similar way that in which &quot;europeo&quot; or &quot;europea&quot; refers to a person from &quot;Europa&quot;. The terms &quot;sudamericano/a&quot;, &quot;centroamericano/a&quot;, &quot;antillano/a&quot; and &quot;norteamericano/a&quot; can be used to more specifically refer to the location where a person may live.

Citizens of the United States of America are normally referred to by the term &quot;estadounidense&quot; (rough literal translation: &quot;United Statesian&quot;) instead of &quot;americano&quot; or &quot;americana&quot; which is discouraged, and the country&#x27;s name itself is officially translated as &quot;Estados Unidos de América&quot; (United States of America), commonly abbreviated as &quot;Estados Unidos&quot; (EEUU). Also, the term &quot;norteamericano&quot; (North American) may refer to a citizen of the United States. This term is primarily used to refer to citizens of the United States, and less commonly to those of other North American countries.

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese, &quot;América&quot; is a single continent composed of &quot;América do Sul&quot; (South America), &quot;América Central&quot; (Central America) and &quot;América do Norte&quot; (North America). It can be ambiguous, as &quot;América&quot; can be used to refer to the United States of America, but is avoided in print and formal environments.

===French===
In French, the word &quot;américain&quot; may be used for things relating to the Americas; however, similar to English, it is most often used for things relating to the United States, with the term &quot;états-unien&quot; sometimes used for clarity. &quot;Panaméricain&quot; may be used as an adjective to refer to the Americas without ambiguity. French speakers may use the noun &quot;Amérique&quot; to refer to the whole landmass as one continent, or two continents, &quot;Amérique du Nord&quot; and &quot;Amérique du Sud&quot;. In French, &quot;Amérique&quot; is seldom used to refer to the United States, leading to some ambiguity when it is. Similar to English usage, &quot;les Amériques&quot; or &quot;des Amériques&quot; is used to refer unambiguously to the Americas.

===Dutch===
In Dutch, the word &quot;Amerika&quot; mostly refers to the United States. Although the United States is equally often referred to as &quot;de Verenigde Staten&quot; (&quot;the United States&quot;) or &quot;de VS&quot; (&quot;the US&quot;), &quot;Amerika&quot; relatively rarely refers to the Americas, but it is the only commonly used Dutch word for the Americas. This often leads to ambiguity; and to stress that something concerns the Americas as a whole, Dutch uses a combination, namely &quot;Noord- en Zuid-Amerika&quot; (North and South America).

Latin America and Central America are generally referred to as &quot;Latijns Amerika&quot; and &quot;Midden-Amerika&quot; respectively.

The adjective &quot;Amerikaans&quot; is most often used for things or people relating to the United States. There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas. Dutch uses the local alternative for things relating to elsewhere in the Americas, such as &quot;Argentijns&quot; for Argentine, etc.

<doc id="29834" wikidata="Q627333" url="?curid=29834" title="The Time Machine">
<text>The Time Machine is an 1895 dystopian post-apocalyptic science fiction novella by H. G. Wells about a Victorian scientist known as the Time Traveller who travels to the year 802,701. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time. The term &quot;time machine&quot;, coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.

Utilizing a frame story set in then-present Victorian England, Wells&#x27; text focuses on a recount of the otherwise anonymous Time Traveller&#x27;s journey into the far future. A work of future history and speculative evolution, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; is interpreted in modern times as a commentary on the increasing inequality and class divisions of Wells&#x27; era, which he projects as giving rise to two separate human species: the fair, childlike Eloi, and the savage, simian Morlocks, distant descendants of the contemporary upper and lower classes respectively. It is believed that Wells&#x27; depiction of the Eloi as a race living in plenitude and abandon was inspired by the utopic romance novel &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890), though Wells&#x27; universe in the novel is notably more savage and brutal.

In his 1931 preface to the book, Wells wrote that &quot;The Time Machine&quot; seemed &quot;a very undergraduate performance to its now mature writer, as he looks over it once more&quot;, though he states that &quot;the writer feels no remorse for this youthful effort&quot;. However, critics have praised the novella&#x27;s handling of its thematic concerns, with Marina Warner writing that the book was the most significant contribution to understanding before Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, with the novel &quot;[conveying] how close he felt to the melancholy seeker after a door that he once opened on to a luminous vision and could never find again&quot;.

&quot;The Time Machine&quot; has been adapted into two feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions and many comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.

==History==
Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot; (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

He frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, but in response to a request by W. E. Henley, the editor of &quot;National Observer&quot;, he rewrote &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot; into a series of seven loosely connected and fictionalized essays which were anonymously published in the newspaper from 17 March to 23 June 1894. The series was never completed as Henley stepped down from his role as editor in &quot;National Observer&quot;. With his encouragement, Wells continued to work on the story, and at the end of the year, when Henley was given the position as editor of Heinemann&#x27;s periodical &quot;The New Review&quot;, he arranged for the story to be published there in serialized form in the January to May 1895 editions instead, for which Wells was paid £100 (equal to about £ today). Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript) on 7 May 1895; Heinemann published a British edition on 29 May. These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the &quot;Holt text&quot; and &quot;Heinemann text&quot;, respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.

The story reflects Wells&#x27;s own socialist political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about industrial relations. It is also influenced by Ray Lankester&#x27;s theories about social degeneration and shares many elements with Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s novel &quot;Vril, the Power of the Coming Race&quot; (1871). It is also thought that Wells&#x27;s Eloi race shares many features with the works of other English socialists, most notably William Morris and his work &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890), in which money is depicted as irrelevant and work is undertaken merely as a form of pleasure. Other science fiction works of the period, including Edward Bellamy&#x27;s novel &quot;Looking Backward: 2000–1887&quot; (1888) and the later film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), dealt with similar themes. In his later reassessment of the book, published as the 1931 preface to &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, Wells wrote that the text has &quot;lasted as long as the diamond-framed safety bicycle, which came in at about the date of its first publication&quot;, and is &quot;assured it will outlive him&quot;, attesting to the power of the book.

Based on Wells&#x27;s personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father&#x27;s shop. Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with tunnels below, where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters. A medical journal published in 1905 would focus on these living quarters for servants in poorly ventilated dark basements. In his early teens, Wells became a draper&#x27;s apprentice, having to work in a basement for hours on end.

This work is an early example of the Dying Earth subgenre. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places &quot;The Time Machine&quot; within the realm of eschatology; that is, the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.

Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston re-published the book in 2000, paired with &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate a new cover art.

==Plot==
A Victorian Englishman, identified only as the &quot;Time Traveller&quot;, tells his weekly dinner guests that he has experimental verification of a machine that can travel through time. He shows them what he says is a small model, and they watch it disappear. He says he has a big machine nearly finished in his laboratory, in which a person could travel through time. At dinner the following week, a weary, bedraggled Traveller recounts to his guests what he experienced on his journey to the future.

In the new narrative, the Time Traveller goes into the future, observing things moving in quick motion around him. He sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Traveller stops in A.D. 802,701, and meets the Eloi, a society of small, childlike humanoids. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet deteriorating buildings, and adhere to a fruit-based diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline. They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, particularly moonless nights. They give no response to nocturnal disappearances, possibly because they are so afraid of them. After exploring the area around the Eloi&#x27;s residences, the Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking what was once London and finds the ruins of what once was a metropolis. He concludes that the entire planet became a garden, with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior, and that communism has at last been achieved. He also theorizes that intelligence springs from necessity; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

Returning to the site where he arrived, the Traveller finds his machine missing; he is confident that it at least has not traveled through time, as he had removed its levers. Later, he encounters the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Deducing that they must have taken his time machine, he explores one of many &quot;wells&quot; that lead to the Morlocks&#x27; dwellings and discovers them operating the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He realizes that the Morlocks control and feed upon the Eloi. The Traveller speculates that the human race has diverged into two species: the favored aristocracy has become the Eloi, and their mechanical servants have become the Morlocks.

Meanwhile, he rescues Eloi Weena from drowning, as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight. The Traveller takes Weena with him on an expedition to &quot;The Palace of Green Porcelain&quot;, a distant structure which turns out to be a derelict museum. Here, the Traveller finds fresh matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to recover his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time to save her from the horrors of the future world. Because the tiring journey back to Weena&#x27;s home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are eventually attacked by Morlocks, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he left behind them to repel the Morlocks turns into a forest fire; Weena and the Morlocks are lost in the blaze.

The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the machine as bait to capture the distraught Traveller, not understanding that he can use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before travelling further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There, he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: crab-like creatures wandering blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in a world covered in lichenoid vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth&#x27;s rotation cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last living things die out.

Overwhelmed, he returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two unusual white flowers Weena put in his pocket.

The original narrator relates that he returned to the Traveller&#x27;s house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. After waiting for three years, however, the narrator says that the Traveller has not returned.

==Deleted text==
A section from the thirteenth chapter of the serial published in &quot;New Review&quot; (May 1895, partway down p. 577 to p. 580, line 29) does not appear in either of the 1895 editions of the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells&#x27;s editor, William Ernest Henley, who wanted Wells to &quot;oblige your editor&quot; by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of &quot;the ultimate degeneracy&quot; of humanity. &quot;There was a slight struggle,&quot; Wells later recalled, &quot;between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little &#x27;writing&#x27; into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text.&quot; This portion of the story was published elsewhere as &quot;&quot; (1940) and &quot;&quot;. The deleted text was also published by Forrest J Ackerman in an issue of the American edition of &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot;.

The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller&#x27;s escape from the Morlocks. He finds himself in the distant future in a frost-covered moorland with simple grasses and black bushes, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling kangaroos. He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like arthropod approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid. The Dover Press and Easton Press editions of the novella restore this deleted segment.

==Scholarship==
Significant scholarly commentary on &quot;The Time Machine&quot; began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells&#x27;s early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi&#x27;s &quot;The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances&quot;) and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas&#x27;s &quot;The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians&quot;). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.

===Academic publications===
A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella&#x27;s centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as &quot;H.G. Wells&#x27;s Perennial Time Machine&quot;. This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master&#x27;s and Ph.D. level: &quot;H.G. Wells&#x27;s The Time Machine: A Reference Guide&quot;.

The scholarly journal &quot;The Wellsian&quot; has published around twenty articles on &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, and a U.S. academic journal &quot;The Undying Fire&quot;, devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002.

===Subtext of the names &quot;Eloi&quot; and &quot;Morlock&quot;===
The name &quot;Eloi&quot; is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the Old Testament.

Wells&#x27;s source for the name &quot;Morlock&quot; is less clear. It may refer to the Canaanite god Moloch associated with child sacrifice. The name Morlock may also be a play on &quot;&quot; – what miners might call themselves – or a Scots word for rubbish, or a reference to the Morlacchi community in Dalmatia.

===Symbols===
&quot;The Time Machine&quot; can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.

* The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of Oedipus who gives a riddle that he must first solve before he can pass. The Sphinx appeared on the cover of the first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers.
* The white flowers can symbolize Weena&#x27;s devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine. They are the only proof that the Time Traveller&#x27;s story is true.
* Fire symbolizes civilization: the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire.

==Adaptations==
=== Radio and audio ===
====&quot;Escape&quot; radio broadcasts====
The CBS radio anthology &quot;Escape&quot; adapted &quot;The Time Machine&quot; twice, in 1948 starring Jeff Corey, and again in 1950 starring Lawrence Dobkin as the traveller. A script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used in both episodes. The Time Traveller was named Dudley and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they travelled to the year 100,080.

====1994 Alien Voices audio drama====
In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring Leonard Nimoy as the Time Traveller (named John in this adaptation) and John de Lancie as David Filby. John de Lancie&#x27;s children, Owen de Lancie and Keegan de Lancie, played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.

==== 7th Voyage ====
In 2000, Alan Young read &quot;The Time Machine&quot; for 7th Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells&#x27;s novella.

====2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast====
Robert Glenister starred as the Time Traveller, with William Gaunt as H. G. Wells in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by Jeremy Mortimer as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22 February 2009 on BBC Radio 3 and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.

The other cast members were:
*Donnla Hughes as Martha
*Gunnar Cauthery as Young H. G. Wells
*Stephen Critchlow as Filby, friend of the young Wells
*Chris Pavlo as Bennett, friend of the young Wells
*Manjeet Mann as Mrs. Watchett, the Traveller&#x27;s housemaid
*Jill Crado as Weena, one of the Eloi and the Traveller&#x27;s partner
*Robert Lonsdale, Inam Mirza, and Dan Starkey as other characters

The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the US journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of Broadcasting House during the Blitz. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30 million AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.

====Big Finish====
On 5 September 2017, Big Finish Productions released an adaptation of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. This adaptation was written by Marc Platt and starred Ben Miles as the Time Traveller.

Platt explained in an interview that adapting &quot;The Time Machine&quot; to audio was not much different from writing &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and that he could see where some of the roots of early &quot;Doctor Who&quot; came from.

=== Film adaptations ===

==== 1949 BBC teleplay ====
The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from Alexandra Palace on 25 January 1949 by the BBC, which starred Russell Napier as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.

====1960 film====
In 1960, the novella was made into a US science fiction film, also known promotionally as &quot;H.G. Wells&#x27;s The Time Machine&quot;. The film starred Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux. The film was produced and directed by George Pal, who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. The film won an Academy Award for time-lapse photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly.

In 1993, Rod Taylor hosted &quot;Time Machine: The Journey Back&quot; reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal&#x27;s classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were Academy Award-winners special effect artists Wah Chang and Gene Warren.

====1978 television film====

Sunn Classic Pictures produced a television film version of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; as a part of their &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells&#x27;s story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US defence contractor, &quot;the Mega Corporation&quot;. Dr. Neil Perry (John Beck), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega&#x27;s most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation). Perry&#x27;s skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could destroy Los Angeles. His reputation secures a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project. Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project.

====2002 film====
The 1960 film was remade in 2002, starring Guy Pearce as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, Mark Addy as his colleague David Philby, Sienna Guillory as Alex&#x27;s ill-fated fiancée Emma, Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchit, and Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was Alan Young, who featured in the 1960 film. (H.G. Wells himself can also be said to have a &quot;cameo&quot; appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex&#x27;s home, near the front door.)

The film was directed by Wells&#x27;s great-grandson Simon Wells, with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of paradoxes and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown New York City, where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on &#x27;Practical Application of Time Travel;&#x27; first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon.

It was met with mixed reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the Fresnel lenses common to lighthouses. (In Wells&#x27;s original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his &#x27;scientific papers on optics&#x27;.) Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by Samantha Mumba, who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a &quot;stone language&quot; that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot.

=== Derivative work ===
====&quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979 film)====

In &quot;Time After Time&quot;, H.G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 TV series of the same name.

===Comics===
&quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; was the first to adapt &quot;The Time Machine&quot; into a comic book format, issuing an American edition in July 1956.

The Classics Illustrated version was published in French by &quot;Classiques Illustres&quot; in Dec 1957, and &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and &quot;Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja&quot; (a Finnish edition) in November 1957. There were also &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008.

In 1976, Marvel Comics published a new version of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, as #2 in their &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; series, with art by Alex Niño. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by Pendulum Press as part of their &quot;Pendulum Now Age Classics&quot; series; it was colorized and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.)

In 1977, Polish painter Waldemar Andrzejewski adapted the novel as a 22-page comic book, written in Polish by Antoni Wolski.

From April 1990, Eternity Comics published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, written by Bill Spangler and illustrated by John Ross — this was collected as a trade paperback graphic novel in 1991.

In 2018, US imprint Insight Comics published an adaptation of the novel, as part of their &quot;H. G. Wells&quot; series of comic books.

In 2024 the time traveler will appear in IDW&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&#x27;s Monsterpiece Theatere&quot; alongside Sherlock Holmes, Dracula and Gatsby. where they all team up to battle Godzilla.

==Sequels by other authors==
Wells&#x27;s novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on Wells&#x27;s story include:

* &quot;La Belle Valence&quot; by Théo Varlet and André Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of World War I soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of Valencia in the 14th century. Translated by Brian Stableford as &quot;Timeslip Troopers&quot; (2012). 
* &quot;Die Rückkehr der Zeitmaschine&quot; (1946) by Egon Friedell was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. After visiting a futuristic 1995 where London is in the sky and the weather is created by companies, as well as the year 2123 where he meets two Egyptians who study history using intuition instead of actual science, the time traveller, who is given the name James MacMorton, travels to the past and ends up weeks before the time machine was built, causing it to disappear. He is forced to use the miniature version of his time machine, which already existed at that time, to send telegraphic messages through time to a friend (the author), instructing him to send him things that will allow him to build a new machine. After returning to the present, he tells his friend what happened. The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as &quot;The Return of the Time Machine&quot; (1972, DAW).
*&quot;The Hertford Manuscript&quot; by Richard Cowper, first published in 1976. It features a &quot;manuscript&quot;, which reports the Time Traveller&#x27;s activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27 August 1665, in London during the outbreak of the Great Plague of London. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with Robert Hooke. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18 June 1894.
* &quot;The Space Machine&quot; by Christopher Priest, first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth&#x27;s trajectory through space. In Priest&#x27;s book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on Mars, just before the start of the invasion described in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.
* &quot;Morlock Night&quot; by K. W. Jeter, first published in 1979. A steampunk fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller&#x27;s machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find – and destroy – the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history.
* &quot;Time Machine II&quot; by George Pal and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George&#x27;s journals, and the Time Machine&#x27;s original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future. Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a second sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal&#x27;s film version of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, using the original actors. This second sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal&#x27;s first, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in World War I. This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen. He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the distant future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma – allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever.
* &quot;The Man Who Loved Morlocks&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Truth about Weena&quot; (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by David J. Lake. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller&#x27;s return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution.
* &quot;The Time Ships&quot;, by Stephen Baxter, was first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original&#x27;s publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller&#x27;s desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the multiverse as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind&#x27;s far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells&#x27;s story in the names of characters and chapters.
* In &quot;The Richmond Enigma&quot; by John DeChancie, Sherlock Holmes investigates the disappearance of the Time Traveller, a contemporary and, in this story, a distant relative. The intervention of Holmes and Watson succeeds in calling back the missing Time Traveller, who has resolved to prevent the time machine&#x27;s existence, out of concern for the danger it could make possible. The story appeared in &quot;Sherlock Holmes in Orbit&quot; (1995)
* &quot;The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel&quot; by Joe R. Lansdale, first published in &quot;The Long Ones&quot; (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider.
* The 2003 short story &quot;On the Surface&quot; by Robert J. Sawyer begins with this quote from the Wells original: &quot;I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.&quot; In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world.
* The Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story &quot;Allan and the Sundered Veil&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill, which acts as a prequel to &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One&quot;. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons Allan Quatermain, John Carter, and Randolph Carter.
* David Haden&#x27;s novelette &quot;The Time Machine: A Sequel&quot; (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated.
* Simon Baxter&#x27;s novel &quot;The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks&quot; (2010) imagines a steampunk/cyberpunk future in which the British Empire has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future.
* Hal Colebatch&#x27;s &quot;Time-Machine Troopers&quot; (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him Robert Baden-Powell, the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and Winston Churchill are also featured as characters.
*Paul Schullery&#x27;s &quot;The Time Traveller&#x27;s Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity&quot; (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years&#x27; absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity&#x27;s catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.
* The &quot;Great Illustrated Classics&quot; in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells&#x27;s novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller&#x27;s adventure: Stopping in 2200 AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a technocratic society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe.
* &quot;Beyond the Time Machine&quot; by Burt Libe (2002). The first of two Time Machine sequels written by US writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of the Time Traveller: where he finally settles down, including his rescue of Weena and his subsequent family with her. Highlighted are exploits of his daughters Narra and her younger sister Belinda; coping with their 33rd-Century existence; considering their unusual past and far-Future heritage. Doing some time travelling of their own, the daughters revisit 802,701 AD, discovering that the so-called dual-specie Eloi and Morlock inhabitants actually are far more complex and complicated than their father&#x27;s initial appraisal.
* &quot;Tangles in Time&quot; by Burt Libe (2005). The second of two Time Machine sequels written by American writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of younger daughter Belinda, now grown at age 22. Her father (the original Time Traveller) has just died from old age, and she and Weena (her mother) now must decide what to do with the rest of their lives. Weena makes a very unusual decision, leaving Belinda to search for her own place in time. Also, with further time travel, she locates her two long-lost brothers, previously thought to be dead; she also meets and rescues a young man from the far future, finding herself involved in a very confusing relationship.
* &quot;Epilogue: Time Machine Chronicles&quot; is a 2010 sequel by Jaime V. Batista

==The Time Traveller==

Although the Time Traveller&#x27;s real name is never given in the original novella, other sources have named him:

*The 1960 film named him H. George Wells, although he was only called George in dialogue.
*In the 1978 telefilm version of the story, the Time Traveller (this time a modern-day American) is named Dr. Neil Perry.
*H.G. Wells&#x27; great-grandson, Simon Wells, directed a 2002 remake where the Time Traveller&#x27;s name is Alexander Hartdegen.
*In &quot;The Time Ships&quot;, Stephen Baxter&#x27;s sequel to &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, the Time Traveller encounters his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self&#x27;s knowledge of his real names: &quot;I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. &quot;No. I will use—if you will permit—&quot;Moses&quot;.&quot; He took a deep pull on his brandy, and gazed at me with genuine anger in his grey eyes. &quot;How do you know about that?&quot; Moses—my hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school—and which I had kept a secret since leaving home!&quot; This is a reference to H.G. Wells&#x27;s story &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot;, the story which grew into &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells&#x27;s first inventor graces another character in Baxter&#x27;s book (see above).
*&quot;Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life&quot; by Philip José Farmer gives the Time Traveller&#x27;s name as Bruce Clarke Wildman.
*&quot;The Rook&quot; comic book series gives the Time Traveller&#x27;s name as Adam Dane.
*In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic strip story &quot;The Eternal Present&quot;, the character of Theophilus Tolliver is implied to be the Time Traveller of Wells&#x27;s novella. Also featured in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is Wells, himself, appearing in the television serial &quot;Timelash&quot;. The events of this story are portrayed as having inspired Wells to write &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.
*In Episode 11, Season 1, of US television series &quot; Legends of Tomorrow&quot; the team travels back in time to the Old West in hopes to hide from the Time Masters. During their stay there the character Martin Stein saves a boy&#x27;s life with modern medicine. After a fighting scene that reveals their whole team to be from the future, Martin Stein learns that the name of the boy he saved is Herbert George Wells. &quot;You&#x27;re H.G. Wells?&quot; he asks him, the boy replies &quot;H.G.Wells, I like that name&quot;, implying that they inspired the stories that he wrote and also the name he goes by.
*&quot;The Hertford Manuscript&quot; by Richard Cowper names the Time Traveller as Dr. Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18 June 1894, and who was part of the same social and political circle as Wells – in particular, the Fabian Society.
*&quot;The Space Machine&quot; by Christopher Priest gives the Time Traveller&#x27;s name as William Reynolds.
*&quot;Sherlock Holmes &amp; The Coils of Time&quot; by Ralph E. Vaughan gives the Time Traveller&#x27;s name as Moesen Maddoc.
*The I.C.E. role-playing game supplement &quot;Time Riders&quot; suggests that the Time Traveller&#x27;s name is Ashleigh Holmes. It suggests that the Time Traveller is actually a woman who disguised herself as a man during the male chauvinistic Victorian era. She is said to be the sister of Sherlock Holmes.
*It has also been suggested that the Time Traveller was based on Thomas Edison.

<doc id="29837" wikidata="Q8350" url="?curid=29837" title="Trombone">
<text>The trombone (, Italian, French: &quot;trombone&quot;) is a musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player&#x27;s lips vibrate inside a mouthpiece, causing the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones use a telescoping slide mechanism to alter the pitch instead of the valves used by other brass instruments. The valve trombone is an exception, using three valves similar to those on a trumpet, and the superbone has valves and a slide.

The word &quot;trombone&quot; derives from Italian &quot;tromba&quot; (trumpet) and &quot;-one&quot; (a suffix meaning &quot;large&quot;), so the name means &quot;large trumpet&quot;. The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like the trumpet, in contrast to the more conical brass instruments like the cornet, the flugelhorn, the baritone, and the euphonium. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. These are treated as non-transposing instruments, reading at concert pitch in bass clef, with higher notes sometimes being notated in tenor clef. They are pitched in B, an octave below the B trumpet and an octave above the B bass tuba. The once common E alto trombone became less common as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is regaining popularity for its lighter sonority. In British brass-band music the tenor trombone is treated as a B transposing instrument, written in treble clef, and the alto trombone is written at concert pitch, usually in alto clef.

A person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. 

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
&quot;Trombone&quot; comes from the Italian word &quot;tromba&quot; (trumpet) plus the suffix &quot;-one&quot; (large), meaning &quot;large trumpet&quot;.

During the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was &quot;sackbut&quot;. The word first appears in court records in 1495 as &quot;&quot;shakbusshe&quot;. &quot;Shakbusshe&quot; is similar to &quot;sacabuche&quot;, attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent &quot;saqueboute&quot;&quot; appears in 1466.

The German &quot;Posaune&quot; long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.

=== Origin ===
The sackbut appeared in the 15th century and was used extensively across Europe, declining in most places by the mid to late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. Its principal role was as the contratenor part in a dance band. It was also used, along with shawms, in bands sponsored by towns and courts. Trumpeters and trombonists were employed in German city-states to stand watch in the city towers and herald the arrival of important people to the city, an activity that signified wealth and strength in 16th-century German cities. These heralding trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the alta capella wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles, which performed in religious settings such as St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice in the early 17th century. The 17th-century trombone had slightly smaller dimensions than a modern trombone, with a bell that was more conical and less flared. Modern period performers use the term &quot;sackbut&quot; to distinguish this earlier version of the trombone from the modern instrument.

Composers who wrote for trombone during this period include Claudio Monteverdi, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Gabrieli and his uncle Andrea Gabrieli. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.

When the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known by its Italian name, &quot;trombone&quot;. Its name remained constant in Italy (&quot;trombone&quot;) and in Germany (&quot;Posaune&quot;).

During the later Baroque period, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel used trombones on a few occasions. Bach called for a &quot;tromba di tirarsi&quot;, which may have been a form of the closely related slide trumpet, to double the cantus firmus in some liturgical cantatas. He also employed a choir of four trombones to double the chorus in three of his cantatas (BWV 2, BWV 21 and BWV 38), and used three trombones and a cornett in the cantata BWV 25. Handel used it in &quot;Samson&quot;, in &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;, and in the &quot;Death March&quot; from &quot;Saul&quot;. All were examples of an oratorio style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional &quot;Stadtpfeiffer&quot; or alta cappella musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions. Because of the relative scarcity of trombones, their solo parts were generally interchangeable with other instruments.

=== Classical period ===
The construction of the trombone did not change very much between the Baroque and Classical period, but the bell became slightly more flared. Christoph Willibald Gluck was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, in the opera &quot;Alceste &quot;(1767). He also used it in the operas &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride &quot;(1779), and &quot;Echo et Narcisse&quot;.

Early Classical composers occasionally included concertante movements with alto trombone as a solo instrument in divertimenti and serenades; these movements are often extracted from the multi-movement works and performed as standalone alto trombone concerti. Examples include the Serenade in E (1755) by Leopold Mozart and Divertimento in D major (1764) by Michael Haydn. The earliest known independent trombone concerto is probably the Concerto for Alto Trombone and Strings in B (1769) by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger.

Mozart used the trombone in operas (notably in scenes featuring the Commendatore in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;) and in sacred music. The prominent solo part in the &quot;Tuba Mirum&quot; section of his Requiem became a staple audition piece for the instrument. Aside from solo parts, Mozart&#x27;s orchestration usually features a trio of alto, tenor and bass trombones, doubling the respective voices in the choir. The earliest known symphony featuring a trombone section is Symphony in C minor by Anton Zimmermann. The date is uncertain but it is most probably from the peak of the composer&#x27;s activity in the 1770s. The earliest confident date for introducing the trombone to the symphony is therefore Zimmermann&#x27;s death in 1781.

==== Transition to Romantic period ====
Symphony in E (1807) by Swedish composer Joachim Nicolas Eggert features an independent trombone part. Ludwig van Beethoven is sometimes mistakenly credited with the trombone&#x27;s introduction into the orchestra, having used it shortly afterwards in his Symphony No. 5 in C minor (1808), Symphony No. 6 in F major (&quot;Pastoral&quot;), and Symphony No. 9 (&quot;Choral&quot;).

=== Romantic period ===

==== 19th-century orchestras ====
Trombones were included in operas, symphonies, and other compositions by Felix Mendelssohn, Hector Berlioz, Franz Berwald, Charles Gounod, Franz Liszt, Gioacchino Rossini, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Giuseppe Verdi, and Richard Wagner, and others.

The trombone trio was combined with one or two cornetts during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods. The replacement of cornetts with oboes and clarinets did not change the trombone&#x27;s role as a support to the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings), whose moving harmonic lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. The introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon a tenor trombone replaced the alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the Second World War. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid-19th century.

Trombonists were employed less by court orchestras and cathedrals, who had been providing the instruments. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E bass trombone remained in military use until around the First World War. Orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, as it could generally play any of the three trombone parts in orchestral scores.

Valve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section. While its use declined in German and French orchestras, the valve trombone remained popular in some countries, including Italy and Bohemia, almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, Bedřich Smetana, and Antonín Dvořák scored for a valve trombone section.

As the ophicleide or the tuba was added to the orchestra during the 19th century, bass trombone parts were scored in a higher register than previously. The bass trombone regained some independence in the early 20th century. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner&#x27;s addition of a contrabass trombone in &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; and Gustav Mahler&#x27;s and Richard Strauss&#x27; addition of a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenors and one bass. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.

==== 19th-century wind bands ====
Wind bands began during the French Revolution of 1791 and have always included trombones. They became more established in the 19th century and included circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones with the bell pointing behind the player&#x27;s left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz&#x27;s 1840 &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;, which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement. Toward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. Arthur Pryor, who played with the John Philip Sousa band and formed his own band, was one of the most famous of these trombonists.

==== 19th-century pedagogy ====
In the Romantic era, Leipzig became a center of trombone pedagogy, and the instrument was taught at the Musikhochschule founded by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. The Paris Conservatory and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn&#x27;s bass trombonist, Karl Traugott Queisser, was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of the trombone. Several composers wrote works for Queisser, including Mendelssohn&#x27;s concertmaster Ferdinand David, Ernst Sachse, and Friedrich August Belcke. David wrote his &quot;Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra&quot; in 1837, and Sachse&#x27;s solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler&#x27;s tenor-bass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.

==== 19th-century construction ====
Sattler had a great influence on trombone design, introducing a significantly larger bore (the most important innovation since the Renaissance), &quot;Schlangenverzierungen&quot; (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare. These features were widely copied during the 19th century and are still found on German made trombones.

The trombone was improved in the 19th century with the addition of &quot;stockings&quot; at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of a valve that was designed to be set in a single position but later became the modern F-valve. The valve trombone appeared around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.

=== Twentieth century ===

With the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. In the 1940s, British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of the American/German choice of large bore tenors and B basses. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.

==== 20th-century wind bands ====
During the first half of the 20th century the popularity of touring and community concert bands in the United States decreased. At the same time, the development of music education in the public school system made high-school and university concert bands and marching bands ubiquitous. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.

==== Use in jazz ====

In the 1900s the trombone and the tuba played bass lines and outlined chords to support improvisation by the higher-pitched instruments. It began to be used as a solo instrument during the swing era of the mid-1920s. Jack Teagarden and J. J. Johnson were early trombone soloists.

==== 20th-century construction ====
The trombone&#x27;s construction changed in the 20th century. Different materials were used, mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions increased, and different mutes and valves were developed. Despite the overall trend towards larger bore instruments, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.

One of the most significant changes was the development of the F-attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century there was no need for orchestral trombonists to use instruments with the F attachment trigger. As contemporary composers such as Mahler began to write lower passages for the trombone, the trigger became necessary.

=== Contemporary use ===
The trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, big bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, and trios, and also in trombone groups ranging from trios to choirs. A trombone choir can vary in size from five to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&amp;B, ska, and New Orleans brass bands.

== Construction ==
The trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube with two U-shaped bends and a flared bell at the end. The tubing is approximately cylindrical but contains a complex series of tapers which affect the instrument&#x27;s intonation. As with other brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a standing wave in the instrument.

The detachable cup-shaped mouthpiece is similar to that of the baritone horn and closely related to that of the trumpet. It has a venturi: a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance, greatly affecting the tone of the instrument. The slide section consists of a leadpipe, inner and outer slide tubes, and bracing, or &quot;stays&quot;. The soldered stays on modern instruments replaced the loose stays found on sackbuts (medieval precursors to trombones).

The most distinctive feature of the trombone is the slide that lengthens the tubing and lowers the pitch (cf. valve trombone). During the Renaissance, sleeves (called &quot;stockings&quot;) were developed to decrease friction that would impede the slide&#x27;s motion. These were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes to slightly increase their diameter. The ends of inner slides on modern instruments are manufactured with a slightly larger diameter to achieve the same end. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. The slide section is connected to the bell section by the neckpipe and a U-bend called the bell or back bow. The joint connecting the slide and bell sections has a threaded collar to secure the connection. Prior to the early 20th century this connection was made with friction joints alone.

Trombones have a short tuning slide in the U-shaped bend between the neckpipe and the bell, a feature designed by the French maker François Riedlocker in the early 19th century. It was incorporated into French and British designs, and later to German and American models, although German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. Many types of trombone also include one or more rotary valves connected to additional tubing which lengthens the instrument. This extends the low range of the instrument and creates the option of using alternate slide positions for many notes.

Like the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing that are of unchanging diameter (the slide section must be cylindrical in order to function). Tenor trombones typically have a bore of (small bore) to (large or &quot;orchestral&quot; bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the bow to the bell, which is typically between . A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.

=== Bells ===
Trombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between in diameter, with most being between . The smallest sizes are found on jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common on orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be or more, with most being between . The bell may be made from two separate brass sheets or from one single piece of metal, hammered on a mandrel to shape it. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.

=== Valve attachments ===

Modern trombones often have a valve attachment, an extra loop of tubing attached to the bell section and engaged by a valve operated by the left hand by means of a lever or trigger. The valve attachment aids in increasing the lower range of the instrument, while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. A valve can also make trills easier.
The valve attachment was originally developed by German instrument maker Christian Friedrich Sattler in the late 1830s for the (), a B tenor trombone built with the wider bore and larger bell of a bass trombone that Sattler had earlier invented in 1821. Sattler&#x27;s valve attachment added about of tubing to lower the fundamental pitch from B to F, controlled by a rotary valve, and is essentially unchanged in modern instruments.

Valve attachments are most commonly found on tenor and bass trombones, but they can appear on sizes from soprano to contrabass.

;Soprano
:In the early 2010s Torbjörn Hultmark of the Royal College of Music commissioned the first soprano trombone in B with an F valve, built by Thein Brass.

;Alto
:Although rare on the E alto trombone, a valve attachment usually lowers the instrument a perfect fourth into B, providing the first five or six positions from the tenor trombone slide. Some alto models have what is called a &quot;trill valve&quot;, providing a small loop of tubing that lowers the instrument by only a minor or major second, into D or D respectively.

;Tenor
:Tenor trombones, especially the larger bore symphonic models, commonly have a valve attachment which lowers the instrument from B to F.

:It provides access to the otherwise missing notes between the pedal B in first position, and the second partial E in seventh, as well as providing alternate slide positions for other notes in long (sixth and seventh) positions. Because the attachment tubing increases the length of the overall instrument by one-third, the distances between slide positions must also be one-third longer when the valve is engaged, resulting in only six positions available on the F slide, to low C. Thus, the F attachment cannot provide the low B, but it usually has a sufficiently long tuning slide to lower it into E as required, which will provide B in a very long position.

:Tenor trombones without a valve are sometimes known as &quot;straight&quot; trombones.

;Bass
:The modern bass trombone usually has two valve attachments to provide all of the notes that are absent on an instrument with no valves (B – E). This allows the player to produce a complete chromatic range upwards from the pedal register.

:The first valve is an F attachment the same as that found on a tenor trombone and extends the range down to C. The second valve, engaged together with the first, lowers the instrument to D (or less commonly, E) and provides the low B. The second valve can be &quot;dependent&quot;, where it serves to lower the F attachment to D and has no effect alone. More commonly the second valve is &quot;independent&quot;, where it can be engaged separately to lower the instrument to G, or to D when both are engaged.

:Single-valve B bass trombones with an F attachment are still made but are now less common than two-valve bass trombones. They are essentially very large bore tenor trombones, and likewise cannot provide the low B without lowering the valve to E with a long tuning slide.

;Contrabass
:Contrabass trombones in F typically have two independent valves, tuned either to C and D combining to A, or in European models tuned to D and B combining to A. Contrabass trombones in low B usually have only one valve in F, although Miraphone make a model in C with two independent valves in G and A, which combine to E.

==== Valve types ====

The most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the rotary valve, appearing on most band instruments, as well as most student and intermediate model trombones. Many improvements of the rotary valve, as well as entirely new and radically different valve designs, have been invented since the mid 20th century to give the trombone a more open, free sound than the tight bends in conventional rotary valve designs would allow. Many of these new valve designs have been widely adopted by players, especially in symphony orchestras. The Thayer axial flow valve is offered on professional models from most trombone manufacturers, and the Hagmann valve particularly from European manufacturers.

Some trombones have three piston or rotary valves instead of a slide; see valve trombone.

==== Tubing ====

F attachment tubing usually has a larger bore through the attachment than through the rest of the instrument. A typical slide bore for an orchestral tenor trombone is while the bore in the attachment is . The attachment tubing also incorporates a tuning slide to tune the valve separately from the rest of the instrument, usually long enough to lower the pitch by a semitone when fully extended (from F to E on tenor and bass trombones, to reach the missing low B).

Valve attachment tubing is often coiled tightly to keep within the bell section (&quot;closed wrap &quot; or &quot;traditional wrap&quot;). A less coiled configuration, called &quot;open wrap&quot;, is found on some 19th and early 20th century instruments. In the early 1980s, American instrument manufacturers began producing open wrap instruments after Californian instrument technician Larry Minick introduced open wraps around the same time that the Thayer valve began to emerge among orchestral players. Open wrap F attachment tubing is shaped in a single loop free of tight bends, resulting in a freer response and more &quot;open&quot; sound through the valve.

In marching bands and other situations where the trombone may be more prone to damage, the confined traditional wrap is more common, since open wrap tubing protrudes behind the bell section.

=== Tuning ===
Some trombones are tuned using a mechanism in the slide section instead of a tuning slide in the bell section. Having the tuning slide in the bell section (the more typical setup) requires two sections of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Placing the tuning mechanism in the cylindrical slide section allows the bell section to remain conical.

=== Slides ===
Common and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are for tenor trombones, and for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a &quot;dual-bore&quot; configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are , , , , for tenor trombones, and for bass trombones.

=== Mouthpiece ===

The mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player&#x27;s ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the timbre of that tone, its volume, the instrument&#x27;s intonation tendencies, the player&#x27;s subjective level of comfort, and the instrument&#x27;s playability in a given pitch range.

Mouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.

Instruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass. Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.

=== Regional variations ===

==== Germany and Austria ====

German trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German &quot;Konzertposaune&quot; can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least . The whole instrument is typically made of gold brass. They are constructed using very thin metal (especially in the bell section), and many have a metal ring called a () on the rim of the bell. Their sound is very even across dynamic levels but it can be difficult to play at louder volumes. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed in diameter.

Valve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German &quot;Quart-Ventil&quot;, built onto a B tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B or F for extended passages. Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.
As with other traditional German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long water keys as well as &quot;Schlangenverzierungen&quot; (snake decorations) on the slide and bell U-bows to help protect the tubing from damage.

Since around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling &quot;American trombones&quot; as well. Most trombones made and/or played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper. However, some higher-end manufacturers such as Thein make modern iterations of the classic German &quot;Konzertposaune&quot;, as well as American-style trombones with German features like the &quot;Kranz&quot; and snake decorations.

==== France ====
French trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the Second World War and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid–20th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around , small bells of not more than in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the cornet or horn. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B, altos in D, sopranos in F, piccolos in B, basses in G and E, and contrabasses in B.

== Types ==

The most frequently encountered types of trombone today are the tenor and bass, though as with many other instrument families such as the clarinet, the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Although trombones are usually constructed with a slide to change the pitch, valve trombones instead use the set of three valves common on other brass instruments.

=== Slide trombones ===
==== Contrabass trombone ====

The contrabass trombone is the lowest trombone, first appearing in BB an octave below the tenor with a double slide. This design was commissioned by Wagner in the 1870s for his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; opera cycle. Since the late 20th century however, it has largely been supplanted by a less cumbersome single-slide bass-contrabass instrument pitched in 12&#x27; F. With two valve attachments to provide the same full range as its predecessor, this design is effectively a modern bass trombone built down a perfect fourth. Although the contrabass has only appeared occasionally in orchestral repertoire and is not a permanent member of the modern orchestra, it has enjoyed a revival in the 21st century, particularly in film and video game soundtracks.

==== Bass trombone ====

Although early instruments were pitched in G, F or E below the tenor trombone, the modern bass trombone is pitched in the same B as the tenor but with a wider bore, a larger bell, and a larger mouthpiece. These features facilitate playing in the lower register of the instrument. Modern bass trombones have valves that allow a fully chromatic range down to the pedal register (B). In Britain, the bass trombone in G was used in orchestras from the mid-19th century and survived into the 1950s, particularly in British brass bands.

==== Tenor trombone ====
The tenor trombone has a fundamental note of B and is usually treated as a non-transposing instrument (see below). Tenor trombones with C as their fundamental note were almost equally popular in the mid-19th century in Britain and France. As the trombone in its simplest form has neither crooks, valves nor keys to lower the pitch by a specific interval, trombonists use seven chromatic &quot;slide positions&quot;. Each position progressively increases the length of the air column, thus lowering the pitch.

Extending the slide from one position to the next lowers the pitch by one semitone. Thus, each note in the harmonic series can be lowered by an interval of up to a tritone. The lowest note of the standard instrument is therefore an E – a tritone below B. Most experienced trombonists can play lower &quot;falset&quot; notes and much lower pedal notes (first partials or fundamentals, which have a peculiar metallic rumbling sound). Slide positions are subject to adjustment, compensating for imperfections in the tuning of different harmonics. The fifth partial is rather flat on most trombones and usually requires a minute shortening of the slide position to compensate; other small adjustments are also normally required throughout the range. Trombonists make frequent use of alternate positions to minimize slide movement in rapid passages; for instance, B3 may be played in first or fifth position. Alternate positions are also needed to allow a player to produce a glissando to or from a higher note on the same partial.

While the lowest note of the tenor trombone&#x27;s range (excluding fundamentals or pedal notes) is E2, the trombone&#x27;s upper range is theoretically open-ended. The practical top of the range is sometimes considered to be F5, or more conservatively D5. The range of the C tenor trombone is F2 to G5.

==== Alto trombone ====

The alto trombone is smaller than the tenor trombone and almost always pitched in E a fourth higher than the tenor, although examples pitched in F are occasionally found. Modern instruments are sometimes fitted with a valve to lower the pitch, either by a semitone to D (known as a &quot;trill&quot; valve), or by a fourth into B. The alto trombone was commonly used in the 16th to the 18th centuries in church music to strengthen the alto voice, particularly in the Mass. Early 19th century composers such as Beethoven, Brahms, and Schumann began writing for alto trombone in their symphonies, but the subsequent use and popularity of tenor trombones in the orchestra largely eclipsed their use until a modern revival that began in the late 20th century.

==== Soprano trombone ====

The soprano trombone is usually pitched in B an octave above the tenor, and has seldom been used since its first known appearance in 1677 outside of trombone choirs in Moravian Church music. Built with mouthpiece, bore and bell dimensions similar to the B trumpet, it tends to be played by trumpet players. During the 20th century some soprano trombones—dubbed &quot;slide cornets&quot;—were made as novelties or for use by jazz players including Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie. A small number of contemporary proponents of the instrument include jazz artists Wycliffe Gordon and Christian Scott, and classical trumpeter Torbjörn Hultmark, who advocates for its use as an instrument for young children to learn music.

==== Sopranino and piccolo trombones ====

The sopranino and piccolo trombones appeared in the 1950s as novelty instruments, and are even smaller and higher than the soprano. They are pitched in high E and B respectively, one octave above the alto and soprano trombones. Owing to being essentially a slide variant of the piccolo trumpet, they are played primarily by trumpet players.

=== Trombones with valves ===

==== Valve trombone ====
In the 19th century as soon as brass instrument valves were invented, trombones with valves instead of slides were adopted widely in orchestras, and remain popular in some parts of Europe and in military bands.

==== Cimbasso ====
The cimbasso covers the same range as a tuba or a contrabass trombone. The term first appeared in early 19th century Italian opera scores, and originally referred to an upright serpent or an ophicleide. The modern cimbasso first appeared as the &quot;trombone basso Verdi&quot; in the 1880s and has three to six piston or rotary valves and a predominantly cylindrical bore. They are most often pitched in 12&#x27; F, although models are available in E and occasionally 16&#x27; C and 18&#x27; B. The cimbasso is most commonly used in performances of late Romantic Italian operas by Verdi and Puccini, but has also experienced a 21st-century revival in film, television and video game soundtracks.

==== Superbone ====
A hybrid, &quot;duplex&quot; or &quot;double&quot; trombone is a design of trombone that has both a slide and a set of three valves for altering the pitch. It has been reinvented several times since first appearing in the 19th century by Besson, and later Conn. Jazz trombonist and machinist Brad Gowans invented his &quot;valide trombone&quot; in the 1940s with a short four-position slide. In the 1970s Maynard Ferguson and Holton produced the &quot;Superbone&quot;, very similar to the earlier Conn. In 2013 Schagerl in collaboration with James Morrison announced a larger bore variant with rotary valves.

==== Flugabone ====

The &quot;flugabone&quot; (or sometimes &quot;flugelbone&quot;), portmanteau of &quot;flugelhorn&quot; and &quot;trombone&quot;, also known as the &quot;marching trombone&quot;, is a marching brass instrument, essentially a valve trombone wrapped into a compact flugelhorn shape. It retains the cylindrical bore of the trombone, rather than the conical bore of either the flugelhorn or bugle, and thus is similar in playing characteristics to a valve trombone. A similar marching trombone is the &quot;trombonium&quot; first produced by King Musical Instruments, wrapped and held vertically like a euphonium.

=== Other variants ===

==== Sackbut ====
The term &quot;sackbut&quot; refers to the early forms of the trombone commonly used during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, with a characteristically smaller, more cylindrically proportioned bore, and a less-flared bell.

==== Buccin ====
A distinctive form of tenor trombone was popularized in France in the early 19th century. Called the buccin, it featured a tenor trombone slide and a bell that ended in a zoomorphic (serpent or dragon) head. It sounds like a cross between a trombone and a French horn, with a very wide dynamic range but a limited and variable range of pitch. Hector Berlioz wrote for the buccin in his &quot;Messe solennelle&quot; of 1824.

==== Tromboon ====
A portmanteau of &quot;trombone&quot; and &quot;bassoon&quot;, the &quot;tromboon&quot; was created by musical parodist Peter Schickele by replacing a trombone&#x27;s mouthpiece with the reed and bocal of a bassoon. It appears in several humorous works of Schickele&#x27;s fictional composer, P. D. Q. Bach.

== Technique ==

=== Basic slide positions ===
The modern system has seven chromatic slide positions on a tenor trombone in B. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.

In 1811 Joseph Fröhlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A. To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered &quot;drawn past&quot; then current 1st). In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately ) will produce a note which is one semitone lower when played in the same partial. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to &quot;bend&quot; the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.
=== Partials and intonation ===

As with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different partial in the harmonic series. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B2 (one octave higher than the pedal B1), F3 (a perfect fifth higher than the previous partial), B3 (a perfect fourth higher), D4 (a major third higher), and F4 (a minor third higher).

F4 marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A4 (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone equal temperament scale. A4 in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh. On the slide trombone, such deviations from intonation are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position. Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have just intonation (see harmonic seventh as well for A4).

The next higher partials—B4 (a major second higher), C5 (a major second higher), D5 (a major second higher)—do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E5 (a minor second higher) is almost exactly a quarter tone higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E5 and F5 (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed facial musculature and diaphragm can go even higher to G5, A5, B5 and beyond.

The higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above). A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F4 (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B trombone. The note E1 (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a B tenor trombone, requiring a full of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B1 (the fundamental in first position) and E2 (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce &quot;falset&quot; notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.

=== Pedal tones ===
The B pedal tone is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music, while notes below that are called for only rarely as they &quot;become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality&quot; with A or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists. The trombone&#x27;s tubing is largely cylindrical, which inhibits the production of the fundamental as a pedal tone pitch. Instead, trombonists use the higher harmonics of the instrument to produce pedal tones, giving them a bright and hollow tone quality. Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B on the bass trombone.

=== Glissando === 
The trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true glissando, by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.

The trombone glissando can create remarkable effects, and it is used in jazz and popular music, as in the famous song &quot;The Stripper&quot; by David Rose and his orchestra.

&#x27;Harmonic&#x27;, &#x27;inverted&#x27;, &#x27;broken&#x27; or &#x27;false&#x27; glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.

=== Trills ===
Trills, though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B3/C4 is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B4/C5) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor&#x27;s range. Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.

=== Notation ===
Unlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a transposing instrument. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a &quot;crook&quot;) or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (&quot;e.g.&quot; Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).

Trombone parts are typically notated in bass clef, though sometimes also written in tenor clef or alto clef. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German Robert Schumann was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.

An accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B as well.

=== Mutes ===

A variety of mutes can be used with the trombone to alter its timbre. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a wah-wah effect. Mutes used in this way include the &quot;hat&quot; (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or toilet plunger). The &quot;wah-wah&quot; sound of a trombone with a harmon mute is featured as the voices of adults in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoons.

== Didactics ==
Several makers have begun to market compact B/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short attachment that puts the instrument in B has its valve &quot;open&quot; when the trigger is &quot;not&quot; depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (&quot;Preacher model&quot;) was marketed by C.G. Conn in the 1920s, also under the Wurlitzer label. Currently, B/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers Günter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the Yamaha Corporation.

== Manufacturers ==
Trombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, Boston Musical Instrument Company, E. A. Couturier, H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments, J. W. York, and C.G. Conn. In the 21st century, leading mainstream manufacturers of trombones include Bach, Conn, Courtois, Edwards, Getzen, Jupiter, King, Rath, Schilke, S.E. Shires, Thein, Wessex, Willson and Yamaha.

<doc id="29838" wikidata="Q886" url="?curid=29838" title="The Simpsons">
<text>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, it caricatures society, Western culture, television and the human condition, and is still in current release. 

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to &quot;simpleton&quot;. The shorts became a part of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox&#x27;s first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in seasons and individual episodes. A feature-length film, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, to critical and commercial success, with a sequel in development as of 2024. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was initially a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Television; 20th Television&#x27;s involvement was later moved to 20th Television Animation, a separate unit of Disney Television Studios.

On January 26, 2023, the series was renewed for its 35th and 36th seasons, taking the show through the 2024–25 television season. The two seasons contain a combined total of 51 episodes. Seven of these episodes are season 34 holdovers, while the other 44 will be produced in the production cycle of the upcoming seasons, bringing the show&#x27;s overall episode total up to 801. Season 35 premiered on October 1, 2023. Season 36 premiered on September 29, 2024.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; received widespread acclaim throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered its &quot;golden age&quot;. Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived decline in quality. &quot;Time&quot; named it the 20th century&#x27;s best television series, and Erik Adams of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; named it &quot;television&#x27;s crowning achievement regardless of format&quot;. On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer&#x27;s exclamatory catchphrase of &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; has been adopted into the English language, while &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcom television series.

==Premise==

===Characters===

The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in the fictional &quot;Middle America&quot; town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge ( Bouvier), a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie (named by Bart), the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.

The family also owns a greyhound, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, (who first appeared in the episode &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;) and a cat, Snowball II, who is replaced by a cat, also named Snowball II, in the fifteenth-season episode &quot;I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot&quot;. Extended members of the Simpson and Bouvier family in the main cast include Homer&#x27;s father Abe and Marge&#x27;s sisters Patty and Selma. Marge&#x27;s mother Jacqueline and Homer&#x27;s mother Mona appear less frequently.
The show includes a vast array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer&#x27;s friends Barney Gumble, Lenny Leonard, and Carl Carlson; the school principal Seymour Skinner and staff members such as Edna Krabappel and Groundskeeper Willie; students such as Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum; shopkeepers such as Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Comic Book Guy, and Moe Szyslak; government figures Mayor &quot;Diamond&quot; Joe Quimby and Clancy Wiggum; next-door neighbor Ned Flanders; local celebrities such as Krusty the Clown and news reporter Kent Brockman; nuclear tycoon Montgomery Burns and his devoted assistant Waylon Smithers; and many more.

The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show &quot;SCTV&quot;.

===Continuity and the floating timeline===
Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters never age. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, the 1991 episodes &quot;The Way We Was&quot; and &quot;I Married Marge&quot; depict Homer and Marge as high schoolers in the 1970s who had Bart (who is always 10 years old) in the early &#x27;80s, while the 2008 episode &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot; depicts Homer and Marge as a childless couple in the &#x27;90s, and the 2021 episode &quot;Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars&quot; portrays Homer as an adolescent in the same period. The 1995 episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; takes place during Lisa&#x27;s college years in the then-future year of 2010, the same year the show began airing its 22nd season, in which Lisa was still 8. Regarding the contradictory flashbacks, Selman stated that &quot;they all kind of happened in their imaginary world&quot;.

The show follows a loose and inconsistent continuity. For example, Krusty the Clown may be able to read in one episode, but not in another. However, it is consistently portrayed that he is Jewish, that his father was a rabbi, and that his career began in the 1960s. The latter point introduces another snag in the floating timeline: historical periods that are a core part of a character&#x27;s backstory remain so even when their age makes it unlikely or impossible, such as Grampa Simpson and Principal Skinner&#x27;s respective service in World War II and Vietnam.

The only episodes not part of the series&#x27; main canon are the &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes, which often feature the deaths of main characters. Characters who die in &quot;regular&quot; episodes, such as Maude Flanders, Mona Simpson, Edna Krabappel, etc, however, stay dead. An exception to this is Hans Moleman, who is often killed in his appearances - he has been killed 26 times only to reappear later. Most episodes end with the status quo being restored, though occasionally major changes will stick, such as Lisa&#x27;s conversions to vegetarianism and Buddhism, the divorce of Milhouse van Houten&#x27;s parents, and the marriage and subsequent parenthood of Apu and Manjula.

===Setting===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; takes place in a fictional American town called Springfield. Although there are many real settlements in America named Springfield, the town the show is set in is fictional. The state it is in is not established. In fact, the show is intentionally evasive with regard to Springfield&#x27;s location. Springfield&#x27;s geography and that of its surroundings is inconsistent: from one episode to another, it may have coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;. He &quot;figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, &#x27;This will be cool; everyone will think it&#x27;s their Springfield.&#x27; And they do.&quot; Many landmarks, including street names, have connections to Portland.
==Production==

===Development===

When producer James L. Brooks was working on the television variety show &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; series. However, Groening later realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life&#x27;s work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks&#x27;s office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting &quot;Bart&quot; for his own name, adopting an anagram of the word &quot;brat&quot;.

The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. The colorist, &quot;Georgie&quot; Gyorgyi Kovacs Peluce (Kovács Györgyike) made the characters yellow; as Bart, Lisa, and Maggie have no hairlines, she felt they would look strange if they were flesh-colored. Groening supported the decision, saying: &quot;Marge is yellow with blue hair? That&#x27;s hilarious — let&#x27;s do it!&quot;

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted &quot;The Simpsons&quot; into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show&#x27;s content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called &quot;the mainstream trash&quot; that they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems. In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series&#x27; success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;—a claim rejected by the courts.

===Executive producers and showrunners===
List of showrunners throughout the series&#x27; run:
* Season 1–2: Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, &amp; Sam Simon
* Season 3–4: Al Jean &amp; Mike Reiss
* Season 5–6: David Mirkin
* Season 7–8: Bill Oakley &amp; Josh Weinstein
* Season 9–12: Mike Scully
* Season 13–31: Al Jean
* Season 32–present: Al Jean &amp; Matt Selman

Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have served as executive producers during the show&#x27;s entire history, and also function as creative consultants. Sam Simon, described by former &quot;Simpsons&quot; director Brad Bird as &quot;the unsung hero&quot; of the show, served as creative supervisor for the first four seasons. He was constantly at odds with Groening, Brooks and the show&#x27;s production company Gracie Films and left in 1993. Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a share of the profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993, at least until his death in 2015. A more involved position on the show is the showrunner, who acts as head writer and manages the show&#x27;s production for an entire season.

===Writing===

The first team of writers, assembled by Sam Simon, consisted of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, and Wallace Wolodarsky. Newer &quot;Simpsons&quot;″ writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show&#x27;s vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes approximately six months to produce, so the show rarely comments on current events.

Credited with sixty episodes, John Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. One of the best-known former writers is Conan O&#x27;Brien, who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing David Letterman as host of the talk show &quot;Late Night&quot;. English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode &quot;Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife&quot;, becoming the first celebrity both to write and guest star in the same episode. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film &quot;Superbad&quot;, wrote the episode &quot;Homer the Whopper&quot;, with Rogen voicing a character in it.

At the end of 2007, the writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East. The show&#x27;s writers had joined the guild in 1998.

In May 2023, the writers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East.

===Voice actors===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has six main cast members: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Castellaneta voices Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Barney Gumble, and other adult male characters. Julie Kavner voices Marge Simpson, Patty, Selma, as well as several minor characters. Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed. Cartwright voices Bart Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, and other children. Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other episodic characters. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high, so she was given the role of Lisa instead. Cartwright was originally brought in to voice Lisa, but upon arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the &quot;middle child&quot; and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as &quot;devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever&quot;. Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main &quot;Simpsons&quot; cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show. Azaria and Shearer do not voice members of the title family, but play a majority of the male townspeople. Azaria, who has been a part of the main voice cast since the second season in one episode &quot;Old Money&quot; and then perpetually part of the regular main voice cast since the third season, voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Professor Frink. Shearer provides voices for Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers, Principal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, and formerly Dr. Hibbert. Every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance.

With one exception, episode credits list only the voice actors, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists. However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode &quot;Old Money&quot;, because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work. In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, doing live performances of their characters&#x27; voices.

The six main actors were paid $30,000 per episode, until 1998, when they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action. The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The show&#x27;s revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode. The strike was resolved a month later and their salaries were increased to between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode. In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a &quot;healthy bump&quot; in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode. The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors&#x27; salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

In addition to the main cast, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters. From 1999 to 2002, Roswell&#x27;s characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven. Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. Wiedergott left the show in 2010, and since then Chris Edgerly has appeared regularly to voice minor characters. Repeat &quot;special guest&quot; cast members include Albert Brooks, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Maurice LaMarche, and Kelsey Grammer. Following Hartman&#x27;s death in 1998, the characters he voiced (Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz) were retired; Wallace&#x27;s character of Edna Krabappel was retired as well after her death in 2013. Following Taylor&#x27;s death in 2019, her characters (including Sherri, Terri, and Martin Prince) are now voiced by Grey Griffin.

Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; holds the world record for &quot;Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series&quot;.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has been dubbed into several other languages, including Japanese, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans in the area.

===Animation===

Several different U.S. and international studios animate &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo. With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios. These are AKOM, Anivision, Rough Draft Studios, USAnimation, and Toonzone Entertainment.

For the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the United States. In 1992, the show&#x27;s production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to Film Roman, who continued to animate the show until 2016 when they were replaced by Fox Television Animation, which allowed the show to be made more in-house. In Season 14, production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint. The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode &quot;Tennis the Menace&quot;, but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed &quot;Tennis the Menace&quot; was broadcast as made.

The production staff at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.

The series began high-definition production in season 20; the first episode, &quot;Take My Life, Please&quot;, aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation.

==Themes==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa&#x27;s days at Springfield Elementary School, the show&#x27;s writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of television channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about the entertainment industry and the press.

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. Al Jean acknowledged in an interview that &quot;We [the show] are of liberal bent.&quot; The writers often evince an appreciation for progressive leanings, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. The show portrays government and large corporations as evil entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are dismissive to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.

Sexuality is often a source of jokes in the series or serves as the theme of certain episodes. Even though homosexuals are sometimes sources of gags, the series often comments on how American society treats them, with &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; devoting an entire episode to the family making a gay friend and Homer&#x27;s initial hostility to him. In 1990, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; became the first animated early evening show to depict a kiss between two men in &quot;Simpson and Delilah&quot;.

==Hallmarks==

===Opening sequence===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ opening sequence is one of the show&#x27;s most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).

Each has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show&#x27;s title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he did when production began on the show. The series&#x27; distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro-style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone (or occasionally a different instrument), and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.

===Halloween episodes===
The special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the &quot;Treehouse&quot; series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s (and again in 2020), when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox&#x27;s current contract with Major League Baseball&#x27;s World Series. Prior to 2020 (between 2011 and 2019), every &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episode had aired in October.

===Humor===
The show&#x27;s humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show&#x27;s background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, billboards, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show or viewing it in slow motion. Kristin Thompson argues that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses a &quot;flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.&quot;

One of Bart&#x27;s early hallmarks was his prank calls to Moe&#x27;s Tavern owner Moe Szyslak where he asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.
Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis &quot;Red&quot; Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe&#x27;s violent side. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe&#x27;s angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; also often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. For example, the episode &quot;She Used to Be My Girl&quot; included a scene in which a Fox News Channel van drove down the street while displaying a large &quot;Bush Cheney 2004&quot; banner and playing Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;, in reference to the 2004 U.S. presidential election and claims of conservative bias in Fox News.

The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. Notable expressions include Homer&#x27;s annoyed grunt &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot;, Mr. Burns&#x27; &quot;Excellent&quot; and Nelson Muntz&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Ha&quot;-ha!&quot; Some of Bart&#x27;s catchphrases, such as &quot;¡Ay, caramba!&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, man!&quot; and &quot;Eat my shorts!&quot; appeared on T-shirts in the show&#x27;s early days. However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot; mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the &quot;Krusty the Clown Show&quot; solely for saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it&quot;.

====Purported foreshadowing of actual events====
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has gained notoriety for jokes that appeared to become reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode &quot;Bart to the Future&quot;, which mentions billionaire Donald Trump having been president of the United States at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump (who at the time was exploring a presidential run) was elected. Another episode, &quot;When You Dish Upon a Star&quot;, lampooned 20th Century Fox as a division of The Walt Disney Company. Nineteen years later, Disney purchased Fox. Other examples purported as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; predicting the future include the introduction of the smartwatch, video chat services, Richard Branson&#x27;s spaceflight and Lady Gaga&#x27;s acrobatic performance at the Super Bowl LI halftime show.

Al Jean has commented on the show&#x27;s purported ability to predict the future, explaining that they are really just &quot;educated guesses&quot; and stating that &quot;if you throw enough darts, you&#x27;re going to get some bullseyes.&quot; Producer Bill Oakley stated, &quot;There are very few cases where &quot;The Simpsons&quot; predicted something. It&#x27;s mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself.&quot; Fact-checking sources such as Snopes have debunked many of the claimed prophecies, explaining that the show&#x27;s extensive run means &quot;a lot of jokes, and a lot of opportunities for coincidences to appear&quot; and &quot;most of these &#x27;predictions&#x27; have rather simple and mundane explanations&quot;. For example, the device shown on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with autocorrection is an Apple Newton, a real 1993 device notorious for its poor handwriting recognition. Technologically advanced watches have appeared in numerous works of fiction, decades before &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==

===Idioms===
A number of neologisms that originated on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; have entered popular vernacular. Mark Liberman, director of the Linguistic Data Consortium, remarked, &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture&#x27;s greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.&quot; The most famous catchphrase is Homer&#x27;s annoyed grunt: &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, but without the apostrophe. Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson, an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series.

Groundskeeper Willie&#x27;s description of the French as &quot;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot; was used by &quot;National Review&quot; columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France&#x27;s opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. &quot;&quot; and &quot;embiggen&quot;, words used in &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot;, have since appeared in the Dictionary.com&#x27;s 21st Century Lexicon, and scientific journals respectively. &quot;Kwyjibo&quot;, a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;, was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm. &quot;I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords&quot;, was used by Kent Brockman in &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot; and has become a snowclone, with variants of the utterance used to express obsequious submission. It has been used in media, such as &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine. The dismissive term &quot;Meh&quot;, believed to have been popularized by the show, entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. Other words credited as stemming from the show include &quot;yoink&quot; and &quot;craptacular&quot;.

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations&quot; includes several quotations from the show. As well as &quot;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&quot;, Homer&#x27;s lines, &quot;Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try&quot;, from &quot;Burns&#x27; Heir&quot; (season five, 1994) as well as &quot;Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all&quot;, from &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27; (season 11, 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007.

Many quotes/scenes have become popular Internet memes, including Jasper Beardley&#x27;s quote &quot;That&#x27;s a paddlin from &quot;The PTA Disbands&quot; (season 6, 1995) and &quot;Steamed Hams&quot; from &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot; (season 7, 1996).

===Television===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; was the first successful animated program in American prime time since &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot; in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like &quot;Capitol Critters&quot;, &quot;Fish Police&quot;, and &quot;Family Dog&quot;, which were expensive and unsuccessful. &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other adult animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; (which was created by Matt Groening), and &quot;The Critic&quot; (which was also produced by Gracie Films). For &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane, &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years ... As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium.&quot;

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has had crossovers with four other shows. In the episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of &quot;The Critic&quot;, to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with &quot;The Critic&quot;. &quot;South Park&quot; later paid homage to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with the episode &quot;Simpsons Already Did It&quot;. In &quot;Simpsorama&quot;, the Planet Express crew from &quot;Futurama&quot; come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future. In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Simpsons Guy&quot;, the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has also influenced live-action shows like &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; debuted January 9, 2000, in the time slot after &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Ricky Gervais called &quot;The Simpsons&quot; an influence on &quot;The Office&quot;, and fellow British sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; was, according to its director Edgar Wright, &quot;an attempt to do a live-action &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&quot;. In Georgia, the animated television sitcom &quot;The Samsonadzes&quot;, launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.

===LGBT representation===

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has historically been open to portrayals of LGBT characters and settings, and it has routinely challenged heteronormativity. It was one of several animated television shows in the United States that began introducing characters that were LGBT, both openly and implied, in the 1990s. While early episodes involving LGBT characters primarily included them through the use of stereotypes, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; developed several prominent LGBT characters over its run. Producers of the show, such as Matt Groening and Al Jean, have expressed their opinion that LGBT representation in media is important, and that they seek to actively include it. Some characters, such as Julio, were created with their sexual orientation in mind, with it being central to their character. The show expanded its roster of openly LGBT characters through episodes in which prominent characters Patty Bouvier and Waylon Smithers came out in seasons 16 and 27, respectively.

==Release==

===Broadcast===


===Syndication===
In the United States, the cable television network FXX, a sibling of 20th Television and formerly the Fox network, has exclusive cable and digital syndication rights for &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion, at a time when cable syndication deals were highly rare. The series has been syndicated to local broadcast stations in nearly all markets throughout the United States since September 1994.

FXX premiered &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on their network on August 21, 2014, by starting a twelve-day marathon which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until VH1 Classic aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2015; celebrating that program&#x27;s 40th anniversary). The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled those of regular prime time programming for FXX. Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night. In Australia, a marathon of every episode of the show (at the time) aired from December 16, 2019, to January 5, 2020, on Fox8 (a cable network operated on pay TV provider Foxtel and a corporate sibling to the American Fox network). In Canada, Bell Media&#x27;s Much and Rogers Media&#x27;s FXX Canada syndicate the series as of January 2025.

After Disney acquired both 20th Television and FX Networks, it was announced that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; would air on the company&#x27;s Freeform channel starting October 2, 2019.

===Streaming and digital sell-through===

On October 21, 2014, a digital service courtesy of the FXNOW app, called &quot;Simpsons World&quot;, launched with every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes and the length of commercial breaks on the streaming service, but that problem was soon amended with fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that &quot;Simpsons World&quot; would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format. &quot;Simpsons World&quot; was discontinued after the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019, where the series streams exclusively. Initially, the series was only available cropped to 16:9 without the option to view the original 4:3 versions, reigniting criticisms of cropping old episodes. In response, Disney announced that &quot;in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from season 20) of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.&quot; On May 28, 2020, Disney+ made the first 19 seasons, along with some episodes from season 20, of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; available in both 16:9 and the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Season 31 came to Disney+ on October 2, 2020, with Hulu streaming the latest episodes of season 32 the next day. Season 32 came to Disney+ on September 29, 2021.

The season 3 premiere &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;, which features Michael Jackson as the voice of Leon Kompowsky, was pulled out of rotation in 2019 by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean after HBO aired the documentary &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;, in which two men share details into how Jackson allegedly abused them as children. It is therefore unavailable on Disney+. However, the episode is still available on &quot;The Complete Third Season&quot; DVD box set released on August 26, 2003.

In July 2017, all episodes from seasons 4 to 19 were made available for purchase on the iTunes Store in Canada.

On August 10, 2024, it was announced that four episodes of season 36 would air exclusively on Disney+.

==Reception and achievements==
===Early success===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; was the Fox network&#x27;s first television series to rank among a season&#x27;s top 30 highest-rated shows. In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed &quot;Bartmania&quot;. He became the most prevalent &quot;Simpsons&quot; character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as &quot;I&#x27;m Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?&quot; and &quot;Underachiever (&#x27;And proud of it, man!&#x27;)&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot.

Due to the show&#x27;s success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ time slot from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it competed with &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; on NBC, the number one show at the time. Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed &quot;Bill vs. Bart&quot; rivalry. &quot;Bart Gets an &#x27;F&#x27; (season two, 1990) was the first episode to air against &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, and it received a lower Nielsen rating, tying for eighth behind &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The show moved back to its Sunday slot in 1994 and has remained there ever since.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, and it has been noted for being described as &quot;the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air&quot;. In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it as &quot;the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It&#x27;s this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.&quot; Tucker also described the show as a &quot;pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.&quot;

===Run length achievements===
On February 9, 1997, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; surpassed &quot;The Flintstones&quot; with the episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States. In 2004, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; replaced &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action) in the United States in terms of the number of years airing. In 2009, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; surpassed &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;″s record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). In October 2004, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; briefly overtook &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes (albeit under several different iterations). However, network executives in April 2005 again canceled &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, which finished with 371 episodes, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season. In May 2007, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. For example, the Japanese anime series &quot;Sazae-san&quot; has over 2,000 episodes (7,000+ segments) to its credit.

In 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled &quot;Best. 20 Years. Ever.&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. One of the first parts of the celebration is the &quot;Unleash Your Yellow&quot; contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show. The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost 20 years after &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; aired on January 14, 1990), with &quot;The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!&quot;, a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the &quot;cultural phenomenon of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&quot;.

As of the twenty-first season (2009–2010), &quot;The Simpsons&quot; became the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, having surpassed the 1955–1975 run of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. On April 29, 2018, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; also surpassed &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;″s 635-episode count with the episode &quot;Forgive and Regret&quot;.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; is both the longest-running and the highest ranking animated series to feature on TV Time&#x27;s top 50 most followed TV shows ever.

On February 6, 2019, it was announced that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has been renewed for seasons 31 and 32.

On March 3, 2021, it was announced that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was renewed for seasons 33 and 34.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century&#x27;s greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;The Simpsons&quot; the century&#x27;s best television series, writing: &quot;Dazzlingly intelligent and unapologetically vulgar, the Simpsons have surpassed the humor, topicality and, yes, humanity of past TV greats.&quot; In that same issue, &quot;Time&quot; included Bart Simpson in the &quot;Time 100&quot;, the publication&#x27;s list of the century&#x27;s 100 most influential people. Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 2000, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named &quot;The Simpsons&quot; the greatest television show of the 1990s. Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at the top of two polls: 2001&#x27;s 100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV shows (despite the show not being aimed at children), and 2005&#x27;s The 100 Greatest Cartoons, with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001&#x27;s 100 Greatest TV Characters. Homer also placed ninth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV icons&quot;. In 2002, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; ranked No. 8 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and was ranked the No. 6 cult show in 2004. In 2007, it moved to No. 8 on TV Guide&#x27;s cult shows list and was included in &quot;Time&quot; list of the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;. In 2008 the show was placed in first on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; named it the greatest TV show of all time. In 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Homer &quot;the greatest character of the last 20 years&quot;, while in 2013 the Writers Guild of America listed &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the 11th &quot;best written&quot; series in television history. In 2013, TV Guide ranked &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the greatest TV cartoon of all time and the tenth greatest show of all time. A 2015 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named it as their No. 10 favorite show. In 2015, British newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot; named &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time. Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the greatest American TV series of all time in their 2016 book &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the second-greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as the fourth-greatest TV show of all time.

====Controversy====
Bart&#x27;s rebellious, bad boy nature, which underlies his misbehavior and rarely leads to any punishment, led some people to characterize him as a poor role model for children. In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a &quot;threat to learning&quot; because of his &quot;underachiever and proud of it&quot; attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as &quot;egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited&quot;. In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him &quot;angry, confused, frustrated&quot;. In response, Matt Groening said, &quot;That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.&quot; On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, &quot;We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.&quot; The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment that aired three days later before a rerun of &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot; in which Bart replied, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re just like the Waltons. We&#x27;re praying for an end to the Depression, too.&quot;

The show also received criticism from the nuclear power industry in its early years, with its portrayal of the evil boss Mr. Burns and &quot;bungling idiot&quot; employees (including Homer Simpson himself) with their lack of safety and security. In a letter to the nuclear power-backed U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, producer Sam Simon apologized, stating, &quot;I apologize that the Simpsons have offended a lot of people in the energy industry. I agree with you that in real life, Homer Simpson would not be employed at a nuclear power plant. On the other hand, he probably wouldn&#x27;t be employed anywhere.&quot;

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot; (season six, 1995) and Brazil in &quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s tourist board—which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot; (season six, 1995), which featured a crossover with &quot;The Critic&quot;. He felt that it was just an advertisement for &quot;The Critic&quot;, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode &quot;violates the Simpsons&#x27; universe&quot;. In response, Brooks said, &quot;I am furious with Matt, ... he&#x27;s allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. ... his behavior right now is rotten.&quot;

&quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; (season nine, 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, &quot;That&#x27;s &quot;so&quot; wrong. You&#x27;re taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we&#x27;ve done before with other characters. It&#x27;s so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it&#x27;s disrespectful to the audience.&quot;

====Bans====
The show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, &quot;in an effort to protect China&#x27;s struggling animation studios&quot;. In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was deemed &quot;unsuitable for children&quot;. The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded that &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot; and some other Western cartoons be removed from broadcast schedules &quot;for propaganda of various vices&quot; and the broadcaster&#x27;s license to be revoked. However, a court decision later dismissed this request.

====Perceived decline in quality====
Critics&#x27; reviews of early &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes praised the show for its sassy humor, wit, realism, and intelligence. However, in the late 1990s, around the airing of season 9, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show &quot;tired&quot;. By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show, and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. Jim Schembri of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favor of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote in 2011: &quot;The central tragedy of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention-seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don&#x27;t have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.&quot;

In 2010, the BBC noted &quot;the common consensus is that &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ golden era ended after season nine&quot;, and Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated &quot;for many fans ... the glory days are long past.&quot; Similarly, Tyler Wilson of &quot;Coeur d&#x27;Alene Press&quot; has referred to seasons one to nine as the show&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;, and Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; described the show&#x27;s classic era as being &quot;say, the first ten seasons&quot;. Jon Heacock of LucidWorks stated that &quot;for the first ten years [seasons], the show was consistently at the top of its game&quot;, with &quot;so many moments, quotations, and references – both epic and obscure – that helped turn the Simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day&quot;.

Mike Scully, who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve, has been the subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote that &quot;under Scully&#x27;s tenure, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; became, well, a cartoon ... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge&#x27;s neck. The show&#x27;s still funny, but it hasn&#x27;t been touching in years.&quot; When asked in 2007 how the series&#x27; longevity is sustained, Scully joked: &quot;Lower your quality standards. Once you&#x27;ve done that you can go on forever.&quot;

Al Jean, who was showrunner during seasons thirteen through thirty-three, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is &quot;on auto-pilot&quot;, &quot;too sentimental&quot;, and the episodes are &quot;just being cranked out&quot;. Some critics believe that the show has &quot;entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny&quot;. John Ortved, author of &quot;The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History&quot;, characterized the Jean era as &quot;toothless&quot;, and criticized what he perceived as the show&#x27;s increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s possible that we&#x27;ve declined. But honestly, I&#x27;ve been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s gone downhill.&#x27; If we&#x27;d listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t.&quot;

In 2004, cast member Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show&#x27;s declining quality: &quot;I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now.&quot; Cast member Dan Castellaneta responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t agree, ... I think Harry&#x27;s issue is that the show isn&#x27;t as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it&#x27;s gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.&quot; Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as &quot;hogwash&quot;, saying &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; hasn&#x27;t fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it&#x27;s hardly likely to fumble it now.&quot; In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t see any end in sight. I think it&#x27;s possible that the show will get too financially cumbersome ... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it&#x27;s ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, the stories do things that we haven&#x27;t done before, so creatively there&#x27;s no reason to quit.&quot;

In 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though &quot;The Simpsons&quot; still holds cultural relevance, &quot;contemporary appeal&quot; is only for the &quot;first ten or so seasons&quot;, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series&#x27; ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers.

Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz argued in their 2016 book titled &quot;TV (The Book)&quot; that the peak of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are &quot;roughly seasons 3–12&quot;, and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as &quot;Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind&quot; and &quot;Holidays of Future Passed&quot; could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that &quot;even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all.&quot;

In 2020, Uproxx writer Josh Kurp stated that while he agrees with the sentiment that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is not as good as it used to be, it is because &quot;it was working at a level of comedy and characterization that no show ever has.&quot; He felt there were still many reasons to watch the series, as it was &quot;still capable of quality television, and even the occasional new classic&quot; and the fact that the show was willing to experiment, giving examples such as bringing on guest animators like Don Hertzfeldt and Sylvain Chomet to produce couch gags, and guest writers like Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Pete Holmes and Megan Amram to write episodes. In the season 32 episode &quot;I, Carumbus&quot;, the show itself makes a nod to these concerns in its credits gag where the god Jupiter notes that &quot;It definitely feels like they&#x27;re wrapping it up ... any day now.&quot;

In a 2021 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Jean was quoted as saying, &quot;To people who say &quot;The Simpsons&quot; isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be, I would say I think the world isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be. But we&#x27;re declining at a slower rate.&quot;

====Race controversy====

The stereotypical nature of the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has been the subject of controversy. Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu stated in his 2017 documentary &quot;The Problem with Apu&quot; that as a child he was a fan of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and liked Apu, but he now finds the character&#x27;s stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, &quot;that&#x27;s the nature of cartooning.&quot; He added that he was &quot;proud of what we do on the show&quot;, and &quot;it&#x27;s a time in our culture where people love to pretend they&#x27;re offended&quot;. In response to the controversy, Apu&#x27;s voice actor, Hank Azaria, said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: &quot;The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character.&quot; In February 2020, he confirmed that he would no longer voice Apu. Groening stated at the same time that the character would remain in the show.

The criticisms were referenced in the season 29 episode &quot;No Good Read Goes Unpunished&quot;, when Lisa breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience by saying, &quot;Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?&quot; to which Marge replies, &quot;Some things will be addressed at a later date.&quot; Lisa adds, &quot;If at all.&quot; This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, Apu&quot;, a play on Bart&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, man,&quot; as well as the fact that many Hindus do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show, which Groening denied.

On June 26, 2020, in light of the various Black Lives Matter protests, Fox announced that recurring characters of color (Carl Carlson and Dr. Hibbert, among others) would no longer be voiced by white actors. Beginning with season 32, Carl, a black character originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by black actor Alex Désert. In addition, Bumblebee Man, a Spanish-speaking Latino character also originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by Mexican-American actor Eric Lopez, and Dr. Hibbert, a black character originally voiced by Harry Shearer, is now voiced by black actor Kevin Michael Richardson.

==Other media==
===Comic books===

Numerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. The first comic strips based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; appeared in 1991 in the magazine &quot;Simpsons Illustrated&quot;, which was a companion magazine to the show. The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled &quot;Simpsons Comics and Stories&quot;, containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. The book was a success and due to this, Groening and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, and Steve and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. A total of nine comic book series were published by Bongo Comics between 1993 and the company&#x27;s dissolution in 2018. Issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, &quot;Bart Simpson&#x27;s Treehouse of Horror&quot; and &quot;Bart Simpson&quot; have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins.

===Film===
20th Century Fox and Gracie Films produced &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007. The film was directed by long-time &quot;Simpsons&quot; producer David Silverman and written by a team of &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, David Mirkin, Mike Scully, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded. There had been talk of a possible feature-length &quot;Simpsons&quot; film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.

On August 10, 2018, 20th Century Fox announced that a sequel is in development.

===Music===

Collections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums &quot;Songs in the Key of Springfield&quot;, &quot;Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons: Testify&quot;. Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been featured on the show. The album &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and becoming certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The first single from the album was the pop rap song &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Michael Jackson, although he did not receive any credit. &quot;The Yellow Album&quot; was released in 1998, but received poor reception and did not chart in any country.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride===
In 2007, it was officially announced that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride, a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008, in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It features more than 24 regular characters from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts. The ride also features clips from the show in the waiting line.

===Video games===

Numerous video games based on the show have been produced. Some of the early games include Konami&#x27;s arcade game &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1991) and Acclaim Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants&quot; (1991). More modern games include &quot;The Simpsons: Road Rage&quot; (2001), &quot;The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; (2007). Electronic Arts, which produced &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot;, has owned the exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005. In 2010, they released a game called &quot;The Simpsons Arcade&quot; for iOS. Another EA-produced mobile game, &quot;Tapped Out&quot;, was released in 2012 for iOS users, then in 2013 for Android and Kindle users. Two &quot;Simpsons&quot; pinball machines have been produced: one that was available briefly after the first season, and another in 2007, both out of production.

==Merchandise==

The popularity of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial &quot;Simpsons&quot; books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;. In particular, seasons one through seventeen were released on DVD for 13 years between September 2001 to December 2014 in the U.S./Canada (Region 1), Europe (Region 2), and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 8, 2015, Al Jean announced that the season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from seasons 1 to 17, season 20 (released out of order in 2010), with seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentaries would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they were pushing for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that season 18 would be released on December 5, 2017, on DVD. Another two years later, on July 20, 2019, it was announced that season 19 would be released on December 3, 2019, on DVD.

In 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters in their advertising. As a promotion for &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold &quot;The Simpsons&quot; related products. These included &quot;Buzz Cola&quot;, &quot;Krusty-O&quot; cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and &quot;Squishees&quot;.

In 2008, consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise related to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009, 20th Century Fox had greatly increased merchandising efforts. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show&#x27;s twentieth anniversary. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. Approximately one billion were printed, but only 318 million were sold, costing the Postal Service $1.2 million.

<doc id="29839" wikidata="Q1160206" url="?curid=29839" title="Television (band)">
<text>Television was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973. The group&#x27;s most prominent lineup consisted of Tom Verlaine (vocals, guitar), Richard Lloyd (guitar), Billy Ficca (drums), and Fred Smith (bass). An early fixture of CBGB and the 1970s New York rock scene, the band is considered influential in the development of punk and alternative rock.

Although they recorded in a stripped-down, guitar-based manner similar to their punk contemporaries, Television&#x27;s music was by comparison clean, improvisational, and technically proficient, drawing influence from jazz and 1960s rock. The group&#x27;s 1977 debut album, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, is considered one of the defining releases of the punk era.

== History ==

=== Early history and formation ===

Television&#x27;s roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, from which they ran away. Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets.

Their first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals and Billy Ficca on drums. The group lasted from late 1972 to March 11, 1973. A 7-inch record featuring &quot;That&#x27;s All I Know (Right Now)&quot; and &quot;Love Comes in Spurts&quot; was released in 1980.

On March 12, 1973, the group reformed, calling themselves Television and recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist. The name, devised by Hell, was a pun on &#x27;tell a vision&#x27; as well as a reference to reclaiming the dominant media of the era. Their first gig was at the Townhouse Theatre, on March 2, 1974. Their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded CBGB owner Hilly Kristal to give the band a regular gig at his club, where they reportedly constructed their first stage. After playing several gigs at CBGB in early 1974, they played at Max&#x27;s Kansas City and other clubs, returning to CBGB in January 1975, where they established a significant cult following.

=== Departure of Richard Hell and debut release ===

Initially, songwriting was split almost equally between Hell and Verlaine, Lloyd being an infrequent contributor as well. However, friction began to develop as Verlaine, Lloyd, and Ficca became increasingly confident and adept with both instruments and composition, while Hell remained defiantly untrained in his approach. Verlaine, feeling that Hell&#x27;s frenzied onstage demeanor was upstaging his songs, reportedly told him to &quot;stop jumping around&quot; during the songs and occasionally refused to play Hell&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, in concert. This conflict, as well as one of their songs being picked up by Island Records, led Hell to leave the group and take some of his songs with him. He co-founded the Heartbreakers in 1975 with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan, later forming Richard Hell and the Voidoids. Fred Smith, briefly of Blondie, replaced Hell as Television&#x27;s bassist.

Television made their vinyl debut in 1975 with &quot;Little Johnny Jewel&quot; (Parts One and Two), a 7-inch single on the independent label Ork Records, owned by their manager, Terry Ork. Lloyd apparently disagreed with the selection of this song, preferring &quot;O Mi Amore&quot; for their debut, to the extent that he seriously considered leaving the band. Reportedly Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner auditioned for his spot during this time.

=== &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, &quot;Adventure&quot; and break-up (1977–78) ===

Television&#x27;s first album, &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, was received positively by music critics and audiences and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart – it also sold well in Europe and reached the Top 30 in many countries there. Upon its initial release in 1977, Roy Trakin wrote in the &quot;SoHo Weekly&quot; &quot;forget everything you&#x27;ve heard about Television, forget punk, forget New York, forget CBGB&#x27;s ... hell, forget rock and roll—this is the real item.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album was &quot;revolutionary&quot; and composed &quot;entirely of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory, which is achieved through the group&#x27;s long, interweaving instrumental sections.&quot;

Television&#x27;s second album, &quot;Adventure&quot;, was recorded and released in 1978. Softer and more reflective than their debut album, &quot;Adventure&quot; was well received by critics despite modest sales. The members&#x27; independent and strongly held artistic visions, along with Lloyd&#x27;s drug abuse and lack of commercial success, led to the band&#x27;s break-up in July 1978. Both Lloyd and Verlaine pursued solo careers, while Ficca became the drummer for the new wave band the Waitresses.

=== Reformation (1992–2023) ===
Television reformed in 1992, released a self-titled third album and have performed live sporadically thereafter. After being wooed back on stage together for the 2001 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival at Camber Sands, England, they played a number of dates around the world on an irregular basis.
In 2007, Lloyd announced he would be amicably leaving the band after a midsummer show in New York City&#x27;s Central Park. Due to an extended hospital stay recovering from pneumonia, he was unable to make the Central Park concert. Jimmy Rip substituted for him that day and was subsequently asked to join the band full-time in Lloyd&#x27;s place. On July 7, 2011, the new lineup performed at the Beco 203 music festival in São Paulo, Brazil. In an MTV Brazil interview, the band confirmed that an album with about ten new tracks was close to being finished, but as of 2023, that album has not surfaced. In the 2010s, the band kept on touring performing &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; in its entirety; they notably did European tours in 2014 and 2016. In New York in October 2015, the band performed a four-song show that lasted an hour: &quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewed it saying the highlight of the set was a new number &quot;Persia&quot;, dubbing it &quot;a pulsing, rhythmic exploration lasting close to 20 minutes, to which each member of the band contributed in equal strength&quot;.

Verlaine died on January 28, 2023, at the age of 73.

==Artistry==
=== Musical style and influences ===
Television are now regarded as an art punk band. The band broke from standard rock convention by omitting blues influence and instead incorporating elements of jazz, while retaining the &quot;raw energy&quot; that was influenced by garage rock. 

As with many emerging punk bands, the Velvet Underground was a strong influence. Television also drew inspiration from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich. Tom Verlaine has often cited the influence of surf bands the Ventures and Dick Dale on Television&#x27;s approach to the guitar, and he has also expressed a fondness for the bands Love and Buffalo Springfield, two groups noted for their dual-guitar interplay. Television&#x27;s ties to punk were underscored by their late &#x27;60s garage rock leanings; the band often covered the Count Five&#x27;s &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; and the 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; &quot;Fire Engine&quot; in concert.

Lester Bangs heard in Television&#x27;s music the influence of Quicksilver Messenger Service, noting a similarity between Verlaine&#x27;s guitar playing and John Cipollina&#x27;s. Tom Verlaine has downplayed the comparison, citing The Ventures as a more apt reference point.

===Instrumentation===
Though Verlaine and Lloyd were nominally &quot;rhythm&quot; and &quot;lead&quot; guitarists, they often rendered such labels obsolete by crafting interlocking parts, where the ostensible rhythm role could be as intriguing as the lead. Al Handa writes, &quot;In Television&#x27;s case, Lloyd was the guitarist who affected the tonality of the music more often than not, and Verlaine and the rhythm section the ones who gave the ear its anchor and familiar musical elements. Listen only to Lloyd, and you can hear some truly off the wall ideas being played.&quot;

<text>A television channel, or TV channel, is a terrestrial frequency or virtual number over which a television station or television network is distributed. For example, in North America, &quot;channel 2&quot; refers to the terrestrial or cable band of 54 to 60 MHz, with carrier frequencies of 55.25 MHz for NTSC analog video (VSB) and 59.75 MHz for analog audio (FM), or 55.31 MHz for digital ATSC (8VSB). Channels may be shared by many different television stations or cable-distributed channels depending on the location and service provider.

Depending on the multinational bandplan for a given region, analog television channels are typically 6, 7, or 8 MHz in bandwidth, and therefore television channel frequencies vary as well. Channel numbering is also different. Digital terrestrial television channels are the same as their analog predecessors for legacy reasons, however through multiplexing, each physical radio frequency (RF) channel can carry several digital subchannels. On satellites, each transponder normally carries one channel, however multiple small, independent channels can be on one transponder, with some loss of bandwidth due to the need for guard bands between unrelated transmissions. ISDB, used in Japan and Brazil, has a similar segmented mode.

Preventing interference between terrestrial channels in the same area is accomplished by skipping at least one channel between two analog stations&#x27; frequency allocations. Where channel numbers are sequential, frequencies are not , such as channel 6 to 7 skip from VHF low to high band, and channel 13 to 14 jump to UHF. On cable TV, it is possible to use adjacent channels only because they are all at the same power, something which could only be done terrestrially if the two stations were transmitted at the same power and height from the same location. For DTT, selectivity is inherently better, therefore channels adjacent (either to analog or digital stations) can be used even in the same area.

==Other meanings==
Commonly, the term &quot;television channel&quot; is used to mean a television station or its pay television counterpart (both outlined below). Sometimes, especially outside the U.S. and in the context of pay television, it is used instead of the term television network, which otherwise (in its technical use above) describes a group of geographically-distributed television stations that share affiliation/ownership and some or all of their programming with one another.
This terminology may be muddled somewhat in other jurisdictions, for instance Europe, where terrestrial channels are commonly mapped from physical channels to common numerical positions (i.e. BBC One does not broadcast on any particular &quot;channel 1&quot; but is nonetheless mapped to the &quot;1&quot; input on most British television sets). On digital platforms, such (location) channels are usually arbitrary and changeable, due to virtual channels.

===Television station===

A television station is a type of terrestrial station that broadcasts both audio &quot;and&quot; video to television receivers in a particular area. Traditionally, TV stations made their broadcasts by sending specially-encoded radio signals over the air, called terrestrial television. Individual television stations are usually granted licenses by a government agency to use a particular section of the radio spectrum (a channel) through which they send their signals. Some stations use LPTV broadcast translators to retransmit to further areas.

Many television stations are now in the process of converting from analog terrestrial (NTSC, PAL or SECAM) broadcast, to digital terrestrial (ATSC broadcast, DVB or ISDB).

===Non-terrestrial television channels===
Because some regions have had difficulty picking up terrestrial television signals (particularly in mountainous areas), alternative means of distribution such as direct-to-home satellite and cable television have been introduced. Television channels specifically built to run on cable or satellite blur the line between TV station and TV network. That fact led some early cable channels to call themselves superstations.

Satellite and cable have created changes. Local programming TV stations in an area can sign-up or even be required to be carried on cable, but content providers like TLC cannot. They are not licensed to run broadcast equipment like a station, and they do not regularly provide content to licensed broadcasters either. Furthermore, a distributor like TNT may start producing its own programming, and shows presented exclusively on pay-TV by one distributor may be syndicated to terrestrial stations. The cost of creating a nationwide channel has been reduced and there has been a huge increase in the number of such channels, with most catering to a small group.

From the definitions above, use of the terms &quot;network&quot; or &quot;station&quot; in reference to nationwide cable or satellite channels is technically inaccurate. However, this is an arbitrary, inconsequential distinction, and varies from company to company. Indeed, the term &quot;cable network&quot; has entered into common usage in the United States in reference to such channels, even with the existence of direct broadcast satellite. There is even some geographical separation among &quot;national&quot; pay television channels in the U.S., be it programming (e.g., the Bally Sports group of regional sports channels, which share several programs), or simply regionalized advertising inserted by the local cable company.

Should a legal distinction be necessary between a (location) channel as defined above and a television channel in this sense, the terms &quot;programming service&quot; (e.g.) or &quot;programming undertaking&quot; (for instance,) may be used instead of the latter definition.

<doc id="29843" wikidata="Q168718" url="?curid=29843" title="The Goon Show">
<text>The Goon Show is a British radio comedy programme, originally produced and broadcast by the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1960, with occasional repeats on the BBC Light Programme. The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled Crazy People; subsequent series had the title &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

The show&#x27;s chief creator and main writer was Spike Milligan, who performed the series alongside Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and (for the first two series) Michael Bentine. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. There were also light music interludes. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Elements of the show satirised contemporary life in 1950s Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.

The show was released internationally through the BBC Transcription Services (TS). It aired regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects. In the United States, NBC began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s.

Subversive and absurdist, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture. It was cited as a major influence by the Beatles, the American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre,:4,5,61 and the British comedy troupe Monty Python.

==Background==
The series was devised and written by Spike Milligan with the regular collaboration of other writers including Larry Stephens (contributing to around 140 episodes), Eric Sykes (who co-wrote most of the episodes in Series 5), Maurice Wiltshire and John Antrobus, initially under the supervision of Jimmy Grafton.

Milligan and Harry Secombe became friends while serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first encountered Lance Bombardier Secombe after Gunner Milligan&#x27;s artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe was sitting in a small wireless truck: &quot;Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the middle of it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked &#x27;Anybody seen a gun?&#x27; It was Milligan.&quot; Secombe&#x27;s answer to that question was &quot;What colour was it?&quot; Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.:20

The group first formed at The Grafton Arms Pub &amp; Rooms, 2 Strutton Ground, Victoria, London,&lt;ref name=&quot;LR/goon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;camra/grafton-arms&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Grafton&#x27;s&lt;ref name=&quot;BEHP/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; London public house in 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;standard/spike-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph/obit/Spike&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers had already débuted with the BBC. Secombe was often heard on &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot;. Milligan was writing for and acting in the high-profile BBC show &quot;Hip-Hip-Hoo-Roy&quot; with Derek Roy. Michael Bentine, who appeared in the first series, had just begun appearing in Charlie Chester&#x27;s peak-time radio show &quot;Stand Easy&quot;.

The four clicked immediately. &quot;It was always a relief to get away from the theatre and join in the revels at Grafton&#x27;s on a Sunday night,&quot; said Secombe years later. They took to calling themselves &quot;The Goons&quot; and started recording their pub goings-on with a Pickersgill aluminium disk recorder. BBC producer Pat Dixon heard a recording and took interest in the group. He pressed the BBC for a long-term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming. The BBC acquiesced and ordered an initial series, though without much enthusiasm.

The series had its premiere in May 1951 and audience figures grew rapidly, from around 370,000 to nearly two million by the end of the 17th show. No recordings of any episode of this series are known to have survived. The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and Max Geldray joined the lineup. Peter Eton, from the BBC&#x27;s drama department, replaced Dennis Main Wilson as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show&#x27;s production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major nervous breakdown. He was hospitalised in early December 1952,:136-139 just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co-written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton.

Bentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.

Milligan blamed his breakdown and the collapse of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however made sure he was surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers—Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton—so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts.

Many senior BBC staff were variously bemused and befuddled by the show&#x27;s surreal humour and it has been reported that senior programme executives erroneously referred to it as &quot;The Go On Show&quot; or even &quot;The Coon Show&quot;. The show&#x27;s title was inspired, according to Spike Milligan, by Alice the Goon, a character from the &quot;Popeye&quot; comic.

Several of the Goons&#x27; nonsense songs were recorded in the late 1950s such as the &quot;Ying Tong Song&quot;, number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956. The radio show had high audience ratings in Britain at its peak; tickets for the recording sessions at the BBC&#x27;s Camden Theatre (now known as KOKO) in London were constantly over-subscribed and the various character voices and catchphrases from the show quickly became part of the vernacular. The series has remained consistently popular ever since, with the show being broadcast weekly by Australia&#x27;s ABC network as late as 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au/rn/goons&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The show is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

The scripts exist mostly in fan-transcribed versions via dedicated websites. Although three books were published containing selected scripts, they are out of print, and typically available only in libraries or second-hand. Some more recent biographical books contain selected scripts.

There were 10 series in total, plus an additional series called &quot;Vintage Goons&quot;, recorded at the same time as the eighth series, which featured recordings of redevelopments (by Milligan) of short sketches from early shows which had not been recorded by transcription services. The first series had 17 episodes plus one special, &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1951); the second series had 25 episodes, (1952); the third series had 25 episodes plus one special - &quot;The Coronation Special&quot; (1952–53); the fourth series had 30 episodes plus one special, &quot;Archie In Goonland&quot; (1953–54); the fifth series had 26 episodes plus one special - &quot;The Starlings&quot; (1954–55); the sixth series had 27 episodes plus three specials, (1955–56); the seventh series had 25 episodes plus two specials, (1956–57); the eighth series had 26 episodes, (1957–58); the &quot;Vintage Goons&quot; were re-performances of 14 episodes from series four; the ninth series had 17 episodes, (1958–59); and the tenth series had six episodes, (1959–1960).

==Format==
Throughout its history, each episode of &quot;The Goon Show, &quot;which usually ran just under 30 minutes, was essentially structured as a comedy-variety programme, consisting of scripted comedy segments alternating with musical interludes.

The first two series were mostly produced by Dennis Main Wilson; none of the episodes was given an individual title and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted of four or five unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer Peter Eton, the musical segments took up around half the programme.:113 In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and Michael Bentine as the nominal &#x27;hero&#x27; of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart.:124 Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray, singer Ray Ellington and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number.:124 Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by Stanley Black and the BBC Dance Orchestra.:127 Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers).

From Series 3, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its &#x27;classic&#x27; format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot,:143 with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of Angela Morley (known at the time as Wally Stott), who had been writing for the show since the first series.:127 After the end of Series 3, original announcer Andrew Timothy was replaced (at the suggestion of John Snagge) by Wallace Greenslade,:127 who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.

From Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were:
*Neddie Seagoon (Secombe)
*Eccles (Milligan)
*Bluebottle (Sellers)
*Henry Crun (Sellers)
*Minnie Bannister (Milligan)
*Hercules Grytpype-Thynne (Sellers)
*Count Jim Moriarty (Milligan)
*Major Dennis Bloodnok (Sellers)

Secondary characters were the &quot;Indians&quot;, Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium &quot;Mate&quot; Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder – both played by Ray Ellington. There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer John Snagge, and actors Valentine Dyall, Dick Emery, Kenneth Connor, Dennis Price and Bernard Miles. The traditional plots involved Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty getting Neddie Seagoon involved in some far-fetched plan, and meeting the other cast members along the way.

Many characters had regular catchphrases which quickly moved into the vernacular; among the best known are:
* &quot;He&#x27;s fallen in the water!&quot; (Little Jim)
* &quot;You dirty, rotten swine, you! You have deaded me!&quot; (Bluebottle)
* &quot;You can&#x27;t get the wood, you know.&quot; (Henry, Minnie)
* &quot;You silly, twisted boy, you.&quot; (Grytpype-Thynne)
* &quot;You can&#x27;t park &#x27;ere, mate&quot; (Willium) – Milligan&#x27;s dig at officious BBC commissionaires.
* &quot;Ying Tong Iddle I Po&quot; (various) – which became the basis for a novelty hit as &quot;Ying Tong Song&quot;

===Surrealism===

&quot;The Goon Show&quot; has been variously described as &quot;avant-garde&quot;, &quot;surrealist&quot;, &quot;abstract&quot;, and &quot;four dimensional&quot;. The show played games with the medium of radio itself. Whole scenes were written in which characters would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, but it would be another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.

The show paved the way for surreal and alternative humour, as acknowledged by comedians such as Eddie Izzard.:vii The surreality was part of the attraction for Sellers, and this exacerbated his mental instability especially during the third series. 
Many of the sequences have been cited as being visionary in the way that they challenged the traditional conventions of comedy. In the Pythons&#x27; autobiography, Terry Jones states &quot;The Goons of course were my favourite. It was the surreality of the imagery and the speed of the comedy that I loved - the way they broke up the conventions of radio and played with the very nature of the medium.&quot; This is reiterated by Michael Palin and John Cleese. Cleese recalls listening to &quot;The Goon Show&quot; as a teenager in the mid-1950s &quot;and being absolutely amazed by its surreal humour. It came at a key stage in my own development and I never missed a show&quot;.

===Music and sound effects===

Orchestral introductions, links and accompaniment were provided by a hand-picked big band made up of London-based session musicians. The arrangements and musical direction were done by Angela Morley from the third to the 10th series. Morley produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve. Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist George Chisholm who frequently played Scots characters. The show&#x27;s concluding music was usually either &quot;Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead&quot; or a truncated and ironic rendition of the &quot;Alte Kameraden&quot; (Old Comrades&#x27;) march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot; as play-out music. Other theme tunes used included &quot;Goons&#x27; Gallop&quot;, a play on Devil&#x27;s Galop, &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; and &quot;Lucky Strike&quot;, which the cast sang over at the conclusion of the episode called &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot;.

In keeping with the variety requirements of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;light entertainment&quot; format, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the Ray Ellington Quartet – who performed a mixture of jazz, rhythm &amp; blues and calypso songs – and by harmonica virtuoso Max Geldray who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 1930s and 1940s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical &quot;black&quot; roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok&#x27;s nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok&#x27;s affliction) &quot;The Red Bladder&quot;.

It was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that &quot;The Goon Show&quot; broke the most new ground. Part of the problem was that &quot;not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head – he just knew when it had not yet happened&quot;.:205 An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard – which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled &quot;Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.&quot; One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (&quot;So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!&quot;).:205 Secombe noted that &quot;Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each – chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships&#x27; sirens – all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.&quot; An FX instruction in one script read &quot;Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can&#x27;t get two lions, two hippos will do&quot;. Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC&#x27;s newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.:205

Milligan&#x27;s relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding &quot;I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel – that was it, and I tried to transform it.&quot;

Many of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of &quot;musique concrète&quot;, and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary &quot;Bloodnok&#x27;s Stomach&quot; sound effect, created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok&#x27;s digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p. 218) states Bloodnok&#x27;s stomach &quot;was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts&quot;.

==Episodes and archiving==
==Running jokes==
===Lurgi===

Several of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word . In the episode &quot;Lurgi Strikes Britain&quot;, Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective &quot;dreaded&quot;). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry &quot;Eeeeyack-a-boo&quot;, though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell brass band musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in &quot;Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan&quot;, where Jim Hawkins&#x27; mother describes it as &quot;like brown spots of shit on the liver&quot;.

===Brandyyy!===
Alcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase &quot;round the back for the old brandy!&quot; or &quot;the old Marlon Brando&quot; was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In &quot;The Pam&#x27;s Paper Insurance Policy&quot; (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, &quot;I wonder where he keeps that stuff!&quot;. In &quot;The Scarlet Capsule&quot; (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington&#x27;s reply to Secombe&#x27;s cry of &quot;Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there&quot; was &quot;The introductions he gives me...&quot;. In &quot;The Moon Show&quot; (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating &quot;Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!&quot;, causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail &quot;MATE!&quot; in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.

===Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb!===
During radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling &quot;rhubarb&quot; under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in &quot;custard&quot; during these scenes (for example, in &quot;The Fear of Wages and Wings Over Dagenham&quot;, where the phrase was amended to &#x27;flying rhubarb&#x27;).

===Raspberry blowing===
As well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing of raspberries entered the Goons as Harry Secombe&#x27;s signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter. In the Goons&#x27; musical recording &quot;The Ying-Tong Song&quot;, Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone. Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia Records 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title &quot;Donkey&quot; on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show &quot;The Sinking of Westminster Pier&quot; as a sound to accompany an oyster called Fred opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts. This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot; during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to &quot;start the show&quot;.

Years later, Milligan collaborated with Ronnie Barker on &quot;The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town&quot; in which the credits read, &quot;Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan&quot;. David Jason has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker&#x27;s LWT series &quot;Six Dates with Barker&quot; (1971).

===&quot;Trapped in a piano&quot;===
In several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano. In &quot;The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon&quot;, Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises. In &quot;The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI&quot;, Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings. Grytpype-Thynne plays a &quot;do-re-mi&quot; scale to find him – Moriarty is &quot;me&quot;. When Moriarty escapes, he is two feet taller than he used to be -- someone sent in a piano tuner.

The &quot;in a piano&quot; joke was re-used one last time in &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot;.

===Other references===
Sometimes characters were introduced as &quot;scion of the house of Rowton&quot;, or &quot;member of Rowton House&quot;. This was a reference to the &quot;Rowton Houses&quot;, which were hostels for working men in London.

===Films===
*&quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004)
A re-creation of a &quot;Goon Show&quot; recording before a studio audience is seen early in the HBO Original Movie &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004), with Geoffrey Rush as Sellers, Edward Tudor-Pole as Spike Milligan, Steve Pemberton as Harry Secombe and Lance Ellington as Ray Ellington. A brief moment from that re-creation is seen in the trailer for that film.

===Stage===
*Ying Tong: A Walk with the Goons
&quot;Ying Tong&quot; is a play written by Roy Smiles which is set partly in a radio studio, partly in a mental asylum and partly in Spike Milligan&#x27;s mind. It recreates the Goons recording the show, but part way through Spike has a mental breakdown and is committed to an asylum. While it features all of the Goons throughout (although Bentine is mentioned, the fourth character represents Wallace Greenslade), the focus is on Milligan and his breakdown.

*Birmingham Comedy Festival
Birmingham Comedy Festival produced a theatre production as part of their festival in 2014 staging two Milligan Goon Show scripts, &quot;The Canal&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Head Shaver (of Brighton)&quot;. The festival produced a second touring production in 2017 featuring two more Milligan scripts, &quot;The House Of Teeth&quot; and &quot;The Jet Propelled Guided NAAFI&quot;. Both runs were sanctioned by Norma Farnes and Spike Milligan Productions. The festival returned to The Goon Show in 2023 to mark the centenary of the birth of Larry Stephens, staging &quot;The Seagoon Memoirs&quot; and &quot;The Moriarty Murder Mystery&quot;. Cast: Sellers - Richard Usher; Milligan - Robert Coletta (2014), Mark Earby (2017, 2023), Secombe - Jimm Rennie (2014, 2023), Stephan Bessant (2017); Wallace Greenslade/ Valentine Dyal - Phil Hemming (2014, 2017), Ian Danter (2024). Director by Robert F. Ball (2014, 2017); Director/Producer Dave Freak.

*Apollo Theatre Company
Touring in late 2018 in the UK, Apollo Theatre Company in conjunction with Spike Milligan Productions recreated three episodes of The Goon Show - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler, Tails of Men&#x27;s Shirts, and The Phantom Head Shaver - with recreations of the original scripts. Co-producer Norma Farnes, Milligan&#x27;s ex-manager, agreed to the use of the material on the basis the production was respectful of the scripts. The roles of Sellers, Milligan, and Secombe were played by Julian McDowell, Colin Elmer and Clive Greenwood and the production was directed by McDowell and Tim Astley.

===Radio and television===
*The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d (TV, 1956) and The Idiot Weekly (radio, 1958–1962)
&quot;The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d&quot;, which starred Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate &quot;Goon Show&quot; humour to television. Made for Associated-Rediffusion during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the Associated London Scripts cooperative including Dave Freeman and Terry Nation, with Eric Sykes as script editor. &quot;The Idiot Weekly&quot; (1958–1962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including Ray Barrett and John Bluthal. It was made for the ABC during Milligan&#x27;s numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some &quot;Goon Show&quot; scripts and included his &quot;Goon Show&quot; characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of &quot;The Idiot Weekly&quot; were remade by the BBC as &quot;The Omar Khayyam Show&quot; in 1963.

*&quot;The Telegoons&quot; (1963–1964)
&quot;The Telegoons&quot; (1963–1964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online.

*&quot;The Goon Show – The Whistling Spy Enigma&quot; (Secombe &amp; Friends) (1966)
Recorded for Harry Secombe&#x27;s six-part comedy series, of which only a portion was actually used for the original broadcast, this was similar to &quot;Tales of Men&#x27;s Shirts&quot; as a re-enactment of a radio play for television. Whilst initially it was thought that only the portion used in the TV show survived, a full copy of the performance was found by the British Film Institute.

*&quot;The Goon Show – Tales of Men&#x27;s Shirts&quot; (1968)
Essentially a re-enactment of a radio performance, the three Goons were joined by John Cleese as announcer for a special shown on Thames Television. An almost-complete copy of this broadcast is held by the British Film Institute.

*&quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot; (1972)
In 1972, the Goons reunited to perform &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot;.

*&quot;Goon Again&quot; (2001)
In 2001, the BBC recorded a &quot;new&quot; &quot;Goon Show&quot;, &quot;Goon Again&quot;, featuring Andy Secombe (son of Harry), Jon Glover and Jeffrey Holland, with Christopher Timothy (son of Andrew Timothy) announcing and Lance Ellington (son of Ray Ellington) singing, based on two lost series 3 episodes from 1953, &quot;The Story of Civilisation&quot; and &quot;The Plymouth Hoe Armada&quot;, both written by Milligan and Stephens.

===Records===
The Goons made a number of records, including &quot;I&#x27;m Walking Backwards for Christmas&quot; (originally sung by Milligan in the show to fill in during a musicians&#x27; strike), and &quot;Bloodnok&#x27;s Rock and Roll Call&quot;, the B-side of which, the &quot;Ying Tong Song&quot;, soon became more popular and was reissued as an A-side in the mid-1970s, becoming a surprise novelty hit. The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, &quot;The Raspberry Song&quot; and &quot;Rhymes&quot;.

*&quot;Bridge on the River Wye&quot; (Parlophone, 1962)
A 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller. A spoof of the film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer George Martin removed the &quot;K&quot; every time the word &quot;Kwai&quot; was uttered, creating &quot;Bridge on the River Wye&quot;. The LP is based on &quot;The Goon Show&quot;″s &quot;African Incident&quot; (30 December 1957),:183 which featured Sellers&#x27; vocal impersonation of Alec Guinness. Lewis&#x27; (1995, pp. 205–206) gives a good account of this background.

*&quot;How to Win an Election&quot; (1964)
In 1964, Milligan, Secombe and Sellers lent their voices to a comedy LP, &quot;How to Win an Election (or Not Lose by Much)&quot;, which was written by Leslie Bricusse. It was not exactly a Goons reunion, because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately. The album was reissued on CD in 1997.

==Impact on comedy and culture==
In George Perry&#x27;s book &quot;The Life of Python&quot; (1999) he comments: &quot;In the Britain of 1950, humour was derived from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, throughout the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was &quot;Take It from Here&quot;, with its polished professionalism. The other was &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.&quot;

On the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, &quot;other shows came along but &#x27;The House of Comedy&#x27; needed electricity. Then, out of the blue ... &quot;The Goons&quot; ...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, &quot;The Goon Show&quot; was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth. In &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, Spike was unknowingly portraying every facet of the British psyche&quot;.

Sykes and Milligan, along with Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, Frankie Howerd and Stanley (&quot;Scruffy&quot;) Dale, co-founded the writers&#x27; cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others such as Larry Stephens. In his book &quot;Spike &amp; Co&quot;, Graham McCann says &quot;the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot; The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and countless other strange and bold new comedies&quot;. Other ALS-related comedies such as &quot;Sykes and A...&quot;, &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot;, and &quot;Round The Horne&quot; influenced their own genres of comedy.:344–345

Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular &quot;influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as &#x27;alternative&#x27;.&quot;:vii John Cleese notes that &quot;In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before. The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N. F. Simpson&#x27;s play &quot;One Way Pendulum&quot; ... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else.&quot;:151

===The Beatles===
The Goons made a considerable impact on the humour of the Beatles, especially John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book &quot;The Goon Show Scripts&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He wrote: &quot;I was 12 when &quot;The Goon Show&quot; first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a &#x27;newspaper&#x27; called &quot;The Daily Howl&quot;. I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.&quot; Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.

In a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of &quot;Pop Go The Beatles&quot;, Lennon is also recorded as quipping &quot;Love these Goon shows&quot;. This was included in the double album and CD titled &quot; Live at the BBC&quot; (side 4, track 10 of the LP; track 62 of CD).

===Royal family===
The Goons were popular among the British royal family, particularly with Prince Charles (now King Charles III) who would often mimic the voices of the characters. Prince Philip and Princess Anne attended the recording of &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot; in 1972; Charles was unable to do so due to naval duties but sent a telegram to the cast. Charles wrote an introduction to the book &quot;More Goon Show Scripts&quot; (1973), and became patron of the Goon Show Preservation Society in 1998.

===Firesign Theatre===
The NBC radio network broadcast the programme in the United States in the mid-1950s. In 1965, Peter Bergman met and befriended Milligan during the time he worked in the UK on the BBC television programme &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;. He also saw the Beatles in concert, which gave him the inspiration to form a four-man comedy group. When he returned to the US the next year to host the radio show &quot;Radio Free Oz&quot; on KPFK-FM in Los Angeles, he teamed with Philip Proctor, Phil Austin, and David Ossman to form the Firesign Theatre. Proctor, Austin, and Ossman were big fans of the &quot;Monitor&quot; broadcasts of the &quot;Goon Show&quot;. According to Ossman:

===Monty Python===
Among the influences on Monty Python, the members of the comedy team are described as being &quot;indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the &quot;Goon Show&quot;.&quot; The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated &quot;&quot;the Goon Show&quot; influenced us enormously&quot;.:170 He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham&#x27;s book: &quot;We all loved &quot;The Goon Show&quot; in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it&quot;.:151

Similarly, in the introduction to Graham Chapman&#x27;s posthumous anthology (2006, p. xvii) Yoakum notes that while other radio comedies influenced Chapman, &quot;the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.&quot; And on page 23 Chapman states: &quot;from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener to a radio programme called &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. In fact, at that stage I wanted to &quot;be&quot; a Goon&quot;.

In their sketch &quot;Election Night Special&quot;, the Pythons gave an appreciative nod to their forebears. When one of the onscreen elections reporters asks his companion, &quot;What do you make of the nylon dog cardigan and plastic mule rest?&quot; a voice offstage yells, &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing!&quot; to which the reporter replies, &quot;Thank you, Spike.&quot;

==Deaths==
Peter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan claimed to be relieved that Secombe had died before him, because had he died before Secombe then Secombe would have been in a position to sing at his funeral. Terence &quot;Spike&quot; Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later, Milligan&#x27;s wish to have the words &quot;I told you I was ill&quot; inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as .

<doc id="29848" wikidata="Q7828" url="?curid=29848" title="Marge Simpson">
<text>Marjorie Jacqueline &quot;Marge&quot; Simpson () is a character in the American animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and part of the eponymous family (The Simpsons). Voiced by Julie Kavner, she first appeared on television in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot; on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks&#x27; office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on &quot;Life in Hell&quot; but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He based the character on his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.

Marge is the matriarch of the Simpson family. With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family&#x27;s antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top &quot;TV moms&quot;. She has appeared in other media relating to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;—including video games, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise.

Marge&#x27;s distinctive blue beehive hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride&#x27;s in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Role in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;==
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; uses a floating timeline (the characters do not physically age), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Marge Simpson is married to Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. She was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier. She has a pair of sisters, the joyless Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In &quot;The Way We Was&quot; (season two, 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met Homer, after they both were sent to detention—Homer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with Artie Ziff after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should&#x27;ve gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line. Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought their first house. The episode &quot;That &#x27;90s Show&quot; (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.

As with many &quot;Simpsons&quot; characters, Marge&#x27;s age and birthday changes to serve the story. In season one (1990) episodes &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, Marge was said to be 34. This is also the age given in &quot;The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family&quot;, a book written by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; creator, Matt Groening. In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Paternity Coot&quot; (season 17, 2006), Marge states that Emerald would have been her birthstone if she had been born three months later, placing her birthday sometime in February. In &quot;Regarding Margie&quot; (season 17, 2006), Homer mentioned that Marge was his age, meaning she could have been anywhere between 36 and 40. During this episode (Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore), Lisa questions Homer&#x27;s memory of Marge&#x27;s birthday. When he cannot remember, Marge yells that it is in May. In the season eighteen episode &quot;Marge Gamer&quot; she states that she and actor Randy Quaid share the same birthdate (October 1).

Marge has been nonworking for most of the series, choosing to be a homemaker and take care of her family. However, she has held several one-episode jobs in the course of the series. These include working as a nuclear technician alongside Homer at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in &quot;Marge Gets a Job&quot; (season four, 1992); selling houses in &quot;Realty Bites&quot; (season nine, 1997); owning her own pretzel business in &quot;The Twisted World of Marge Simpson&quot; (season eight, 1997), and working at an erotic bakery in &quot;Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes&quot; (season 20, 2008). While Marge has never expressed discontent with her role as a homemaker, she has become bored with it. In &quot;The Springfield Connection&quot; (season six, 1995), Marge decided that she needed more excitement in her life and became a police officer. However, by the end of the episode, she became upset with the corruption in the force and quit.

==Character==

===Creation===

Matt Groening first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1987 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks&#x27; office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, and had intended to present an adaptation of his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strip. When he realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening&#x27;s mother Margaret &quot;Marge&quot; Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s really weird to have people think you&#x27;re a cartoon.&quot; Marge&#x27;s beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.

Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; short &quot;Good Night&quot;. In 1989, the shorts were adapted into &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Network. Marge and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.

Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. Bill Oakley believes that the &quot;junior&quot; writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner Josh Weinstein were given several to write during their first season. During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so David M. Stern decided to write a Marge episode, which became &quot;Homer Alone&quot; (season three, 1992). He felt that they could achieve a &quot;deeper vein&quot; of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.

===Design===
The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening&#x27;s original plan for Marge&#x27;s hair was that it would conceal large, &quot;Life in Hell&quot;-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

===Voice===

Marge&#x27;s voice is performed by Julie Kavner, who also does the voices of Marge&#x27;s mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner had been part of the regular cast of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors. Part of Kavner&#x27;s contract says that she will never have to promote &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on video and she rarely performs Marge&#x27;s voice in public because she believes it &quot;destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people.&quot; Kavner takes recording sessions seriously and feels that voice acting is &quot;a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my character&#x27;s movement.&quot;

Marge&#x27;s raspy voice is only slightly different from Kavner&#x27;s, who has a &quot;honeyed gravel voice&quot; which she says is due to &quot;a bump on [her] vocal cords.&quot; While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner&#x27;s favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because &quot;they&#x27;re really funny and sad at the same time.&quot; In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, some scenes, such as Marge&#x27;s video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted. Kristen Bell provided Marge&#x27;s singing voice in &quot;The Star of the Backstage&quot;.

Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Kavner earned $250,000 per episode. After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Kavner and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.

===Personality===
Marge is generally a stereotypical sitcom mother, and she also plays the &quot;long-suffering wife&quot; who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband. While she usually takes her family&#x27;s problems with good humor, in &quot;Homer Alone&quot; (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a nervous breakdown. After spending time at &quot;Rancho Relaxo&quot;, during which her family barely coped with her absence, she returned refreshed and everyone promised to help out more often.

Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she &quot;put[s] up with a lot in [their] marriage,&quot; and has left Homer or thrown him out of the house on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is &quot;Secrets of a Successful Marriage&quot; (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an education class on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is &quot;complete and utter dependence.&quot; At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he &quot;really [does] make a gal feel needed.&quot; Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show.

Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot; (season one, 1990), where she resists Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.
Marge is more caring, understanding, and nurturing toward Bart than Homer, but she refers to him as &quot;a handful&quot; and is often embarrassed by his antics. In &quot;Marge Be Not Proud&quot; (season seven, 1995), she felt she was mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. In the beginning of the episode, Bart protested her &quot;over-mothering&quot;, but as she started becoming distant, he felt bad about it and made up with her. Marge has expressed understanding for her &quot;special little guy&quot; and has defended him on many occasions. She once said &quot;I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he&#x27;s like inside. He&#x27;s got a spark. It&#x27;s not a bad thing ... Of course, it makes him &quot;do&quot; bad things.&quot;

Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge.
Marge maintains a good relationship with her mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma, though they disapprove of Homer and are vocal about it. Marge has tolerated their criticism, but has occasionally lost patience with them, once referring to them as &quot;ghouls&quot;.

Marge&#x27;s late father Clancy is rarely referred to in the series and has had speaking parts in only two episodes. It was revealed in &quot;Fear of Flying&quot; (season six, 1994) that Clancy told Marge that he was a pilot, but in reality, he was a flight attendant. Marge discovered this one day and developed aerophobia. In &quot;Jazzy and the Pussycats&quot; (season 18, 2006), Homer casually mentions that they once attended his funeral. It was finally revealed that Clancy died of lung cancer in season 27 episode &quot;Puffless&quot;.

Marge believes she has higher morals and is more law-abiding than most other characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; and being a prominent member of the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Committee on Moral Hygiene&quot;. She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, but many of the townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms.

Marge is the only member of the family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot; (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him &quot;don&#x27;t make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can&#x27;t win.&quot; Yet, in some episodes, Marge&#x27;s stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with Lisa, who is a feminist. In &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; (season nine, 1997), an &quot;angel skeleton&quot; is discovered, much to Lisa&#x27;s skepticism. As Lisa rants about the people who believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, &quot;There has to be more to life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in.&quot;

In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show. Marge is also known to suffer OCD as shown when she won a house cleaning but she then cleaned the whole house herself and it thus led to her accidentally causing her to suffer Amnesia. Another time is when the family had to house sit for Mr. Burns, she forced Lisa and herself to clean the entire mansion.

Politically, Marge generally aligns with the Democratic Party, having supported the candidacy of her state&#x27;s progressive governor Mary Bailey, and voted for Jimmy Carter in both of his presidential elections. She was also deeply affected by the death of Lyndon B. Johnson, to the point where she wanted him to be alive so badly that she kept seeing him everywhere she looked.

==Reception==

At the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards, Kavner received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for voicing Marge in the season three episode &quot;I Married Marge&quot;. In 2004, Kavner and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer) won a Young Artist Award for &quot;Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series&quot;. For her performance in &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, Kavner was nominated for &quot;Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature&quot; at the 2007 Annie Awards, but lost to Ian Holm from &quot;Ratatouille&quot;. Kavner&#x27;s emotional performance in the movie got positive reviews and one critic said she &quot;gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever.&quot; Various episodes in which Marge is prominently featured have been nominated for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program, including &quot;The Way We Weren&#x27;t&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot;, which won the award in 1990. In 2000, Marge and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard.

Marge has been ranked highly in lists of the top television mothers of all time. She was ranked first on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list in 1994; first on Fox News&#x27; list in 2005; eighth on CityNews&#x27; list in 2008; and was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;10 Best Moms Ever&quot;. In a 2004 poll in the United Kingdom, Marge was named the &quot;most respected mother&quot; by respondents. Still in 2004, Marge was ranked third in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company. In May 2012, Marge was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of &quot;Mommy Dearest: The TV Moms You Love&quot;. AOL has named Marge the 24th &quot;Most Memorable Female TV Character&quot;. Her relationship with Homer was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot; list of &quot;The Best TV Couples of All Time&quot;.

Religious writer Kenneth Briggs has written that &quot;Marge is my candidate for sainthood ... She lives in the real world, she lives with crises, with flawed people. She forgives and she makes her own mistakes. She is a forgiving, loving person ... absolutely saintly.&quot;

Marge and Lisa are James L. Brooks&#x27;s favorite characters in the series, and the two with whom he identifies with most. Marge and Lisa are more popular than Homer and Bart in Japan, France, and many French speaking countries. Matt Groening has spoken fondly of them, though he prefers Homer and Bart. Sam Simon also prefers Homer and Bart finding Marge and Lisa to be too &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; for his tastes.

==Cultural influence==
The edition of October 1, 1990, of &quot;People&quot; included an interview with then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: &quot;She loves &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; but remains baffled after sampling &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&#x27;s a family thing, and I guess it&#x27;s clean.&quot; The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: &quot;Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I&#x27;m glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn&#x27;t know you had one. I am looking at a picture of you ... depicted on a plastic cup ... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family — Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie — are camping out. It&#x27;s a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example for the rest of the country. Please forgive a loose tongue.&quot;

In 2002, opponents of the Seattle Monorail Project planned on showing the episode &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot; at a protest event. Following complaints, 20th Century Fox sent a letter to the event organizers ordering that the episode not be shown due to copyright laws. In 2004, Marge appeared on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the Alternative Christmas message, which is annually broadcast at the same time that Queen Elizabeth II gives her Christmas message.

On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Marge and the four other members of the Simpson family. They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while the show is still in production. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009.

===Merchandising===
Marge is depicted in much &quot;The Simpsons&quot;-related merchandise, including T-shirts, baseball caps, bumper stickers, cardboard stand-ups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters and figurines. She has appeared in each of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; video games. Besides the television series, Marge regularly appears in issues of &quot;Simpsons Comics&quot;, which were published from 1993 to 2018. Marge also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.

Marge appeared in a 2005 advertisement for Dove Styling, where her normal beehive hair was exchanged for a more stylish look for a series of ads featuring several popular cartoon women.

In April 2004, Marge appeared on the cover of &quot;Maxim&quot;. She also appeared on the cover of the November 2009 issue of &quot;Playboy,&quot; becoming the first cartoon character to appear on the cover. The cover and a three-page picture spread, as well as a story inside entitled &quot;The Devil in Marge Simpson&quot;, commemorated the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, but as also part of a plan to appeal to younger readers, a decision which has been criticized due to a page in which the character is depicted nude. Darine Stern&#x27;s picture on the October 1971 cover served as the inspiration for Playboy&#x27;s November 2009 cover.

In 2024, a 3500-year-old sarcophagus was discovered in Egypt, with a human depiction that was very similar to Marge Simpson. It had yellow skin, a green dress, tall blue hair and 4 toes.

<doc id="29918" wikidata="Q1445" url="?curid=29918" title="Tamil Nadu">
<text>Tamil Nadu (; , TN) is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language—the state&#x27;s official language and one of the longest surviving classical languages of the world. The capital and largest city is Chennai.

Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula, with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and encloses a part of the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the Tamil Nadu region could have been inhabited more than 385,000 years ago by archaic humans. The state has more than 5,500 years of continuous cultural history. Historically, the Tamilakam region was inhabited by Tamil-speaking Dravidian people, who were ruled by several regimes over centuries such as the Sangam era triumvirate of the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas, the Pallavas (3rd–9th century CE), and the later Vijayanagara Empire (14th–17th century CE). European colonization began with establishing trade ports in the 17th century, with the British controlling much of the state as a part of the Madras Presidency for two centuries. After the Indian Independence in 1947, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into its current shape. The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning &quot;Tamil Country&quot;, in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.

, Tamil Nadu had an economy with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of , making it the second-largest economy amongst the 28 states of India. It has the country&#x27;s 9th-highest GSDP per capita of and ranks 11th in human development index. Tamil Nadu is also one of the most industrialised states, with the manufacturing sector accounting for nearly one-third of the state&#x27;s GDP. With its diverse culture and architecture, long coastline, forests and mountains, Tamil Nadu is home to a number of ancient relics, historic buildings, religious sites, beaches, hill stations, forts, waterfalls and four World Heritage Sites. The state&#x27;s tourism industry is the largest among the Indian states. The state has three biosphere reserves, mangrove forests, five National Parks, 18 wildlife sanctuaries and 17 bird sanctuaries. The Tamil film industry, nicknamed as Kollywood, plays an influential role in the state&#x27;s popular culture.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from Tamil language with &quot;nadu&quot; meaning &quot;land&quot; and Tamil Nadu meaning &quot;the land of Tamils&quot;. The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it. In the ancient Sangam literature, Tamilakam refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot; (2nd to 1st century BCE) indicates the borders of Tamilakam as Tirumala and Kanniyakumari. The name &quot;Tamilakam&quot; is used in other Sangam era literature such as &quot;Puṟanāṉūṟu&quot;, &quot;Patiṟṟuppattu&quot;, &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot;, and &quot;Manimekalai&quot;. &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; (5th to 6th century CE) and &quot;Ramavataram&quot; (12th century CE) mention the name &quot;Tamil Nadu&quot; to denote the region.

== History ==
=== Prehistory (before 5th century BCE) ===
Archaeological evidence indicates that the Tamil Nadu region could have been inhabited more than 385,000 years ago by archaic humans. Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago. Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language. Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE. Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which might be a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later.

=== Sangam period (5th century BCE–3rd century CE) ===
The Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the Sangam literature. Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta. The kings called &quot;Vendhar&quot; ruled over several tribes of &quot;Velala&quot; (peasants), headed by the &quot;Velir&quot; chiefs. The rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolkāppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar.

The kingdoms had significant diplomatic and trade contacts with other kingdoms to the north and with the Romans. Much of the commerce from the Romans and Han China were facilitated via seaports including Muziris and Korkai with spices being the most prized goods along with pearls and silk. From 300 CE, the region was ruled by the Kalabhras, warriors belonging to the Vellalar community, who were once feudatories of the three ancient Tamil kingdoms. The Kalabhra era is referred to as the &quot;dark period&quot; of Tamil history, and information about it is generally inferred from any mentions in the literature and inscriptions that are dated many centuries after their era ended. The twin Tamil epics Silappatikaram and Manimekalai were written during the era. Tamil classic Tirukkural by Valluvar, a collection of couplets is attributed to the same period.

=== Medieval era (4th–13th century CE) ===

Around the 7th century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas, who patronised Buddhism and Jainism before the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement. Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture: the massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples, originated with the Pallava architecture. They built the group of rock-cut monuments in Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram. Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas and Pandyas. The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the 6th century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The Pallavas were finally defeated by Chola prince Aditya I in the 9th century CE.

The Cholas became the dominant kingdom in the 9th century under Vijayalaya Chola, who established Thanjavur as Chola&#x27;s new capital with further expansions by subsequent rulers. In the 11th century CE, Rajaraja I expanded the Chola Empire with conquests of entire Southern India and parts of present-day Sri Lanka and Maldives, and increased Chola influence across the Indian Ocean. Rajaraja brought in administrative reforms including the reorganisation of Tamil country into individual administrative units. Under his son Rajendra Chola I, the Chola Empire reached its zenith and stretched as far as Bengal in the north and across the Indian Ocean. The Cholas built many temples in the Dravidian style with the most notable being the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, one of the foremost temples of the era built by Rajaraja, and Gangaikonda Cholapuram, built by Rajendra.

The Pandyas again reigned supreme early in the 13th century under Maravarman Sundara I. They ruled from their capital of Madurai and expanded trade links with other maritime empires. During the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned the Pandyas as the richest empire in existence. The Pandyas also built a number of temples including the Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai.

=== Vijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE) ===
In the 13th and 14th centuries, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate. The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in . The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates.
Later, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent. They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.

=== Later conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE) ===
In the 18th century, the Mughal Empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751–1752). This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.

Europeans started to establish trade centres from the 16th century along the eastern coast. The Portuguese arrived in 1522 and built a port named São Tomé near present-day Mylapore in Madras. In 1609, the Dutch established a settlement in Pulicat and the Danes had their establishment in Tharangambadi. On 20 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company met with the Vijayanager emperor Peda Venkata Raya and obtained a grant for land on the Coromandel coast for their trading activities. A year later, the company built Fort St. George, the first major English settlement in India, which became the nucleus of the British Raj in the region. By 1693, the French established trading posts at Pondichéry. In September 1746, the French captured Madras during the Battle of Madras. The British regained control of Madras in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and resisted a French siege attempt in 1759. The British and French competed to expand the trade which led to Battle of Wandiwash in 1760 as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. The Nawabs of the Carnatic surrendered much of their territory to the British East India Company in the north and bestowed tax revenue collection rights in the South, which led to constant conflicts with the Palaiyakkarars known as the Polygar Wars. Puli Thevar was one of the earliest opponents, joined later by Rani Velu Nachiyar of Sivagangai and Kattabomman of Panchalakurichi in the first series of Polygar wars. The Maruthu brothers along with Oomaithurai, the brother of Kattabomman, formed a coalition with Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, which fought the British in the Second Polygar War. In the later 18th century, the Mysore kingdom captured parts of the region and engaged in constant fighting with the British which culminated in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars.

By the 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region and established the Madras Presidency with Madras as the capital. After the defeat of Mysore in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799 and the British victory in the second Polygar war in 1801, the British consolidated most of southern India into what was later known as the Madras Presidency. On 10 July 1806, the Vellore mutiny, which was the first instance of a large-scale mutiny by Indian sepoys against the British East India Company, took place in Vellore Fort. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred the governance of India from the East India Company to the British crown, forming the British Raj.

Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in two severe famines in the Madras Presidency, the Great Famine of 1876–78 and the Indian famine of 1896–97 which killed millions and the migration of many Tamils as bonded laborers to other British countries eventually forming the present Tamil diaspora. The Indian Independence movement gathered momentum in the early 20th century with the formation of the Indian National Congress, which was based on an idea propagated by the members of the Theosophical Society movement after a Theosophical convention held in Madras in December 1884. Tamil Nadu was the base of various contributors to the Independence movement including V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, Subramaniya Siva and Bharatiyar. The Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the Indian National Army (INA), founded by Subhas Chandra Bose.

=== Post-Independence (1947–present) ===
After the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. Andhra state was split from the state in 1953 and the state was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning &quot;Tamil country&quot;. In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi. After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment. After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates from the 1970s, due to reform-oriented economic policies. In the 2000s, the state has become one of the most urbanized states in the country with a higher Human Development Index compared to national average.

== Environment ==
=== Geography ===


Tamil Nadu covers an area of and is the tenth-largest state in India. Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island. The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama&#x27;s Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

The Western Ghats run south along the western boundary with the highest peak at Doddabetta () in the Nilgiri Hills. The Eastern Ghats run parallel to the Bay of Bengal along the eastern coast and the strip of land between them forms the Coromandel region. They are a discontinuous range of mountains intersected by Kaveri river. Both mountain ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains which run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, extending to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border. The Deccan plateau is the elevated region bound by the mountain ranges and the plateau slopes gently from west to east resulting in major rivers arising in the Western Ghats and flowing east into the Bay of Bengal.

The coastline of Tamil Nadu is long, and is the second longest state coastline in the country after Gujarat. There are coral reefs located in the Gulf of Mannar and Lakshadweep islands. Tamil Nadu&#x27;s coastline was permanently altered by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004.

=== Geology ===
Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II and III. The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan plateau were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The predominant soils of Tamil Nadu are red loam, laterite, black, alluvial and saline. Red soil, with a higher iron content, occupies a larger portion of the state and all the inland districts. Black soil is found in western Tamil Nadu and parts of the southern coast. Alluvial soil is found in the fertile Kaveri delta region, with laterite soil found in pockets, and saline soil across the coast where the evaporation is high.

=== Climate ===

The region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall. Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri delta. A tropical wet and dry climate prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above ; summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding ; and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry. A hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats which includes inland south and south central parts of the state and gets between of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around . The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around , with precipitation. Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture.

The southwest monsoon from June to September accounts for most of the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon hits the Western Ghats from Kerala and moves northward along the Konkan coast, with precipitation on the western region of the state. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau; hence, the leeward region (the region deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of the southwest monsoon heads toward northeast India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the southwest monsoon, due to the shape of the land. Northern Tamil Nadu receives most of its rains from the northeast monsoon. The northeast monsoon takes place from November to early March, when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall. The annual rainfall of the state is about of which 48 per cent is through the northeast monsoon, and 52 per cent through the southwest monsoon. The state has only 3% of the water resources nationally and is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources. Monsoon failures lead to acute water scarcity and severe drought.

=== Flora and fauna ===

Forests occupy an area of constituting 17.4% of the geographic area. There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in Tamil Nadu, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior. The southern Western Ghats have rain forests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The Western Ghats eco-region is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu, 5640 species of angiosperms (including 1,559 species of medicinal plants, 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants, 230 red-listed species), 64 species of gymnosperms (including four indigenous species and 60 introduced species) and 184 species of pteridophytes apart from bryophytes, lichen, fungi, algae, and bacteria. Common plant species include the state tree: palmyra palm, eucalyptus, rubber, cinchona, clumping bamboos (&quot;Bambusa arundinacea&quot;), common teak, &quot;Anogeissus latifolia&quot;, Indian laurel, grewia, and blooming trees like Indian laburnum, ardisia, and solanaceae. Rare and unique plant life includes &quot;Combretum ovalifolium&quot;, ebony (&quot;Diospyros nilagrica&quot;), &quot;Habenaria rariflora&quot; (orchid), &quot;Alsophila&quot;, &quot;Impatiens elegans&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus reniformis&quot;, and royal fern.

Important ecological regions of Tamil Nadu are the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in the Nilgiri Hills, the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve in the Agastya Mala-Cardamom Hills and Gulf of Mannar coral reefs. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. It is home to endangered aquatic species, including dolphins, dugongs, whales and sea cucumbers. Bird sanctuaries, including Thattekad, Kadalundi, Vedanthangal, Ranganathittu, Kumarakom, Neelapattu, and Pulicat, are home to numerous migratory and local birds.

Protected areas cover an area of , constituting 2.54% of the geographic area and 15% of the recorded forest area of the state. Mudumalai National Park was established in 1940 and was the first modern wildlife sanctuary in South India. The protected areas are administered by the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the government of India and the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Pichavaram consists of a number of islands interspersing the Vellar estuary in the north and Coleroon estuary in the south with mangrove forests. The Pichavaram mangrove forests is one of the largest mangrove forests in India covering and supports the existence of rare varieties of economically important shells, fishes and migrant birds. The state has five National Parks covering Anamalai, Mudumalai, Mukurthi, Gulf of Mannar, a marine national park and Guindy, an urban national park within Chennai. Tamil Nadu has 18 wildlife sanctuaries. Tamil Nadu is home to one of the largest populations of endangered Bengal tigers and Indian elephants in India. There are five declared elephant sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu as per Project ElephantAgasthyamalai, Anamalai, Coimbatore, Nilgiris and Srivilliputtur. Tamil Nadu participates in Project Tiger and has five declared tiger reservesAnamalai, Kalakkad-Mundanthurai, Mudumalai, Sathyamangalam and Megamalai. There are seventeen declared bird sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu.

There is one conservation reserve at Tiruvidaimarudur in Thanjavur district. There are two zoos recognised by the Central Zoo Authority of India namely Arignar Anna Zoological Park and Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, both located in Chennai. The state has other smaller zoos run by local administrative bodies such as Coimbatore Zoo in Coimbatore, Amirthi Zoological Park in Vellore, Kurumpampatti Wildlife Park in Salem, Yercaud Deer Park in Yercaud, Mukkombu Deer Park in Tiruchirapalli and Ooty Deer Park in Nilgiris. There are five crocodile farms located at Amaravati in Coimbatore district, Hogenakkal in Dharmapuri district, Kurumbapatti in Salem district, Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in Chennai and Sathanur in Tiruvannamalai district. Threatened and endangered species found in the region include the grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, sloth bear, Nilgiri tahr, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, and the Indian leopard.

== Administration and politics ==
=== Administration ===
Chennai is the capital of the state and houses the state executive, legislative and head of judiciary. The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments. There are 43 departments of the state and the departments have further sub-divisions which may govern various undertakings and boards. The state is divided into 38 districts, each of which is administered by a District Collector, who is an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) appointed to the district by the Government of Tamil Nadu. For revenue administration, the districts are further subdivided into 87 revenue divisions administered by Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) which comprise 310 taluks administered by Tahsildars. The taluks are divided into 1349 revenue blocks called &quot;Firkas&quot; which consist of 17,680 revenue villages.

Regional parties have ruled ever since. The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E. V. Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency and led to the formation of the Justice party. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the chief minister of the Madras Presidency. In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics. After independence, the Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K. Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. C. N. Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949.

The Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu led to the rise of Dravidian parties that formed Tamil Nadu&#x27;s first government, in 1967. In 1972, a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran.

Karunanidhi became the leader of the DMK after Annadurai and J. Jayalalithaa succeeded as the leader of AIADMK after M. G. Ramachandran.

===Literature===
Tamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era. Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India. This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;, and the epics &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; and &quot;Manimekalai&quot;. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and &quot;hero stones&quot; date from around the 3rd century BCE. The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku consisting of Eṭṭuttokai and the Pattupattu, and the Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book &#x27; based on the &quot;Tolkāppiyam.&quot; Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely &#x27;, &quot;sol&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;yāppu&quot;, &#x27;. &quot;Tirukkural&quot;, a book on ethics by Thiruvalluvar, is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature.

The Tamil literature that followed in the next 300 years after the Sangam period is generally called the &quot;post-Sangam&quot; literature which included the Five Great Epics and the Five Minor Epics.
In the early medieval period, Vaishnava and Shaiva literature became prominent following the Bhakti movement in the sixth century CE with hymns composed by the Alvars and the Nayanars. In the following years, Tamil literature again flourished with notable works including Ramavataram, written in the 12th century CE by Kambar. After a lull in the intermediate years due to various invasions and instability, the Tamil literature recovered in the 14th century CE, with the notable work being &quot;Tiruppukal&quot; by Arunagirinathar. In 1578, the Portuguese published a Tamil book in old Tamil script named &quot;Thambiraan Vanakkam&quot;, thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. &quot;Tamil Lexicon&quot;, published by the University of Madras, is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language. The 19th century gave rise to the Tamil Renaissance and writings and poems by authors such as Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, U.V. Swaminatha Iyer, Ramalinga Swamigal, Maraimalai Adigal, and Bharathidasan. During the Indian Independence Movement, many Tamil poets and writers sought to provoke national spirit, social equity and secularist thoughts, notably Subramania Bharati and Bharathidasan.

===Architecture===
Dravidian architecture is the distinct style of rock architecture in Tamil Nadu. In Dravidian architecture, the temples consisted of porches or &quot;mantapas&quot; preceding the door leading to the sanctum, gate-pyramids or &quot;gopurams&quot; in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple, and &quot;pillared halls&quot; used for many purposes. These features are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the &quot;kalyani&quot; or &quot;pushkarni&quot;. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature of koils and Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the &quot;kalasam&quot;, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The gopuram&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram. The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple&#x27;s outer appearance. The state emblem also features the Lion Capital of Ashoka with an image of a Gopuram on the background. &quot;Vimanam&quot; are similar structures built over the &quot;garbhagriha&quot; or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture with a few exceptions including the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur.

The Mugal influence in medieval times and the British influence later gave rise to a blend of Hindu, Islamic and Gothic revival styles, resulting in the distinct Indo-Saracenic architecture. Several buildings and institutions built during the British era followed the style. By the early 20th century, art deco made its entry in the urban landscape. After Indian Independence, Tamil architecture witnessed a rise in Modernism with the transition from lime-and-brick construction to concrete columns.

It is one of the two longest-surviving classical languages in India, along with Sanskrit, attested since 300 BCE. The language belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian language family and shares close ties with Malayalam and Kannada. Despite external influences, Tamil has retained a sense of linguistic purism, especially in formal and literary contexts.

Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders, with inscriptions found in places like Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Egypt. The language has a well-documented history with literary works like Sangam literature, consisting of over 2,000 poems. Tamil script evolved from Tamil Brahmi, and later, the vatteluttu script was used until the current script was standardized. The language has a distinct grammatical structure, with agglutinative morphology that allows for complex word formations.

Tamil is predominantly spoken in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, India, as well as the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. It has significant speaking populations in Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and among diaspora communities. Tamil was recognized as a classical language by the Indian government in 2004.

== Etymology ==
The earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the Pandiyan Kings for the organization of long-term Tamil Sangams, which researched, developed and made amendments to the Tamil language. Although the name of the language which was developed by these Tamil Sangams is mentioned as Tamil, the period when the name &quot;Tamil&quot; came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in Tholkappiyam, which is dated as early as the 2nd century BCE. The Hathigumpha inscription, inscribed around a similar period (150 BCE) by Kharavela, the Jain king of Kalinga, also refers to a &quot;Tamira Samghatta&quot; (&quot;Tamil confederacy&quot;)

The Samavayanga Sutra, dated to the 3rd century BCE contains a reference to a Tamil script named &#x27;Damili&#x27;.

Southworth suggests that the name comes from &gt; &quot;self-speak&quot;, or &quot;our own speech&quot;. Kamil Zvelebil suggests an etymology of , with meaning &quot;self&quot; or &quot;one&#x27;s self&quot;, and &quot;&quot; having the connotation of &quot;unfolding sound&quot;. Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of &lt; &lt; * &lt; *, meaning in origin &quot;the proper process (of speaking)&quot;. However, this is deemed unlikely by Southworth due to the contemporary use of the compound &#x27;centamiḻ&#x27;, which means refined speech in the earliest literature.

The Tamil Lexicon of the University of Madras defines the word &quot;Tamil&quot; as &quot;sweetness&quot;. S. V. Subramanian suggests the meaning &quot;sweet sound&quot;, from &quot;tam&quot; – &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;il&quot; – &quot;sound&quot;.

David Shulman cites Cuntaramurti&#x27;s &quot;Tevaram&quot;, in which he writes to Shiva, &quot;Do you know proper Tamil?&quot; and ascribes it the meaning &quot;Do you know how to behave properly as a male lover should? Can you understand the hints and implicit meaning that a proficient lover ought to be able to decipher?&quot; He also states that at some point in history, Tamil meant something like &quot;knowing how to love&quot;, in a poetic sense, and that to &quot;know Tamil&quot; could also mean &quot;to be a civilized being&quot;.

== Classification ==

&quot;Tamil&quot; belongs to the southern branch of the Dravidian languages, a family of around 26 languages native to the Indian subcontinent. It is also classified as being part of a Tamil language family that, alongside Tamil proper, includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups such as the Irula and Yerukula languages (see SIL Ethnologue).

The closest major relative of Tamil is Malayalam; the two began diverging around the 9th century CE. Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam demonstrate a pre-historic divergence of the western dialect, the process of separation into a distinct language, Malayalam, was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.

Additionally Kannada is also relatively close to the Tamil language and shares the format of the formal ancient Tamil language. While there are some variations from the Tamil language, Kannada still preserves a lot from its roots. As part of the southern family of Indian languages and situated relatively close to the northern parts of India, Kannada also shares some Sanskrit words, similar to Malayalam. Many of the formerly used words in Tamil have been preserved with little change in Kannada. This shows a relative parallel to Tamil, even as Tamil has undergone some changes in modern ways of speaking.

== History ==

=== Legendary origins ===

According to Hindu legend, Tamil or in personification form Tamil Thāi (Mother Tamil) was created by Lord Shiva. Murugan, revered as the Tamil God, along with sage Agastya, brought it to the people.

===Historical origins===
Tamil, like other Dravidian languages, ultimately descends from the Proto-Dravidian language, which was most likely spoken around the third millennium BCE, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India, but it has also been related to the Harappan civilization.

Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods: Old Tamil (300 BCE–700 CE), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present).

===Brahmi script===
About 60,000 of the approximately 100,000 inscriptions found by the Archaeological Survey of India in India are in Tamil Nadu. Of them, most are in Tamil, with only about 5 percent in other languages.
In 2004, a number of skeletons were found buried in earthenware urns dating from at least 696 BCE in Adichanallur. Some of these urns contained writing in Tamil Brahmi script, and some contained skeletons of Tamil origin. Between 2017 and 2018, 5,820 artifacts have been found in Keezhadi. These were sent to Beta Analytic in Miami, Florida, for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating. One sample containing Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions was claimed to be dated to around 580 BCE.

John Guy states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BCE with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. There are a number of apparent Tamil loanwords in Biblical Hebrew dating to before 500 BCE, the oldest attestation of the language.

=== Old Tamil ===

Old Tamil is the period of the Tamil language spanning the 3rd century BCE to the 8th century CE. The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from 300 BCE to 700 CE. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil-Brahmi. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;, an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the late 2nd century BCE. Many literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as Sangam literature. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st century BCE and 5th century CE.

=== Middle Tamil ===
The evolution of Old Tamil into Middle Tamil, which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century, was characterised by a number of phonological and grammatical changes. In phonological terms, the most important shifts were the virtual disappearance of the aytam (ஃ), an old phoneme, the coalescence of the alveolar and dental nasals, and the transformation of the alveolar plosive into a rhotic. In grammar, the most important change was the emergence of the present tense. The present tense evolved out of the verb &#x27; (), meaning &quot;to be possible&quot; or &quot;to befall&quot;. In Old Tamil, this verb was used as an aspect marker to indicate that an action was micro-durative, non-sustained or non-lasting, usually in combination with a time marker such as &#x27; (). In Middle Tamil, this usage evolved into a present tense marker – &quot;&quot; () – which combined the old aspect and time markers.

=== Modern Tamil ===
The Nannūl remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil. Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil – instead, negation is expressed either morphologically or syntactically. Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions, and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.

Contact with European languages affected written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the syntactic argument structure of English.

In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries published a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named &quot;Thambiran Vanakkam&quot;, thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. The &quot;Tamil Lexicon&quot;, published by the University of Madras, was one of the earliest dictionaries published in Indian languages.

A strong strain of linguistic purism emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the Pure Tamil Movement which called for removal of all Sanskritic elements from Tamil. It received some support from Dravidian parties. This led to the replacement of a significant number of Sanskrit loanwords by Tamil equivalents, though many others remain.

According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.

== Geographic distribution ==
Tamil is the primary language of the majority of the people residing in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, (in India) and in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The language is spoken among small minority groups in other states of India which include Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India and in certain regions of Sri Lanka such as Colombo and the hill country. Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century CE. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern Andhra Pradesh districts of Chittoor and Nellore until the 12th century CE. Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as Kolar, Mysore, Mandya and Bengaluru.

There are currently sizeable Tamil-speaking populations descended from colonial-era migrants in Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Mauritius, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, and Vietnam. Tamil is used as one of the languages of education in Malaysia, along with English, Malay and Mandarin. A large community of Pakistani Tamils speakers exists in Karachi, Pakistan, which includes Tamil-speaking Hindus as well as Christians and Muslims – including some Tamil-speaking Muslim refugees from Sri Lanka. There are about 100 Tamil Hindu families in Madrasi Para colony in Karachi. They speak impeccable Tamil along with Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi. Many in Réunion, Guyana, Fiji, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago have Tamil origins, but only a small number speak the language. In Reunion where the Tamil language was forbidden to be learnt and used in public space by France it is now being relearnt by students and adults. Tamil is also spoken by migrants from Sri Lanka and India in Canada, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Australia.

== Legal status ==

Tamil is the official language of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one of the 22 languages under schedule 8 of the constitution of India. It is one of the official languages of the union territories of Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Tamil is also one of the official languages of Singapore. Tamil is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka, along with Sinhala. It was once given nominal official status in the Indian state of Haryana, purportedly as a rebuff to Punjab, though there was no attested Tamil-speaking population in the state, and was later replaced by Punjabi, in 2010. In Malaysia, 543 primary education government schools are available fully in Tamil as the medium of instruction. The establishment of Tamil-medium schools has been in process in Myanmar to provide education completely in Tamil language by the Tamils who settled there 200 years ago. Tamil language is available as a course in some local school boards and major universities in Canada and the month of January has been declared &quot;Tamil Heritage Month&quot; by the Parliament of Canada. Tamil enjoys a special status of protection under Article 6(b), Chapter 1 of the Constitution of South Africa and is taught as a subject in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province. Recently, it has been rolled out as a subject of study in schools in the French overseas department of Réunion.

In addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the Government of India and following a political campaign supported by several Tamil associations, Tamil became the first legally recognised Classical language of India. The recognition was announced by the contemporaneous President of India, Abdul Kalam, who was a Tamilian himself, in a joint sitting of both houses of the Indian Parliament on 6 June 2004.

== Dialects ==

=== Region-specific variations ===

The socio-linguistic situation of Tamil is characterised by diglossia: there are two separate registers varying by socioeconomic status, a high register and a low one. Tamil dialects are primarily differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for &quot;here&quot;—&#x27; in &quot;Centamil&quot; (the classic variety)—has evolved into &#x27; in the Kongu dialect of Coimbatore, &quot;inga&quot; in the dialects of Thanjavur and Palakkad, and &#x27; in some dialects of Sri Lanka. Old Tamil&#x27;s &#x27; (where &#x27; means place) is the source of &#x27; in the dialect of Tirunelveli, Old Tamil &#x27; is the source of &#x27; in the dialect of Madurai, and &quot; in some northern dialects. Even now, in the Coimbatore area, it is common to hear &quot; meaning &quot;that place&quot;. Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. Tamil dialects include Central Tamil dialect, Kongu Tamil, Madras Bashai, Madurai Tamil, Nellai Tamil, Kumari Tamil in India; Batticaloa Tamil dialect, Jaffna Tamil dialect, Negombo Tamil dialect in Sri Lanka; and Malaysian Tamil in Malaysia. Sankethi dialect in Karnataka has been heavily influenced by Kannada.

==== Loanword variations ====

The dialect of the district of Palakkad in Kerala has many Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam&#x27;s syntax, and has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the &quot;Vaishnava paribasai&quot;, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person&#x27;s caste by their speech. For example, Tamil Brahmins tend to speak a variety of dialects that are all collectively known as Brahmin Tamil. These dialects tend to have softer consonants (with consonant deletion also common). These dialects also tend to have many Sanskrit loanwords. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.

== Spoken and literary variants ==


In addition to its dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language (&#x27;), a modern literary and formal style (&#x27;), and a modern colloquial form (&#x27;). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write &#x27; with a vocabulary drawn from &#x27;, or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking &#x27;.

In modern times, &#x27; is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, &#x27; has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of &#x27;. Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in &#x27;, and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience. The increasing use of &#x27; in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial &#x27;standard&#x27; spoken dialects. In India, the &#x27;standard&#x27; &#x27;, rather than on any one dialect, but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of Thanjavur and Madurai. In Sri Lanka, the standard is based on the dialect of Jaffna.

== Writing system ==


After Tamil Brahmi fell out of use, Tamil was written using a script called  amongst others such as Grantha and Pallava. The current Tamil script consists of 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character, the &quot;āytam&quot;. The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 × 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel &quot;a&quot;, as with other Indic scripts. This inherent vowel is removed by adding a tittle called a &quot;&quot;, to the consonantal sign. For example, is &quot;ṉa&quot; (with the inherent &quot;a&quot;) and is &quot;ṉ&quot; (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called virama, but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible &quot;puḷḷi&quot; to indicate a &#x27;dead consonant&#x27; (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and unvoiced plosives. Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of Tamil phonology.

In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the Grantha script, which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. ISO 15919 is an international standard for the transliteration of Tamil and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to Latin script, and thus the alphabets of various languages, including English.

=== Numerals and symbols ===

Apart from the usual numerals, Tamil has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, and numeral are present as well. Tamil also uses several historical fractional signs.

== Phonology ==

, , and are only found in loanwords and may be considered marginal phonemes, though they are traditionally not seen as fully phonemic.

Tamil has two diphthongs: &#x27; and &#x27;, the latter of which is restricted to a few lexical items.

== Grammar ==



Tamil employs agglutinative grammar, where suffixes are used to mark noun class, number, and case, verb tense and other grammatical categories. Tamil&#x27;s standard metalinguistic terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, as opposed to the Sanskrit that is standard for most Indo-Aryan languages.

Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;. Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th-century grammar &#x27; which restated and clarified the rules of the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;, with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.

Tamil words consist of a lexical root to which one or more affixes are attached. Most Tamil affixes are suffixes. Tamil suffixes can be derivational suffixes, which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or inflectional suffixes, which mark categories such as person, number, mood, tense, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of agglutination, which can lead to long words with many suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. To give an example, the word &quot;pōkamuṭiyātavarkaḷukkāka&quot; (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means &quot;for the sake of those who cannot go&quot; and consists of the following morphemes:

=== Morphology ===

Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (&#x27;)—the &quot;rational&quot; (&#x27;), and the &quot;irrational&quot; (&quot;&quot;)—which include a total of five classes (&quot;pāl&quot;, which literally means &quot;gender&quot;). Humans and deities are classified as &quot;rational&quot;, and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The &quot;rational&quot; nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes (&quot;pāl&quot;)—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The &quot;irrational&quot; nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes: irrational singular and irrational plural. The &quot;pāl&quot; is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an honorific, gender-neutral, singular form.

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of cases or postpositions. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in Sanskrit. These were the nominative, accusative, dative, sociative, genitive, instrumental, locative, and ablative. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case. Tamil nouns can take one of four prefixes: &quot;i&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;e&quot; which are functionally equivalent to the demonstratives in English. For example, the word &quot;vazhi&quot; (வழி) meaning &quot;way&quot; can take these to produce &quot;ivvazhi&quot; (இவ்வழி) &quot;this way&quot;, &quot;avvazhi&quot; (அவ்வழி) &quot;that way&quot;, &quot;uvvazhi&quot; (உவ்வழி) &quot;the medial way&quot; and &quot;evvazhi&quot; (எவ்வழி) &quot;which way&quot;.

Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes, which show person, number, mood, tense, and voice.
* Person and number are indicated by suffixing the oblique case of the relevant pronoun. The suffixes to indicate tenses and voice are formed from grammatical particles, which are added to the stem.
* Tamil has two voices. The first indicates that the subject of the sentence &quot;undergoes&quot; or &quot;is the object of&quot; the action named by the verb stem, and the second indicates that the subject of the sentence &quot;directs&quot; the action referred to by the verb stem.
* Tamil has three simple tenses—past, present, and future—indicated by the suffixes, as well as a series of perfects indicated by compound suffixes. Mood is implicit in Tamil, and is normally reflected by the same morphemes which mark tense categories. Tamil verbs also mark evidentiality, through the addition of the hearsay clitic &quot;.&quot; Verb inflection is shown below using example &quot;aḻintukkoṇṭiruntēṉ&quot;; (அழிந்துக்கொண்டிருந்தேன்); &quot;(I) was being destroyed&quot;.

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, including both of them under the category &quot;uriccol&quot;, although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds. Tamil has many ideophones that act as adverbs indicating the way the object in a given state &quot;says&quot; or &quot;sounds&quot;.

Tamil does not have articles. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number &quot;one&quot; as an indefinite article, or by the context. In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between inclusive pronouns &#x27; (we), &#x27; (our) that include the addressee and exclusive pronouns &#x27; (we), &#x27; (our) that do not.

=== Syntax ===
Tamil is a consistently head-final language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a null-subject language. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs, and objects. It is possible to construct grammatically valid and meaningful sentences which lack one or more of the three. For example, a sentence may only have a verb—such as &#x27; (&quot;completed&quot;)—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as &#x27; (&quot;That [is] my house&quot;). Tamil does not have a copula (a linking verb equivalent to the word &quot;is&quot;). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

== Vocabulary ==

The vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. A strong sense of linguistic purism is found in Modern Tamil, which opposes the use of foreign loanwords. Nonetheless, a number of words used in classical and modern Tamil are loanwords from the languages of neighbouring groups, or with whom the Tamils had trading links, including Malay (e.g. &quot;sago&quot; from Malay ), Chinese (for example, &quot;skiff&quot; from Chinese san-pan) and Greek (for example, from Greek ὥρα). In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from Urdu and Marathi, reflecting groups that have influenced the Tamil area at times, and from neighbouring languages such as Telugu, Kannada, and Sinhala. During the modern period, words have also been adapted from European languages, such as Portuguese, French, and English.

The strongest effect of purism in Tamil has been on words taken from Sanskrit. During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc., was influenced by Sanskrit in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles, reflecting the increased trend of Sanskritisation in the Tamil country. Tamil vocabulary never became quite as heavily Sanskritised as that of the other Dravidian languages, and unlike in those languages, it was and remains possible to express complex ideas (including in science, art, religion and law) without the use of Sanskrit loan words. In addition, Sanskritisation was actively resisted by a number of authors of the late medieval period, culminating in the 20th century in a movement called &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;pure Tamil movement&quot;), led by Parithimaar Kalaignar and Maraimalai Adigal, which sought to remove the accumulated influence of Sanskrit on Tamil. As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, literature and public speeches has seen a marked decline in the use Sanskrit loan words in the past few decades, under some estimates having fallen from 40 to 50% to about 20%. As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and abstract nouns.

In the 20th century, institutions and learned bodies have, with government support, generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing neologisms and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages. the language had a listed vocabulary of over 470,000 unique words, including those from old literary sources. In November 2019, the state government issued an order to add 9,000 new words to the vocabulary.

== Influence ==
Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. A notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is &quot;orange&quot;, via Sanskrit from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil &#x27;fragrant fruit&#x27;. One suggestion as to the origin of the word &quot;anaconda&quot; is the Tamil &#x27;having killed an elephant&#x27;. Examples in English include &quot;cheroot&quot; ( meaning &#x27;rolled up&#x27;), &quot;mango&quot; (from ), &quot;mulligatawny&quot; (from &#x27;pepper water&#x27;), &quot;pariah&quot; (from ), &quot;curry&quot; (from ), &quot;catamaran&quot; (from &#x27;bundled logs&#x27;), and &quot;congee&quot; (from &#x27;rice porridge&#x27; or &#x27;gruel&#x27;).

<text>Truth or verity is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. In everyday language, it is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences.

Truth is usually held to be the opposite of false statement. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, law, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion, including journalism and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. Most commonly, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to a mind-independent world. This is called the correspondence theory of truth.

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. There are many different questions about the nature of truth which are still the subject of contemporary debates. These include the question of defining truth; whether it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth; identifying things as truth-bearers capable of being true or false; if truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if there are other truth values; identifying the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood; the role that truth plays in constituting knowledge; and, if truth is always absolute or if it can be relative to one&#x27;s perspective.

==Etymology and ordinary usage==
The English word &quot;truth&quot; is derived from Old English , Middle English , cognate to Old High German , Old Norse . Like &quot;troth&quot;, it is a &quot;-th&quot; nominalisation of the adjective &quot;true&quot; (Old English ).

The English word &quot;true&quot; is from Old English (West Saxon) , cognate to Old Saxon , Old High German (Modern German &quot;faithful&quot;), Old Norse , Gothic , all from a Proto-Germanic &quot;*trewwj-&quot; &quot;having good faith&quot;, perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- &quot;tree&quot;, on the notion of &quot;steadfast as an oak&quot; (e.g., Sanskrit  &quot;(piece of) wood&quot;). Old Norse &#x27;, &quot;faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief&quot; (archaic English &quot;troth&quot; &quot;loyalty, honesty, good faith&quot;, compare &#x27;).

Thus, &quot;truth&quot; in its ordinary usage involves both the quality of &quot;faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity&quot;, and that of &quot;agreement with fact or reality&quot;, in Anglo-Saxon expressed by &quot;sōþ&quot; (Modern English &quot;sooth&quot;).

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth &quot;fidelity&quot; and truth &quot;factuality&quot;. To express &quot;factuality&quot;, North Germanic opted for nouns derived from &quot;to assert, affirm&quot;, while continental West Germanic (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of &quot;faith, trust, pact&quot; (cognate to Slavic &quot;věra&quot; &quot;(religious) faith&quot;, but influenced by Latin ). Romance languages use terms following the Latin , while the Greek , Russian , South Slavic &quot;istina&quot; and Sanskrit (related to English &quot;sooth&quot; and North Germanic ) have separate etymological origins.

In some modern contexts, the word &quot;truth&quot;, like the adjective &quot;true&quot;, is used to refer to fidelity to an original or standard. It can also be used in the context of being &quot;true to oneself&quot; in the sense of acting with authenticity.

==Major theories==

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.

Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean toward correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean toward deflationary theories and 14% epistemic theories.

===Substantive===
====Correspondence====

Correspondence theories emphasize that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to &quot;things&quot; according to whether it accurately describes those &quot;things&quot;. A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: &quot;Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus&quot; (&quot;Truth is the adequation of things and intellect&quot;), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli. Aquinas also restated the theory as: &quot;A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality&quot;.

Correspondence theory centres around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as &quot;objective reality&quot; and then representing it in thoughts, words, and other symbols. Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors. For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The German word &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may &quot;know&quot; what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in agglutinative languages). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski, whose semantic theory is summarized further on.

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases, and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth or in what the contents of truth consist.

====Coherence====
For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system. A central tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to an individual proposition only in virtue of its relationship to that system as a whole. Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics. Formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various alternative geometries. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the natural world, empirical data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers, particularly of Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, along with the British philosopher F. H. Bradley. They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of logical positivism, notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel.

====Pragmatic====
Three influential forms of the &quot;pragmatic theory of truth&quot; were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they all hold that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one&#x27;s concepts into practice.

Peirce defines it: &quot;Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.&quot; This statement stresses Peirce&#x27;s view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as &quot;fallibilism&quot; and &quot;reference to the future&quot;, are essential to a proper conception of truth. Although Peirce uses words like &quot;concordance&quot; and &quot;correspondence&quot; to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than &quot;nominal&quot; definitions, which he accords a lower status than &quot;real&quot; definitions.

James&#x27; version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that &quot;the &#x27;true&#x27; is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the &#x27;right&#x27; is only the expedient in our way of behaving.&quot; By this, James meant that truth is a &quot;quality&quot;, the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, &quot;pragmatic&quot;).

Dewey, less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical, or cultural, is self-corrective over time &quot;if&quot; openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine, and/or refute proposed truths.

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as &quot;negative pragmatism&quot;. Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works. Philosopher of science Richard Feynman also subscribed to it: &quot;We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.&quot; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. For Peirce, the idea of &quot;endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief&quot; fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. As Feynman noted, an idea or theory &quot;could never be proved right, because tomorrow&#x27;s experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.&quot; Similarly, James and Dewey&#x27;s ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is &quot;self-corrective&quot; over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, &quot;...if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.&quot;

====Constructivist====
Social constructivism holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as &quot;constructed,&quot; because it does not reflect any external &quot;transcendent&quot; realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold). Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, are socially constructed.

Giambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico&#x27;s epistemological orientation unfolds in one axiom: &quot;verum ipsum factum&quot;—&quot;truth itself is constructed&quot;. Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth, but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is &quot;in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history&quot; and ideological knowledge is &quot;an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement&quot;.

====Consensus====
Consensus theory holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of &quot;truth&quot; is the philosopher Jürgen Habermas. Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation. Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher.

===Minimalist===
====Deflationary====
Modern developments in the field of philosophy have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term &quot;truth&quot; does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of &quot;truth predicates&quot; (e.g., that some particular thing &quot;...is true&quot;) which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century. From this point of view, to assert that &quot;&#x27;2 + 2 = 4&#x27; is true&quot; is logically equivalent to asserting that &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;, and the phrase &quot;is true&quot; is—philosophically, if not practically (see: &quot;Michael&quot; example, below)—completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilize a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account, and work with sentence structures as actually employed in common discourse, can be broadly described:
* as &quot;deflationary&quot; theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words &quot;true&quot; or &quot;truth&quot;,
* as &quot;disquotational&quot; theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
* as &quot;minimalist&quot; theories of truth.

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that &quot;the predicate &#x27;true&#x27; is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.&quot; Once we have identified the truth predicate&#x27;s formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it &quot;does&quot; appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., Semantic paradoxes, and below.)

The scope of deflationary principles is generally limited to representations that resemble sentences. They do not encompass a broader range of entities that are typically considered true or otherwise. In addition, some deflationists point out that the concept employed in &quot;...is true&quot; formulations does enable us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences; for example, one cannot express confidence in Michael&#x27;s accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:

This assertion can instead be succinctly expressed by saying: &quot;What Michael says is true&quot;.

=====Redundancy and related=====
An early variety of deflationary theory is the redundancy theory of truth, so-called because—in examples like those above, e.g. &quot;snow is white [is true]&quot;—the concept of &quot;truth&quot; is redundant and need not have been articulated; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held that the use of words like &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a &quot;linguistic muddle&quot;.

A variant of redundancy theory is the &quot;disquotational&quot; theory, which uses a modified form of the logician Alfred Tarski&#x27;s schema: proponents observe that to say that &quot;&#x27;P&#x27; is true&quot; &quot;is&quot; to assert &quot;P&quot;. A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams (in his book &quot;What is Truth?&quot;). Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey&#x27;s claims. They argue that utterances such as &quot;that&#x27;s true&quot;, when said in response to (e.g.) &quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot;, are &quot;prosentences&quot;—expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. In the same way that &quot;it&quot; means the same as &quot;my dog&quot; in the statement &quot;my dog was hungry, so I fed it&quot;, &quot;that&#x27;s true&quot; is supposed to mean the same as &quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot; when the former is said in reply to the latter. 

As noted above, proponents of these ideas do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a &quot;property;&quot; rather, they can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion &quot;P&quot; &quot;may well&quot; involve a substantial truth—it is only the redundancy involved in statements such as &quot;that&#x27;s true&quot; (i.e., a prosentence) which is to be minimized.

====Performative====
Attributed to philosopher P. F. Strawson is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say &quot;&#x27;Snow is white&#x27; is true&quot; is to perform the speech act of signaling one&#x27;s agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one&#x27;s head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. For example, when a wedding couple says &quot;I do&quot; at the appropriate time in a wedding, they are performing the act of taking the other to be their lawful wedded spouse. They are not &quot;describing&quot; themselves as taking the other, but actually &quot;doing&quot; so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such &quot;illocutionary acts&quot; is J. L. Austin, most notably in &quot;How to Do Things With Words&quot;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: &quot;To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. When one says &#x27;It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s raining,&#x27; one asserts no more than &#x27;It&#x27;s raining.&#x27; The function of [the statement] &#x27;It&#x27;s true that...&#x27; is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that &#x27;it&#x27;s raining.

====Philosophical skepticism====
Philosophical skepticism is generally any doubt of one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions. The primary target of philosophical skepticism is epistemology, but it can be applied to any domain, such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), and religion (skepticism about the existence of God).

Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the &quot;big questions&quot; in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. Religious skepticism is &quot;doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)&quot;. Scientific skepticism concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to investigation using the scientific method, to discover empirical evidence for them.

===Pluralist===

Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by Charles Peirce and William James, included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book &quot;Truth and Objectivity&quot; that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book &quot;Truth as One and Many&quot;, argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.

==Formal theories==
===Logic===
Logic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell if a proposition is true or not. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement that is true in all logically possible worlds or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a &quot;fact&quot; (also called a &quot;synthetic claim&quot; or a &quot;contingency&quot;), which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as &quot;If p and q, then p&quot; is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

Degrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with bivalent logic (or binary logic), three-valued logic, and other forms of finite-valued logic. Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range, typically between 0 and 1, as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite-valued logic. In general, the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many-valued logic.

===Mathematics===


There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics. They are the &quot;model theory of truth&quot; and the &quot;proof theory of truth&quot;.

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of Boolean algebra, mathematical models of logic began to treat &quot;truth&quot;, also represented as &quot;T&quot; or &quot;1&quot;, as an arbitrary constant. &quot;Falsity&quot; is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as &quot;F&quot; or &quot;0&quot;. In propositional logic, these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of axioms and rules of inference, often given in the form of truth tables.

In addition, from at least the time of Hilbert&#x27;s program at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems and the development of the Church–Turing thesis in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.

The works of Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert&#x27;s problems. Work on Hilbert&#x27;s 10th problem led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution, or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, Hilbert&#x27;s first problem was on the continuum hypothesis. Gödel and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory. In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

Gödel thought that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition, an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication. But he commented, &quot;The more I think about language, the more it amazes me that people ever understand each other at all&quot;.

===Tarski&#x27;s semantics===
The semantic theory of truth has as its general case for a given language:
:&#x27;P&#x27; is true if and only if P
where &#x27;P&#x27; refers to the sentence (the sentence&#x27;s name), and P is just the sentence itself.

Tarski&#x27;s theory of truth (named after Alfred Tarski) was developed for formal languages, such as formal logic. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression &quot;is true&quot; could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an &quot;object language&quot;, the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as, &quot;This sentence is not true&quot;. As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth-conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism.

Bertrand Russell is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, Russell&#x27;s paradox. Russell and Whitehead attempted to solve these problems in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; by putting statements into a hierarchy of types, wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy. This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible type systems that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke&#x27;s semantics===

Kripke&#x27;s theory of truth (named after Saul Kripke) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Beginning with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression &quot;is true&quot; (or &quot;is false&quot;). So, &quot;The barn is big&quot; is included in the subset, but not &quot;&quot;The barn is big&quot; is true&quot;, nor problematic sentences such as &quot;&quot;This sentence&quot; is false&quot;.
* Defining truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Extending the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So &quot;&quot;The barn is big&quot; is true&quot; is now included, but not either &quot;&quot;This sentence&quot; is false&quot; nor &quot;&#x27;&quot;The barn is big&quot; is true&#x27; is true&quot;.
* Defining truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for &quot;The barn is big&quot;; then for &quot;&quot;The barn is big&quot; is true&quot;; then for &quot;&#x27;&quot;The barn is big&quot; is true&#x27; is true&quot;, and so on.

Truth never gets defined for sentences like &quot;This sentence is false&quot;, since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke&#x27;s terms, these are &quot;ungrounded.&quot; Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke&#x27;s theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the principle of bivalence: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.

The proof sketch for Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem shows self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel&#x27;s work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea — manifested by the diagonal lemma—is the basis for Tarski&#x27;s theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined.

It has thus been claimed that Kripke&#x27;s system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski&#x27;s proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski&#x27;s proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by acceptable methods used in mathematical logic.

Kripke&#x27;s semantics are related to the use of topoi and other concepts from category theory in the study of mathematical logic. They provide a choice of formal semantics for intuitionistic logic.

==Folk beliefs==
The truth predicate &quot;&quot;P&quot; is true&quot; has great practical value in human language, allowing &quot;efficient&quot; endorsement or impeaching of claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect (Gricean) conversational implications. Individuals or societies will sometime punish &quot;false&quot; statements to deter falsehoods; the oldest surviving law text, the Code of Ur-Nammu, lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery, as well as for committing perjury in court. Even four-year-old children can pass simple &quot;false belief&quot; tests and successfully assess that another individual&#x27;s belief diverges from reality in a specific way; by adulthood there are strong implicit intuitions about &quot;truth&quot; that form a &quot;folk theory&quot; of truth. These intuitions include:
* Capture (&quot;T&quot;-in): If &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;P&quot; is true
* Release (&quot;T&quot;-out): If &quot;P&quot; is true, then &quot;P&quot;
* Noncontradiction: A statement cannot be both true and false
* Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true
* False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement does not necessarily make it true

Like many folk theories, the folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any formal system that fully obeys &quot;capture and release&quot; semantics for truth (also known as the &quot;T-schema&quot;), and that also respects classical logic, is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
Socrates&#x27;, Plato&#x27;s and Aristotle&#x27;s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, Aristotle stated: &quot;To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true&quot;. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy proceeds to say of Aristotle:

...Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the &quot;Categories&quot; (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of &quot;underlying things&quot; that make statements true and implies that these &quot;things&quot; (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in &quot;De Interpretatione&quot; (16a3) that thoughts are &quot;likenesses&quot; (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought&#x27;s likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind...

Similar statements can also be found in Plato&#x27;s dialogues (&quot;Cratylus&quot; 385b2, &quot;Sophist&quot; 263b).

Some Greek philosophers maintained that truth was either not accessible to mortals, or of greatly limited accessibility, forming early philosophical skepticism. Among these were Xenophanes, Democritus, and Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, who argued that there was no criterion of truth.

The Epicureans believed that all sense perceptions were true, and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions.

The Stoics conceived truth as accessible from impressions via cognitive grasping.

==Medieval philosophy==
===Avicenna (980–1037)===
In early Islamic philosophy, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work Kitab Al-Shifa &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;, Book I, Chapter 8, as:
Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:
This definition is but a rendering of the medieval Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet. A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

===Aquinas (1225–1274)===
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas stated in his &quot;Disputed Questions on Truth&quot;:

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth). Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle&#x27;s view in his Summa I.16.1:
 Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the Creator God who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; reality) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the senses, then through the understanding and the judgement done by reason. For Aquinas, human intelligence (&quot;intus&quot;, within and &quot;legere&quot;, to read) has the capability to reach the essence and existence of things because it has a non-material, spiritual element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

===Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages===
Richard Firth Green examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his &quot;A Crisis of Truth&quot;, and concludes that roughly during the reign of Richard II of England the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance Romance literature, changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in Derek Pearsall&#x27;s summary). Whereas truth (the &quot;trouthe&quot; of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;) was first &quot;an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons&quot;, in Ricardian England it &quot;transforms... into a political truth in which truth is understood to reside in documents&quot;.

==Modern philosophy==
===Kant (1724–1804)===
Immanuel Kant endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth. Kant writes in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;: &quot;The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed&quot;. He denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. He states in his logic lectures:
...Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only &quot;by cognizing it&quot;. Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object. The ancients called such a circle in explanation a &quot;diallelon&quot;. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man...
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition. Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is &quot;impossible without qualification and for every man&quot;.

===Hegel (1770–1831)===
G. W. F. Hegel distanced his philosophy from empiricism by presenting truth as a self-moving process, rather than a matter of merely subjective thoughts. Hegel&#x27;s truth is analogous to an organism in that it is self-determining according to its own inner logic: &quot;Truth is its own self-movement within itself.&quot;

===Schopenhauer (1788–1860)===
For Arthur Schopenhauer, a judgment is a combination or separation of two or more concepts. If a judgment is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. &quot;Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)&quot;. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has &quot;material&quot; truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or &quot;formal&quot;. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has &quot;transcendental&quot; truth.

===Kierkegaard (1813–1855)===
When Søren Kierkegaard, as his character &quot;Johannes Climacus&quot;, ends his writings: &quot;My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth&quot;, he does not advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person&#x27;s life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person&#x27;s being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person&#x27;s way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person&#x27;s inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one&#x27;s actual experience of life.

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one&#x27;s existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one&#x27;s own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one&#x27;s way of life.

===Nietzsche (1844–1900)===
Friedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth, or &#x27;the will to truth&#x27;, was a consequence of the &quot;will to power&quot; of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the &quot;will to power&quot;, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, &quot;The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...&quot; (aphorism 4). He proposed the &quot;will to power&quot; as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche&#x27;s basic view of truth as follows:
...Some scholars regard Nietzsche&#x27;s 1873 unpublished essay, &quot;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense&quot; (&quot;&quot;) as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call &quot;truth&quot; is only &quot;a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.&quot; His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; &quot;truth&quot; is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence...

Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: &quot;But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take &quot;our&quot; fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato&#x27;s faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is &#x27;Divine&#x27;...&quot;

Moreover, Nietzsche challenges the notion of objective truth, arguing that truths are human creations and serve practical purposes. He wrote, &quot;Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.&quot; He argues that truth is a human invention, arising from the artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images, serving practical purposes like repose, security, and consistency; formed through metaphorical and rhetorical devices, shaped by societal conventions and forgotten origins: &quot;What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms – in short, a sum of human relations which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically...&quot;

Nietzsche argues that truth is always filtered through individual perspectives and shaped by various interests and biases. In &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality,&quot; he asserts, &quot;There are no facts, only interpretations.&quot; He suggests that truth is subject to constant reinterpretation and change, influenced by shifting cultural and historical contexts as he writes in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; that &quot;I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.&quot; In the same book, Zarathustra proclaims, &quot;Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.&quot;

===Heidegger (1889–1976)===
Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to Martin Heidegger, the original meaning and essence of truth in Ancient Greece was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, . On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept&#x27;s original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term . Owing to the primacy of ontology in Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy, he considered this truth to lie within Being itself, and already in &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927) had identified truth with &quot;being-truth&quot; or the &quot;truth of Being&quot; and partially with the Kantian thing-in-itself in an epistemology essentially concerning a mode of &quot;Dasein&quot;.

=== Sartre (1905–1980) ===
In &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943), partially following Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre identified our knowledge of the truth as a relation between the in-itself and for-itself of being - yet simultaneously closely connected in this vein to the data available to the material personhood, in the body, of an individual in their interaction with the world and others - with Sartre&#x27;s description that &quot;the world is human&quot; allowing him to postulate all truth as strictly &quot;understood&quot; by self-consciousness as self-consciousness &quot;of&quot; something, a view also preceded by Henri Bergson in &quot;Time and Free Will&quot; (1889), the reading of which Sartre had credited for his interest in philosophy. This first existentialist theory, more fully fleshed out in Sartre&#x27;s essay &quot;Truth and Existence&quot; (1948), which already demonstrates a more radical departure from Heidegger in its emphasis on the primacy of the idea, already formulated in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, of existence as preceding essence in its role in the formulation of truth, has nevertheless been critically examined as idealist rather than materialist in its departure from more traditional idealist epistemologies such as those of Ancient Greek philosophy in Plato and Aristotle, and staying as does Heidegger with Kant.

Later, in the &quot;Search for a Method&quot; (1957), in which Sartre used a unification of existentialism and Marxism that he would later formulate in the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot; (1960), Sartre, with his growing emphasis on the Hegelian totalisation of historicity, posited a conception of truth still defined by its process of relation to a container giving it material meaning, but with specific reference to a role in this broader totalisation, for &quot;subjectivity is neither everything nor nothing; it represents a moment in the objective process (that in which externality is internalised), and this moment is perpetually eliminated only to be perpetually reborn&quot;: &quot;For us, truth is something which becomes, it &quot;has&quot; and &quot;will have&quot; become. It is a totalisation which is forever being totalised. Particular facts do not signify anything; they are neither true nor false so long as they are not related, through the mediation of various partial totalities, to the totalisation in process.&quot; Sartre describes this as a &quot;&quot;realistic&quot; epistemology&quot;, developed out of Marx&#x27;s ideas but with such a development only possible in an existentialist light, as with the theme of the whole work. In an early segment of the lengthy two-volume &quot;Critique&quot; of 1960, Sartre continued to describe truth as a &quot;totalising&quot; &quot;truth of history&quot; to be interpreted by a &quot;Marxist historian&quot;, whilst his break with Heidegger&#x27;s epistemological ideas is finalised in the description of a seemingly antinomous &quot;dualism of Being and Truth&quot; as the essence of a truly Marxist epistemology.

=== Camus (1913–1960) ===
The well-regarded French philosopher Albert Camus wrote in his famous essay, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; (1942), that &quot;there are truths but no truth&quot;, in fundamental agreement with Nietzsche&#x27;s perspectivism, and favourably cites Kierkergaad in posing that &quot;no truth is absolute or can render satisfactory an existence that is impossible in itself&quot;. Later, in &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1951), he declared, akin to Sartre, that &quot;the very lowest form of truth&quot; is &quot;the truth of history&quot;, but describes this in the context of its abuse and like Kierkergaad in the &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&quot; he criticizes Hegel in holding a historical attitude &quot;which consists of saying: &#x27;This is truth, which appears to us, however, to be error, but which is true precisely because it happens to be error. As for proof, it is not I, but history, at its conclusion, that will furnish it.&#x27;&quot;

===Whitehead (1861–1947)===
Alfred North Whitehead, a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: &quot;There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil&quot;.

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since half-truths are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

===Peirce (1839–1914)===
Pragmatists like C. S. Peirce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: &quot;The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...&quot;

===Nishida (1870–1945)===
According to Kitaro Nishida, &quot;knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.&quot;

===Fromm (1900–1980)===
Erich Fromm finds that trying to discuss truth as &quot;absolute truth&quot; is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on &quot;optimal truth&quot;. He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one&#x27;s environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in &quot;a strange and powerful world&quot;. The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in &quot;Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics&quot; (1947), from which excerpts are included below.
===Foucault (1926–1984)===
Truth, says Michel Foucault, is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an &quot;objective&quot; quality. He prefers not to use the term truth itself but &quot;Regimes of Truth&quot;. In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure. Thus Foucault&#x27;s view shares much in common with the concepts of Nietzsche. Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various episteme throughout history.

===Baudrillard (1929–2007)===
Jean Baudrillard considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something. He took his cue from iconoclasts whom he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist. Baudrillard wrote in &quot;Precession of the Simulacra&quot;:
::The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes

Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the &quot;truth&quot; that society is free; scandals (e.g., Watergate) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. Though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard&#x27;s theory. For a less extreme example, movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.

=== Other contemporary positions ===
Truthmaker theory is &quot;the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists&quot;. It is different from substantive theories of truth in the sense that it does not aim at giving a definition of what truth is. Instead, it has the goal of &quot;determining&quot; how truth depends on being.

==Theological views==

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, truth is defined as &quot;unchangeable&quot;, &quot;that which has no distortion&quot;, &quot;that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person&quot;, &quot;that which pervades the universe in all its constancy&quot;. The human body, therefore, is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of India: &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (Truth alone triumphs), as well as &quot;Satyam muktaye&quot; (Truth liberates), &quot;Satya&#x27; is &#x27;Parahit&#x27;artham&#x27; va&#x27;unmanaso yatha&#x27;rthatvam&#x27; satyam&quot; (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), &quot;When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him (patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36), &quot;The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. &quot;Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!&quot;&quot; (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence (Manusmriti), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as a modifier, like &quot;ultra&quot; or &quot;highest&quot;, or more literally &quot;truest&quot;, connoting &quot;purity and excellence&quot;. For example, satyaloka is the &quot;highest heaven&quot; and Satya Yuga is the &quot;golden age&quot; or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on. The Buddha, the 9th incarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, quoted as such - Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon and the truth.

===Buddhism===
In Buddhism, particularly in the Mahayana tradition, the notion of truth is often divided into the two truths doctrine, which consists of relative or conventional truth and ultimate truth. The former refers to truth that is based on common understanding among ordinary people and is accepted as a practical basis for communication of higher truths. Ultimate truth necessarily transcends logic in the sphere of ordinary experience, and recognizes such phenomena as illusory. Mādhyamaka philosophy asserts that any doctrine can be analyzed with both divisions of truth. Affirmation and negation belong to relative and absolute truth respectively. Political law is regarded as relative, while religious law is absolute.

===Christianity===

Christianity has a soteriological view of truth. According to the Bible in John 14:6, Jesus is quoted as having said &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me&quot;.

He was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming president in 1801, Jefferson was the nation&#x27;s first U.S. secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation&#x27;s second vice president under John Adams. Jefferson was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and natural rights, and he produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels. 

Jefferson was born into the Colony of Virginia&#x27;s planter class, dependent on slave labor. During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented colonial-era Virginia in the Second Continental Congress, which established the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson&#x27;s advocacy for individual rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, helped shape the ideological foundations of the revolution and inspired the Thirteen Colonies in their fight for independence, culminating in the establishment of the United States as a free and sovereign nation. Jefferson served as the second governor of revolutionary Virginia from 1779 to 1781. In 1785, Congress appointed Jefferson U.S. minister to France, where he served from 1785 to 1789. President Washington then appointed Jefferson the nation&#x27;s first secretary of state, where he served from 1790 to 1793. During this time, in the early 1790s, Jefferson and political ally James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the nation&#x27;s First Party System. Jefferson and Federalist John Adams became both personal friends and political rivals. In the 1796 U.S. presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which made him Adams&#x27; vice president under the electoral laws of the time. Four years later, in the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson again challenged Adams and won the presidency. In 1804, Jefferson was reelected overwhelmingly to a second term.

As president, Jefferson assertively defended the nation&#x27;s shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies, promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation&#x27;s geographic size, and was able to reduce military forces and expenditures following successful negotiations with France. In his second presidential term, Jefferson was beset by difficulties at home, including the trial of his former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act to defend the nation&#x27;s industries from British threats to U.S. shipping, limiting foreign trade and stimulating the birth of the American manufacturing industry.

Jefferson is ranked among the upper tier of U.S. presidents by both scholars and in public opinion. Presidential scholars and historians have praised Jefferson&#x27;s advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France, and his leadership in supporting the Lewis and Clark Expedition. They acknowledge his lifelong ownership of large numbers of slaves, but offer varying interpretations of his views on and relationship with slavery.

==Early life and education==

Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, Old Style, Julian calendar), at the family&#x27;s Shadwell Plantation in the Colony of Virginia, one of the Thirteen Colonies of British America. He was the third of ten children. He was of English and possibly Welsh descent, and was born a British subject. His father, Peter Jefferson, was a planter and surveyor; his mother was Jane Randolph. Peter Jefferson moved his family to Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 on the death of William Randolph III, the plantation&#x27;s owner and Jefferson&#x27;s friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph&#x27;s children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell before October 1753.

Jefferson began his education together with the Randolph children at Tuckahoe under tutors. Thomas&#x27; father Peter, who was self-taught and regretted not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school at age five. In 1752, at age nine, he attended a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love. At this time he began studying Latin, Greek, and French, while learning to ride horses as well. Thomas also read books from his father&#x27;s modest library. He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville, Virginia, where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury&#x27;s family. Jefferson came to know various American Indians, including the Cherokee chief Ostenaco, who often stopped at Shadwell to visit on their way to Williamsburg to trade. In Williamsburg, the young Jefferson met and came to admire Patrick Henry, eight years his senior, and shared a common interest in the playing of the violin.

Thomas&#x27;s father died in 1757, and his estate was divided between his sons Thomas and Randolph. John Harvie Sr. became 14-year-old Thomas&#x27; guardian. Thomas inherited approximately , which included land later to be named Monticello, and he assumed full legal authority over the property at age 21.
Jefferson entered the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1761, at the age of eighteen, and studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy with William Small. Under Small&#x27;s tutelage, Jefferson encountered the ideas of the British Empiricists, including John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton. Small introduced Jefferson to George Wythe and Francis Fauquier. Small, Wythe, and Fauquier recognized Jefferson as a man of exceptional ability and included him in their inner circle, where he became a regular member of their Friday dinner parties. Jefferson later wrote that, while there, he &quot;heard more common good sense, more rational &amp; philosophical conversations than in all the rest of my life&quot;.

During his first year at the college, Jefferson spent considerable time attending parties and dancing and was not very frugal with his expenditures; in his second year, regretting that he had squandered away time and money in his first year, he committed to studying fifteen hours a day. While at William &amp; Mary, Jefferson became a member of the Flat Hat Club.

Jefferson concluded his formal studies in April 1762. He read the law under Wythe&#x27;s tutelage while working as a law clerk in his office. Jefferson was well-read in a broad variety of subjects, which, along with law and philosophy, included history, natural law, natural religion, ethics, and several areas in science, including agriculture. During his years of study under the watchful eye of Wythe, Jefferson authored a &quot;Commonplace Book&quot;, a survey of his extensive readings. Wythe was so impressed with Jefferson that he later bequeathed his entire library to him.

On July 20, 1765, Jefferson&#x27;s sister Martha married his close friend and college companion Dabney Carr, which was greatly pleasing to Jefferson. In October of that year, however, Jefferson mourned his sister Jane&#x27;s unexpected death at age 25; he wrote a farewell epitaph for her in Latin.

Jefferson treasured his books and amassed three sizable libraries in his lifetime. He began assembling his first library, which grew to 200 volumes, in his youth. It included books inherited from his father and left to him by Wythe. In 1770, however, Jefferson&#x27;s first library was destroyed in a fire at his Shadwell home. His second library replenished the first. It grew to 1,250 titles by 1773, and to nearly 6,500 volumes by 1814. Jefferson organized his books into three broad categories corresponding with elements of the human mind: memory, reason, and imagination. After British forces burnt the Library of Congress during the 1814 Burning of Washington, Jefferson sold his second library to the U.S. government for $23,950, hoping to help jumpstart the Library of Congress&#x27;s rebuilding. Jefferson used a portion of the proceeds to pay off some of his large debt. However, Jefferson soon resumed collecting what amounted to his third personal library, writing to John Adams, &quot;I cannot live without books.&quot; By the time of his death a decade later, the library had grown to nearly 2,000 volumes.

==Career==

===Lawyer and House of Burgesses===

In 1767, Jefferson was granted admission to the Virginia bar, and lived with his mother at Shadwell. Between 1769 and 1775, he represented Albemarle County in Virginia&#x27;s House of Burgesses. While serving in the House of Burgesses, Jefferson pursued reforms to slavery, including writing and sponsoring legislation in 1769 to strip power from the royal governor and courts, instead providing masters of slaves with the discretion to emancipate them. Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation&#x27;s passage, but it faced strong opposition in a state whose economy was largely agrarian.

As a lawyer, Jefferson took on seven freedom-seeking enslaved people as clients and waived his fee for one he claimed should be freed before the minimum statutory age for emancipation. Jefferson invoked natural law, arguing &quot;everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will ... This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by the author of nature, because it is necessary for his own sustenance.&quot; The judge cut him off and ruled against his client. As a consolation, Jefferson gave his client some money, which was conceivably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter. Jefferson&#x27;s underlying intellectual argument that all people were entitled by their creator to what he labeled a &quot;natural right&quot; to liberty is a theme that he later prominently incorporate as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. In 1767, Jefferson also took on 68 cases for the General Court of Virginia and was the counsel in three notable cases of that era, &quot;Howell v. Netherland&quot; (1770), &quot;Bolling v. Bolling&quot; (1771), and &quot;Blair v. Blair&quot; (1772).

In 1774, Jefferson authored a resolution calling for a &quot;Day of Fasting and Prayer&quot; and a boycott of all British goods in protest of the British Parliament&#x27;s passing of the Intolerable Acts. Jefferson&#x27;s resolution was later expanded into &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot;, a tract published that year in which he argued that people have the right to govern themselves.

===Monticello, marriage, and family===
In 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence, Monticello, the name of which in Italian means &quot;Little Mountain&quot;, on a hilltop overlooking his plantation. He spent most of his adult life designing Monticello as an architect and was quoted as saying, &quot;Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.&quot; Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson&#x27;s slaves. He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770. Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project.

On January 1, 1772, Jefferson married his third cousin Martha Wayles Skelton, the 23-year-old widow of Bathurst Skelton. She was a frequent hostess for Jefferson and managed the large household. Biographer Dumas Malone described the marriage as the happiest period of Jefferson&#x27;s life. Martha read widely, did fine needlework, and was a skilled pianist; Jefferson often accompanied her on the violin or cello. During their ten years of marriage, Martha bore six children: Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; (1772–1836); Jane Randolph (1774–1775); an unnamed son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777; Mary &quot;Polly&quot; (1778–1804); Lucy Elizabeth (1780–1781); and another Lucy Elizabeth (1782–1784). Only Martha and Mary survived to adulthood. Martha&#x27;s father John Wayles died in 1773, and the couple inherited 135 enslaved people, , and the estate&#x27;s debts. The debts took Jefferson years to satisfy, contributing to his financial problems.

Martha later suffered from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent childbirth weakened her. Her mother had died young, and Martha lived with two stepmothers as a girl. A few months after the birth of her last child, she died on September 6, 1782, with Jefferson at her bedside. Shortly before her death, Martha made Jefferson promise never to marry again, telling him that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children. Jefferson was grief-stricken by her death, relentlessly pacing back and forth. He emerged after three weeks, taking long rambling rides on secluded roads with his daughter Martha, by her description &quot;a solitary witness to many a violent burst of grief&quot;.

After serving as U.S. Secretary of State from 1790 to 1793 during Washington&#x27;s presidency, Jefferson returned to Monticello and initiated a remodeling based on architectural concepts he had learned and acquired in Europe. The work continued throughout most of his presidency and was completed in 1809.

==Revolutionary War==
===Declaration of Independence===

Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored. Jefferson was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.

Jefferson sought out John Adams, a Continental Congress delegate from Massachusetts and an emerging leader in the Congress. They became close friends, and Adams supported Jefferson&#x27;s appointment to the Committee of Five, charged by the Congress with authoring a declaration of independence. The five chosen were Adams, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman. The committee initially thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson. His choice was due to Jefferson being a Virginian, popular, and being considered a good writer by Adams.

Jefferson consulted with his fellow committee members, but mostly wrote the Declaration of Independence in isolation between June 11 and 28, 1776, in a home he was renting at 700 Market Street in Center City Philadelphia. Jefferson drew considerably on his proposed draft of the Virginia Constitution, George Mason&#x27;s draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and other sources. Other committee members made some changes, and a final draft was presented to Congress on June 28, 1776.

The declaration was introduced on Friday, June 28, and Congress began debate over its contents on Monday, July 1, resulting in the removal of roughly a fourth of Jefferson&#x27;s original draft. Jefferson resented the changes, but he did not speak publicly about the revisions. On July 4, 1776, the Congress ratified the Declaration, and delegates signed it on August 2; in so doing, the delegates were knowingly committing an act of high treason against The Crown, which was deemed the most serious criminal offense and was punishable by torture and death.

Jefferson&#x27;s preamble is regarded as an enduring statement on individual and human rights, and the phrase &quot;all men are created equal&quot; has been called &quot;one of the best-known sentences in the English language&quot;. The Declaration of Independence, historian Joseph Ellis wrote in 2008, represents &quot;the most potent and consequential words in American history&quot;.

===Virginia state legislator and governor===
At the start of the Revolution, Colonel Jefferson was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775. He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing the state constitution was a priority.
For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which prohibited state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine. The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican Church, but both were later revived by James Madison.

In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state&#x27;s laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. He proposed statutes that provided for general education, which he considered the basis of &quot;republican government&quot;. Jefferson also was concerned that Virginia&#x27;s powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy and took the lead in abolishing what he called &quot;feudal and unnatural distinctions.&quot; He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which a deceased landowner&#x27;s oldest son was vested with all land ownership and power.

Jefferson was elected governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780. He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced additional measures for public education, religious freedom, and inheritance.

During General Benedict Arnold&#x27;s 1781 invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, which razed the city. He sent emergency dispatches to Colonel Sampson Mathews and other commanders in an attempt to repel Arnold&#x27;s efforts. General Charles Cornwallis that spring dispatched a cavalry force led by Banastre Tarleton to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but Jack Jouett of the Virginia militia thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to Poplar Forest, his plantation to the west. When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson&#x27;s actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor—but he was not re-elected.

In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the following year, but she died at age two.

In 1782, Jefferson refused a partnership offer by North Carolina Governor Abner Nash, in a profiteering scheme involving the sale of confiscated Loyalist lands. Unlike some Founders, Jefferson was content with his Monticello estate and the land he owned in the vicinity of Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley. Jefferson thought of Monticello as an intellectual gathering place for his friends James Madison and James Monroe.

===&quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;===
In 1780, Jefferson received from French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois a letter of inquiry into the geography, history, and government of Virginia, as part of a study of the United States. Jefferson organized his responses in a book, &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785). He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia&#x27;s history, politics, laws, culture, and geography. The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state&#x27;s natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery and miscegenation; he articulated his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved. He also wrote of his views on the American Indians, equating them to European settlers.

&quot;Notes&quot; was first published in 1785 in French and appeared in English in 1787. Biographer George Tucker considered the work &quot;surprising in the extent of the information which a single individual had been thus far able to acquire, as to the physical features of the state&quot;; Merrill D. Peterson described it as an accomplishment for which all Americans should be grateful.

==Member of Congress==
Jefferson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the Congress of the Confederation organized following the peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783. He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and recommended an American currency based on the decimal system that was adopted. He advised the formation of the Committee of the States to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess. The committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional.

In the Congress&#x27;s 1783–1784 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for settlement of the western territories. He was the principal author of the Land Ordinance of 1784, whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the Ohio River. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but that it should be divided into sections that could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation&#x27;s territories. Congress made extensive revisions and rejected the ban on slavery. The provisions banning slavery, known as the &quot;Jefferson Proviso&quot;, were modified and implemented three years later in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest Territory.

==Minister to France==
On May 7, 1784, Jefferson was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with Great Britain and other countries. With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month. Jefferson had Patsy educated at the Pentemont Abbey. Less than a year later he was assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to France. French foreign minister Count de Vergennes commented, &quot;You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear.&quot; Jefferson replied, &quot;I &quot;succeed&quot;. No man can replace him.&quot; During his five years in Paris, Jefferson played a leading role in shaping U.S. foreign policy.

In 1786, he met and fell in love with Maria Cosway, an accomplished—and married—Italian-English musician of 27. She returned to Great Britain after six weeks, but they maintained a lifelong correspondence.

During the summer of 1786, Jefferson arrived in London to meet with John Adams, the US Ambassador to Britain. Adams had official access to George III and arranged a meeting between Jefferson and the king. Jefferson later described the king&#x27;s reception of the men as &quot;ungracious.&quot; According to Adams&#x27;s grandson, George III turned his back on both in a gesture of public insult. Jefferson returned to France in August.

Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child, nine-year-old Polly, in June 1787. She was accompanied by a young slave from Monticello, Sally Hemings. Jefferson had taken her older brother, James Hemings, to Paris as part of his domestic staff and had him trained in French cuisine. According to Sally&#x27;s son, Madison Hemings, the 16-year-old Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris, where she became pregnant. The son indicated Hemings agreed to return to the United States only after Jefferson promised to free her children when they came of age.

While in France, Jefferson became a regular companion of the Marquis de Lafayette, a French hero of the American Revolution, and Jefferson used his influence to procure trade agreements with France. As the French Revolution began, he allowed his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Langeac, to be used for meetings by Lafayette and other republicans. He was in Paris during the storming of the Bastille and consulted with Lafayette while the latter drafted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Jefferson often found his mail opened by postmasters, so he invented his own enciphering device, the &quot;Wheel Cipher&quot;; he wrote important communications in code for the rest of his career. Unable to attend the 1787 Constitution Convention, Jefferson supported the Constitution but desired the addition of the promised Bill of Rights. Jefferson left Paris for America in September 1789. He remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution while opposing its more violent elements.

==Secretary of State==

Soon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted President Washington&#x27;s invitation to serve as Secretary of State. Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. He opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of states&#x27; debts by the federal government. Hamilton also had bold plans to establish national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from the cabinet. He later left the cabinet voluntarily.

The second major issue was the capital&#x27;s permanent location. Hamilton favored a capital close to the major commercial centers of the Northeast, while Washington, Jefferson, and other agrarians wanted it further south. After lengthy deadlock, the Compromise of 1790 was struck, permanently locating the capital on the Potomac River, and the federal government assumed the war debts of all original 13 states.

Jefferson&#x27;s goals were to decrease American dependence on British commerce and to expand commercial trade with France. He sought to weaken Spanish colonialism of the trans-Appalachian West and British control in the North, believing this would aid in the pacification of Native Americans.

Jefferson and political protegé Congressman James Madison founded the &quot;National Gazette&quot; in 1791, along with author Phillip Freneau, to counter Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist policies, which Hamilton was promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot;. The &quot;National Gazette &quot;made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name &quot;Brutus&quot; at Jefferson&#x27;s urging, which were written by Madison. In Spring 1791, Jefferson and Madison took a vacation to Vermont; Jefferson had been suffering from migraines and was tiring of the in-fighting with Hamilton.

In May 1792, Jefferson became alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, imploring him to run for reelection that year as a unifying influence. He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-Republican Party principles. Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored states&#x27; rights and local control and opposed the federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.

Jefferson supported France against Britain when the two nations fought in 1793, though his arguments in the Cabinet were undercut by French Revolutionary envoy Edmond-Charles Genêt&#x27;s open scorn for Washington. In his discussions with British Minister George Hammond, he tried in vain to persuade the British to vacate their posts in the Northwest and to compensate the U.S. for enslaved people whom the British had freed at the end of the war. Jefferson sought a return to private life, and resigned from the cabinet position in December 1793; he may also have wanted to bolster his political influence from outside the administration.

After the Washington administration negotiated the Jay Treaty with Britain in 1794, Jefferson saw a cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello. The treaty, designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it &quot;the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on to undermine the government&quot;. The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson&#x27;s presidential administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-France stance; during the violence of the Reign of Terror, he declined to disavow the revolution: &quot;To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America.&quot;

==Election of 1796 and vice presidency==

In the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams 71–68. He did, however, receive the second-highest number of votes and, under the electoral laws at the time, was elected as vice president. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams. He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an &quot;honorable and easy&quot; role. Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him quite qualified to serve as presiding officer. In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as &quot;A Manual of Parliamentary Practice&quot;. He cast only three tie-breaking votes in the Senate.

In four confidential talks with French consul Joseph Létombe in the spring of 1797, Jefferson attacked Adams and predicted that his rival would serve only one term. He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris. This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration. After Adams&#x27;s initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the XYZ Affair after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved. However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the Quasi-War.

During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson believed these laws were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional. To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states. The resolutions followed the &quot;interposition&quot; approach of Madison, that states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated nullification, allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether. He warned that, &quot;unless arrested at the threshold&quot;, the Alien and Sedition Acts would &quot;drive these states into revolution and blood&quot;.

Historian Ron Chernow claims that &quot;the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion&quot;, contributing to the American Civil War as well as later events. Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if &quot;systematically and pertinaciously pursued&quot;, the resolutions would &quot;dissolve the union or produce coercion.&quot; Jefferson had always admired Washington&#x27;s leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading the country in the wrong direction. He decided not to attend Washington&#x27;s funeral in 1799 because of acute differences with him while serving as secretary of state.

===Election of 1800===

Jefferson contended for president once more against John Adams in 1800. Adams&#x27; campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War. Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the French. Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was &quot;one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history&quot;.

The Democratic-Republicans ultimately won more electoral college votes, due in part to the electors that resulted from the addition of three-fifths of the South&#x27;s slaves to the population calculation under the Three-Fifths Compromise. Jefferson and his vice-presidential candidate Aaron Burr unexpectedly received an equal total. Because of the tie, the election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of Representatives. Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives on Jefferson&#x27;s behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr. On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president.

The win was marked by Democratic-Republican celebrations throughout the country. Some of Jefferson&#x27;s opponents argued that he owed his victory to the South&#x27;s inflated number of electors. Others alleged that Jefferson secured James Asheton Bayard&#x27;s tie-breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government. Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the historical record is inconclusive.

The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history. As historian Gordon S. Wood writes, &quot;it was one of the first popular elections in modern history that resulted in the peaceful transfer of power from one &#x27;party&#x27; to another.&quot;

==Presidency (1801–1809)==

Jefferson was sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1801. His inauguration was not attended by outgoing President Adams. In contrast to his two predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette. Plainly dressed, he chose to walk alongside friends to the Capitol from his nearby boardinghouse that day instead of arriving by carriage. His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation and commitment to democratic ideology, declaring, &quot;We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.&quot; Ideologically, he stressed &quot;equal and exact justice to all men&quot;, minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press. He said that a free and republican government was &quot;the strongest government on earth.&quot; He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state, Henry Dearborn as secretary of war, Levi Lincoln as attorney general, and Robert Smith as secretary of the navy.

Widowed since 1782, Jefferson first relied on his two daughters to serve as his official hostesses. In late May 1801, he asked Dolley Madison, wife of his long-time friend James Madison, to be the permanent White House hostess. She was also in charge of the completion of the White House mansion. Dolley served as White House hostess for the rest of Jefferson&#x27;s two terms and then for another eight years as First Lady while her husband was president.

===Financial affairs===
Jefferson&#x27;s first challenge as president was shrinking the $83 million national debt. He began dismantling Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury, Albert Gallatin. Gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes. The administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing &quot;unnecessary offices&quot; and cutting &quot;useless establishments and expenses&quot;.

Jefferson believed that the First Bank of the United States represented a &quot;most deadly hostility&quot; to republican government. He wanted to dismantle the bank before its charter expired in 1811, but was dissuaded by Gallatin. Gallatin argued that the national bank was a useful financial institution and set out to expand its operations. Jefferson looked to other corners to address the growing national debt. He shrank the Navy, for example, deeming it unnecessary in peacetime, and incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats intended only for local defense to avoid provocation against foreign powers. After two terms, he had lowered the national debt from $83 million to $57 million.

===Domestic affairs===
Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Congressional Republicans repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams&#x27;s &quot;midnight judges&quot;. A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions. Jefferson appointed three Supreme Court justices: William Johnson (1804), Henry Brockholst Livingston (1807), and Thomas Todd (1807).

Jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university, producing an officer engineering corps for a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences, rather than having to rely on foreign sources. He signed the Military Peace Establishment Act on March 16, 1802, founding the United States Military Academy at West Point. The act documented a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote Republican values.

Jefferson took great interest in the Library of Congress, which had been established in 1800. He often recommended books to acquire. In 1802, Congress authorized Jefferson to name the first Librarian of Congress, and formed a committee to establish library regulations. Congress also granted both the president and vice president the right to use the library.

===Foreign affairs (1801–1805)===

====First Barbary War====

American merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies. After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S. merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom. Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785. In 1801, he authorized a U.S. Navy fleet under Commodore Richard Dale to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic. Following the fleet&#x27;s first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war. The &quot;First Barbary War&quot; was the first foreign war fought by the U.S.

Pasha of Tripoli Yusuf Karamanli captured the , so Jefferson authorized William Eaton, the U.S. Consul to Tunis, to lead a force to restore the pasha&#x27;s older brother to the throne. The American navy forced Tunis and Algiers into breaking their alliance with Tripoli. Jefferson ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli, leading the pasha to sign a treaty that restored peace in the Mediterranean. This victory proved only temporary, but according to Wood, &quot;many Americans celebrated it as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny.&quot;

====Louisiana Purchase====

Spain ceded ownership of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to France. Jefferson was concerned that Napoleon&#x27;s interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and Mississippi River shipping. He wrote that the cession &quot;works most sorely on the U.S. It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S.&quot; In 1802, he instructed James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas. In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10 million for of tropical territory.

Napoleon realized that French military control was impractical over such a vast remote territory, and he was in dire need of funds for his wars on the home front. In early April 1803, he unexpectedly made negotiators a counter-offer to sell of French territory for $15 million (~$ in ), doubling the size of the United States. U.S. negotiators accepted the offer and signed the treaty on April 30, 1803. Word of the unexpected purchase did not reach Jefferson until July 3, 1803. He unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on Earth, making the new country self-sufficient in food and other resources. The sale also significantly curtailed European presence in North America, removing obstacles to U.S. westward expansion.

Most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity, despite Republican reservations about the Constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land. Jefferson initially thought that a Constitutional amendment was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory; but he later changed his mind, fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase, and urged a speedy debate and ratification. On October 20, 1803, the Senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24–7. Jefferson personally was humble about acquiring the Louisiana Territory, but he resented complainers who called the vast domain a &quot;howling wilderness&quot;.

After the purchase, Jefferson preserved the region&#x27;s Spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach to integrating settlers into American democracy. He believed that a period of the federal rule would be necessary while Louisianans adjusted to their new nation. Historians have differed in their assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale, but they typically hail the Louisiana acquisition as a major accomplishment. Frederick Jackson Turner called the purchase the most formative event in American history.

===Expeditions===

Jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory. He sought to establish a U.S. claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored Northwest Passage. Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana (1763) and James Cook in the Pacific (1784), and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean.

Jefferson appointed secretary Meriwether Lewis and acquaintance William Clark to lead the Corps of Discovery (1803–1806). In the months leading up to the expedition, Jefferson tutored Lewis in the sciences of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, and astronomy and navigation, giving him unlimited access to his library at Monticello, which included the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, along with an impressive collection of maps.

The expedition lasted from May 1804 to September 1806 and obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge, including knowledge of many Indian tribes.

Jefferson organized three other western expeditions: the William Dunbar and George Hunter Expedition on the Ouachita River (1804–1805), the Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis Expedition (1806) on the Red River, and the Zebulon Pike Expedition (1806–1807) into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. All three produced valuable information about the American frontier. This interest also motivated Jefferson to meet the Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt several times in June 1804, inquiring into Humboldt&#x27;s knowledge of New Spain&#x27;s natural resources, economic prospects, and demographic development.

===Native American affairs===

Jefferson refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were inferior and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent, although he believed them to be inferior in terms of culture and technology. As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River. But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada. In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia. This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to &quot;advance compactly as we multiply&quot;.

In keeping with his Enlightenment thinking, President Jefferson adopted an assimilation policy toward American Indians known as his &quot;civilization program&quot; which included securing peaceful U.S.–Indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral. Various tribes accepted Jefferson&#x27;s policies, including the Shawnees led by Black Hoof, the Muscogee, and the Cherokee. However, some Shawnees, led by Tecumseh, broke off from Black Hoof, and opposed Jefferson&#x27;s assimilation policies.

Historian Bernard Sheehan argues that Jefferson believed that assimilation was best for American Indians, and next-best was removal to the west; he felt that the worst outcome of the conflict would be their attacking the whites. Jefferson told U.S. Secretary of War Henry Dearborn, who then oversaw Indian affairs, &quot;If we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the Mississippi.&quot; Miller agrees that Jefferson believed that Indians should assimilate to American customs and agriculture. Historians such as Peter S. Onuf and Merrill D. Peterson argue that Jefferson&#x27;s actual Indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands.

===Re-election in 1804 and second term===

Jefferson was nominated for reelection by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr as his running mate. The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase.

In March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally John Randolph, who viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart politically from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British seizures of American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20 million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.

Jefferson&#x27;s popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive relations with Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British diplomat Anthony Merry. After Napoleon&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter. Jefferson then led the enactment of the Embargo Act of 1807, directed at both France and Britain. This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized, resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later.

During the revolutionary era, the states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reopened it. In his annual message of December 1806, Jefferson denounced the &quot;violations of human rights&quot; attending the international slave trade, calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately. In 1807, Congress passed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which Jefferson signed. The act established severe punishment against the international slave trade, although it did not address the issue domestically.

In Haiti, Jefferson&#x27;s neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its Revolution, and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803. But his administration refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862.

===Controversies===

====Burr conspiracy and trial====
Following the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson&#x27;s relationship with his vice president, Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded. Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson&#x27;s refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office. Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic George Clinton.

The same year, Burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected New York governor. During the campaign, Alexander Hamilton publicly made callous remarks regarding Burr&#x27;s moral character. Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, mortally wounding him on July 11, 1804. Burr was indicted for Hamilton&#x27;s murder in New York and New Jersey, causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained president of the Senate during Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase&#x27;s impeachment trial. Both indictments quietly died and Burr was not prosecuted. Also during the election, certain New England separatists approached Burr, desiring a New England federation and intimating that he would be their leader. However, nothing came of the plot, since Burr had lost the election and his reputation was ruined after killing Hamilton. In August 1804, Burr contacted British Minister Anthony Merry offering to cede U.S. western territory in return for money and British ships.

After leaving office in April 1805, Burr traveled west and conspired with Louisiana Territory governor James Wilkinson, beginning a large-scale recruitment for a military expedition. Other plotters included Ohio Senator John Smith and Irishman Harman Blennerhassett. Burr discussed seizing control of Mexico or Spanish Florida, or forming a secessionist state in New Orleans or the Western U.S.; historians remain unclear as to his true goal. In the fall of 1806, Burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the Ohio River. Wilkinson renounced the plot and reported Burr&#x27;s expedition to Jefferson, who ordered Burr&#x27;s arrest. On February 13, 1807, Burr was captured in Louisiana and sent to Virginia to be tried for treason.

Burr&#x27;s 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue. Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr&#x27;s guilt was &quot;beyond question&quot;, but the case came before his longtime political foe John Marshall, who dismissed the treason charge. Burr&#x27;s legal team subpoenaed Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for executive privilege. Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents. After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal. Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a &quot;faithless plotter&quot;.

====Wilkinson&#x27;s misconduct====
Commanding General James Wilkinson was a holdover of the Washington and Adams administrations. In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000 pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans. Wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn. This damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson. In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson and appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson&#x27;s work ethic.

In January 1806, Jefferson received information from Kentucky U.S. Attorney Joseph Davies that Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll. Jefferson took no action against Wilkinson, since there was not then significant evidence against him. An investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1807 exonerated Wilkinson. In 1808, a military court looked into the allegations against Wilkinson but also found a lack of evidence. Jefferson retained Wilkinson in the U.S. Army. Evidence found in Spanish archives in the 20th century proved Wilkinson was on the Spanish payroll.

===Foreign affairs (1805–1809)===

====Attempted annexation of Florida====
In the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain. In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations. A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two-million-dollar expenditure to purchase Florida. Floor leader John Randolph opposed annexation, was upset over Jefferson&#x27;s secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would end up going to Napoleon. The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with Barnabas Bidwell as floor leader. This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress. Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806. Six weeks later the law was made public. The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States. France, however, refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control. The failed venture damaged Jefferson&#x27;s reputation among his supporters.

====&quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair====

Starting in 1806, the Royal Navy began stopping American merchantmen to search for deserters from the British navy; approximately 6,000 sailors were impressed into the Royal Navy this way, leading to deep anger and resentment among the U.S. public. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate an end to foreign interference with American merchant shipping, though relations with Britain showed no signs of improving. The Monroe–Pinkney Treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions regarding the issue of impressment, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.

The British warship encountered the off the Virginia coast in June 1807; &quot;Leopard&quot; fired at &quot;Chesapeake&quot; after the latter refused to allow for a search for deserters before removing four deserters from the ship. Jefferson issued a proclamation banning British warships from U.S. waters. He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, &quot;The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]&quot;. The was dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government, and Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.

====Embargo (1807–1809)====

In December 1807, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree, globally banning British imports. The Royal Navy, meanwhile continued to impress sailors from American merchant ships. However, Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S. for war; Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S. more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces. Meacham argued that the Embargo Act was a projection of power that surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R. B. Bernstein said that Jefferson &quot;was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution&quot;.

In November 1807, Jefferson, for several days, met with his cabinet to discuss the deteriorating foreign situation. Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo, while Treasury Secretary Gallatin opposed it, due to its indefinite time frame and the risk to the policy of American neutrality. The U.S. economy suffered, criticism grew, and opponents began evading the embargo. Instead of retreating, Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators. Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808, called the &quot;Supplementary&quot;, the &quot;Additional&quot;, and the &quot;Enforcement&quot; acts. The government could not prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports, although the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports.

In December 1807, Jefferson announced his intention not to seek a third term. He turned his attention increasingly to Monticello during the last year of his presidency, giving Madison and Gallatin almost total control of affairs. Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo. In its place, the Non-Intercourse Act was passed, but it proved no more effective. The day before Madison was inaugurated as his successor, Jefferson said that he felt like &quot;a prisoner, released from his chains&quot;.

===Cabinet===

==Post-presidency (1809–1826)==
After his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country&#x27;s leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823.

===University of Virginia===

Jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in new areas not offered at other colleges. He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible based solely on ability. He initially proposed his university in a letter to Joseph Priestley in 1800 and, in 1819, founded the University of Virginia. He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of Edmund Bacon, purchased the location. He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university&#x27;s curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825.

Jefferson was a strong disciple of Greek and Roman architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy. Each academic unit, called a pavilion, was designed with a two-story temple front, while the library &quot;Rotunda&quot; was modeled on the Roman Pantheon. Jefferson referred to the university&#x27;s grounds as the &quot;Academical Village&quot;, and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout. The ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences; they formed a quadrangle and were connected by colonnades, behind which stood the student rooms. Gardens and vegetable plots were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by serpentine walls, affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle. The university had a library rather than a church at its center, emphasizing its secular nature—controversial at the time.

When Jefferson died in 1826, James Madison replaced him as rector. Jefferson bequeathed most of his reconstructed library of almost 2,000 volumes to the university. Only one other ex-president has founded a university; Millard Fillmore founded the University at Buffalo in 1846.

===Reconciliation with Adams===
Jefferson and John Adams became good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson&#x27;s sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender. Jefferson was angered by Adams&#x27; appointment of &quot;midnight judges&quot;. The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president. A brief correspondence took place between Abigail Adams and Jefferson after Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Polly died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams. However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson.

As early as 1809, Benjamin Rush began to prod the two through correspondence to re-establish contact. In 1812, Adams wrote a short New Year&#x27;s greeting to Jefferson, prompted earlier by Rush, to which Jefferson warmly responded. This initial correspondence began what historian David McCullough calls &quot;one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American history&quot;. Over the next 14 years, Jefferson and Adams exchanged 158 letters discussing their political differences, justifying their respective roles in events, and debating the revolution&#x27;s import to the world.

When Adams died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, his last words were an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival. &quot;Thomas Jefferson survives&quot;, Adams said, unaware that Jefferson had died a few hours earlier.

===Autobiography===
In 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his &quot;Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1790&quot;, in which he said he sought to &quot;state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself&quot;. He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short. He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights. Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a &quot;strong mind and sound judgement&quot;. He also addressed his enrollment in the College of William &amp; Mary and his election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775.

He expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged aristocracy made up of large landowning families partial to the King, and instead promoted &quot;the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, &amp; scattered with equal hand through all its conditions, was deemed essential to a well-ordered republic&quot;. The work is primarily concerned with the Declaration and reforming the government of Virginia. He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many of the stories. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.

===Greek War of Independence===
Thomas Jefferson was a philhellene, lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the Greek War of Independence. He has been described as the most influential of the Founding Fathers who supported the Greek cause, viewing it as similar to the American Revolution. By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar Adamantios Korais. Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of Greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S. state. He also suggested the application of a classical education system for the newly founded First Hellenic Republic. Jefferson&#x27;s philosophical instructions were welcomed by the Greek people. Korais became one of the designers of the Greek constitution and urged his associates to study Jefferson&#x27;s works and other literature from the American Revolution.

===Lafayette&#x27;s visit===

In the summer of 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the country. Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789. After visits to New York, New England, and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4.

Jefferson&#x27;s grandson Randolph was present and recorded the reunion: &quot;As they approached each other, their uncertain gait quickened itself into a shuffling run, and exclaiming, &#x27;Ah Jefferson!&#x27; &#x27;Ah Lafayette!&#x27;, they burst into tears as they fell into each other&#x27;s arms.&quot; Jefferson and Lafayette then retired to the house to reminisce. The next morning Jefferson, Lafayette, and James Madison attended a tour and banquet at the University of Virginia. Jefferson had someone else read a speech he had prepared for Lafayette, as his voice was weak and could not carry. This was his last public presentation. After an 11-day visit, Lafayette bid Jefferson goodbye and departed Monticello.

===Final days, death, and burial===

Jefferson&#x27;s approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months, as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs. In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fundraiser. His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, and intestinal and urinary disorders. By June 1826, he was confined to bed. On July 3, overcome by fever, Jefferson declined an invitation to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration in Washington.
During his last hours, he was accompanied by family members and friends. Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, at 12:50 p.m. at age 83, on the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. In the moments prior to his death, Jefferson instructed his treating physician, &quot;No, doctor, nothing more&quot;, refusing laudanum. But his final significant words were, &quot;Is it the Fourth?&quot; or &quot;This is the Fourth&quot;. When John Adams died later that same day, his last words were &quot;Thomas Jefferson survives&quot;, though Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before. The sitting president was Adams&#x27;s son, John Quincy Adams, and he called the coincidence of their deaths on the nation&#x27;s anniversary &quot;visible and palpable remarks of Divine Favor&quot;.

Shortly after Jefferson died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, containing a small faded blue ribbon around a lock of his wife Martha&#x27;s hair.

Jefferson was interred at Monticello, under an epitaph that he wrote:

HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

In his advanced years, Jefferson became increasingly concerned that people would understand the principles in the Declaration of Independence, and the people responsible for writing it, and he continually defended himself as its author. He considered the document one of his greatest life achievements, in addition to authoring the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and founding the University of Virginia. Absent from his epitaph were his political roles, including his presidency.

Jefferson died deeply in debt, and was unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs. He gave instructions in his will for disposal of his assets, including the freeing of Sally Hemings&#x27;s children; but his estate, possessions, and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827. In 1831, Monticello was sold by Martha Jefferson Randolph and the other heirs.

==Political, social, and religious views==

Jefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived. He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire. Jefferson thought that the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues. He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies. He supported efforts to disestablish the Church of England, wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state. The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British Whig Party, which believed in limited government. His Democratic-Republican Party became dominant in early American politics, and his views became known as Jeffersonian democracy.

===Philosophy, society, and government===
Jefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically; these show him to be well-read in the philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity. Nevertheless, some scholars do not take Jefferson seriously as a philosopher mainly because he did not produce a formal work on philosophy. However, he has been described as one of the most outstanding philosophical figures of his time because his work provided the theoretical background to, and the substance of, the social and political events of the revolutionary years and the development of the American Constitution in the 1770s and 1780s. Jefferson continued to attend to more theoretical questions of natural philosophy and subsequently left behind a rich philosophical legacy in the form of presidential messages, letters, and public papers.

Jefferson described himself as an Epicurean and, although he adopted the Stoic belief in intuition and found comfort in the Stoic emphasis on the patient endurance of misfortune, he rejected most aspects of Stoicism with the notable exception of Epictetus&#x27; works. He rejected the Stoics&#x27; doctrine of a separable soul and their fatalism, and was angered by their misrepresentation of Epicureanism as mere hedonism. Jefferson knew Epicurean philosophy from original sources, but also mentioned Pierre Gassendi&#x27;s &quot;Syntagma philosophicum&quot; as influencing his ideas on Epicureanism.

According to Jefferson&#x27;s philosophy, citizens have &quot;certain inalienable rights&quot; and &quot;rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others.&quot; A staunch advocate of the jury system, he proclaimed in 1801, &quot;I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.&quot; Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others, but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against tyranny of the majority. Initially, Jefferson favored restricted voting to those who could actually have the free exercise of their reason by escaping any corrupting dependence on others. He advocated enfranchising a majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include &quot;yeoman farmers&quot; who owned their own land while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most American Indians, and women.

He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which was threatened by the arbitrary government. Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruption rather than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries. As president, Jefferson feared that the federal system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal governments more nearly reflecting the Articles of Confederation, seeking to reinforce state prerogatives where his party was in the majority.

According to Stanford Scholar Jack Rakove, &quot;[w]hen Jefferson wrote &#x27;all men are created equal&#x27; in the preamble to the Declaration, he was not talking about individual equality. What he really meant was that the American colonists, as a people, had the same rights of self-government as other peoples, and hence could declare independence, create new governments and assume their &#x27;separate and equal station&#x27; among other nations.&quot; Jefferson&#x27;s famous mantra later became a statement &quot;of individual equality that everyone and every member of a deprived group could claim for himself or herself.&quot; Historian Henry Wiencek has noted Jefferson included slaves when he penned &quot;all men are created equal&quot; in the Declaration. As early as 1774, Jefferson had supported ending domestic slavery, and making slaves citizens. Later, writing in &quot;Notes&quot; (1781), Jefferson supported gradual emancipation of slaves, to be sent away from the U.S. to an unspecified place. The former slaves would be replaced by white immigrant workers. In 1792, Jefferson calculated that he was making a 4 percent profit every year on the birth of black children. After this he wrote that slavery presented an investment strategy for the future. Historian Brion Davis writes that Jefferson&#x27;s emancipation efforts virtually ceased.

Jefferson was steeped in the Whig tradition of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime ruled by the majority, he acknowledged &quot;it will often be exercised when wrong&quot;. But &quot;the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them.&quot; As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental republic and an &quot;empire of liberty&quot; grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency, he described America as &quot;trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government&quot;.

Jefferson was a supporter of American expansionism, writing in 1801 that &quot;it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.&quot;

===Democracy===
Jefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth. He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation.

After resigning as secretary of state in 1795, Jefferson focused on the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The &quot;Republican&quot; classification for which he advocated included &quot;the entire body of landholders&quot; everywhere and &quot;the body of laborers&quot; without land. Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide at grassroots levels. Jefferson promoted Republican candidates for local offices.

Beginning with Jefferson&#x27;s electioneering for the &quot;revolution of 1800&quot;, his political efforts were based on egalitarian appeals. In his later years, he referred to the 1800 election &quot;as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of &#x27;76 was in its form&quot;, one &quot;not effected indeed by the sword ... but by the ... suffrage of the people&quot;. Voter participation grew during Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, increasing to &quot;unimaginable levels&quot; compared to the Federalist Era, with turnout of about 67,000 in 1800 rising to about 143,000 in 1804.

At the onset of the American Revolution, Jefferson accepted William Blackstone&#x27;s argument that property ownership would sufficiently empower voters&#x27; independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor. In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson&#x27;s support. In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating &quot;the principle of equal political rights&quot;—the social right of universal male suffrage. He sought a &quot;general suffrage&quot; of all taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.

===Religion===

==== Christianity ====
Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters. Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity. Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings. Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation. Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, &quot;I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be&quot;.

Jefferson later defined being a Christian as one who followed the simple teachings of Jesus. Influenced by Joseph Priestley, Jefferson selected New Testament passages of Jesus&#x27; teachings into a private work he called &quot;The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, known today as the &quot;Jefferson Bible&quot;, which was never published during his lifetime. Jefferson believed that Jesus&#x27; message had been obscured and corrupted by Paul the Apostle, the Gospel writers and Protestant reformers. Peterson states that Jefferson was a theist &quot;whose God was the Creator of the universe ... all the evidences of nature testified to His perfection; and man could rely on the harmony and beneficence of His work&quot;. In a letter to John Adams, Jefferson wrote that what he believed was genuinely Christ&#x27;s, found in the Gospels, was &quot;as easily distinguishable as diamonds in a dunghill&quot;. By omitting miracles and the resurrection, Jefferson made the figure of Jesus more compatible with a worldview based on reason.

Jefferson was firmly anticlerical, writing in &quot;every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty ... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon.&quot; The full letter to Horatio Spatford can be read at the National Archives. Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public office but later relented. In 1777, he drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Ratified in 1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal and declared that men &quot;shall be free to profess ... their opinions in matters of religion&quot;. The Statute is one of only three accomplishments he chose for his epitaph. Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association that &quot;religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God&quot;. He interpreted the First Amendment as having built &quot;a wall of separation between Church and State&quot;. The phrase &#x27;Separation of Church and State&#x27; has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the Establishment Clause.

Jefferson donated to the American Bible Society, saying the Four Evangelists delivered a &quot;pure and sublime system of morality&quot; to humanity. He thought Americans would rationally create &quot;Apiarian&quot; religion, extracting the best traditions of every denomination. He contributed generously to several local denominations near Monticello. Acknowledging organized religion would always be factored into political life, he encouraged reason over supernatural revelation to make inquiries into religion. He believed in a creator god, an afterlife, and the sum of religion as loving God and neighbors. But he also controversially rejected fundamental Christian beliefs, denying the conventional Christian Trinity, Jesus&#x27;s divinity as the Son of God and miracles, the Resurrection of Christ, atonement from sin, and original sin. Jefferson believed that original sin was a gross injustice.

Jefferson&#x27;s unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the 1800 presidential election. Federalists attacked him as an atheist. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol.

==== Islam ====
In October 1765, while Jefferson was still a law student he bought a copy of the Quran from the year 1734. He had the Quran shipped from England to Williamsburg, Virginia. He was interested in comparative religions. Keith Ellison was sworn in on Jefferson&#x27;s copy of the Quran.

===Banks===
Jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor. In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations.

In 1791, President Washington asked Jefferson, then secretary of state, and Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, if the Congress had the authority to create a national bank. While Hamilton believed so, Jefferson and Madison thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers, and would violate the Tenth Amendment by assuming powers not granted to the federal government by the states. Hamilton successfully argued that the implied powers given to the federal government in the Constitution supported the creation of a national bank, among other federal actions.

Jefferson used agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party, recruiting candidates for Congress on the issue as early as 1792. As president, Jefferson was persuaded by Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin to leave the bank intact but sought to restrain its influence.

===Slavery===

Scholars give radically differing interpretations on Jefferson&#x27;s views and relationship with slavery. Opinions range from &quot;emancipationists&quot; who view him as an early proto-abolitionist, who subsequently made pragmatic compromises with the slave power to preserve the union; to &quot;revisionists&quot;, who argue that he in fact entrenched the institution in American society; with people also having more nuanced opinions, who either argue that Jefferson held inconsistent views on the institution throughout his lifetime or that both interpretations are too overly simplistic.

Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops. He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41 enslaved people. Over his lifetime he enslaved about 600 people; he inherited about 175 people while most of the remainder were people born on his plantations. Jefferson purchased some slaves in order to reunite their families. He sold approximately 110 people for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms. In 1784, when the number of people he enslaved likely was approximately 200, he began to divest himself of many slaves, and by 1794 he had divested himself of 161 individuals.

Approximately 100 slaves lived at Monticello at any given time. In 1817, the plantation recorded its largest slave population of 140 individuals.

Jefferson once said, &quot;My first wish is that the labourers may be well treated&quot;. Jefferson did not work his slaves on Sundays and Christmas and he allowed them more personal time during the winter months. Some scholars doubt Jefferson&#x27;s benevolence, noting cases of excessive slave whippings in his absence. His nail factory was staffed only by enslaved children. Many of the enslaved boys became tradesmen. Burwell Colbert, who started his working life as a child in Monticello&#x27;s Nailery, was later promoted to the supervisory position of butler.

Jefferson felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master but had reservations about releasing slaves from captivity, and advocated for gradual emancipation. In 1779, he proposed gradual voluntary training and resettlement to the Virginia legislature, and three years later drafted legislation allowing slaveholders to free their own slaves. In his draft of the Declaration of Independence, he included a section, stricken by other Southern delegates, criticizing King George III for supposedly forcing slavery onto the colonies. In 1784, Jefferson proposed the abolition of slavery in all western U.S. territories, limiting slave importation to 15 years. Congress, however, failed to pass his proposal by one vote. In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, a partial victory for Jefferson that terminated slavery in the Northwest Territory. Jefferson freed his slave Robert Hemings in 1794 and he freed his cook slave James Hemings in 1796. Jefferson freed his runaway slave Harriet Hemings in 1822. Upon his death in 1826, Jefferson freed five male Hemings slaves in his will.

During his presidency, Jefferson allowed the diffusion of slavery into the Louisiana Territory hoping to prevent slave uprisings in Virginia and to prevent South Carolina secession. In 1804, in a compromise, Jefferson and Congress banned domestic slave trafficking for one year into the Louisiana Territory. In 1806 he officially called for anti-slavery legislation terminating the import or export of slaves. Congress passed the law in 1807.

In 1819, Jefferson strongly opposed a Missouri statehood application amendment that banned domestic slave importation and freed slaves at the age of 25 on grounds it would destroy the union. In &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which the nation would ultimately have to account to God. Jefferson wrote of his &quot;suspicion&quot; that Black people were mentally and physically inferior to Whites, but argued that they nonetheless had innate human rights. He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as Liberia or Sierra Leone, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals. According to Eric Foner, &quot;In 1824 Jefferson proposed that the federal government purchase and deport &#x27;the increase of each year&#x27; (that is, children), so that the slave population would age and eventually disappear.&quot;

During his presidency, Jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and emancipation, as the Congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north–south rift among the states, with talk of a northern confederacy in New England. The violent attacks on white slave owners during the Haitian Revolution due to injustices under slavery supported Jefferson&#x27;s fears of a race war, increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation. After numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation, Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter to William A. Burwell, &quot;I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us.&quot; That same year he also related this idea to George Logan, writing, &quot;I have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject.&quot;

====Jefferson–Hemings controversy====


Claims that Jefferson fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings after his wife&#x27;s death have been debated since 1802. In that year James T. Callender, after being denied a position as postmaster, alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her. In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson&#x27;s uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Hemings&#x27;s son, Eston Hemings. The results showed a match with the male Jefferson line. Subsequently, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) formed a nine-member research team of historians to assess the matter. The TJF report concluded that &quot;the DNA study ... indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings&quot;. The TJF also concluded that Jefferson likely fathered all of Hemings&#x27;s children listed at Monticello.

In July 2017, the TJF announced that archeological excavations at Monticello had revealed what they believe to have been Sally Hemings&#x27;s quarters, adjacent to Jefferson&#x27;s bedroom. Since the results of the DNA tests were made public, the consensus among most historians has been that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Sally Hemings and that he was the father of her son Eston Hemings.

Still, a minority of scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson&#x27;s paternity conclusively. Based on DNA and other evidence, they note the possibility that additional Jefferson males, including his brother Randolph Jefferson and any one of Randolph&#x27;s four sons, or his cousin, could have fathered Sally Hemings&#x27;s children. In 2002, historian Merrill Peterson said: &quot;in the absence of direct documentary evidence either proving or refuting the allegation, nothing conclusive can be said about Jefferson&#x27;s relations with Sally Hemings.&quot; Concerning the 1998 DNA study, Peterson said that &quot;the results of the DNA testing of Jefferson and Hemings descendants provided support for the idea that Jefferson was the father of at least one of Sally Hemings&#x27;s children&quot;.

After Jefferson&#x27;s death in 1826, although not formally manumitted, Sally Hemings was allowed by Jefferson&#x27;s daughter Martha to live in Charlottesville as a free woman with her two sons until her death in 1835. The Monticello Association refused to allow Sally Hemings&#x27; descendants the right of burial at Monticello.

==Interests and activities==
Jefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques. His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable. He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means and was always in debt. Jefferson also planted two vineyards at Monticello and hoped to grow &quot;Vitis vinifera,&quot; the European wine grape species, to make wine, but the crop failed. His efforts were nonetheless an important contribution to the development of American viticulture.

Jefferson mastered architecture through self-study. His primary authority was Andrea Palladio&#x27;s 1570 &quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;, which outlines the principles of classical design. Jefferson helped popularize the Neo-Palladian style in the United States utilizing designs for the Virginia State Capitol, the University of Virginia, Monticello, and others. It has been speculated that he was inspired by the Château de Rastignac in south-west France—the plans of which he saw during his ambassadorship—to convince the architect of the White House to modify the South Portico to resemble the château.

In the field of archaeology, in 1784, Jefferson, using the trench method, started excavating several Native American burial mounds in Virginia. His excavations were prompted by the &quot;Moundbuilders&quot; question and his careful methods allowed him to witness the stratigraphic layout, the various human remains and other artifacts inside the mound. The evidence present at the site granted him enough insight to admit that he saw no reason why the ancestors of the present-day Native Americans could not have raised those mounds.

He was interested in birds and wine, and was a noted gourmet. As a naturalist, he was fascinated by the Natural Bridge geological formation, and in 1774 successfully acquired the Bridge by a grant from George III.

As an advocate of Enlightenment ideals, Jefferson studied many aspects of the natural sciences and frequently corresponded, and even hosted on multiple occasions, with Prussian explorer, Alexander von Humboldt. These two figures regularly shared ideas and knowledge with one another with letters spanning multiple years.

===American Philosophical Society===
Jefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through the society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom. His &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; was written in part as a contribution to the society. He became the society&#x27;s third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States. In accepting, Jefferson stated: &quot;I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings.&quot;

On March 10, 1797, Thomas Jefferson gave a lecture, later published as a paper in 1799, which reported on the skeletal remains of an extinct large sloth, which he named &quot;Megalonyx&quot;, unearthed by saltpeter workers from a cave in what is now Monroe County, West Virginia. Jefferson is considered to be a pioneer of scientific paleontology research in North America.

Jefferson served as APS president for the next eighteen years, including through both terms of his presidency. He introduced Meriwether Lewis to the society, where various scientists tutored him in preparation for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He resigned on January 20, 1815, but remained active through correspondence.

===Linguistics===
Jefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics, and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German. In his early years, he excelled in classical languages. Jefferson later came to regard Greek as the &quot;perfect language&quot; as expressed in its laws and philosophy. While attending the College of William &amp; Mary, he taught himself Italian. Here Jefferson first became familiar with the Anglo-Saxon language, studying it in a linguistic and philosophical capacity. He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language. Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language. Jefferson criticized language purists and supported the introduction of neologisms to English, foreseeing the emergence of &quot;an American dialect&quot;. He described the Académie Française, a body designated to regulate the French language, as an &quot;endeavor to arrest the progress of their language&quot;. 

He collected and understood a number of American Indian vocabularies and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian languages during their Expedition. When Jefferson moved from Washington after his presidency, he took 50 Native American vocabulary lists back to Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the heavy chest, thinking it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief discovered it was only filled with papers. Thirty years of collecting were lost, with only a few fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.

Jefferson was not an outstanding orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his State of the Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition that continued until 1913 when President Woodrow Wilson chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.

===Inventions===
Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a &quot;Great Clock&quot; powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing), and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity. Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the swivel chair, the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence. He first opposed patents but later supported them. In 1790–1793, as Secretary of State, he was the &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the three-person patent review board. He drafted reforms of US patent law which led to him being relieved of this duty in 1793, and also drastically changed the patent system.

As Minister to France, Jefferson was impressed by the military standardization program known as the &quot;Système Gribeauval&quot;, and initiated a program as president to develop interchangeable parts for firearms. For his inventiveness and ingenuity, he received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Harvard University.

==Legacy==

===Historical reputation===
Jefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship. The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations. Meacham opined that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren. The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents, and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.

===Memorials and honors===
Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings, sculptures, postage, and currency. In the 1920s, Jefferson, together with George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, was chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in a stone national memorial at Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota.

The Jefferson Memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C., in 1943, on the 200th anniversary of Jefferson&#x27;s birth. The interior of the memorial includes a statue of Jefferson by Rudulph Evans and engravings of passages from Jefferson&#x27;s writings. Most prominent among these passages are the words inscribed around the Jefferson Memorial: &quot;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man&quot;, a quote from Jefferson&#x27;s September 23, 1800, letter to Benjamin Rush.

In October 2021, in response to lobbying, the New York City Public Design Commission voted unanimously to remove the plaster model of the statue of Jefferson that currently stands in the United States Capitol rotunda from the chamber of the New York City Council, where it had been for more than a century, due to him fathering children with people he enslaved. The statue was taken down the next month.
