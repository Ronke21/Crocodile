<text>Thealogy views divine matters through feminine perspectives including but not limited to feminism. Valerie Saiving, Isaac Bonewits (1976) and Naomi Goldenberg (1979) introduced the concept as a neologism (new word). Its use then widened to mean all feminine ideas of the sacred, which Charlotte Caron usefully explained in 1993: &quot;reflection on the divine in feminine or feminist terms&quot;. By 1996, when Melissa Raphael published &quot;Thealogy and Embodiment&quot;, the term was well established.

As a neologism, the term derives from two Greek words: , , meaning &#x27;goddess&#x27;, the feminine equivalent of , &#x27;god&#x27; (from PIE root ); and , , plural , often found in English as the suffix &quot;-logy&quot;, meaning &#x27;word, reason, plan&#x27;; and in Greek philosophy and theology, the divine reason implicit in the cosmos.

Thealogy has areas in common with feminist theology – the study of God from a feminist perspective, often emphasizing monotheism. The relation is an overlap, as thealogy is not limited to one deity (in spite of its etymology); the two fields have been described as both related and interdependent.

==History of the term==

The term&#x27;s origin and initial use is open to ongoing debate. Patricia &#x27;Iolana traces the early use of the neologism to 1976, crediting both Valerie Saiving and Isaac Bonewits for its initial use. The coinage of &quot;thealogian&quot; on record by Bonewits in 1976 has been promoted.

In the 1979 book &quot;Changing of the Gods&quot;, Naomi Goldenberg introduces the term as a future possibility with respect to a distinct discourse, highlighting the masculine nature of theology. Also in 1979, in the first revised edition of &quot;Real Magic&quot;, Bonewits defined &quot;thealogy&quot; in his Glossary as &quot;Intellectual speculations concerning the nature of the Goddess and Her relations to the world in general and humans in particular; rational explanations of religious doctrines, practices and beliefs, which may or may not bear any connection to any religion as actually conceived and practiced by the majority of its members&quot;. In the same glossary, he defined &quot;theology&quot; with nearly identical words, changing the feminine pronouns with masculine pronouns appropriately.

Carol P. Christ used the term in &quot;Laughter of Aphrodite&quot; (1987), claiming that those creating thealogy could not avoid being influenced by the categories and questions posed in Christian and Jewish theologies. She further defined thealogy in her 2002 essay, &quot;Feminist theology as post-traditional thealogy&quot;, as &quot;the reflection on the meaning of the Goddess&quot;.

In her 1989 essay &quot;On Mirrors, Mists and Murmurs: Toward an Asian American Thealogy&quot;, Rita Nakashima Brock defined thealogy as &quot;the work of women reflecting on their experiences of and beliefs about divine reality&quot;. And again in 1989, Ursula King notes thealogy&#x27;s growing usage as a fundamental departure from traditional male-oriented theology, characterized by its privileging of symbols over rational explanation.

In 1993, Charlotte Caron&#x27;s inclusive and clear definition of thealogy as a &quot;reflection on the divine in feminine and feminist terms&quot; appeared in &quot;To Make and Make Again&quot;. By this time, the concept had gained considerable status among Goddess adherents.

==As academic discipline==
Situated in relationship to the fields of theology and religious studies, thealogy is a discourse that critically engages the beliefs, wisdom, practices, questions, and values of the Goddess community, both past and present. Similar to theology, thealogy grapples with questions of meaning, include reflecting on the nature of the divine, the relationship of humanity to the environment, the relationship between the spiritual and sexual self, and the nature of belief. However, in contrast to theology, which often focuses on an exclusively logical and empirical discourse, thealogy embraces a postmodern discourse of personal experience and complexity.

The term suggests a feminist approach to theism and the context of God and gender within Paganism, Neopaganism, Goddess Spirituality and various nature-based religions. However, thealogy can be described as religiously pluralistic, as thealogians come from various religious backgrounds that are often hybrid in nature. In addition to Pagans, Neopagans, and Goddess-centred faith traditions, they are also Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, Quakers, etc. or define themselves as Spiritual Feminists. As such, the term &quot;thealogy&quot; has also been used by feminists within mainstream monotheistic religions to describe in more detail the feminine aspect of a monotheistic deity or trinity, such as God/dess Herself, or the Heavenly Mother of the Latter Day Saint movement.

In 2000, Melissa Raphael wrote the text &quot;Introducing Thealogy: Discourse on the Goddess&quot; for the series Introductions in Feminist Theology. Written for an academic audience, it purports to introduce the main elements of thealogy within the context of Goddess feminism. She situates thealogy as a discourse that can be engaged with by Goddess feminists—those who are feminist adherents of the Goddess who may have left their church, synagogue, or mosque—or those who may still belong to their originally established religion. In the book, Raphael compares and contrasts thealogy with the Goddess movement. In 2007, Paul Reid-Bowen wrote the text &quot;Goddess as Nature: Towards a Philosophical Thealogy&quot;, which can be regarded as another systematic approach to thealogy, but which integrates philosophical discourse.

In the past decade, other thealogians like Patricia &#x27;Iolana and D&#x27;vorah Grenn have generated discourses that bridge thealogy with other academic disciplines. &#x27;Iolana&#x27;s Jungian thealogy bridges analytical psychology with thealogy, and Grenn&#x27;s metaformic thealogy is a bridge between matriarchal studies and thealogy.

Contemporary thealogians include Carol P. Christ, Melissa Raphael, Asphodel Long, Beverly Clack, Charlotte Caron, Naomi Goldenberg, Paul Reid-Bowen, Rita Nakashima Brock, and Patricia &#x27;Iolana.

==Criticisms==
At least one Christian theologian dismisses thealogy as the creation of a new deity made up by radical feminists. Paul Reid-Bowen and Chaone Mallory point out that essentialism is a problematic slippery slope when Goddess feminists argue that women are inherently better than men or inherently closer to the Goddess. In his book &quot;Goddess Unmasked: The Rise of Neopagan Feminist Spirituality&quot;, Philip G. Davis levies a number of criticisms against the Goddess movement, including logical fallacies, hypocrisies, and essentialism.

Thealogy has also been criticized for its objection to empiricism and reason. In this critique, thealogy is seen as flawed by rejecting a purely empirical worldview for a purely relativistic one. Meanwhile, scholars like Harding and Haraway seek a middle ground of feminist empiricism.

==Art and culture==
Artist Edwina Sandys&#x27; bronze statue of a bare-breasted female Crucifixion statue, &quot;Crista&quot;, was removed from the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine at the order of the Jesus Suffragan Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York during Holy Week in 1984. The bishop accused the Cathedral Dean of &quot;descrating our symbols&quot; even though viewer reaction had been &quot;overwhelmingly positive.&quot; In 2016, Sandy&#x27;s &quot;Crista&quot; was reinstalled at the cathedral, on the altar, as the centerpiece of the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; &quot;The Christa Project: Manifesting Divine Bodies.&quot; The Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York wrote an article for the cathedral&#x27;s booklet stating, &quot;In an evolving, growing, learning church, we may be ready to see &#x27;Christa&#x27; not only as a work of art but as an object of devotion, over our altar, with all of the challenges that may come with that for many visitors to the cathedral, or indeed, perhaps for all of us.&quot; This exhibition of more than 50 contemporary works that &quot;interpret – or reinterpret – the symbolism associated with the image of Jesus&quot;, in order to provide &quot;an excellent vehicle for thinking about sacred incarnation, and one that reaches out to humans of all genders, races, religions and sexual orientations&quot; included work by Fredericka Foster, Kiki Smith, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge and Eiko Otake.

<doc id="31446" wikidata="Q324233" url="?curid=31446" title="Torpedo boat">
<text>A torpedo boat is a relatively small and fast naval ship designed to carry torpedoes into battle. The first designs were steam-powered craft dedicated to ramming enemy ships with explosive spar torpedoes. Later evolutions launched variants of self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes.

These were inshore craft created to counter both the threat of battleships and other slow and heavily armed ships by using speed, agility, and powerful torpedoes, and the overwhelming expense of building a like number of capital ships to counter an enemy. A swarm of expendable torpedo boats attacking en masse could overwhelm a larger ship&#x27;s ability to fight them off using its large but cumbersome guns. A fleet of torpedo boats could pose a similar threat to an adversary&#x27;s capital ships, albeit only in the coastal areas to which their small size and limited fuel load restricted them.

The introduction of fast torpedo boats in the late 19th century was a serious concern to the era&#x27;s naval strategists, introducing the concept of tactical asymmetric warfare. In response, navies operating large ships introduced firstly batteries of small-calibre quick-firing guns on board large warships for &#x27;anti-torpedo&#x27; defence, before developing small but seaworthy ships, mounting light quick-firing guns, to accompany the fleet and counter torpedo boats. These small ships, which came to be called &quot;torpedo boat destroyers&quot; (and later simply &quot;destroyers&quot;), initially were largely defensive, primarily meeting the torpedo boat threat with their own guns outside of the range at which battleships would be vulnerable. In time they became larger and took on more roles, including making their own torpedo attacks on valuable enemy ships as well as defending against submarines and aircraft. Later yet they were armed with guided missiles and eventually became the predominant type of surface warship in the modern era.

Today, the old concept of a very small, fast, and cheap surface combatant with powerful offensive weapons is taken up by the &quot;fast attack craft&quot;.

==Spar torpedo boats==

The American Civil War saw a number of innovations in naval warfare, including an early type of torpedo boat, armed with spar torpedoes. In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln instituted a naval blockade of Southern ports, which crippled the South&#x27;s efforts to obtain war materiel from abroad. The South also lacked the means to construct a naval fleet capable of taking on the Union Navy on even terms. One strategy to counter the blockade saw the development of torpedo boats, small fast boats designed to attack the larger capital ships of the blockading fleet as a form of asymmetrical warfare.

The class of torpedo boats were steam powered with a partially enclosed hull. They were not true submarines but were &quot;semi-submersible&quot;; when ballasted, only the smokestack and few inches of the hull were above the water line. CSS Midge was a &quot;David&quot;-class torpedo boat. CSS &quot;Squib&quot; and represented another class of torpedo boats that were also low built but had open decks and lacked the ballasting tanks found on the &quot;David&quot;s.

The Confederate torpedo boats were armed with spar torpedoes. This was a charge of powder in a waterproof case, mounted to the bow of the torpedo boat below the water line on a long spar. The torpedo boat attacked by ramming her intended target, which stuck the torpedo to the target ship by means of a barb on the front of the torpedo. The torpedo boat would back away to a safe distance and detonate the torpedo, usually by means of a long cord attached to a trigger.

In general, the Confederate torpedo boats were not very successful. Their low sides made them susceptible to swamping in high seas, and even to having their boiler fires extinguished by spray from their own torpedo explosions. Torpedo misfires (too early) and duds were common. In 1864, Union Navy Lieutenant William B. Cushing fitted a steam launch with a spar torpedo to attack the Confederate ironclad . Also the same year the Union launched , a purpose-built craft with a number of technical innovations including variable ballast for attack operations and an extensible and reloadable torpedo placement spar.

==Self-propelled torpedo==

A prototype self-propelled torpedo was created by a commission placed by Giovanni Luppis, an Austrian naval officer from Rijeka, then a port city of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Robert Whitehead, an English engineer who was the manager of a town factory. In 1864, Luppis presented Whitehead with the plans of the &quot;Salvacoste&quot; (&quot;coastsaver&quot;), a floating weapon driven by ropes from the land that had been dismissed by the naval authorities due to the impractical steering and propulsion mechanisms.

Whitehead was unable to improve the machine substantially, since the clockwork motor, attached ropes, and surface attack mode all contributed to a slow and cumbersome weapon. However, he kept considering the problem after the contract had finished, and eventually developed a tubular device, designed to run underwater on its own, and powered by compressed air. The result was a submarine weapon, the &quot;Minenschiff&quot; (&quot;mine ship&quot;), the first modern self-propelled torpedo, officially presented to the Austrian Imperial Naval commission on December 21, 1866.

The first trials were not successful as the weapon was unable to maintain a course on a steady depth. After much work, Whitehead introduced his &quot;secret&quot; in 1868 which overcame this. It was a mechanism consisting of a hydrostatic valve and pendulum that caused the torpedo&#x27;s hydroplanes to be adjusted so as to maintain a preset depth.

==First torpedo boats==

During the mid-19th century, the ships of the line were superseded by large steam powered ships with heavy gun armament and heavy armour, called ironclads. Ultimately this line of development led to the dreadnought class of all-big-gun battleship, starting with .

At the same time, the weight of armour slowed the battleships, and the huge guns needed to penetrate enemy armour fired at very slow rates. This allowed for the possibility of a small and fast ship that could attack the battleships, at a much lower cost. The introduction of the torpedo provided a weapon that could cripple, or even sink, any battleship.

The first warship of any kind to carry self-propelled torpedoes was HMS &quot;Vesuvius&quot; of 1873. The first seagoing vessel &quot;designed&quot; to fire the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo was . The boat was built by John Thornycroft at Church Wharf in Chiswick for the Royal Navy. It entered service in 1876 and was armed with self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes.
As originally built, &quot;Lightning&quot; had two drop collars to launch torpedoes; these were replaced in 1879 by a single torpedo tube in the bow. She carried also two reload torpedoes amidships. She was later renamed &quot;Torpedo Boat No. 1&quot;. The French Navy followed suit in 1878 with &quot;Torpilleur No 1&quot;, launched in 1878 though she had been ordered in 1875.

Another early such ship was the Norwegian warship , ordered from Thornycroft shipbuilding company, England, in either 1872 or 1873, and built at Thornycroft&#x27;s shipyard at Church Wharf in Chiswick on the River Thames. Managing a speed of , she was one of the fastest boats afloat when completed. The Norwegians initially planned to arm her with a spar torpedo, but this may never have been fitted. &quot;Rap&quot; was outfitted with launch racks for the new self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes in 1879.

==Use in combat==

In the late 19th century, many navies started to build torpedo boats in length, armed with up to three torpedo launchers and small guns. They were powered by steam engines and had a maximum speed of . They were relatively inexpensive and could be purchased in quantity, allowing mass attacks on fleets of larger ships. The loss of even a squadron of torpedo boats to enemy fire would be more than outweighed by the sinking of a capital ship.

The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 was the first great naval war of the 20th century. It was the first practical testing of the new steel battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and torpedo boats. During the war the Imperial Russian Navy in addition to their other warships, deployed 86 torpedo boats and launched 27 torpedoes (from all warships) in three major campaigns, scoring 5 hits.

The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), like the Russians, often combined their torpedo boats (the smaller of which possessed only hull numbers, although the larger 1st class boats were named) with their torpedo boat destroyers (TBDs) (often simply referring to them as &quot;destroyers&quot;) and launched over 270 torpedoes (counting the opening engagement at Port Arthur naval base on 8 February 1904) during the war. The IJN deployed approximately 21 TBs during the conflict, and on 27 May 1905 the Japanese torpedo boat destroyers and TBs launched 16 torpedoes at the battleship , Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky&#x27;s flagship at the battle of Tsushima. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō, the IJN commander, had ordered his torpedo boats to finish off the enemy flagship, already gunned into a wreck, as he prepared to pursue the remnants of the Russian battle fleet.

Of the 16 torpedoes launched by the TBDs and TBs at the Russian battleship, only four hit their mark, two of those hits were from torpedo boats &quot;#72&quot; and &quot;#75&quot;. By evening, the battleship rolled over and sank to the bottom of the Tsushima Straits. By war&#x27;s end, torpedoes launched from warships had sunk one battleship, two armored cruisers, and two destroyers. The remaining over 80 warships would be sunk by guns, mines, scuttling, or shipwreck.

==Torpedo boat destroyers==
The introduction of the torpedo boat resulted in a flurry of activity in navies around the world, as smaller, quicker-firing guns were added to existing ships to ward off the new threat. In the mid-1880s there were developed torpedo gunboats, the first vessel design for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats. Essentially very small cruisers, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats.

The first example of this was , designed by Nathaniel Barnaby in 1885. The gunboat was armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller torpedo boats. She was armed with a single 4-inch/25-pounder breech-loading gun, six 3-pounder QF guns and four torpedo tubes, arranged with two fixed tubes at the bow and a set of torpedo dropping carriages on either side. Four torpedo reloads were carried.

A number of torpedo gunboat classes followed, including the , the , the and the – all built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s and the 1890s. In 1891, a Chilean torpedo gunboat managed to sink the ironclad with a torpedo at the battle of Caldera Bay during the Chilean Civil War of 1891. This marked a milestone in naval history, as it was the first time an ironclad warship had been sunk by a self-propelled torpedo.
In the late 1890s, torpedo boats had been made obsolete by their more successful contemporaries, the torpedo boat destroyers, which were much faster. The first ships to bear the formal designation &quot;torpedo boat destroyer&quot; (TBD) were the of two ships and of two ships of the Royal Navy, ordered from Yarrows in 1892 by Rear Admiral Jackie Fisher. These were basically enlarged torpedo boats, with speed equal to or surpassing the torpedo boats, but were armed with heavier guns that could attack them before they were able to close on the main fleet.

 and were both built by Thornycroft. They were armed with one 12-pounder gun and three 6-pounder guns, with one fixed 18-in torpedo tube in the bow plus two more torpedo tubes on a revolving mount behind the two funnels. Later the bow torpedo tube was removed and two more 6-pounder guns added instead. They produced from a pair of Thornycroft water-tube boilers, giving them a top speed of 27 knots, giving the range and speed to travel effectively with a battle fleet.

After the Russo-Japanese War, these ships became known simply as destroyers. Destroyers became so much more useful, having better seaworthiness and greater capabilities than torpedo boats, that they eventually replaced most torpedo boats. However, the London Naval Treaty after World War I limited tonnage of warships, but placed no limits on ships of under 600 tons. The French, Italian, Japanese and German Navies developed torpedo boats around that displacement, 70 to 100 m long, armed with two or three guns of around 100 mm (4 in) and torpedo launchers. For example, the Royal Norwegian Navy s were in fact of a torpedo boat size, while the Italian s were closer in size to a destroyer escort. After World War II they were eventually subsumed into the revived corvette classification.

The Kriegsmarine torpedo boats were classified &quot;Torpedoboot&quot; with &quot;T&quot;-prefixed hull numbers. The classes designed in the mid-1930s, such as the Torpedo boat type 35, had few guns, relying almost entirely upon their torpedoes. This was found to be inadequate in combat, and the result was a &quot;fleet torpedo boat&quot; class (&quot;Flottentorpedoboot&quot;), which were significantly larger, up to 1,700 tons, comparable to small destroyers. This class of German boats could be highly effective, as in the action in which the British cruiser was sunk off Brittany by a torpedo salvo launched by the s T23 and T27.

==Motor torpedo craft==

Before World War I steam torpedo boats which were larger and more heavily armed than hitherto were being used. The new internal combustion engine generated much more power for a given weight and size than steam engines, and allowed the development of a new class of small and fast boats. These powerful engines could make use of planing hull designs and were capable of the much higher speed of under appropriate sea conditions than displacement hulls. The boat could carry two to four torpedoes fired from simple fixed launchers and several machine guns.

During the First World War, three junior officers of the Harwich Force suggested that small motor boats carrying a torpedo might be capable of travelling over the protective minefields and attacking ships of the Imperial German Navy at anchor in their bases. In 1915, the Admiralty produced a Staff Requirement requesting designs for a Coastal Motor Boat for service in the North Sea. These boats were expected to have a high speed, making use of the lightweight and powerful petrol engines then available. The speed of the boat when fully loaded was to be at least and sufficient fuel was to be carried to give a considerable radius of action.

They were to be armed in a variety of ways, with torpedoes, depth charges or for laying mines. Secondary armament would have been provided by light machine guns, such as the Lewis gun. The CMBs were designed by Thornycroft, who had experience in small fast boats. Engines were not proper maritime internal combustion engines (as these were in short supply) but adapted aircraft engines from firms such as Sunbeam and Napier. A total of 39 such vessels were built.

In 1917 Thornycroft produced an enlarged overall version. This allowed a heavier payload, and now two torpedoes could be carried. A mixed warload of a single torpedo and four depth charges could also be carried, the depth charges released from individual cradles over the sides, rather than a stern ramp. Speeds from were possible, depending on the various petrol engines fitted. At least two unexplained losses due to fires in port are thought to have been caused by a build-up of petrol vapour igniting.
Italian torpedo boats sank the Austrian-Hungarian in 1917, and in 1918. During the civil war in Russia, British torpedo boats made raids on Kronstadt harbour damaging two battleships and sinking a cruiser.

Such vessels remained useful through World War II. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs), Kriegsmarine &#x27;S-Boote&#x27; (&quot;Schnellboot&quot; or &quot;fast-boat&quot;: British termed them E-boats), (Italian) M.A.S. and M.S., Soviet Navy and U.S. PT boats (standing for &quot;Patrol Torpedo&quot;) were all of this type.

A classic fast torpedo boat action was the Channel Dash in February 1942 when German &quot;E-boats&quot; and destroyers defended the flotilla of , , and several smaller ships as they passed through the Channel.

By World War II torpedo boats were seriously hampered by higher fleet speeds; although they still had a speed advantage, they could only catch the larger ships by running at very high speeds over very short distances, as demonstrated in the Channel Dash. An even greater threat was the widespread arrival of patrol aircraft, which could hunt down torpedo boats long before they could engage their targets.

During World War II United States naval forces employed fast wooden PT boats in the South Pacific in a number of roles in addition to the originally envisioned one of torpedo attack. PT boats performed search and rescue, reconnaissance, ferry and courier work as well as attack and smoke screening duties. They took part in fleet actions and they worked in smaller groups and singly to harry enemy supply lines. Late in the Pacific War when large targets became scarce, many PT boats replaced two or all four of their torpedo tubes with additional guns for engaging enemy coastal supply boats and barges, isolating enemy-held islands from supply, reinforcement or evacuation.

The most significant military ship sunk by a torpedo boat during World War II was the cruiser which was attacked by two Italian torpedo boats (M.S. 16 and M.S. 22) during Operation Pedestal on 13 August 1942. It seems that the torpedo that mortally struck &quot;Manchester&quot; was launched by M.S. 22 (commanded by Franco Mezzadra) from a distance of about 600 meters.

==Fast attack craft today==

Boats similar to torpedo boats are still in use, but are armed with long-range anti-ship missiles that can be used at ranges between 30 and 70 km. This reduces the need for high-speed chases and gives them much more room to operate in while approaching their targets.

Aircraft are a major threat, making the use of boats against any fleet with air cover very risky. The low height of the radar mast makes it difficult to acquire and lock onto a target while maintaining a safe distance. As a result, fast attack craft are being replaced for use in naval combat by larger corvettes, which are able to carry radar-guided anti-aircraft missiles for self-defense, and helicopters for over-the-horizon targeting.

Although torpedo boats have disappeared from the majority of the world&#x27;s navies, they remained in use until the late 1990s and early 2000s in a few specialised areas, most notably in the Baltic. The close confines of the Baltic and ground clutter effectively negated the range benefits of early ASMs. Operating close to shore in conjunction with land based air cover and radars, and in the case of the Norwegian navy hidden bases cut into fjord sides, torpedo boats remained a cheap and viable deterrent to amphibious attack. Indeed, this is still the operational model followed by the Chinese Navy with its for the protection of its coastal and estuarial waters.

<doc id="31447" wikidata="Q1517519" url="?curid=31447" title="The Book of the Courtier">
<text>The Book of the Courtier ( ) by Baldassare Castiglione is a lengthy philosophical dialogue on the topic of what constitutes an ideal courtier or (in the third chapter) court lady, worthy to befriend and advise a prince or political leader. Inspired by the Spanish court during his time as Ambassador of the Holy See (1524–1529), Castiglione set the narrative of the book in his years as a courtier in the Duchy of Urbino. The book quickly became enormously popular and was assimilated by its readers into the genre of prescriptive courtesy books or books of manners—dealing with issues of etiquette, self-presentation, and morals, particularly at princely, or royal courts—books such as Giovanni Della Casa&#x27;s &quot;Il Galateo&quot; (1558) and Stefano Guazzo&#x27;s &quot;The Civil Conversation&quot; (1574). &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; was much more than that, however, having the character of a drama, an open-ended philosophical discussion, and an essay. It has also been seen as a veiled political allegory.

The book portrays the small courts of the High Renaissance which were vanishing in the Italian Wars — with a reverent tribute to the friends of Castiglione&#x27;s youth. It pays tribute in particular to the chastely married Duchess Elisabetta Gonzaga of Urbino, to whom Castiglione had addressed a sequence of Platonic sonnets, and who died in 1526. The work was composed over the course of twenty years, beginning in 1508, and ultimately published in 1528 by the Aldine Press in Venice just before the author&#x27;s death. An influential English translation by Thomas Hoby was published in 1561.

==Principles==
The book is organized as a series of conversations supposed to have taken place over four nights in 1507 between the courtiers of the Duchy of Urbino, at a time when Castiglione was himself a member of the Duke&#x27;s Court (although he is not portrayed as one of the interlocutors). The nature of an ideal courtier is debated between the many characters on the basis of various qualities, such as the need for noble rank, physical prowess, modesty, and pleasant physique, among other attributes. Different characters grant different levels of importance to these various qualities throughout the discussion.

The ideal courtier is described as having a cool mind, a good voice (with beautiful, elegant and brave words) along with proper bearing and gestures. At the same time though, the courtier is expected to have a warrior spirit, to be athletic, and have good knowledge of the humanities, Classics and fine arts. Over the course of four evenings, members of the court try to describe the perfect gentleman of the court. In the process, they debate the nature of nobility, humor, women, and love.

==Reception==
&quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; was widely distributed around Europe, with editions printed in six languages and in twenty European centers. The 1561 English translation by Thomas Hoby had a great influence on the English upper class&#x27;s conception of English gentlemen. &quot;The Courtier&quot; enjoyed influence for some generations, not least in Elizabethan England following its first translation by Sir Thomas Hoby in 1561, a time when Italian culture was very much in fashion.

==Rhetoric==
Of the many qualities Castiglione&#x27;s characters attribute to their perfect courtier, oratory and the manner in which the courtier presents himself while speaking is amongst the most highly discussed. Wayne Rebhorn, a Castiglione scholar, states that the courtier&#x27;s speech and behavior in general is &quot;designed to make people marvel at him, to transform himself into a beautiful spectacle for others to contemplate.&quot; As explained by Count Ludovico, the success of the courtier depends greatly on his reception by the audience from the first impression. This partly explains why the group considers the courtier&#x27;s dress so vital to his success.

Castiglione&#x27;s characters opine about how their courtier can impress his audience and win its approval. Similar to the Classical Roman rhetoricians Cicero and Quintilian, Castiglione stresses the importance of delivery while speaking. In Book I, the Count states that when the courtier speaks he must have a &quot;sonorous, clear, sweet and well sounding&quot; voice that is neither too effeminate nor too rough and be &quot;tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes that shall give an effect of grace&quot; (Castiglione 1.33). This grace, or &quot;grazia&quot;, becomes an important element in the courtier&#x27;s appearance to the audience. Edoardo Saccone states in his analysis of Castiglione, &quot;&quot;grazia&quot; consists of, or rather is obtained through, &quot;sprezzatura&quot;.&quot;

According to the Count, &quot;sprezzatura&quot; is the most important rhetorical device the courtier needs. Peter Burke describes &quot;sprezzatura&quot; in &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; as &quot;nonchalance&quot;, &quot;careful negligence&quot;, and &quot;effortless and ease&quot;. The ideal courtier is someone who &quot;conceals art, and presents what is done and said as if it was done without effort and virtually without thought&quot; (31).

The Count advocates the courtier engage in &quot;sprezzatura,&quot; or this &quot;certain nonchalance&quot;, in all the activities he participates in, especially speech. In Book I, he states, &quot;Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does not appear to be art; nor to anything must we give greater care than to conceal art, for if it is discovered, it quite destroys our credit and brings us into small esteem&quot; (Castiglione 1.26). The Count reasons that by obscuring his knowledge of letters, the courtier gives the appearance that his &quot;orations were composed very simply&quot; as if they sprang up from &quot;nature and truth [rather] than from study and art&quot; (1.26). This much more natural appearance, even though it is not natural by any means, is more advantageous to the courtier.

The Count contends that if the courtier wants to attain &quot;grazia&quot; and be esteemed as excellent, it would be in his best interest to have this appearance of nonchalance. By failing to employ &quot;sprezzatura,&quot; he destroys his opportunity for grace. By applying &quot;sprezzatura&quot; to his speech and everything else he does, the courtier appears to have &quot;grazia&quot; and impresses his audience, thereby achieving excellence and perfection (Saccone 16).

Another feature of rhetoric which Castiglione discusses is the role of written language and style. Castiglione declined to imitate Boccaccio and write in Tuscan Italian, as was customary at the time; instead he wrote in the Italian used in his native Lombardy (he was born near Mantua): as the Count says, &quot;certainly it would require a great deal of effort on my part if in these discussions of ours I wished to use those old Tuscan words which the Tuscans of today have discarded; and what&#x27;s more I&#x27;m sure you would all laugh at me&quot; (Courtier 70). Here, the use of the old and outdated Tuscan language is seen as a form of excess rather than a desirable trait. Castiglione states that had he followed Tuscan usage in his book, his description of sprezzatura would appear hypocritical, in that his effort would be seen as lacking in nonchalance (Courtier 71).

Federico responds to the Count&#x27;s assessment of the use of spoken language by posing the question as to what is the best language in which to write rhetoric. The Count&#x27;s response is that the language does not matter, but rather the rhetoric&#x27;s style, authority, and grace (Courtier 71). Robert J. Graham, a Renaissance literary scholar, notes that &quot;questions of whose language is privileged at any given historical moment are deeply implicated in matters of personal, social and cultural significance&quot;, which he states is the primary reason for Castiglione&#x27;s usage of the native vernacular. This also illustrates the Count&#x27;s response to the relativity of language in Latin. With the role of language set, Castiglione begins to describe the style and authority in which the courtier must write in order to become successful.

The Count explains, &quot;It is right that greater pains would be taken to make what is written more polished and correct... they should be chosen from the most beautiful of those employed in speech&quot; (Courtier 71). This is where the style of which the courtier writes encourages the persuasiveness or success of a speech. The success of a written speech, in contrast to the spoken speech, hinges on the notion that &quot;we are willing to tolerate a great deal of improper and even careless usage&quot; in oral rhetoric than written rhetoric. The Count explains that along with proper word usage, an ideal courtier must have a proper sense of style and flow to their words. These words must be factual yet entertaining as the Count states, &quot;then, it is necessary to arrange what is to be said or written in its logical order, and after that to express it well in words that, if I am not mistaken, should be appropriate, carefully chosen, clear and well formed, but above all that are still in popular use&quot; (Courtier 77). This form of emphasis on language is noted by Graham as; &quot;Although the Count is aware that more traditional aspects of the orator (appearance, gestures, voice, etc.) ... all this will be futile and of little consequence if the ideas conveyed by these words themselves are not witty or elegant to the requirements of the situation&quot;.

<text>In computing, codice_1 and codice_2 are diagnostic command-line interface commands for displaying possible routes (paths) and transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. 

The command reports the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) along the route to a destination. The sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection. The command aborts if all (usually three) sent packets are lost more than twice.

Ping, however, only computes the final round-trip times from the destination point.

For Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), the tool sometimes has the name codice_3 and codice_4.

== Implementations ==
A command is available in many modern operating systems, generally named codice_1 in Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD, macOS, and Linux and named codice_2 in Windows and ReactOS.

The functionality was available graphically in macOS, but has been deprecated since the release of macOS Big Sur.

Windows NT-based operating systems also provide PathPing, which combines the functionality of ping with that of tracert. 

The ReactOS version was developed by Ged Murphy and is licensed under the GPL.

On Unix-like operating systems, traceroute sends, by default, a sequence of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, with destination port numbers ranging from 33434 to 33534; the implementations of traceroute shipped with Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and macOS include an option to use ICMP Echo Request packets (&quot;-I&quot;), or any arbitrary protocol (&quot;-P&quot;) such as UDP, TCP using TCP SYN packets, or ICMP.

On Windows, tracert sends ICMP Echo Request packets, rather than the UDP packets traceroute sends by default.

The time-to-live (TTL) value, also known as &quot;hop limit&quot;, is used in determining the intermediate routers being traversed towards the destination. Traceroute sends packets with TTL values that gradually increase from packet to packet, starting with TTL value of one. Routers decrement TTL values of packets by one when routing and discard packets whose TTL value has reached zero, returning the ICMP error message ICMP Time Exceeded. For the first set of packets, the first router receives the packet, decrements the TTL value and drops the packet because it then has TTL value zero. The router sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. The next set of packets are given a TTL value of two, so the first router forwards the packets, but the second router drops them and replies with ICMP Time Exceeded. Proceeding in this way, traceroute uses the returned ICMP Time Exceeded messages to build a list of routers that packets traverse, until the destination is reached and returns an ICMP Destination Unreachable message if UDP packets are being used or an ICMP Echo Reply message if ICMP Echo messages are being used.

The timestamp values returned for each router along the path are the delay (latency) values, typically measured in milliseconds for each packet.

The sender expects a reply within a configured number of seconds. If a packet is not acknowledged within the expected interval, an asterisk is displayed. 

The Internet Protocol does not require packets to take the same route towards a particular destination, thus hosts listed might be hosts that other packets have traversed. If the host at hop #N does not reply, the hop is skipped in the output.

If a network has a firewall and operates both Windows and Unix-like systems, more than one protocol must be enabled inbound through the firewall for traceroute to work and receive replies.

Some traceroute implementations use TCP packets, such as &quot;tcptraceroute&quot; and layer four traceroute (lft). PathPing is a utility introduced with Windows NT that combines ping and traceroute functionality. MTR is an enhanced version of ICMP traceroute available for Unix-like and Windows systems. The various implementations of traceroute all rely on ICMP Time Exceeded (type 11) packets being sent to the source.
On Linux, &quot;tracepath&quot; is a utility similar to traceroute, with the primary difference of not requiring superuser privileges.

Cisco&#x27;s implementation of traceroute also uses a sequence of UDP datagrams, each with incrementing TTL values, to an invalid port number at the remote host; by default, UDP port 33434 is used. An extended version of this command (known as the &quot;extended traceroute&quot; command) can change the destination port number used by the UDP probe messages.

== Usage ==
Most implementations include options to specify the number of queries to send per hop, time to wait for a response, the hop limit and port to use. Invoking traceroute with no options displays the list of available options

For Linux, &quot;man traceroute&quot; presents more details, including the displayed error flags. 

For example:
$ traceroute -w 3 -q 1 -m 16 example.com
traceroute to example.com (93.184.216.34), 16 hops max, 52 byte packets
 1 192.x.x.x (192.x.x.x) 5.152 ms
 2 10.x.x.x (10.x.x.x) 12.767 ms
 3 172.x.x.x (172.x.x.x) 11.638 ms
 4 172.x.x.x (172.x.x.x) 13.193 ms
 5 xxx.x.x.x.cox.net (68.x.x.x) 20.624 ms
 6 xxx.xxx.xxx.edgecastcdn.net (192.x.x.x) 56.205 ms
 7 xxx.xxx.xxx.edgecastcdn.net (192.x.x.x) 24.573 ms
 8 *
 9 *
10 93.x.x.x (93.x.x.x) 22.810 ms
11 93.x.x.x (93.x.x.x) 20.235 ms
In the example above, selected options are to wait for three seconds (instead of five), send out only one query to each hop (instead of three), limit the maximum number of hops to 16 before giving up (instead of 30), with &quot;example.com&quot; as the final host. On line 8 and 9 (TTLs 8 and 9) it shows asterisks where the router did not respond within the timeout.

== Value ==

Traceroute can help identify incorrect routing table definitions or firewalls that may be blocking ICMP traffic, A correct traceroute response does not guarantee connectivity for applications as a firewall may permit ICMP packets but not permit packets of other protocols.

Traceroute is used by penetration testers to gather information about network infrastructure and IP address ranges around a given host.

Traceroute can be used to optimize data download. If there are multiple mirrors available for the same resource, each mirror can be traced to find the fastest.

== Origins ==
The traceroute manual page states that the original traceroute program was written by Van Jacobson in 1987 from a suggestion by Steve Deering, and that Guy Almes and Matt Mathis also had the idea concurrent with Deering. The author of the ping program, Mike Muuss, states on his website that traceroute was written using kernel ICMP support that he had earlier coded to enable raw ICMP sockets when he first wrote the ping program.

== Limitations ==
Traceroute has multiple limitations. Traceroute does not discover paths at the router level, but at the interface level. Another limitation appears when routers do not respond to probes or when routers have a limit for ICMP responses. In the presence of traffic load balancing, traceroute may indicate a path that does not actually exist; to minimize this problem there is a traceroute modification called Paris-traceroute, which maintains the flow identifier of the probes to avoid load balancing.

<text>Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism which limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed, data is discarded or revalidated. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the caching of data.

== Description ==
The original DARPA Internet Protocol&#x27;s RFC describes TTL as: 

==IP packets==
Under the Internet Protocol, TTL is an 8-bit field. In the IPv4 header, TTL is the 9th octet of 20. In the IPv6 header, it is the 8th octet of 40. The maximum TTL value is 255, the maximum value of a single octet. A recommended initial value is 64.

The time-to-live value can be thought of as an upper bound on the time that an IP datagram can exist in an Internet system. The TTL field is set by the sender of the datagram, and reduced by every router on the route to its destination. If the TTL field reaches zero before the datagram arrives at its destination, then the datagram is discarded and an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error datagram (11 - Time Exceeded) is sent back to the sender. The purpose of the TTL field is to avoid a situation in which an undeliverable datagram keeps circulating on an Internet system, and such a system eventually becoming swamped by such &quot;immortals&quot;.

In theory, under IPv4, time to live is measured in seconds, although every host that passes the datagram must reduce the TTL by at least one unit. In practice, the TTL field is reduced by one on every hop. To reflect this practice, the field is renamed &quot;hop limit&quot; in IPv6.

==DNS records==

TTLs also occur in the Domain Name System (DNS), where they are set by an authoritative name server for a particular resource record. When a caching (recursive) nameserver queries the authoritative nameserver for a resource record, it will cache that record for the time (in seconds) specified by the TTL. If a stub resolver queries the caching nameserver for the same record before the TTL has expired, the caching server will simply reply with the already cached resource record rather than retrieve it from the authoritative nameserver again. TTL for NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) responses is set from the minimum of the MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself, and indicates how long a resolver may cache the negative answer.

Shorter TTLs can cause heavier loads on an authoritative name server, but can be useful when changing the address of critical services like web servers or MX records, and therefore are often lowered by the DNS administrator prior to a service being moved, in order to reduce possible disruptions.

The units used are seconds. An older common TTL value for DNS was 86400 seconds, which is 24 hours. A TTL value of 86400 would mean that, if a DNS record was changed on the authoritative nameserver, DNS servers around the world could still be showing the old value from their cache for up to 24 hours after the last update by client.

Newer DNS methods that are part of a disaster recovery (DR) system may have some records deliberately set extremely low on TTL. For example, a 300-second TTL would help key records expire in 5 minutes to help ensure these records are flushed quickly worldwide. This gives administrators the ability to edit and update records in a timely manner. TTL values are &quot;per record&quot; and setting this value on specific records is sometimes honored automatically by all standard DNS systems worldwide. However, a problem persists in that some caching DNS nameservers set their own TTLs regardless of the authoritative records, thus it cannot be guaranteed that all downstream DNS servers have the new records after the TTL has expired.

==HTTP==
Time to live may also be expressed as the date and time on which a record expires. The codice_1 header in HTTP responses, the codice_2 header field in both requests and responses and the codice_3 field in HTTP cookies express time-to-live in this way.

<text>Tel Aviv-Yafo (, ; ), sometimes rendered as Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and usually referred to as just Tel Aviv, is the most populous city in the Gush Dan metropolitan area of Israel. Located on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline and with a population of , it is the economic and technological center of the country and a global high tech hub. If East Jerusalem is considered part of Israel, Tel Aviv is the country&#x27;s second-most-populous city, after Jerusalem; if not, Tel Aviv is the most populous city, ahead of West Jerusalem.

Tel Aviv is governed by the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, headed by Mayor Ron Huldai, and is home to most of Israel&#x27;s foreign embassies. It is a beta+ world city and is ranked 57th in the 2022 Global Financial Centres Index. Tel Aviv has the third- or fourth-largest economy and the largest economy per capita in the Middle East. Tel Aviv is ranked the 4th top global startup ecosystem hub. The city currently has the highest cost of living in the world. Tel Aviv receives over 2.5 million international visitors annually. Tel Aviv is home to Tel Aviv University, the largest university in the country with more than 30,000 students.

The city was founded in 1909 by the Yishuv (Jewish residents) and initially given the Hebrew name &quot;Ahuzat Bayit&quot; (, &#x27;House Estate&#x27; or &#x27;Homestead&#x27;), namesake of the Jewish association which established the neighbourhood as a modern housing estate on the outskirts of the ancient port city of Jaffa (&quot;Yafo&quot; in Hebrew), then part of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem within the Ottoman Empire. Its name was changed the following year to Tel Aviv, after the biblical name Tel Abib ( &quot;Tell of Spring&quot;) adopted by Nahum Sokolow as the title for his Hebrew translation of Theodor Herzl&#x27;s 1902 novel &quot;Altneuland&quot; (&quot;Old New Land&quot;). Other Jewish suburbs of Jaffa had been established before Tel Aviv, the oldest among them being Neve Tzedek. Tel Aviv was given township status within the Jaffa Municipality in 1921, and became independent from Jaffa in 1934. Immigration by mostly Jewish refugees meant that the growth of Tel Aviv soon outpaced that of Jaffa, which had a majority Arab population at the time. In 1948, the Israeli Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in the city, with Tel Aviv named as the founding capital of Israel – a function it retained officially until 1950. After the 1947–1949 Palestine war, Tel Aviv began the municipal annexation of parts of Jaffa, fully unified with Jaffa under the name Tel Aviv in April 1950, and was formally renamed to Tel Aviv-Yafo in August 1950.

Tel Aviv&#x27;s White City, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003, comprises the world&#x27;s largest concentration of International Style buildings, including Bauhaus and other related modernist architectural styles. Popular attractions include Old Jaffa, the Eretz Israel Museum, the Museum of Art, Yarkon Park, and the city&#x27;s promenade and beach.

==Etymology and origins==
&quot;Tel Aviv&quot; is the Hebrew title of Theodor Herzl’s 1902 novel (&quot;Old New Land&quot;), as translated from German by Nahum Sokolow. Sokolow had adopted the name of a Mesopotamian site near the city of Babylon mentioned in Ezekiel: &quot;Then I came to them of the captivity at [Tel Aviv], that lived by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.&quot; The name was chosen in 1910 from several suggestions, including &quot;Herzliya&quot;. It was found fitting as it embraced the idea of a renaissance in the ancient Jewish homeland. &quot;Aviv&quot; (, or &quot;Abib&quot;) is a Hebrew word that can be translated as &quot;spring&quot;, symbolizing renewal, and &quot;tell&quot; (or &quot;tel&quot;) is an artificial mound created over centuries through the accumulation of successive layers of civilization built one over the other and symbolizing the ancient.

Although founded in 1909 as a small settlement on the sand dunes north of Jaffa, Tel Aviv was envisaged as a future city from the start. Its founders hoped that in contrast to what they perceived as the squalid and unsanitary conditions of neighbouring Arab towns, Tel Aviv was to be a clean and modern city, inspired by the European cities of Warsaw and Odesa. The marketing pamphlets advocating for its establishment stated:

==History==
===Jaffa===
The walled city of Jaffa is modern-day Tel Aviv-Yafo&#x27;s only urban centre that existed in early modern times. Jaffa was an important port city in the region for millennia. Archaeological evidence shows signs of human settlement there starting in roughly 7,500 BC. The city was established around 1,800 BC at the latest. Its natural harbour has been used since the Bronze Age. By the time Tel Aviv was founded as a separate city during Ottoman rule of the region, Jaffa had been ruled by the Canaanites, Egyptians, Philistines, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Phoenicians, Ptolemies, Seleucids, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, the early Islamic caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, and Mamluks before coming under Ottoman rule in 1515. It had been fought over numerous times. The city is mentioned in ancient Egyptian documents, as well as the Hebrew Bible.

Other ancient sites in Tel Aviv include: Tell Qasile, Tel Gerisa, Abattoir Hill, Tel Hashash, and Tell Qudadi.

During the First Aliyah in the 1880s, when Jewish immigrants began arriving in the region in significant numbers, new Jewish neighborhoods were founded outside Jaffa on the current territory of Tel Aviv. The first was Neve Tzedek, founded in 1887 by Mizrahi Jews due to overcrowding in Jaffa and built on lands owned by Aharon Chelouche. Other neighborhoods were Neve Shalom (1890), Yafa Nof (1896), Achva (1899), Ohel Moshe (1904), Kerem HaTeimanim (1906), and others. Once Tel Aviv received city status in the 1920s, those neighborhoods joined the newly formed municipality, now becoming separated from Jaffa.

===Foundation in Late Ottoman period (1904–1917)===


The Second Aliyah led to further expansion. In 1906, a group of Jews, among them residents of Jaffa, followed the initiative of Akiva Aryeh Weiss and banded together to form the &quot;Ahuzat Bayit&quot; (lit. &quot;homestead&quot;) society. One of the society&#x27;s goals was to form a &quot;Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment, planned according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene&quot;. The urban planning for the new city was influenced by the garden city movement. The first 60 plots were purchased in Kerem Djebali (Karm al-Jabali) near Jaffa by Jacobus Kann, a Dutch citizen, who registered them in his name to circumvent the Turkish prohibition on Jewish land acquisition. Meir Dizengoff, later Tel Aviv&#x27;s first mayor, also joined the Ahuzat Bayit society. His vision for Tel Aviv involved peaceful co-existence with Arabs.

On 11 April 1909, 66 Jewish families gathered on a desolate sand dune to parcel out the land by lottery using seashells. This gathering is considered the official date of the establishment of Tel Aviv. The lottery was organised by Akiva Aryeh Weiss, president of the building society. Weiss collected 120 sea shells on the beach, half of them white and half of them grey. The members&#x27; names were written on the white shells and the plot numbers on the grey shells. A boy drew names from one box of shells and a girl drew plot numbers from the second box. A photographer, Abraham Soskin (b. 1881 in Russia, made &quot;aliyah&quot; 1906), documented the event. The first water well was later dug at this site, located on what is today Rothschild Boulevard, across from Dizengoff House. Within a year, Herzl, Ahad Ha&#x27;am, Yehuda Halevi, Lilienblum, and Rothschild streets were built; a water system was installed; and 66 houses (including some on six subdivided plots) were completed. At the end of Herzl Street, a plot was allocated for a new building for the Herzliya Hebrew High School, founded in Jaffa in 1906. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 28 July 1909. The town was originally named Ahuzat Bayit. On 21 May 1910, the name Tel Aviv was adopted. The flag and city arms of Tel Aviv (see above) contain under the red Star of David 2 words from the biblical book of Jeremiah: &quot;I (God) will build You up again and you will be rebuilt.&quot; (Jer 31:4) Tel Aviv was planned as an independent Hebrew city with wide streets and boulevards, running water for each house, and street lights.

By 1914, Tel Aviv had grown to more than . In 1915 a census of Tel Aviv was conducted, recording a population 2,679. However, growth halted in 1917 when the Ottoman authorities expelled the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv as a wartime measure. A report published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by United States Consul Garrels in Alexandria, Egypt described the Jaffa deportation of early April 1917. The orders of evacuation were aimed chiefly at the Jewish population. Jews were free to return to their homes in Tel Aviv at the end of the following year when, with the end of World War I and the defeat of the Ottomans, the British took control of Palestine.

The town had rapidly become an attraction to immigrants, with a local activist writing:

===British administration (1917–1934)===

Tel Aviv, along with the rest of the Jaffa municipality, was conquered by the British imperial army in late 1917 during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I and became part of British-administered Mandatory Palestine until 1948.

Tel Aviv, established as suburb of Jaffa, received &quot;township&quot; or local council status within the Jaffa Municipality in 1921. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Tel Aviv had a population of 15,185 (15,065 Jews, 78 Muslims and 42 Christians). The population of Tel Aviv had increased to around 34,000 by 1925. The 1931 census recorded Tel Aviv as having a population of 46,101 (45,564 Jews, 288 with no religion, 143 Christians, and 106 Muslims) in 12,545 houses.

With increasing Jewish immigration during the British administration, friction between Arabs and Jews in Palestine increased. On 1 May 1921, the Jaffa riots resulted in the deaths of 48 Arabs and 47 Jews and injuries to 146 Jews and 73 Arabs. In the wake of this violence, many Jews left Jaffa for Tel Aviv.

Tel Aviv began to develop as a commercial center. In 1923, Tel Aviv was the first town to be wired to electricity in Palestine, followed by Jaffa later in the same year. The opening ceremony of the Jaffa Electric Company powerhouse, on 10 June 1923, celebrated the lighting of the two main streets of Tel Aviv.

In 1925, the Scottish biologist, sociologist, philanthropist and pioneering town planner Patrick Geddes drew up the Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv, a master plan for Tel Aviv which was adopted by the city council led by Meir Dizengoff. Geddes&#x27;s plan for developing the northern part of the township was based on Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s garden city movement. The plan consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. While most of the northern area of Tel Aviv was built according to this plan, the influx of European refugees in the 1930s necessitated the construction of taller apartment buildings on a larger footprint in the city.

Ben Gurion House was built in 1930–31, part of a new workers&#x27; housing development. At the same time, Jewish cultural life was given a boost by the establishment of the Ohel Theatre and the decision of Habima Theatre to make Tel Aviv its permanent base in 1931.

===1934 municipal independence from Jaffa===


Tel Aviv was granted the status of an independent municipality separate from Jaffa in 1934. The Jewish population rose dramatically during the Fifth Aliyah after the Nazis came to power in Germany. Many new Jewish immigrants to Palestine disembarked in Jaffa, and remained in Tel Aviv, turning the city into a center of urban life. Friction during the 1936–39 Arab revolt led to the opening of a local Jewish port, Tel Aviv Port, independent of Jaffa, in 1938. It closed on 25 October 1965. Lydda Airport (later Ben Gurion Airport) and Sde Dov Airport opened between 1937 and 1938. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, the Jewish population of Tel Aviv had risen to 150,000 by 1937, compared to Jaffa&#x27;s mainly Arab 69,000 residents, and by 1939 rose to 160,000, which was over a third of Palestine&#x27;s total Jewish population. The village statistics of 1938 listed Tel Aviv&#x27;s population as 140,000, all Jews.

Many German Jewish architects trained at the Bauhaus, the Modernist school of architecture in Germany, and left Germany during the 1930s. Some, like Arieh Sharon, came to Palestine and adapted the architectural outlook of the Bauhaus and similar schools to the local conditions there, creating what is recognized as the largest concentration of buildings in the International Style in the world.

Tel Aviv&#x27;s White City emerged in the 1930s, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. During World War II, Tel Aviv was hit by Italian airstrikes on 9 September 1940, which killed 137 people in the city.

The village statistics of 1945 listed Tel Aviv&#x27;s population as 166,660, consisting of 166,000 Jews, 300 &quot;other&quot;, 230 Christians, and 130 Muslims.

During the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine, Jewish Irgun and Lehi guerrillas launched repeated attacks against British military, police, and government targets in the city. In 1946, following the King David Hotel bombing, the British carried out Operation Shark, in which the entire city was searched for Jewish militants and most of the residents questioned, during which the entire city was placed under curfew. During the March 1947 martial law in Mandatory Palestine, Tel Aviv was placed under martial law by the British authorities for 15 days, with the residents kept under curfew for all but three hours a day as British forces scoured the city for militants. In spite of this, Jewish guerrilla attacks continued in Tel Aviv and other areas under martial law in Palestine.

According to the 1947 UN Partition Plan for dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Tel Aviv was to be included in the proposed Jewish state. Jaffa with, as of 1945, a population of 101,580 people—53,930 Muslims, 30,820 Jews and 16,800 Christians—was designated as part of the Arab state. Civil War broke out in the country and in particular between the neighbouring cities of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, which had been assigned to the Jewish and Arab states respectively. After several months of siege, on 13 May 1948, Jaffa fell and the Arab population fled en masse.

===State of Israel===
After Israel declared Independence on 14 May 1948, Tel Aviv was the temporary government center of the State of Israel. The city was repeatedly bombed by Egyptian warplanes and shelled by Egyptian warships during the Israeli War of Independence, killing around 150 people. The most significant attack was the bombing of the central bus station, in which 42 people were killed. On 3 June 1948, the Israeli Air Force scored its first aerial victory over Tel Aviv when Israeli fighter pilot Modi Alon shot down two Egyptian bombers during a raid. The city was also the scene of fighting between the Israel Defense Forces and Irgun during the Altalena Affair, in which the IDF stopped an Irgun attempt to import arms for its own use.

In December 1949, the Israeli government relocated to Jerusalem. Due to the international dispute over the status of Jerusalem, most embassies remained in or near Tel Aviv. The boundaries of Tel Aviv and Jaffa became a matter of contention between the Tel Aviv municipality and the Israeli government in 1948. The former wished to incorporate only the northern Jewish suburbs of Jaffa, while the latter wanted a more complete unification. The issue also had international sensitivity, since the main part of Jaffa was in the Arab portion of the United Nations Partition Plan, whereas Tel Aviv was not, and no armistice agreements had yet been signed. On 10 December 1948, the government announced the annexation to Tel Aviv of Jaffa&#x27;s Jewish suburbs, the Palestinian neighborhood of Abu Kabir, the Arab village of Salama and some of its agricultural land, and the Jewish Hatikva slum. On 25 February 1949, the depopulated Palestinian village of al-Shaykh Muwannis was also annexed to Tel Aviv. On 18 May 1949, Manshiya and part of Jaffa&#x27;s central zone were added, for the first time including land that had been in the Arab portion of the UN partition plan. The government voted on the unification of Tel Aviv and Jaffa on 4 October 1949, but the decision was not implemented until 24 April 1950 due to the opposition of Tel Aviv mayor Israel Rokach. The name of the unified city was Tel Aviv until 19 August 1950, when it was renamed Tel Aviv-Yafo in order to preserve the historical name Jaffa. Tel Aviv thus grew to . In 1949, a memorial to the 60 founders of Tel Aviv was constructed.
In the 1960s, some of the older buildings were demolished, making way for the country&#x27;s first high-rises. The historic Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium was controversially demolished, to make way for the Shalom Meir Tower, which was completed in 1965, and remained Israel&#x27;s tallest building until 1999. Tel Aviv&#x27;s population peaked in the early 1960s at 390,000, representing 16 percent of the country&#x27;s total. By the early 1970s, Tel Aviv had entered a long and steady period of continuous population decline, which was accompanied by urban decay. By 1981, Tel Aviv had entered not just natural population decline, but an absolute population decline as well. In the late 1980s the city had an aging population of 317,000. Construction activity had moved away from the inner ring of Tel Aviv, and had moved to its outer perimeter and adjoining cities. A mass out-migration of residents from Tel Aviv, to adjoining cities like Petah Tikva and Rehovot, where better housing conditions were available, was underway by the beginning of the 1970s, and only accelerated by the Yom Kippur War. Cramped housing conditions and high property prices pushed families out of Tel Aviv and deterred young people from moving in. From the beginning of 1970s, the common image of Tel Aviv became that of a decaying city, as Tel Aviv&#x27;s population fell 20%.
In the 1970s, the apparent sense of Tel Aviv&#x27;s urban decline became a theme in the work of novelists such as Yaakov Shabtai, in works describing the city such as &quot;Sof Davar&quot; (&quot;The End of Things&quot;) and &quot;Zikhron Devarim&quot; (&quot;The Memory of Things&quot;). A symptomatic article of 1980 asked &quot;Is Tel Aviv Dying?&quot; and portrayed what it saw as the city&#x27;s existential problems: &quot;Residents leaving the city, businesses penetrating into residential areas, economic and social gaps, deteriorating neighbourhoods, contaminated air – Is the First Hebrew City destined for a slow death? Will it become a ghost town?&quot;. However, others saw this as a transitional period. By the late 1980s, attitudes to the city&#x27;s future had become markedly more optimistic. It had also become a center of nightlife and discotheques for Israelis who lived in the suburbs and adjoining cities. By 1989, Tel Aviv had acquired the nickname &quot;Nonstop City&quot;, as a reflection of the growing recognition of its nightlife and 24/7 culture, and &quot;Nonstop City&quot; had to some extent replaced the former moniker of &quot;First Hebrew City&quot;. The largest project built in this era was the Dizengoff Center, Israel&#x27;s first shopping mall, which was completed in 1983. Other notable projects included the construction of Marganit Tower in 1987, the opening of the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater in 1989, and the Tel Aviv Cinematheque (opened in 1973 and located to the current building in 1989).
In the early 1980s, 13 embassies in Jerusalem moved to Tel Aviv as part of the UN&#x27;s measures responding to Israel&#x27;s 1980 Jerusalem Law. Today, most national embassies are located in Tel Aviv or environs. In the 1990s, the decline in Tel Aviv&#x27;s population began to be reversed and stabilized, at first temporarily due to a wave of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Tel Aviv absorbed 42,000 immigrants from the FSU, many educated in scientific, technological, medical and mathematical fields. In this period, the number of engineers in the city doubled. Tel Aviv soon began to emerge as a global high-tech center. The construction of many skyscrapers and high-tech office buildings followed. In 1993, Tel Aviv was categorized as a world city. However, the city&#x27;s municipality struggled to cope with an influx of new immigrants. Tel Aviv&#x27;s tax base had been shrinking for many years, as a result of its preceding long term population decline, and this meant there was little money available at the time to invest in the city&#x27;s deteriorating infrastructure and housing. In 1998, Tel Aviv was on the &quot;verge of bankruptcy&quot;. Economic difficulties would then be compounded by a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the city from the mid-1990s, to the end of the Second Intifada, as well as the dot-com bubble, which affected the city&#x27;s rapidly growing hi-tech sector. On 4 November 1995, Israel&#x27;s prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated at a rally in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo peace accord. The outdoor plaza where this occurred, formerly known as Kikar Malchei Yisrael, was renamed Rabin Square.
In the Gulf War in 1991, Tel Aviv was attacked by Scud missiles from Iraq. Iraq hoped to provoke an Israeli military response, which could have destroyed the US–Arab alliance. The United States pressured Israel not to retaliate, and after Israel acquiesced, the US and Netherlands rushed Patriot missiles to defend against the attacks, but they proved largely ineffective. Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities continued to be hit by Scuds throughout the war, and every city in the Tel Aviv area except for Bnei Brak was hit. A total of 74 Israelis died as a result of the Iraqi attacks, mostly from suffocation and heart attacks, while approximately 230 Israelis were injured. Extensive property damage was also caused, and some 4,000 Israelis were left homeless. It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents or sarin. As a result, the Israeli government issued gas masks to its citizens. When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas. The inhabitants of the southeastern suburb of Hatikva erected an angel-monument as a sign of their gratitude that &quot;it was through a great miracle, that many people were preserved from being killed by a direct hit of a Scud rocket.&quot;
Since the First Intifada, Tel Aviv has suffered from Palestinian political violence. The first suicide attack in Tel Aviv occurred on 19 October 1994, on the Line 5 bus, when a bomber killed 22 civilians and injured 50 as part of a Hamas suicide campaign. On 6 March 1996, another Hamas suicide bomber killed 13 people (12 civilians and 1 soldier), many of them children, in the Dizengoff Center suicide bombing. Three women were killed by a Hamas terrorist in the Café Apropo bombing on 27 March 1997.
One of the deadliest attacks occurred on 1 June 2001, during the Second Intifada, when a suicide bomber exploded at the entrance to the Dolphinarium discothèque, killing 21, mostly teenagers, and injuring 132. Another Hamas suicide bomber killed six civilians and injured 70 in the Allenby Street bus bombing. Twenty-three civilians were killed and over 100 injured in the Tel Aviv central bus station massacre. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the attack. In the Mike&#x27;s Place suicide bombing, an attack on a bar by a British Muslim suicide bomber resulted in the deaths of three civilians and wounded over 50. Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed joint responsibility. An Islamic Jihad bomber killed five and wounded over 50 on 25 February 2005 Stage Club bombing. The most recent suicide attack in the city occurred on 17 April 2006, when 11 people were killed and at least 70 wounded in a suicide bombing near the old central bus station.

Another attack took place on 29 August 2011 in which a Palestinian attacker stole an Israeli taxi cab and rammed it into a police checkpoint guarding the popular Haoman 17 nightclub in Tel Aviv which was filled with 2,000 Israeli teenagers. After crashing, the assailant went on a stabbing spree, injuring eight people. Due to an Israel Border Police roadblock at the entrance and immediate response of the Border Police team during the subsequent stabbings, a much larger and fatal mass-casualty incident was avoided.

On 21 November 2012, during Operation Pillar of Defense, the Tel Aviv area was targeted by rockets, and air raid sirens were sounded in the city for the first time since the Gulf War. All of the rockets either missed populated areas or were shot down by an Iron Dome rocket defense battery stationed near the city. During the operation, a bomb blast on a bus wounded at least 28 civilians, three seriously. This was described as a terrorist attack by Israel, Russia, and the United States and was condemned by the United Nations, United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia, whilst Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri declared that the organisation &quot;blesses&quot; the attack. More than 300 rockets were fired towards the Tel Aviv Metropolitan area in the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis.

New laws were introduced to protect Modernist buildings, and efforts to preserve them were aided by UNESCO recognition of Tel Aviv&#x27;s White City as a world heritage site in 2003. In the early 2000s, Tel Aviv municipality focused on attracting more young residents to the city. It made significant investment in major boulevards, to create attractive pedestrian corridors. Former industrial areas like the city&#x27;s previously derelict Northern Tel Aviv Port and the Jaffa railway station, were upgraded and transformed into leisure areas. A process of gentrification began in some of the poor neighborhoods of southern Tel Aviv and many older buildings began to be renovated.

The demographic profile of the city changed in the 2000s, as it began to attract a higher proportion of young residents. By 2012, 28 percent of the city&#x27;s population was aged between 20 and 34 years old. Between 2007 and 2012, the city&#x27;s population growth averaged 6.29 percent. As a result of its population recovery and industrial transition, the city&#x27;s finances were transformed, and by 2012 it was running a budget surplus and maintained a credit rating of AAA+. In the 2000s and early 2010s, Tel Aviv received tens of thousands of illegal immigrants, primarily from Sudan and Eritrea, changing the demographic profile of areas of the city. In 2009, Tel Aviv celebrated its official centennial. In addition to city- and country-wide celebrations, digital collections of historical materials were assembled. These include the History section of the official Tel Aviv-Yafo Centennial Year website; the Ahuzat Bayit collection, which focuses on the founding families of Tel Aviv, and includes photographs and biographies; and Stanford University&#x27;s Eliasaf Robinson Tel Aviv Collection, documenting the history of the city. Today, the city is regarded as a strong candidate for global city status. Over the past 60 years, Tel Aviv had developed into a secular, liberal-minded center with a vibrant nightlife and café culture.

==Geography==

Tel Aviv is located around on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline, in central Israel, the historic land bridge between Europe, Asia and Africa. Immediately north of the ancient port of Jaffa, Tel Aviv lies on land that used to be sand dunes and as such has relatively poor soil fertility. The land has been flattened and has no important gradients; its most notable geographical features are bluffs above the Mediterranean coastline and the Yarkon River mouth. Because of the expansion of Tel Aviv and the Gush Dan region, absolute borders between Tel Aviv and Jaffa and between the city&#x27;s neighborhoods do not exist.

The city is located northwest of Jerusalem and south of the city of Haifa. Neighboring cities and towns include Herzliya to the north, Ramat HaSharon to the northeast, Petah Tikva, Bnei Brak, Ramat Gan and Giv&#x27;atayim to the east, Holon to the southeast, and Bat Yam to the south. The city is economically stratified between the north and south. Southern Tel Aviv is considered less affluent than northern Tel Aviv with the exception of Neve Tzedek and northern and north-western Jaffa. Central Tel Aviv is home to Azrieli Center and the important financial and commerce district along Ayalon Highway. The northern side of Tel Aviv is home to Tel Aviv University, Yarkon Park, and upscale residential neighborhoods such as Ramat Aviv and Afeka.

===Environment===
Tel Aviv is ranked as the greenest city in Israel. Since 2008, city lights are turned off annually in support of Earth Hour. In February 2009, the municipality launched a water saving campaign, including competition granting free parking for a year to the household that is found to have consumed the least water per person.

In the early 21st century, Tel Aviv&#x27;s municipality transformed a derelict power station into a public park, now named &quot;Gan HaHashmal&quot; (&quot;Electricity Park&quot;), paving the way for eco-friendly and environmentally conscious designs. In October 2008, Martin Weyl turned an old garbage dump near Ben Gurion International Airport, called Hiriya, into an attraction by building an arc of plastic bottles. The site, which was renamed Ariel Sharon Park to honor Israel&#x27;s former prime minister, will serve as the centerpiece in what is to become a urban wilderness on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, designed by German landscape architect, Peter Latz.

At the end of the 20th century, the city began restoring historical neighborhoods such as Neve Tzedek and many buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. Since 2007, the city hosts its well-known, annual Open House Tel Aviv weekend, which offers the general public free entrance to the city&#x27;s famous landmarks, private houses and public buildings. In 2010, the design of the renovated Tel Aviv Port (&quot;Nemal Tel Aviv&quot;) won the award for outstanding landscape architecture at the European Biennial for Landscape Architecture in Barcelona.

In 2014, the Sarona Market Complex opened, following an 8-year renovation project of Sarona colony.

There are many economic migrants and refugees from African countries, primarily Eritrea and Sudan, located in the southern part of the city.

===Neighborhoods===

Tel Aviv is divided into nine boroughs that have formed naturally over the city&#x27;s short history. The oldest of these is Jaffa, the ancient port city out of which Tel Aviv grew. This area is traditionally made up demographically of a greater percentage of Arabs, but recent gentrification is replacing them with a young professional and artist population. Similar processes are occurring in nearby Neve Tzedek, the original Jewish neighborhood outside of Jaffa. Ramat Aviv, a district in the northern part of the city that is largely made up of luxury apartments and includes Tel Aviv University, is currently undergoing extensive expansion and is set to absorb the beachfront property of Sde Dov Airport after its decommissioning. The area known as HaKirya is the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) headquarters and a large military base. Moreover, in the past few years, Rothschild Boulevard which is beginning in Neve Tzedek has become an attraction for tourists, businesses and startups. It features a wide, tree-lined central strip with pedestrian and bike lanes. Historically, there was a demographic split between the Ashkenazi northern side of the city, including the district of Ramat Aviv, and the southern, more Sephardi and Mizrahi neighborhoods including Neve Tzedek and Florentin.
Since the 1980s, major restoration and gentrification projects have been implemented in southern Tel Aviv. Baruch Yoscovitz, city planner for Tel Aviv beginning in 2001, reworked old British plans for the Florentin neighborhood from the 1920s, adding green areas, pedestrian malls, and housing. The municipality invested two million shekels in the project. The goal was to make Florentin the Soho of Tel Aviv, and attract artists and young professionals to the neighborhood. Street artists, such as Dede, installation artists such as Sigalit Landau, and many others made the upbeat neighborhood their home base. Florentin is now known as a hip, &quot;cool&quot; place to be in Tel Aviv with coffeehouses, markets, bars, galleries and parties.

Sixty-four percent of students in the city are entitled to matriculation, more than 5 percent higher than the national average. About 4,000 children are in first grade at schools in the city, and population growth is expected to raise this number to 6,000. As a result, 20 additional kindergarten classes were opened in 2008–09 in the city. A new elementary school is planned north of Sde Dov as well as a new high school in northern Tel Aviv.

The first Hebrew high school, called Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, was established in Jaffa in 1905 and moved to Tel Aviv after its founding in 1909, where a new campus on Herzl Street was constructed for it.

==Economy==

Tel Aviv has been ranked as the twenty-fifth most important financial center in the world. In 1926, the country&#x27;s first shopping arcade, Passage Pensak, was built there. By 1936, as tens of thousands of middle class immigrants arrived from Europe, Tel Aviv was already the largest city in Palestine.

==Culture==
===Architecture===

Tel Aviv is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The early architecture of Tel Aviv consisted largely of European-style single-storey houses with red-tiled roofs. Neve Tzedek, the first neighbourhood to be built outside of Jaffa, is characterised by two-storey sandstone buildings. By the 1920s, a new eclectic Orientalist style came into vogue, combining European architecture with Eastern features such as arches, domes and ornamental tiles. Pagoda House (&quot;Beit HaPagoda&quot;), designed by Alexander Levy and built in 1924, is an example of this style. Municipal construction followed the &quot;garden city&quot; master plan drawn up by Patrick Geddes. Two- and three-storey buildings were interspersed with boulevards and public parks. Various architectural styles, such as Art Deco, classical and modernist also exist in Tel Aviv.

Bauhaus architecture was introduced in the 1920s and 1930s by German Jewish architects who settled in Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv&#x27;s White City, around the city center, contains more than 5,000 Modernist-style buildings inspired by the Bauhaus school and Le Corbusier. Construction of these buildings, later declared protected landmarks and, collectively, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, continued until the 1950s in the area around Rothschild Boulevard. Some 3,000 buildings were created in this style between 1931 and 1939 alone. In the 1960s, this architectural style gave way to office towers and a chain of waterfront hotels and commercial skyscrapers. Some of the city&#x27;s Modernist buildings were neglected to the point of ruin. Before legislation to preserve this landmark architecture, many of the old buildings were demolished. Efforts are under way to refurbish Bauhaus buildings and restore them to their original condition.
The Shalom Meir Tower, Israel&#x27;s first skyscraper, was built in Tel Aviv in 1965 and remained the country&#x27;s tallest building until 1999. At the time of its construction, the building rivaled Europe&#x27;s tallest buildings in height, and was the tallest in the Middle East.

In the mid-1990s, the construction of skyscrapers began throughout the entire city, altering its skyline. Before that, Tel Aviv had had a generally low-rise skyline. In 2010, the Tel Aviv Municipality&#x27;s Planning and Construction Committee launched a new master plan for the city for 2025. It decided not to allow the construction of any additional skyscrapers in the city center, while at the same time greatly increasing the construction of skyscrapers in the east. The ban extends to an area between the coast and Ibn Gabirol Street, and also between the Yarkon River and Eilat Street. It did not extend to towers already under construction or approved. One final proposed skyscraper project was approved, while dozens of others had to be scrapped. Any new buildings there will usually not be allowed to rise above six and a half stories. However, hotel towers along almost the entire beachfront will be allowed to rise up to 25 stories. According to the plan, large numbers of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings at least 18 stories tall would be built in the entire area between Ibn Gabirol Street and the eastern city limits, as part of the master plan&#x27;s goal of doubling the city&#x27;s office space to cement Tel Aviv as the business capital of Israel. Under the plan, &quot;forests&quot; of corporate skyscrapers will line both sides of the Ayalon Highway. Further south, skyscrapers rising up to 40 stories will be built along the old Ottoman railway between Neve Tzedek and Florentine, with the first such tower there being the Neve Tzedek Tower. Along nearby Shlavim Street, passing between Jaffa and south Tel Aviv, office buildings up to 25 stories will line both sides of the street, which will be widened to accommodate traffic from the city&#x27;s southern entrance to the center.

=== Arts and museums ===

In the 1920s Tel-Aviv gradually became the center of art in Israel. In 1919, several prominent Olim from Odessa arrived in the Ruslan ship. In 1920 some of these set up the HaTomer art cooperative as well as opened the first modern art exhibition in Israel. In the 1925 following the return of Isaac Frenkel Frenel from Paris and his opening of the Histadrut art studio, and the introduction of École de Paris influence; Tel Aviv grew to supplement Jerusalem in its cultural importance in the visual arts; especially in respect to modern art. In the late 1920s to 1940s Tel Aviv painters were heavily influenced by the École de Paris, painting Tel Aviv&#x27;s urban landscape, people and cafes in a manner influenced by Soutine, Pascin, Frenel, Chagall and others from the School of Paris. Tel Aviv&quot;s bohemian culture was characterized by cafes such as Kassit which attracted numerous writers and painters. Numerous exhibitions were held in the Ohel theatre and the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium prior to the opening of museums. Reuben Rubin and Nahum Gutman also worked and painted in the city, painting in the naive style. Tel Aviv hosts the Tel Aviv museum of art, established in 1932 in Meir Dizengoff&#x27;s house, since having moved to a new larger location in 1971, as well as numerous galleries.

Two rowing clubs operate in Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv Rowing Club, established in 1935 on the banks of the Yarkon River, is the largest rowing club in Israel. Meanwhile, the beaches of Tel Aviv provide a vibrant Matkot (beach paddleball) scene. Tel Aviv Lightning represent Tel Aviv in the Israel Baseball League. Tel Aviv also has an annual half marathon, run in 2008 by 10,000 athletes with runners coming from around the world.

In 2009, the Tel Aviv Marathon was revived after a fifteen-year hiatus, and is run annually since, attracting a field of over 18,000 runners.

==Transportation==
Tel Aviv is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive public transport network, with many major routes of the national transportation network running through the city. As of 2023, 56% of the residents are going to work without using cars and the plan is to expand it to 70% by the end of the decade.

===Bus and taxi===
As with the rest of Israel, bus transport is the most common form of public transport and is very widely used. The Tel Aviv central bus station is located in the southern part of the city. The main bus network in Tel Aviv metropolitan area operated by Dan Bus Company, Metropoline, and Kavim. the Egged Bus Cooperative, Israels&#x27;s largest bus company, provides intercity transportation.

The city is also served by local and inter-city share taxis. Many local and inter-city bus routes also have sherut taxis that follow the same route and display the same route number in their window. Fares are standardised within the region and are comparable to or less expensive than bus fares. Unlike other forms of public transport, these taxis also operate on Fridays and Saturdays (the Jewish sabbath &quot;Shabbat&quot;). Private taxis are white with a yellow sign on top. Fares are standardised and metered, but may be negotiated ahead of time with the driver.

===Rail===


The Tel Aviv Savidor Central railway station is the main railway station of the city, and the second-busiest station in Israel. The city has five additional railway stations along the Ayalon Highway: three of them, Tel Aviv University, HaShalom (the busiest station in Israel, adjacent to Azrieli Center) and HaHagana (near the Tel Aviv central bus station), serve Tel Aviv directly, while the remaining two, Holon Junction and Holon–Wolfson, are within Tel Aviv&#x27;s municipal boundaries but serve the southern suburb of Holon. It is estimated that over a million passengers travel by rail to Tel Aviv monthly. The trains do not run on Saturday and the principal Jewish festivals (Rosh Hashana (2 days), Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Simkhat Torah, Pessach (Passover) first and fifth days and Shavuot (Pentecost)). Jaffa railway station was the first railway station in the Middle East. It served as the terminus for the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway. The station opened in 1891 and closed in 1948. In 2005–2009, the station was restored and converted into an entertainment and leisure venue marketed as &quot;HaTachana&quot;, Hebrew for &quot;the station&quot; (see homepage here:). The Jaffa–Jerusalem railway also included the Tel Aviv Beit Hadar railway station, which was opened in 1920 and replaced in 1970, and the Tel Aviv South railway station, which was opened in 1970 to replace Beit Hadar and itself closed in 1993. The Bnei Brak railway station, while located in Bnei Brak&#x27;s municipal borders, is closer to the Tel Aviv neighborhood of Ramat HaHayal than to Bnei Brak&#x27;s city center and was originally called Tel Aviv North.
Tel Aviv Light Rail is a mass transit system for the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. As of 2023, two LRT lines are under construction. Work on the Red Line, the first in the project, started on September 21, 2011, following years of preparatory works, and was expected to be completed and opened in late 2022 after numerous delays, and was finally opened on August 18, 2023, after the opening day was postponed numerous times. Construction of the Purple Line started in December 2018; work on the Green Line began in 2021 and is scheduled for completion in 2028. Tel Aviv Metro is a proposed subway system for the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. It will augment the Tel Aviv Light Rail and Israel Railways suburban lines and 3 underground metro lines to form a rapid transit transportation solution for the city. Construction is expected to start in 2025, with the first public opening in 2032.

===Roads===

The main highway leading to and within the city is the Ayalon Highway (Highway 20), which runs in the eastern side of the city from north to south along the Ayalon River riverbed. Driving south on Ayalon gives access to Highway 4 leading to Ashdod, Highway 1, leading to Ben Gurion International Airport and Jerusalem and Highway 431 leading to Jerusalem, Modiin, Rehovot and the Highway 6 Trans-Israel Highway. Driving north on Ayalon gives access to the Highway 2 coastal road leading to Netanya, Hadera and Haifa. Within the city, main routes include Kaplan Street, Allenby Street, Ibn Gabirol Street, Dizengoff Street, Rothschild Boulevard, and in Jaffa the main route is Jerusalem Boulevard. Namir Road connects the city to Highway 2, Israel&#x27;s main north–south highway, and Begin/Jabotinsky Road, which provides access from the east through Ramat Gan, Bnei Brak and Petah Tikva. Tel Aviv, accommodating about 500,000 commuter cars daily, suffers from increasing congestion. In 2007, the Sadan Report recommended the introduction of a congestion charge similar to that of London in Tel Aviv as well as other Israeli cities. Under this plan, road users traveling into the city would pay a fixed fee.

===Air===

The main airport serving Greater Tel Aviv is Ben Gurion International Airport. Located in the neighbouring city of Lod, it handled over 20 million passengers in 2017. Ben Gurion is the main hub of El Al, Arkia, Israir Airlines and Sun d&#x27;Or. The airport is southeast of Tel Aviv, on Highway 1 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Sde Dov Airport (IATA: SDV), in northwestern Tel Aviv, is a domestic airport and was closed in 2019 in favor of real-estate development. All services to Sde Dov will be transferred to Ben Gurion Airport.

===Cycling===

The Tel Aviv Municipality encourages the use of bicycles in the city. Plans called for expansion of the paths to by 2009. By 2020, the city had 140 kilometres of bicycle paths with plans to reach 300 km by 2025. The city is at the center of the Ofnidan, a network of bicycle paths throughout the Gush Dan metropolitan area.

In April 2011, the Tel Aviv municipality launched Tel-O-Fun, a bicycle sharing system, in which 150 stations of bicycles for rent were installed within the city limits.

<text>Clangers (usually referred to as &quot;The Clangers&quot;) is a British stop-motion animated children&#x27;s television series, consisting of short films about a family of mouse-like creatures who live on, and inside, a small moon-like planet. They speak only in a whistled language, and eat green soup (supplied by the Soup Dragon) and blue string pudding. The programmes were originally broadcast on BBC1 between 1969 and 1972, followed by a special episode which was broadcast in 1974.

The series was made by Smallfilms, the company set up by Oliver Postgate (who was the show&#x27;s writer, animator and narrator) and Peter Firmin (who was its modelmaker and illustrator). Firmin designed the characters, and Joan Firmin, his wife, knitted and &quot;dressed&quot; them. The music, often part of the story, was provided by Vernon Elliott.

A third series, narrated by Monty Python actor Michael Palin, was broadcast in the UK in June 2015 on the BBC&#x27;s CBeebies TV channel, gaining hugely successful viewing figures, following on from a short special broadcast by the BBC earlier that year. The new programmes are still made using stop-motion animation (instead of the computer-generated imagery which had replaced the original stop-motion animation in revivals of other children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;The Wombles&quot;). Further new series were made in 2017 and 2019.

&quot;Clangers&quot; won the British Academy Children&#x27;s Award for Pre-School Animation in 2015.

==Background==
The Clangers originated in a series of children&#x27;s books developed from another &quot;Smallfilms&quot; production, &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot;. Publishers Kay and Ward created a series of books based on the &quot;Noggin the Nog&quot; television episodes, which was subsequently expanded into a series called &quot;Noggin First Reader&quot;, aimed at teaching children to read.

In one of these, called &quot;Noggin and the Moonmouse&quot;, published in 1967, a new horse-trough was put up in the middle of the town in the North-Lands. A spacecraft hurtled down and splash-landed in it: the top unscrewed, and out came a largish, mouse-like creature in a duffel coat, who wanted fuel for his spaceship. He showed Nooka and the children that what he needed was vinegar and soap-flakes, so they filled up the fueltank of the little spherical ship, which then &quot;took off in a dreadful cloud smelling of vinegar and soap-flakes, covering the town with bubbles&quot;.

In 1969 (the year of NASA&#x27;s first landing on the Moon), the BBC asked &quot;Smallfilms&quot; to produce a new series for colour television, but without specifying a storyline. Postgate concluded that as space exploration was topical the new series should take place in space (and, inspired by the real Moon Landing, Peter Firmin designed a set which strongly resembled the Moon). Postgate adapted the Moonmouse from the 1967 story, by simply removing its tail (&quot;because it kept getting into the soup&quot;). Hence the Clangers looked similar to mice (and, from their pink colour, pigs). They wore clothes reminiscent of Roman armour, &quot;against the space debris that kept falling onto the planet, lost from other places, such as television sets and bits of an Iron Chicken&quot;, and they spoke in whistled language.

==Storyline==
&quot;The Clangers&quot; was described by Postgate as a family in space. They were small creatures living in peace and harmony on – and inside – a small, hollow planet, far, far away: nourished by Blue String Pudding, and by Green Soup harvested from the planet&#x27;s volcanic soup wells by the Soup Dragon.

The word &quot;Clanger&quot; is said to derive from the sound made by opening the metal cover of one of the creatures&#x27; crater-like burrows, each of which was covered with an old metal dustbin lid, to protect against meteorite impacts (and space debris). In each episode there would be some problem to solve, typically concerning something invented or discovered, or some new visitor to meet. Music Trees, with note-shaped fruit, grew on the planet&#x27;s surface, and music would often be an integral feature in the simple but amusing plots. In the &quot;Fishing&quot; episode, one of the Cheese Trees provided a cylindrical five-line staff for notes taken from the Music Trees.

Postgate provided the narration, for the most part in a soft, melodic voice, describing and accounting for the curious antics of the little blue planet&#x27;s knitted pink inhabitants, and providing a &quot;translation&quot;, as it were, for much of their whistled dialogue. Postgate claimed that in reality when the Clangers&#x27; were whistling, they were &quot;swearing their little heads off&quot;.

==Production==

The first of the 26 episodes (aired as two series of 13 programmes each) was broadcast on BBC1 from 16 November 1969. The last edition of the second series was transmitted on 10 November 1972.

However, there was also one final programme, a seven-minute election special entitled &quot;Vote for Froglet&quot;, broadcast on 10 October 1974 (the day of the General Election). Oliver Postgate said in a 2005 interview that he wasn&#x27;t sure whether the 1974 special still existed, and it has been referred to as a &quot;missing episode&quot;. In fact the whole episode is available from the British Film Institute.

The original Mother Clanger puppet was stolen in 1972. Today, Major Clanger and the second Mother Clanger are on display at the Rupert Bear Museum.

The Clangers grew in size between the first and last episodes, to allow Firmin to use an Action Man model figure in the episode &quot;The Rock Collector&quot;.

BBC&#x27;s CBeebies channel and the American pre-school channel, Sprout, produced a new series for broadcasting in their 2015 schedules, with Michael Palin narrating in place of the late Oliver Postgate. The American pre-school channel Sprout were major funders and co-producers having commissioned the series in tandem with the BBC, with William Shatner narrating.

In November 2015, &quot;The Clangers&quot; won the Best Pre-school Animation award at the BAFTAs.

==Awards==
==Characters==
The principal characters are the Clangers themselves, the females wearing tabards and the males brass armour:

* Granny Clanger: an elderly Clanger, she is fond of knitting and often falls asleep. She wears a black tabard in the original show, but a lilac one in the new version. She is also Major Clanger&#x27;s mother.
* Major Clanger: the father and head of the family, he is determined to get all things right on their planet, and can be grumpy. He wears brass armour. Narrator of the 2015 series, Michael Palin, said that Major Clanger is one of his favourite characters.
* Mother Clanger: mother to Tiny Clanger and Small Clanger, Mother Clanger is the matriarch of the family and is often seen preparing and dispensing the Clangers&#x27; soup or Blue String Pudding, though her favourite thing to do is gardening. She wears a red tabard.
* Small Clanger: the son of Mother and Major Clanger, and the older brother of Tiny Clanger, Small Clanger is very inquisitive and inventive, which - despite his best intentions - has sometimes led to some element of chaos amongst the Clangers, the soup pump being a classic example. Small Clanger is often the focus of the episodes, as he is the most adventurous of the family. He wears brass armour in the original show, but wears a blue tabard in the new version.
* Tiny Clanger: youngest of the family, daughter to Mother and Major Clanger, and younger sister to Small Clanger, Tiny Clanger often plays a key role in the episodes too. She has a kind and gentle nature, that is apparent in many episodes in which a new visitor arrives, as she usually tries to communicate peacefully with them. She wears a red tabard in the original show. This changed to a bright pink one in the first series of the new version before turning to a reddish pink in later series.
* Three other Clangers, two males with different coloured hair and a female wearing blue, also appear in the original episodes, but they have been dropped for the 2015 revival.

===Other inhabitants===
* Soup Dragon: a benign, female creature with a penchant for Green Soup. The Soup Dragon dwells in the soup wells within the Clangers&#x27; planet. She is often summoned by tapping on the top of what look like small inactive volcanoes; she slides the lid back, and then takes a jug from (usually) Small Clanger, which she fills for them to eat. A green glow is visible beneath her when she emerges, suggesting the presence of a substantial lake of green soup.
* Baby Soup Dragon: the Soup Dragon&#x27;s son, Baby Soup Dragon was brought into the Clangers&#x27; world when the Soup Dragon became broody, which meant the Clangers could not get any soup. Tiny Clanger called the Iron Chicken by radio, for advice, and she told Tiny to get the egg which she had left on the surface of the planet and to fill it with ingredients. Then they made a nest with macaroni sticks, not far from the soup wells, and placed the egg in the middle. The Iron Chicken asked the Clangers to stand back while she shot the iron egg with a beam from her nest: this had an effect, and the Soup Dragon saw the egg and instinctively sat upon it, moments after the beam was shut off. Then the Soup Dragon was startled and leapt up to find that the egg was hatched and she had a Baby Soup Dragon.
* Froglets: a trio of small orange aliens with black, stalk-like legs and large eyes, who travel around in a top hat. In the 2015 series, they can change colour to yellow and blue (and, on one occasion, Green). In &quot;The Medal&quot;, a series 3 episode of the revived series, 6 froglets can be seen together, and in series 2, one episode has 4, including the green one.
* The Cloud: a cotton-wool cloud that floats over the surface of the planet, releasing musical raindrops. In the 2015 series, it displays the ability to change its shape.
* Music Trees: the two small Music Trees are a permanent fixture on the surface of the Clangers&#x27; planet. They sit in a small divot on the surface (in the 2015 series, they sit atop a small hill) and are often harvested by the Clangers for their musical notes, although the Clangers always politely ask the trees first, after which the trees release some of their notes onto the ground, suggesting some form of sentience.
* Glow Buzzers: lightbulb-like creatures which live around the Clangers&#x27; caves, in hives that they fill with &quot;Glow Honey&quot;. They helped Small Clanger find his way out of the flower caves when he followed them one time to find out where they got the Glow Honey from. The Glow Buzzers are rendered digitally in the new series.
* Iron Chicken: a &quot;bird&quot; made of scrap metal (modelled from Meccano), which lives in an orbiting nest made of metallic junk. The pieces were found around the Smallfilms studio.
* Iron Chick: the Iron Chicken&#x27;s chick, who appeared in two episodes of series 2, and in the 2015 series.
* Sky Moos: large, flying, blue cow-like creatures that appear in several episodes. They are always hungry, which can come in handy.
* Singing Flowers: a pair of singing flowers introduced in the 2015 series who are friends of Tiny Clanger.

===Visitors===
Other characters appeared in only one or two episodes each:
* Hoots: small horn-like creatures with three legs, speaking like trumpets.
* A Spaceman: an astronaut who arrives to collect rock samples. Upon landing, the Clangers observe his movements and discover that he is digging up rocks. Small Clanger peeks out of a hole and takes the wicker basket he is (rather humorously) placing the collected rocks in. The astronaut turns to find his basket gone and begins to look for it, searching the surface until he lifts the lid off one of the holes only to find Tiny Clanger within. This clearly scares the astronaut, who proceeds to run away, and falls straight down one of the holes into the planet where he then falls into a soup well. After the Clangers retrieve him and clean him up, he appears to be still in shock, as he then begins to run around again in panic, at which point he accidentally runs himself into orbit around their planet. Small Clanger retrieves him with a fishing rod and a magnet. The Clangers eventually bundle him back into his spacecraft and send him home.
* Lunar Rover: the rover appeared when the Clangers were building a structure on the surface and one of them noticed an incoming object. They all dived below for safety, and on impact the rover destroyed the structure they were building, much to the Clangers&#x27; annoyance. They all observed the rover, staying just out of its sight. When it began to dig - and seemingly eat - some of the surface, Major Clanger intervened and stopped it. It then turned to face him and they attempted to shake hands, at which point the Rover&#x27;s &quot;nose&quot; came off in Major Clanger&#x27;s hand. He tries to return it, but the Rover drives off, finds a suitable bit of ground, then launches itself back into space. Major Clanger exclaims that it is &quot;Marvellous&quot;.
* Eggbots: a group of egg-shaped, nesting doll-like robots who make sounds based on the solfège scale (each smaller Eggbot emitting a successive musical note (&quot;Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do&quot;)).
* Metal Caterpillar: a metallic caterpillar who hatched from a metal egg which Small Clanger found in space. It ate anything that was metal, until it wove a cocoon and became a moth.
* Wols: metallic colorful owls, who fly by spinning. The Iron Chicken had to look after three baby Wols whilst their parent was away
* The Tin Bird visited the Clangers&#x27; planet during an episode of the 2017 series, looking for a place to build a nest.

==Music and sound effects==
One of the most noted aspects was the use of sound effects, with a score composed by Vernon Elliott under instructions from Postgate. Although the episodes were scripted, most of the music used in the two series was written in translation by Postgate in the form of &quot;musical sketches&quot; or graphs that he drew for Elliott, who converted the drawings into a musical score. The music was then recorded by the two, along with other musicians – dubbed the &quot;Clangers Ensemble&quot; – in a village hall, where they would often leave the windows open, leading to the sounds of birds outside being heard on some recordings. Much of the score was performed on Elliott&#x27;s bassoon, and also included harp, clarinet, glockenspiel and bells.

The distinctive whistles made by the Clangers, performed on swanee whistles, have become as identifiable as the characters themselves, much imitated by viewers. The series creators have said that the Clangers, living in vacuum, did not communicate by sound, but rather by a type of nuclear magnetic resonance, which was translated to audible whistles for the human audience. These whistles followed the rhythm and intonation of a script in English. The action was also narrated by a voice-over from Postgate. However, when the series was shown without narration to a group of overseas students, many of them felt that the Clangers were speaking their particular language.

Postgate recounted: &quot;When the BBC got the script, [they] rang me up and said &quot;At the beginning of episode three, where the doors get stuck, Major Clanger says &#x27;sod it, the bloody thing’s stuck again&#x27;. Well, darling, you can&#x27;t say that on children&#x27;s television, you know, I mean you just can&#x27;t&quot;. I said &quot;It&#x27;s not going to be said, it&#x27;s going to be whistled&quot;, but [they] just said &quot;But people will know!&quot; I said no, that if they had nice minds, they&#x27;d think &quot;Oh dear, the silly thing&#x27;s not working properly&quot;. If you watch the episode, the one where the rocket goes up and shoots down the Iron Chicken, Major Clanger kicks the door to make it work and his first words are &quot;Sod it, the bloody thing&#x27;s stuck again&quot;. Years later, when the merchandising took off, the Golden Bear company wanted a Clanger and a Clanger phrase for it to make when you squeezed it, they got &quot;Sod it, the bloody thing’s stuck again&quot;!&quot;

Series 1 episode, &quot;The Visitor&quot; features two brief extracts from the song, &quot;No Smokes&quot; (1967) by the Glasgow psychedelic band One in a Million.

John Du Prez, who wrote some of the music for &quot;Monty Python&quot; (another show Michael Palin was in) composed the score for the 2015 series.

==Episodes from the original series==
===Series 1 (1969–1970)===
The first series was transmitted on BBC1 at 5:55pm, except for the episode &quot;Chicken&quot; which went out at 5:50pm because there was a &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal at 6:00pm.
===Series 2 (1971–1972)===
The second series episodes were also transmitted weekly on BBC1, but in a wide variety of differing timeslots. Episodes 1 and 2 were seen at 4:50pm; episodes 3, 5 and 6 at 5:05pm; episodes 4 and 8 at 5:00pm; episode 7 at 4:40pm; episode 9 at 5:30pm; and episodes 10, 11, 12 and 13 (which followed episode 9 after a gap of more than a year) at 4:00pm.

===Specials===
The first of these was an election special, produced in 1974, entitled &quot;Vote for Froglet&quot;. Inspired by what Postgate referred to as the &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot; (a phrase from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot;, usually employed to refer to the winter of 1978–79, but Postgate was referring to the miners&#x27; strike in the winter of 1973-74), and inspired partly by his recollections of post-war Germany, it was broadcast on the night of the October 1974 General Election. The narrator explains the democratic process, and demonstrates it by asking the Clangers to vote between the Soup Dragon and a Froglet. The Soup Dragon wins the election on a policy of &quot;No Soup for Froglets&quot;, but the Clangers are dissatisfied with the result. This special was believed to be a lost episode for many years, but it was released in full for free by the British Film Institute to coincide with the 2017 UK General Election.

==Episodes from the revival series==
===Series 1 (2015–2016)===
Episodes 1–26 were first broadcast at 5:30pm,
while episodes 27–52 were at 6:00pm on CBeebies.
Following the March 2015 special, a full series was commissioned for the summer of that year. The series was narrated by Michael Palin, and co-produced by Smallfilms with the involvement of Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate&#x27;s son, Dan. The series was directed by Chris Tichborne and Mole Hill, with music composed by John Du Prez. 52 11-minute episodes were commissioned. The voices of the Iron Chicken, the Soup Dragon, and the Baby Soup Dragon were by Dan Postgate.

The first episode of the new series aired on 15 June 2015. It turned out to be a massive hit for CBeebies. The BBC News Entertainment and Arts magazine revealed that 65% of the episode&#x27;s viewing audience of 484,000 were adults, and that it was CBeebies&#x27; most watched programme of 2015 up to that date. The rating was more than double the previous record, set by an episode of &quot;Alphablocks&quot;, &quot;Numberjacks&quot;, &quot;Waybuloo&quot;, &quot;Fimbles&quot;, &quot;Charlie and Lola&quot;, &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;The Lingo Show&quot; and &quot;The Octonauts&quot; that year, as well as other CBeebies favourites since the station&#x27;s launch in 2002, although an episode of &quot;Numberjacks&quot; peaked at over 1 million back in 2009.

The same year, William Shatner was chosen to be the American narrator for the series airing on the cable network Sprout.

===Series 2 (2017-2018)===
A second series of the revival, and the fourth series overall, was released on 11 September 2017 with 26 more episodes.

===Series 3 (2019-2020)===
A third series of the revival, and the fifth series overall was broadcast on CBeebies on 17 July 2019 with another 26 more episodes.

===Specials===
==Reception==
Although not quite as popular as &quot;Bagpuss&quot; (which in 1999 was voted in a British television poll the best children&#x27;s television programme ever made), since the death of Postgate in December 2008 interest has been revived in his work, which is considered to have had a notable influence on British culture throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In 2007, Postgate and Firmin were jointly presented with the Action for Children&#x27;s Arts J. M. Barrie Award &quot;for a lifetime&#x27;s achievement in delighting children&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Soup Dragons, a Scottish alternative rock band of the late 1980s and early 1990s, took their name from the Clangers character.

In the 1972 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;, The Master is seen to be watching the episode &quot;The Rock Collector&quot;. He states that they are fascinating creatures and even mimics their language. He is told that they are just television characters. The Master rolls his eyes; he was obviously joking and knows full well they are puppets.

A Clanger (as a glove-puppet rather than a stop-motion puppet) appears as a member of the &quot;Puppet Government&quot; in &quot;The Goodies&quot; TV episode &quot;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&quot;.

From the block&#x27;s start until its discontinuation, the UK&#x27;s Nick Jr. Classics block aired &quot;Clangers&quot; episodes specifically for parents who remembered the show.

Tiny Clanger (also as a glove-puppet) appeared on &quot;Sprout&#x27;s Sunny Side Up Show&quot; in honour of the U.S. premiere of &quot;Clangers&quot;.

==Other countries==
The series was not widely broadcast outside the UK in the 1970s, mainly because it did not require additional money from sales abroad to finance its production. However the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation showed the series in 1970 and 1982, entitled &quot;Romlingane&quot;. It was narrated by Ingebrigt Davik, a popular author of children&#x27;s books. It was shown on Swedish television in the late 1960s and 1970s, entitled &quot;Rymdlarna&quot;. The first 13 episodes were also shown on Czechoslovak Television in August 1972, entitled &quot;Rámusíci&quot; as a part of the children&#x27;s evening program slot &quot;Večerníček&quot;.

The revived version in 2015 has received funding from Sprout, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal, and has been pre-sold to other foreign broadcasters including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The American transmissions are narrated by William Shatner.

As from 2018, it is also broadcast on the Belgian channel Ketnet. As of 2023 the 2015 UK version is on the American video on demand site Bentkey.

==Soundtrack album==
In 2001, a selection of the music and sound effects was compiled by Jonny Trunk from 128 musical cues held by Postgate, who contributed act one, &quot;The Iron Chicken and the Music Trees&quot;, of &quot;A Clangers Opera&quot;, with libretto that he had compiled.

<text>Terence Dean Brooks (born January 8, 1944) is an American writer of fantasy fiction. He writes mainly epic fantasy, and has also written two film novelizations. He has written 23 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers during his writing career, and has sold over 25 million copies of his books in print. He is one of the most successful living fantasy writers.

==Early life==
Brooks was born in the rural Midwestern town of Sterling, Illinois, and spent a large part of his life living there. He is an alumnus of Hamilton College, earning his B.A. in English literature in 1966. He later obtained a J.D. degree from Washington and Lee University. He was a practicing attorney before becoming a full-time author.

==Career==
Brooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of science fiction, western, fiction, and non-fiction. One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, which inspired him to write in one genre. While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk &quot;Why I Write about Elves&quot;, as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to William Faulkner&#x27;s works. With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;.

After finishing two sequels to &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the &quot;Landover&quot; novels. Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled &quot;The Heritage of Shannara&quot;. For the next fourteen years, he wrote more &quot;Landover&quot; books, then went on to write &quot;The Word and Void&quot; trilogy. Continuing the &quot;Shannara&quot; series, Brooks wrote the prequel to &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot;, titled &quot;First King of Shannara&quot;. He then wrote two series, &quot;The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara&quot; and &quot;High Druid of Shannara&quot; and finished a third, &quot;Genesis of Shannara&quot;, a trilogy bridging his &quot;Word and Void&quot; and &quot;Shannara&quot; series. The sixth book in the &quot;Landover&quot; series, &quot;A Princess of Landover&quot;, was released in August 2009. Returning to Shannara, a duology, &quot;Legends of Shannara&quot;, taking place after the events of &quot;Genesis of Shannara&quot;, was written next. The first book, entitled &quot;Bearers of the Black Staff&quot;, was released in August 2010 and the second, &quot;The Measure of the Magic&quot;, was released in August 2011. He next completed a trilogy entitled &quot;The Dark Legacy of Shannara&quot;. The three books are; &quot;Wards of Faerie&quot; (Feb 2013), &quot;Bloodfire Quest&quot; (June 2013), and &quot;Witch Wraith&quot; (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy &quot;Defenders of Shannara&quot;, which include &quot;The High Druid&#x27;s Blade&quot; (July 2014), &quot;The Darkling Child&quot; (June 2015), and &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (May 24, 2016). According to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as &quot;The Fall of Shannara&quot;. The first book in the tetralogy is &quot;The Black Elfstone&quot; and was released on June 13, 2017. The second book in the series is &quot;The Skaar Invasion &quot; released on June 19, 2018. The third book in the series is &quot;The Stiehl Assassin&quot; published on May 28, 2019. The fourth and final book in the tetralogy is &quot;The Last Druid&quot;, published on October 20, 2020.

A television series based on the Shannara works, entitled &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot;, began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, &quot;Elfstones&quot;, as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book. The second season aired in 2017 on Spike TV. On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons. Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.

Brooks has written a number of other books, based on movies, science fiction and his own life. Novels include &quot;Hook&quot;, based on the movie of the same name, first published November 24, 1991, and republished in 1998. &quot;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; was published April 21, 1999, with four differing dust jacket covers. His own writing life is reflected in two stories, &quot;Sometimes the Magic Works: Lessons from a Writing Life&quot;, published February 3, 2004, and &quot;Why I Write About Elves&quot; published in 2005. A science fiction book, &quot;Street Freaks&quot;, was released on October 2, 2018. Brooks has written a number of e-book short stories which are published in a book titled &quot;Small Magic&quot; with his other short stories.

==Personal life==
Brooks resides in Seattle, Washington, with his wife, Judine.

==Novels versus short stories==
After writing &quot;Indomitable&quot;, a short story constituting an epilogue to &quot;The Wishsong of Shannara&quot;, Terry Brooks declared:

<doc id="31456" wikidata="Q43193" url="?curid=31456" title="Truck">
<text>A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport freight, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle. Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a &quot;straight truck&quot; while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a &quot;tractor&quot;.

The majority of trucks currently in use are powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in North America. Electrically powered trucks are more popular in China and Europe than elsewhere. In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to are defined as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles.

==History==

===Steam wagons===
Trucks and cars have a common ancestor: the steam-powered &quot;fardier&quot; Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built in 1769. However, steam wagons were not common until the mid-19th century. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these vehicles to very short hauls, usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first semi-trailer appeared in 1881, towed by a steam tractor manufactured by De Dion-Bouton. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of World War I, and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.

===Internal combustion===
In 1895, Karl Benz designed and built the first internal combustion truck. Later that year some of Benz&#x27;s trucks were modified to become busses by &quot;Netphener&quot;. A year later, in 1896, another internal combustion engine truck was built by Gottlieb Daimler, the Daimler Motor Lastwagen. Other companies, such as Peugeot, Renault and Büssing, also built their own versions. The first truck in the United States was built by Autocar in 1899 and was available with engines. Another early American truck was built by George Eldridge of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1903. It was powered by an engine with two opposed cylinders, and had a chain drive A 1903 Eldridge truck is displayed at the Iowa 80 Trucking Museum, Walcott, Iowa. Trucks of the era mostly used two-cylinder engines and had a carrying capacity of . After World War I, several advances were made: electric starters, and 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines.

===Diesel engines===
Although it had been invented in 1897, the diesel engine did not appear in production trucks until Benz introduced it in 1923. The diesel engine was not common in trucks in Europe until the 1930s. In the United States, Autocar introduced diesel engines for heavy applications in the mid-1930s. Demand was high enough that Autocar launched the &quot;DC&quot; model (diesel conventional) in 1939. However, it took much longer for diesel engines to be broadly accepted in the US: gasoline engines were still in use on heavy trucks in the 1970s.

===Electric motors===

Electrically powered trucks predate internal combustion ones and have been continuously available since the mid-19th-century. In the 1920s Autocar Trucks was the first of the major truck manufacturers to offer a range of electric trucks for sale. Electric trucks were successful for urban delivery roles and as specialized work vehicles like forklifts and pushback tugs. The higher energy density of liquid fuels soon led to the decline of electric-powered trucks in favor of, first, gasoline, and then diesel and CNG-fueled engines until battery technology advanced in the 2000s when new chemistries and higher-volume production broadened the range of applicability of electric propulsion to trucks in many more roles. Today, manufacturers are electrifying all trucks ahead of national regulatory requirements, with long-range over-the-road trucks being the most challenging.

===Etymology===
&quot;Truck&quot; is used in American English; the British English equivalent is lorry.

The first known usage of &quot;truck&quot; was in 1611 when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships&#x27; cannon carriages, and comes from &quot;Trokhos&quot; (Greek) = &quot;wheel&quot;. In its extended usage, it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads, a meaning known since 1771. Its expanded application to &quot;motor-powered load carrier&quot; has been in usage since 1930, shortened from &quot;motor truck&quot;, which dates back to 1901.

&quot;Lorry&quot; has a more uncertain origin, but probably has its roots in the rail transport industry, where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a goods wagon as in British usage, not a bogie as in the American), specifically a large flat wagon. It might derive from the verb &quot;lurry&quot; (to carry or drag along, or to lug) which was in use as early as 1664, but that association is not definitive. The expanded meaning of &quot;lorry&quot;, &quot;self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods&quot;, has been in usage since 1911.

===International variance===

In the United States, Canada, and the Philippines, &quot;truck&quot; is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than regular passenger cars, but includes large SUVs, pickups, and other vehicles with an open load bed.

In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the word &quot;truck&quot; is mostly reserved for larger vehicles. In Australia and New Zealand, a pickup truck is frequently called a &quot;ute&quot; (short for &quot;utility&quot; vehicle), while in South Africa it is called a &quot;bakkie&quot; (Afrikaans: &quot;small open container&quot;).

In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland, and Hong Kong &quot;lorry&quot; is used instead of &quot;truck&quot;, but only for the medium and heavy types, while &quot;truck&quot; is used almost exclusively to refer to pickups.

==Types by size==
===Ultra light===
Often produced as variations of golf cars, with internal combustion or battery electric drive, these are used typically for off-highway use on estates, golf courses, and parks. While not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets, generally as a body variation of a neighborhood electric vehicle. A few manufactures produce specialized chassis for this type of vehicle, while Zap Motors markets a version of their Xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the U.S. as a motorcycle).

===Very light===
Popular in Europe and Asia, many mini-trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with monocoque bodies. Specialized designs with substantial frames such as the Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by Daihatsu) and are popular for use in &quot;old town&quot; sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.

Regardless of name, these small trucks serve a wide range of uses. In Japan, they are regulated under the Kei car laws, which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently, the engine is limited to 660 cc displacement). These vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in Japan. These Japanese-made mini-trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road ATVs in the United States, and import regulations require that these mini-trucks have a speed governor as they are classified as low-speed vehicles. These vehicles have found uses in construction, large campuses (government, university, and industrial), agriculture, cattle ranches, amusement parks, and replacements for golf carts.

Major mini-truck manufacturers and their brands include: Daihatsu Hijet, Honda Acty, Tata Ace, Mazda Scrum, Mitsubishi Minicab, Subaru Sambar, and Suzuki Carry.

===Light===
Light trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than ) and are used by individuals and businesses alike. In the EU they may not weigh more than and are allowed to be driven with a driving licence for cars.

Pickup trucks, called &quot;utes&quot; in Australia and New Zealand, are common in North America and some regions of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but not so in Europe, where this size of commercial vehicle is most often made as vans.

===Medium===
Medium trucks are larger than light but smaller than heavy trucks. In the US, they are defined as weighing between . For the UK and the EU the weight is between . Local delivery and public service (dump trucks, garbage trucks and fire-fighting trucks) are normally around this size.

===Heavy===
Heavy trucks are the largest on-road trucks, Class 8. These include vocational applications such as heavy dump trucks, concrete pump trucks, and refuse hauling, as well as ubiquitous long-haul 4x2 and 6×4 tractor units.

Road damage and wear increase very rapidly with the axle weight. The number of steering axles and the suspension type also influence the amount of the road wear. In many countries with good roads a six-axle truck may have a maximum weight of or more.

===Off-road===
Off-road trucks include standard, extra heavy-duty highway-legal trucks, typically outfitted with off-road features such as a front driving axle and special tires for applications such as logging and construction, and purpose-built off-road vehicles unconstrained by weight limits, such as the Liebherr T 282B mining truck.

===Maximum sizes by country===

Australia has complex regulations over weight and length, including axle spacing, type of axle/axle group, rear overhang, kingpin to rear of trailer, drawbar length, ground clearance, as well as height and width laws. These limits are some of the highest in the world, a B-double can weigh and be long, and road trains used in the outback can weigh and be long.

The European Union also has complex regulations. The number and spacing of axles, steering, single or dual tires, and suspension type all affect maximum weights. Length of a truck, of a trailer, from axle to hitch point, kingpin to rear of trailer, and turning radius are all regulated. In additions, there are special rules for carrying containers, and countries can set their own rules for local traffic.

The United States Federal Bridge Law deals with the relation between the gross weight of the truck, the number of axles, the weight on and the spacing between the axles that the truck can have on the Interstate highway system. Each State determines the maximum permissible vehicle, combination, and axle weight on state and local roads.
Uniquely, the State of Michigan has a gross vehicle weight limit of , which is twice the U.S. federal limit. A measure to change the law was defeated in the Michigan Senate in 2019.

==Design==
Almost all trucks share a common construction: they are made of a chassis, a cab, an area for placing cargo or equipment, axles, suspension and roadwheels, an engine and a drivetrain. Pneumatic, hydraulic, water, and electrical systems may also be present. Many also tow one or more trailers or semi-trailers.

===Cab===


The &quot;cab&quot;, or &quot;cabin&quot; is an enclosed space where the driver is seated. A &quot;sleeper&quot; is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks.

There are several cab configurations:
* &quot;Cab over engine&quot; (COE) or &quot;flat nose&quot;; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the engine. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, and is widely used in the rest of the world. They were common in North American heavy-duty trucks but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium- and light-duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of &quot;tilt-cab&quot;. This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads require the short turning radius afforded by the shorter wheelbase of the cab over engine layout.
* &quot;Cab-under&quot; is where the driver is positioned at the front at the lowest point possible as means for maximum cargo space as possible. Examples were made by Hunslet, Leyland, Bussing, Strick and Steinwinter.
* &quot;Conventional&quot; cabs seated the driver behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very , with a sloped hood (bonnet) and other features to lower drag. Conventional cabs are the most common in North America, Australia, and China, and are known in the UK as &quot;American cabs&quot; and in the Netherlands as &quot;torpedo cabs&quot;.
* &quot;Cab beside engine&quot; designs are used for terminal tractors at shipping yards and for other specialist vehicles carrying long loads such as pipes. This type is often made by replacing the passenger side of a cab-over truck with an extended section of the load bed.
A further step from this is the side loading forklift that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.

===Engines and motors===

Most small trucks such as sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans or pickups, and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use gasoline engines (petrol engines), but many diesel engined models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use four-stroke diesel engines with a turbocharger and intercooler. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a V12 Detroit Diesel two stroke engine. A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ CNG (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions.

A significant proportion of North American manufactured trucks use an engine built by the last remaining major independent engine manufacturer (Cummins) but most global OEMs such as Volvo Trucks and Daimler AG promote their own &quot;captive&quot; engines.

In the European Union, all new truck engines must comply with Euro VI emission regulations, and Euro 7 from the late 2020s has stricter exhaust limits and also limits air pollution from brakes and tires.

 several alternative technologies are competing to displace the use of diesel engines in heavy trucks. CNG engines are widely used in the US refuse industry and in concrete mixers, among other short-range vocations, but range limitations have prevented their broader uptake in freight hauling applications. Heavy electric trucks and hydrogen-powered trucks are new to the market in 2021, but major freight haulers are interested. Although cars will be first the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles includes trucks. According to The Economist magazine &quot;Electric lorries will probably run on hydrogen, not batteries, which are too expensive.&quot; Other researchers say that once faster chargers are available batteries will become competitive against diesel for all, except perhaps the heaviest, trucks.

===Drivetrain===
Small trucks use the same type of transmissions as almost all cars, having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with synchromesh (synchronizers). Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as &quot;crash boxes&quot;, require double-clutching for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as &quot;floating&quot;, a method of changing gears which does not use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double-clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.

Double-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain the required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while the transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while the transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. &quot;Skip changing&quot; is also widely used; in principle, the operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.

Common North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18 speeds. Automatic and automated manual transmissions for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12, and 16 gears are common on larger trucks with a manual transmission, while conventional automatic or automated manual transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the &quot;range and split&quot; (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so‑called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.

===Frame===
A truck frame consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C‑shaped rails, or beams, held together by crossmembers. These frames are referred to as ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy-duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.

The frame is usually made of steel, but can be made (whole or in part) of aluminum for a lighter weight. A tow bar may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy tractors almost always make use of a fifth wheel hitch.

===Body types===
Box trucks have walls and a roof, making an enclosed load space. The rear has doors for unloading; a side door is sometimes fitted.

Chassis cab trucks have a fully enclosed cab at the front, with bare chassis frame-rails behind, suitable for subsequent permanent attachment of a specialized payload, like a fire-truck or ambulance body.

Concrete mixers have a rotating drum on an inclined axis, rotating in one direction to mix, and in the other to discharge the concrete down chutes. Because of the weight and power requirements of the drum body and rough construction sites, mixers have to be very heavy duty.

Dual drive/Steer trucks are vehicles used to steer the rear of trailers.

Dump trucks (&quot;tippers&quot; in the UK) transport loose material such as sand, gravel, or dirt for construction. A typical dump truck has an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and lifts at the front, allowing the material in the bed to be unloaded (&quot;dumped&quot;) on the ground behind the truck.

Flatbed trucks have an entirely flat, level platform body. This allows for quick and easy loading but has no protection for the load. Hanging or removable sides are sometimes fitted, often in the form of a .

Refrigerator trucks have insulated panels as walls and a roof and floor, used for transporting fresh and frozen cargo such as ice cream, food, vegetables, and prescription drugs. They are mostly equipped with double-wing rear doors, but a side door is sometimes fitted.

Refuse trucks have a specialized body for collecting and, often, compacting trash collected from municipal, commercial, and industrial sites. This application has the widest use of the cab-over configuration in North America, to provide better maneuverability in tight situations. They are also among the most severe-duty and highest GVWR trucks on public roads.

Semi-tractors (&quot;artics&quot; in the UK) have a fifth wheel for towing a semi-trailer instead of a body.

Tank trucks (&quot;tankers&quot; in the UK) are designed to carry liquids or gases. They usually have a cylindrical tank lying horizontally on the chassis. Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids and gases that can be transported.

Wreckers (&quot;recovery lorries&quot; in the UK) are used to recover and/or tow disabled vehicles. They are normally equipped with a boom with a cable; wheel/chassis lifts are becoming common on newer trucks.

===Truck market worldwide===
==Driving==
In many countries, driving a truck requires a special driving license. The requirements and limitations vary with each different jurisdiction.

===Australia===

In Australia, a truck driver&#x27;s license is required for any motor vehicle with a Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) exceeding . The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as:
;Combination
* HC: Heavy Combination, a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination.
* MC: Multi Combination, e.g., B Doubles/road trains

; Rigid
* LR: Light rigid: a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than but not more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM.
* MR: Medium rigid: a rigid vehicle with 2 axles and a GVM of more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM. Also includes vehicles in class &quot;LR&quot;.
* HR: Heavy Rigid: a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than . Any towed trailer must not weigh more than GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class &quot;MR&quot;.

;Heavy vehicle transmission
There is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class &quot;HC&quot;, &quot;HR&quot;, or &quot;MC&quot; test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver&#x27;s license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box).

===Europe===

Driving licensing has been harmonized throughout the European Union and the EEA (and practically all European non-member states), so that common rules apply within Europe (see European driving licence). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats). For licenses first acquired after 1997, that weight was reduced to , not including trailers.

Since 2013, the C1 license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 and up to 7.5 tonnes. The C license category allows driving vehicles over 3.5 tonnes with a trailer up to 750 kg, and the CE category allows driving category C vehicles with a trailer over 750 kg.

===South Africa===
To drive any vehicle with a GVM exceeding , a code C1 drivers license is required. Furthermore, if the vehicle exceeds a code C license becomes necessary.

To drive any vehicle in South Africa towing a trailer with a GVM more than , further restrictions apply and the driver must possess a license suitable for the GVM of the total combination as well as an articulated endorsement. This is indicated with the letter &quot;E&quot; prefixing the license code.

In addition, any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing a Public Driver&#x27;s Permit, (or PrDP) of the applicable type. This is an additional license that is added to the DL card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license.

The requirements for obtaining the different classes are below.
* &quot;G&quot;: Required for the transport of general goods, requires a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal.
* &quot;P&quot;: Required for the transport of paying passengers, requires a more stringent criminal record check, additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue. A G class PrDP will be issued at the same time.
* &quot;D&quot;: Required for the transport of dangerous materials, requires all of the same checks as class P., and in addition the driver must be over 25 at time of issue.

===United States===

In the United States, a commercial driver&#x27;s license is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing or more. The federal government regulates how many hours a driver may be on the clock, how much rest and sleep time is required (e.g., 11 hours driving/14 hours on-duty followed by 10 hours off, with a maximum of 70 hours/8 days or 60 hours/7 days, 34 hours restart ) Violations are often subject to significant penalties. Instruments to track each driver&#x27;s hours must sometimes be fitted.
In 2006, the US trucking industry employed 1.8 million drivers of heavy trucks.

There is a shortage of willing trained long-distance truck drivers. Part of the reason for this is the economic fallout from deregulation of the trucking industry. Michael H. Belzer, associate professor, in the economics department at Wayne State University and co-author of &quot;Sweatshops on Wheels: Winners and Losers in Trucking Deregulation&quot;, argues that low pay, bad working conditions and unsafe conditions have been a direct result of deregulation. The book cites poor working conditions and an unfair pay system as responsible for high annual employee turnover in the industry.

In 2018, in the US, 5,096 large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes:
* The number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes is 4,862,
* The number of large trucks involved in injury crashes is 112,000,
* The number of large trucks involved in property damage only crashes is 414,000.

==Environmental effects==

Like cars, trucks contribute to air, noise, and water pollution. Unlike cars, , most trucks run on diesel, and diesel exhaust is especially dangerous for health. Some countries outside the EU have different vehicle emission standards for trucks and cars.

NOx and particulates emitted by trucks are very dangerous to health, causing thousands of early deaths annually in the US alone. As older trucks are usually the worst, many cities have banned 20th century trucks. Air pollution also threatens professional truck drivers.

Over a quarter of global transport emissions are from road freight, in 2021 over 1700 million tonnes from medium and heavy trucks, so many countries are further restricting truck emissions to help limit climate change. Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail, especially in Europe. Several countries have pledged that 30% of sales of trucks and buses will be zero emission by 2030.

With respect to noise pollution, trucks emit considerably higher sound levels at all speeds compared to typical cars; this contrast is particularly strong with heavy-duty trucks. There are several aspects of truck operations that contribute to the overall sound that is emitted. Continuous sounds are those from tires rolling on the roadway and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds. Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a turbocharger on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an exhaust brake retarder when traversing a downgrade. There has been noise regulation put in place to help control where and when the use of engine braking retarders are allowed.

== Operator health and safety ==

A truck cab is a hazard control that protects the truck operator from hazardous airborne pollutants. As an enclosure, it is an example of an engineering control. Enclosed operator cabs have been used on agriculture, mining, and construction vehicles for several decades. Most modern-day enclosed cabs have heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for primarily maintaining a comfortable temperature and providing breathable air for their occupants. Various levels of filtration can be incorporated into the HVAC system to remove airborne pollutants such as dusts, diesel particulate matter (DPM), and other aerosols.

Two key elements of an effective environmental enclosure are a good filtration system and an enclosure with good integrity (sealed isolation from the outside environment). It is recommended that a filtration system filter out at least 95% or greater of airborne respirable aerosols from the intake airflow, with an additional recirculation filtering component for the inside air. Good enclosure integrity is also needed to achieve positive pressure to prevent wind-driven aerosol penetration into the enclosure&quot;,&quot; as well as to minimize air leakage around the filtration system. Test methods and mathematical modeling of environmental enclosures are also beneficial for quantifying and optimizing filtration system designs, as well as maintaining optimum protection factor performance for enclosure occupants.

==Operations issues==
===Taxes===
Commercial trucks in the US pay higher road use taxes on a state level than other road vehicles and are subject to extensive regulation. A few reasons commercial trucks pay higher road use taxes: they are bigger and heavier than most other vehicles, and cause more wear and tear per hour on roadways; and trucks and their drivers are on the road for more hours per day. Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.

===Damage to pavement===
The life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor, which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.

==Safety==
=== Trucking accidents ===

In 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008, the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths, but trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:
* 14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill
* 6.5% cause open flames

Following increased pressure from &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;Cities Fit For Cycling&quot; campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many heavy goods vehicles (HGV). These signs are directed against a common type of accident that occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV&#x27;s wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the cyclist. The signs, such as the winning design of the InTANDEM road safety competition launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside.

=== HGV safety in the EU ===

In-vehicle speed limitation is required applying a 90 km/h limit to commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.

Front, side, and rear underrun protection is required on commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.

Trucks must be fitted with blind-spot mirrors that give drivers a wider field of vision than conventional mirrors.

<text>A tamasay (or tamasai) is a bead necklace worn by Ainu women for special occasions.

== History ==
The necklace is called a shitoki if it has a medallion. They are made with large glass beads the Ainu obtained through trading with Chinese merchants. The Ainu also obtained glass beads secretly made by the Matsumae Clan. 

== Significance ==
The shitoki medallion often represents the white-tailed sea eagles that the Ainu hunt. The more strands and beads a necklace has, the more valuable it is. The necklaces are passed down through generations and are highly treasured by their owners. 

This jewelry is especially important in ceremonies and rituals because it is believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits. In certain Ainu communities, shitoki were used decorate the skulls of deceased bears during the Iomante ceremony.

<doc id="31459" wikidata="Q43669" url="?curid=31459" title="Thomas the Apostle">
<text>Thomas the Apostle (; , meaning &#x27;the Twin&#x27;), also known as Didymus ( &#x27;twin&#x27;), was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Thomas is commonly known as &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; because he initially doubted the resurrection of Jesus Christ when he was told of it (as is related in the Gospel of John); he later confessed his faith (&quot;My lord and my God&quot;) on seeing the places where the wounds appeared still fresh on the holy body of Jesus after the Crucifixion of Jesus.
According to traditional accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians of modern-day state of Kerala in India, Saint Thomas travelled outside the Roman Empire to preach the Gospel, travelling as far as Kerala in South India, and reached Muziris (modern-day North Paravur and Kodungalloor in Kerala State) in AD 52. He started the Assyrian Church of the East in the region around the Van Province, Edessa, and Hakkari regions of Upper Mesopotamia (today is in southeast Turkey), presumably sometime between mid-late AD 30s and AD 45, and spent many years evangelizing both Jews and pagans in the area before heading further east in the late AD 40s. In 1258, some of the relics were brought to Ortona, in Abruzzo, Italy, where they have been held in the Church of Saint Thomas the Apostle. He is regarded as the patron saint of India among its Christian adherents, and the Feast of Saint Thomas on July 3 is celebrated as Indian Christians&#x27; Day. The name &quot;Thomas&quot; remains quite popular among the Saint Thomas Christians of the Indian subcontinent.

Many churches in the Middle East and southern Asia, besides India, also mention Apostle Thomas in their historical traditions as being the first evangelist to establish those churches, the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the early church of Sri Lanka. 

== Gospel of John ==

Thomas first speaks in the Gospel of John. In John 11:16, when Lazarus has recently died, and the apostles do not wish to go back to Judea, Thomas says: &quot;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&quot;

Thomas speaks again in John 14:5. There, Jesus had just explained that he was going away to prepare a heavenly home for his followers, and that one day they would join him there. Thomas reacted by saying, &quot;Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?&quot;

John 20:24–29 tells how doubting Thomas was skeptical at first when he heard that Jesus had risen from the dead and appeared to the other apostles, saying, &quot;Except I shall see on his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.&quot; But when Jesus appeared later and invited Thomas to touch his wounds and behold him, Thomas showed his belief by saying, &quot;My Lord and my God&quot;. Jesus then said, &quot;Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&quot;

== Names and etymologies ==

The name &quot;Thomas&quot; (Greek: Θωμᾶς) given for the apostle in the New Testament is derived from the Aramaic תְּאוֹמָא &quot;Tʾōmā&quot; (Syriac ܬܐܘܿܡܵܐ/ܬ݁ܳܐܘܡܰܐ &quot;Tʾōmā&quot;/&quot;Tāʾwma&quot;), meaning &quot;the twin&quot; and cognate to Hebrew תְּאוֹם &quot;tʾóm&quot;. The equivalent term for twin in Greek, which is also used in the New Testament, is Δίδυμος &quot;Didymos&quot;.

=== Other names ===

The Nag Hammadi copy of the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot; begins: &quot;These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymus, Judas Thomas, recorded.&quot; Early Syrian traditions also relate the apostle&#x27;s full name as Judas Thomas. Some have seen in the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; (written in east Syria in the early 3rd century, or perhaps as early as the first half of the 2nd century) an identification of Thomas with the apostle Judas, Son of James. However, the first sentence of the Acts follows the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in distinguishing the apostle Thomas and the apostle Judas son of James. Others, such as James Tabor, identify him as Jude, brother of Jesus mentioned by Mark. In the Book of Thomas the Contender, part of the Nag Hammadi library, he is alleged to be a twin to Jesus: &quot;Now, since it has been said that you are my twin and true companion, examine yourself…&quot;

A &quot;Doubting Thomas&quot; is a skeptic who refuses to believe without direct personal experience—a reference to the Gospel of John&#x27;s depiction of the Apostle Thomas, who, in John&#x27;s account, refused to believe the resurrected Jesus had appeared to the ten other apostles until he could see and feel Jesus&#x27; crucifixion wounds.

=== Feast days ===
When the feast of Saint Thomas was inserted in the Roman calendar in the 9th century, it was assigned to 21 December. The &quot;Martyrology of St. Jerome&quot; mentioned the apostle on 3 July, the date to which the Roman celebration was transferred in 1969, so that it would no longer interfere with the major ferial days of Advent. Traditionalist Roman Catholics (who follow the General Roman Calendar of 1960 or earlier), the Lutheran Church, and many Anglicans (including members of the Episcopal Church as well as members of the Church of England who worship according to the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer), still celebrate his feast day on 21 December. However, most modern liturgical calendars (including the Common Worship calendar of the Church of England) prefer 3 July, Thomas is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival.

The Eastern Orthodox venerates Thomas on the following days:

* June 20 – Commemoration of the Translation of the Relics of the Apostles Andrew, Thomas, and Luke; the Prophet Elisha; and the Martyr Lazarus.
* June 30 – The Twelve Apostles.
* October 6 – Primary feast day.
* The First Sunday after Easter – The Sunday of Thomas, which commemorate when Thomas&#x27; doubts regarding the risen Christ were removed by Christ displaying the wounds in his hands and side.

Thomas is also associated with the &quot;Arabian&quot; (or &quot;Arapet&quot;) icon of the Theotokos (Mother of God), which is commemorated on 6 September. He is also associated with the Cincture of the Theotokos, which is commemorated on August 31.

The Malankara Orthodox Church celebrates his feast on three days, 3 July (in memory of the relic translation to Edessa, modern Şanlıurfa), 18 December (the Day he was lanced), and 21 December (when he died).

== Later history and traditions ==
&quot;The Passing of Mary&quot;, adjudged heretical by Pope Gelasius I in 494, was attributed to Joseph of Arimathea. The document states that Thomas was the only witness of the Assumption of Mary into heaven. The other apostles were miraculously transported to Jerusalem to witness her death. Thomas was left in India, but after her first burial, he was transported to her tomb, where he witnessed her bodily assumption into heaven, from which she dropped her girdle. In an inversion of the story of Thomas&#x27; doubts, the other apostles are skeptical of Thomas&#x27; story until they see the empty tomb and the girdle. Thomas&#x27; receipt of the girdle is commonly depicted in medieval and pre-Council of Trent Renaissance art.

=== Mission in India ===

According to traditional accounts of the Saint Thomas Christians of India, the Apostle Thomas landed in Muziris (Cranganore) on the Kerala coast in AD 52 and was martyred in Mylapore, near Madras, Tamil Nadu in AD 72. He is believed by the Saint Thomas Christian tradition to have established seven churches (communities) in Kerala. These churches are at Kodungallur, Palayoor, Kottakkavu (Paravur), Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kollam, and Thiruvithamcode. Thomas baptized several families. Many families claim to have origins almost as far back as these, and the religious historian Robert Eric Frykenberg notes that: &quot;Whatever dubious historicity may be attached to such local traditions, there can be little doubt as to their great antiquity or to their great appeal in the popular imagination.&quot;

Ephrem the Syrian, a doctor of Syriac Christianity, writes in the forty-second of his &quot;Carmina Nisibina&quot; that the Apostle was put to death in India, and that his remains were subsequently buried in Edessa, brought there by an unnamed merchant.

According to Eusebius&#x27; record, Thomas and Bartholomew were assigned to Parthia and northwest India. The &quot;Didascalia&quot; (dating from the end of the 3rd century) states, &quot;India and all countries condering it, even to the farthest seas... received the apostolic ordinances from Judas Thomas, who was a guide and ruler in the church which he built.&quot;

According to traditional accounts, Thomas is believed to have left northwest India when an attack threatened and traveled by vessel to the Malabar Coast, possibly visiting southeast Arabia and Socotra en route, and landing at the former flourishing port of Muziris (modern-day North Paravur and Kodungalloor) (c. AD 50) in the company of a Jewish merchant Abbanes/Habban. From there he is said to have preached the gospel throughout the Malabar coast. The various churches he founded were located mainly on the Periyar River and its tributaries and along the coast, where there were Jewish colonies.

=== Possible visit to China ===

Thomas&#x27;s alleged visit to China is mentioned in the books and church traditions of Saint Thomas Christians in India, some of whom claim descent from the early Christians evangelized by Thomas the Apostle in AD 52. For example, it is found in the Malayalam ballad &quot;Thoma Ramban Pattu&quot; (The Song of the Lord Thomas) with the earliest manuscript being from the 17th century. The sources clearly have Thomas coming to India, then to China, and back to India, where he died.

In other attested sources, the tradition of making Thomas the apostle of China is found in the &quot;Law of Christianity&quot; (Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya), a compilation of juridical literature by Ibn al-Ṭayyib (Nestorian theologian and physician who died in 1043 in Baghdad). Later, in the Nomocanon of Abdisho bar Berika (metropolitan of Nisibis and Armenia, died in 1318) and the breviary of the Chaldean Church it is written:
In its nascent form, this tradition is found at the earliest in the Zuqnin Chronicle (AD 775) and may have originated in the late Sasanian period. Perhaps it originated as a 3rd-century pseudepigraphon where Thomas would have converted the Magi (in the Gospel of Matthew) to Christianity as they dwelled in the land of Shir (land of Seres, Tarim Basin, near what was the world&#x27;s easternmost sea for many people in antiquity). Additionally, the testimony of Arnobius of Sicca, active shortly after AD 300, maintains that the Christian message had arrived in India and among the Persians, Medians, and Parthians (along with the Seres).

=== Possible travel into Indonesia ===
According to Kurt E. Koch, Thomas the Apostle possibly traveled into Indonesia via India with Indian traders.

=== Paraguayan legend ===
Ancient oral tradition retained by the Guaraní tribes of Paraguay claims that the Apostle Thomas was in Paraguay and preached to them under the name of Pa&#x27;í Sumé or Avaré Sumé (while in Peru he was known as Tumé).
Almost 150 years prior to Dobrizhoffer&#x27;s arrival in Paraguay, another Jesuit Missionary, F. J. Antonio Ruiz de Montoya recollected the same oral traditions from the Paraguayan tribes. He wrote:

The sole recorded research done about the subject was during José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia&#x27;s reign after the Independence of Paraguay. This is mentioned by Franz Wisner von Morgenstern, an Austro-Hungarian engineer who served in the Paraguayan armies prior and during the Paraguayan War. According to Wisner, some Paraguayan miners while working nearby some hills at the Caaguazú Department found some stones with ancient letters carved in them. Dictator Francia sent his finest experts to inspect those stones, and they concluded that the letters carved in those stones were Hebrew-like symbols, but they couldn&#x27;t translate them nor figure out the exact date when those letters were carved. No further recorded investigations exist, and according to Wisner, people believed that the letters were made by Thomas the Apostle, following the tradition.

== Death ==
According to Syrian Christian tradition, Thomas was killed with a spear at St. Thomas Mount in Chennai on 3 July in AD 72, and his body was interred in Mylapore. Latin Church tradition holds 21 December as his date of death. Ephrem the Syrian states that the Apostle was killed in India, and that his relics were taken then to Edessa. This is the earliest known record of his death.

The records of Barbosa from the early 16th century record that the tomb was then maintained and a lamp is burning there. The St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, presently located at the tomb, was first built in the 16th century by the Portuguese, and rebuilt in the 19th century by the British. St. Thomas Mount has been a site revered by Christians since at least the 16th century.

=== Relics ===
==== Mylapore ====
Traditional accounts say that the Apostle Thomas preached not only in Kerala but also in other parts of Southern India – and a few relics are still kept at San Thome Basilica in Mylapore neighborhood in the central part of the city of Chennai in India. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller and author of &quot;Description of the World,&quot; popularly known as &quot;Il Milione,&quot; is reputed to have visited Southern India in 1288 and 1292. The first date has been rejected as he was in China at the time, but the second date is generally accepted.

==== Edessa ====
According to tradition, in AD 232, the greater portion of relics of the Apostle Thomas are said to have been sent by an Indian king and brought from India to the city of Edessa, Mesopotamia, on which occasion his Syriac &quot;Acts&quot; were written.

The Indian king is named as &quot;Mazdai&quot; in Syriac sources, &quot;Misdeos&quot; and &quot;Misdeus&quot; in Greek and Latin sources respectively, which has been connected to the &quot;Bazdeo&quot; on the Kushan coinage of Vasudeva I, the transition between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;B&quot; being a current one in Classical sources for Indian names. The martyrologist Rabban Sliba dedicated a special day to both the Indian king, his family, and Saint Thomas:

In the 4th century, the martyrium erected over his burial place brought pilgrims to Edessa. In the 380s, Egeria described her visit in a letter she sent to her community of nuns at home:

We arrived at Edessa in the Name of Christ our God, and, on our arrival, we straightway repaired to the church and memorial of saint Thomas. There, according to custom, prayers were made and the other things that were customary in the holy places were done; we read also some things concerning saint Thomas himself. The church there is very great, very beautiful and of new construction, well worthy to be the house of God, and as there was much that I desired to see, it was necessary for me to make a three days&#x27; stay there.

According to Theodoret of Cyrrhus, the bones of Saint Thomas were transferred by Cyrus I, Bishop of Edessa, from the martyrium outside of Edessa, to a church in the south-west corner of the city on 22 August 394.

In 441, the &quot;Magister militum per Orientem&quot; Anatolius donated a silver coffin to hold the relics. In 1144, the city was conquered by the Zengids and the shrine destroyed.

In AD 522, Cosmas Indicopleustes (called the Alexandrian) visited the Malabar Coast. He is the first traveller who mentions Syrian Christians in Malabar, in his book &quot;Christian Topography.&quot; He mentions that in the town of &quot;Kalliana&quot; (Quilon or Kollam) there was a bishop who had been consecrated in Persia.

==== Chios and Ortona ====

The reputed relics of Saint Thomas remained at Edessa until they were moved to Chios in 1258. Some portion of the relics were later transferred again, and now rest in the Cathedral of Saint Thomas the Apostle in Ortona, Italy. However, the skull of Thomas is said to be at Monastery of Saint John the Theologian on the Greek island of Patmos.

Ortona&#x27;s three galleys reached the island of Chios in 1258, led by General Leone Acciaiuoli. Chios was considered the island where Thomas, after his death in India, had been buried. A portion fought around the Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, the other in the sea lapping at the then Syrian coast. The three galleys of Ortona moved on the second front of the war and reached the island of Chios.

The tale is provided by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer of the 16th century of Ortona. After the looting, the navarca Ortona Leone went to pray in the main church of the island of Chios and was drawn to a chapel adorned and resplendent with lights. An elderly priest, through an interpreter informed him that in that oratory was venerated the Body of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Leone, filled with an unusual sweetness, gathered in deep prayer. At that moment a light hand twice invited him to come closer. The navarca Leone reached out and took a bone from the largest hole of the tombstone, on which were carved the Greek letters and a halo depicted a bishop from the waist up. He was the confirmation of what he had said the old priest and that you are indeed in the presence of the Apostle&#x27;s body. He went back on the galley and planned the theft for the next night, along with fellow Ruggiero Grogno. They lifted the heavy gravestone and watched the underlying relics. The wrapped in snow-white cloths them laid in a wooden box (stored at Ortona to the looting of 1566) and brought them aboard the galley. Leone, then, along with other comrades, he returned again in the church, took the tombstone and took her away. Just the Chinardo admiral was aware of the precious cargo moved all the sailors of the Muslim faith on other ships and ordered him to take the route to Ortona.
He landed at the port of Ortona 6 September 1258. According to the story of De Lectis, he was informed the abbot Jacopo was responsible for Ortona Church, which predisposed full provision for hospitality felt and shared by all the people. Since then the body of the apostle and the gravestone are preserved in the crypt of the Basilica. In 1259 a parchment written in Bari by the court under John Peacock contracts, the presence of five witnesses, preserved in Ortona at the Diocesan Library, confirming the veracity of that event, reported, as mentioned, by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer Ortona of the 16th century.

The relics resisted both the Saracen looting of 1566, and the destruction of the Nazis in the battle of Ortona fought in late December 1943. The basilica was blown up because the belfry was considered a lookout point by the allies, coming by sea from San Vito Chietino. The relics, together with the treasure of Saint Thomas, were intended by the Germans to be sold, but the monks entombed them inside the bell tower, the only surviving part of the semi-ruined church.
The tombstone of Thomas, brought to Ortona from Chios along with the relics of the Apostle, are preserved in the crypt of St Thomas Basilica, behind the altar. The urn containing the bones is placed under the altar. It is the cover of a fake coffin, fairly widespread burial form in the early Christian world, as the top of a tomb of less expensive material. The plaque has an inscription and a bas-relief that refer, in many respects, to the Syro-Mesopotamian. Tombstone Thomas the Apostle on inclusion can be read, in Greek characters uncial, the expression &#x27;osios thomas, that Saint Thomas. It can be dated from the point of view palaeographic and lexical to the 3rd–5th century, a time when the term osios is still used as a synonym of aghios in that holy is he that is in the grace of God and is inserted in the church: the two vocabulary, therefore, indicate the Christians. In the particular case of Saint Thomas&#x27; plaque, the word osios can be the translation of the word Syriac &quot;mar&quot; (Lord), attributed in the ancient world, but also to the present day, is a saint to be a bishop.

====Iraq====
The finger bones of Saint Thomas were discovered during restoration work at the Church of Saint Thomas in Mosul, Iraq in 1964, and were housed there until the Fall of Mosul, after which the relics were transferred to the Monastery of Saint Matthew on 17 June 2014.

== Succession ==

As per the tradition of Saint Thomas Christians, St. Thomas the Apostle established his throne in India and ordained Mar Keppa, a Chera prince, as his successor.

== See of St. Thomas the Apostle==

As per the tradition of Saint Thomas Christians, Saint Thomas the Apostle established his throne in India and India was his (Kolla Hendo), therefore the see of the metropolitan of Saint Thomas Christians was India and used the title Metropolitan and Gate of all India. In Syriac Manuscript Vatican Syriac Codex 22 the title given for the Metropolitan of the Saint Thomas Christians was &quot;the superintendent and ruler of the holy see of St. Thomas the Apostle&quot;.

== Historical references ==

A number of early Christian writings written during the centuries immediately following the first Ecumenical Council of 325 mention Thomas&#x27; mission.

The &quot;Transitus Mariae&quot; describes each of the apostles purportedly being temporarily transported to heaven during the Assumption of Mary.

=== Acts of Thomas ===
The main source is the apocryphal Acts of Thomas, sometimes called by its full name &quot;The Acts of Judas Thomas&quot;, written circa 180–230 AD. These are generally regarded by various Christian religions as apocryphal, or even heretical. The two centuries that lapsed between the life of the apostle and the recording of this work cast doubt on their authenticity.

The king, Misdeus (or Mizdeos), was infuriated when Thomas converted the queen Tertia, the king&#x27;s son Juzanes, sister-in-law princess Mygdonia and her friend Markia. Misdeus led Thomas outside the city and ordered four soldiers to take him to the nearby hill, where the soldiers speared Thomas, killing him. After Thomas&#x27; death, Syphorus was elected the first presbyter of Mazdai by the surviving converts, while Juzanes was the first deacon. (The names Misdeus, Tertia, Juzanes, Syphorus, Markia and Mygdonia (c.f. Mygdonia, a province of Mesopotamia) may suggest Greek descent or cultural influences. Greek traders had long visited Muziris.

=== Doctrine of the Apostles ===

The Doctrine of the Apostles attests that Thomas had written Christian doctrine from India.

=== Origen ===
Christian philosopher Origen taught with great acclaim in Alexandria and then in Caesarea. Outside the account in the Acts of the Apostles , Origen is the earliest known writer to record the casting of lots by the Apostles. Origen&#x27;s original work has been lost, but his statement about Parthia falling to Thomas has been preserved by Eusebius. &quot;Origen, in the third chapter of his Commentary on Genesis, says that, according to tradition, Thomas&#x27;s allotted field of labour was Parthia&quot;.

=== Eusebius ===
Quoting Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea says: &quot;When the holy Apostles and disciples of our Saviour were scattered over all the world, Thomas, so the tradition has it, obtained as his portion Parthia…&quot; &quot;Judas, who is also called Thomas&quot; has a role in the legend of king Abgar of Edessa (Urfa), for having sent Thaddaeus to preach in Edessa after the Ascension. Ephrem the Syrian also recounts this legend.

=== Ephrem the Syrian ===
Many devotional hymns composed by Ephrem the Syrian bear witness to the Edessan Church&#x27;s strong conviction concerning Thomas&#x27;s Indian Apostolate. There the devil speaks of Thomas as &quot;the Apostle I slew in India&quot;. Also, &quot;The merchant brought the bones&quot; to Edessa.

=== Gregory of Nazianzus ===

Gregory of Nazianzus was born AD 330, consecrated a bishop by his friend Basil of Caesarea; in 372, his father, the Bishop of Nazianzus, induced him to share his charge. In 379, the people of Constantinople called him to be their bishop. By the Eastern Orthodox Church, he is emphatically called &quot;the Theologian&quot;. &quot;What? were not the Apostles strangers amidst the many nations and countries over which they spread themselves? … Peter indeed may have belonged to Judea, but what had Paul in common with the gentiles, Luke with Achaia, Andrew with Epirus, John with Ephesus, Thomas with India, Mark with Italy?&quot;

=== Ambrose of Milan ===
Ambrose of Milan was thoroughly acquainted with the Greek and Latin Classics and had a good deal of information on India and Indians. He speaks of the Gymnosophists of India, the Indian Ocean, the river Ganges etc., a number of times. &quot;This admitted of the Apostles being sent without delay according to the saying of our Lord Jesus… Even those Kingdoms which were shut out by rugged mountains became accessible to them, as India to Thomas, Persia to Matthew...&quot;

=== Gregory of Tours ===
The testimony of Gregory of Tours (died 594): &quot;Thomas the Apostle, according to the narrative of his martyrdom is stated to have suffered in India. His holy remains (corpus), after a long interval of time, were removed to the city of Edessa in Syria and there interred. In that part of India where they first rested, stand a monastery and a church of striking dimensions, elaborately adorned and designed. This Theodore, who had been to the place, narrated to us.&quot;

== Writings ==
In the first two centuries of the Christian era, a number of writings were circulated. It is unclear now why Thomas was seen as an authority for doctrine, although this belief is documented in Gnostic groups as early as the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;. In that Gnostic work, Mary Magdalene (one of the disciples) says:

An early, non-Gnostic tradition may lie behind this statement, which also emphasizes the primacy of the Gospel of Matthew in its Aramaic form, over the other canonical three.

Besides the &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot; there was a widely circulated &quot;Infancy Gospel of Thomas&quot; probably written in the later 2nd century, and probably also in Syria, which relates the miraculous events and prodigies of Jesus&#x27; boyhood. This is the document which tells for the first time the familiar legend of the twelve sparrows which Jesus, at the age of five, fashioned from clay on the Sabbath day, which took wing and flew away. The earliest manuscript of this work is a 6th-century one in Syriac. This gospel was first referred to by Irenaeus; Ron Cameron notes: &quot;In his citation, Irenaeus first quotes a non-canonical story that circulated about the childhood of Jesus and then goes directly on to quote a passage from the infancy narrative of the Gospel of Luke. Since the Infancy Gospel of Thomas records both of these stories, in relative close proximity to one another, it is possible that the apocryphal writing cited by Irenaeus is, in fact, what is now known as the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. Because of the complexities of the manuscript tradition, however, there is no certainty as to when the stories of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas began to be written down.&quot;

The best known in modern times of these documents is the &quot;sayings&quot; document that is being called the Gospel of Thomas, a noncanonical work whose date is disputed. The opening line claims it is the work of &quot;Didymos Judas Thomas&quot; – whose identity is unknown. This work was discovered in a Coptic translation in 1945 at the Egyptian village of Nag Hammadi, near the site of the monastery of Chenoboskion. Once the Coptic text was published, scholars recognized that an earlier Greek translation had been published from fragments of papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus in the 1890s. Because of its potentially very early date of composition, the Gospel of Thomas has played a substantial role in New Testament studies.

== Saint Thomas Cross ==
In the 16th-century work &quot;Jornada&quot;, Antonio Gouvea writes of ornate crosses known as &quot;Saint Thomas Crosses&quot;. It is also known as Nasrani Menorah, Persian Cross, or Mar Thoma Sleeva. These crosses are believed to date from the 6th century as per the tradition and are found in a number of churches in Kerala, Mylapore and Goa. &quot;Jornada&quot; is the oldest known written document to refer to this type of cross as a Saint Thomas Cross. Gouvea also writes about the veneration of the Cross at Cranganore, referring to the cross as &quot;Cross of Christians&quot;.

There are several interpretations of the Nasrani symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of a seven branched lamp stand (candelabra). The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolizing &quot;joyfulness&quot; points to the resurrection theology of Paul the Apostle; the Holy Spirit on the top represents the role of Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The lotus symbolizing Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha. The three steps indicate Calvary and the rivulets, channels of Grace flowing from the Cross.

==In Islam==
The Qur&#x27;anic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John, James, son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot.

==Major shrine==
===San Thome Church===
San Thome Church is said to be the tomb of Saint Thomas in Chennai, India. It was built in 1523 by Portuguese missionaries. It is a national shrine, basilica and cathedral. It is an important site for Christians and a major shrine of Saint Thomas.

He was named &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; Sexiest Man Alive in 1990, and received the top honor of &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; in 1997. Outside his film career, Cruise has been an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology. An aviation enthusiast, he has held a pilot&#x27;s license since 1994.

==Early life==
Cruise was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films.

Cruise grew up in near poverty and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as &quot;a merchant of chaos&quot;, a &quot;bully&quot;, and a &quot;coward&quot; who beat his children. He elaborated, &quot;[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he&#x27;d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, &#x27;There&#x27;s something wrong with this guy. Don&#x27;t trust him. Be careful around him. Cruise&#x27;s biological father died of cancer in 1984.

In total, Cruise attended fifteen schools in fourteen years. Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada; when his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces, his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under drama teacher George Steinburg. He and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called &quot;IT&quot; at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright was in the audience and later said that &quot;the movement and improvisation were excellent ... a classic ensemble piece.&quot;

In sixth grade, Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise briefly took a Catholic church scholarship and attended the St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati; he aspired to become a Franciscan priest before leaving after a year. Priests at the seminary have said Cruise chose to leave the school when his family relocated again; however, a former classmate said that they were both asked to leave after getting caught taking liquor. In his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game. He went on to star in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. In 1980, he graduated from Glen Ridge High School in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.

==Acting career==
=== 1980s: Breakthrough and stardom ===
At age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films. He made his film debut in a bit part in the 1981 film &quot;Endless Love&quot;, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in &quot;Taps&quot; later that year. Cruise was originally supposed to appear as a background actor but his role was expanded after impressing director Harold Becker. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. That same year he appeared in &quot;All the Right Moves&quot; and &quot;Risky Business&quot;, which has been described as &quot;A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise.&quot; He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film &quot;Legend&quot;, released in 1985. By 1986&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun&quot;, his status as a superstar had been cemented.
Cruise followed up &quot;Top Gun&quot; with Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Color of Money&quot; (1986), which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. Their chemistry won praise among critics with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writing, &quot;One of the subtle achievements of both Cruise&#x27;s and Newman&#x27;s performances is that you feel that both of them are genuinely top-notch pool hustlers&quot;. In 1988, Cruise starred in &quot;Cocktail&quot;, a film that was a box office success but failed with critics. His performance earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with Dustin Hoffman in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Rain Man&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Film.

In 1989, Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone&#x27;s war epic &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Nothing Cruise has done will prepare you for what he does in &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; ... His performance is so good that the movie lives through it. Stone is able to make his statement with Cruise&#x27;s face and voice and doesn&#x27;t need to put everything into the dialogue.&quot; The performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor, the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Cruise&#x27;s first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.

=== 1990s: Dramatic roles ===
Cruise&#x27;s next films were &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990) and &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife Nicole Kidman as his love interest, followed by the legal thriller &quot;The Firm&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, a gothic drama/horror film that was based on Anne Rice&#x27;s best-selling novel. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid () for a two-page ad in &quot;Daily Variety&quot; praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.

In 1996, Cruise starred as superspy Ethan Hunt in the reboot of &quot;&quot;, which he also produced. The film was directed by Brian De Palma and was a box office success. Film critic Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Cruise&#x27;s performance, declaring &quot;Tom Cruise has found the perfect superhero character on which to graft his breathlessly gung-ho screen personality.&quot; In the same year, Cruise took on the title role in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; playing a sports agent in search of love. The film was a massive financial success grossing more than worldwide against its budget.

In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s erotic and psychological drama film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised both Cruise and Kidman on their performances writing, &quot;Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor&quot;. That same year he took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; film critic Peter Travers heaped praise on Cruise writing, &quot;Cruise is a revelation, fully deserving of the shower of superlatives coming his way ... Cruise seethes with the chaotic energy of a wounded animal—he&#x27;s devastating.&quot; For his performance he received another Golden Globe and nomination for an Academy Award.

=== 2000s: Established career ===
In 2000, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the second installment of the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; films, &quot;&quot;. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director John Woo and branded with his gun fu style; it continued the series&#x27; success at the box office, taking in worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, but had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance for the film.

His next five films were major critical and commercial successes. The following year, Cruise starred in the romantic thriller &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) with Cameron Diaz and Penélope Cruz. In 2002, Cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film &quot;Minority Report&quot;, which was directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the short story by Philip K. Dick. It has since been included in lists of the greatest science fiction films of all time.

In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick&#x27;s period action drama &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in &quot;Collateral&quot;. The critical consensus states that &quot;Driven by director Michael Mann&#x27;s trademark visuals and a lean, villainous performance from Tom Cruise, &quot;Collateral&quot; is a stylish and compelling noir thriller.&quot; In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with worldwide. Also in 2005, he was a nominee for the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the winner of the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over at the box office.

In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; film series, &quot;&quot;. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed nearly at the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot;, which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as &quot;Les Grossman&quot; in the 2008 comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; with Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller &quot;Valkyrie&quot; released on December 25, 2008, to box office success.

=== 2010s: Action star ===
In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy &quot;Knight and Day&quot;, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in &quot;&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;&quot; series. The film was released in December 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise&#x27;s biggest commercial success to that date.

On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (2012), in which he played the fictional character Stacee Jaxx. The film was released in June 2012 and was a rare box-office misstep for Cruise. Cruise however received positive reviews for his performance with &quot;Variety&quot; film critic Justin Chang writing, &quot;Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos, heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow, Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his world&#x27;s-biggest-movie-star identity, displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers haven&#x27;t seen since his turn in &quot;Magnolia&quot;.&quot;

Cruise starred as Jack Reacher in the film adaptation of British author Lee Child&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;One Shot&quot;. The film was released on December 21, 2012. It met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing worldwide. In 2013, he starred in the science fiction film &quot;Oblivion&quot; based on director Joseph Kosinski&#x27;s graphic novel of the same name. The film met with mixed reviews and grossed worldwide. It also starred Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko. In 2014, Cruise starred in the science fiction-action film &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, which received positive reviews and grossed over .

In 2015, Cruise returned as Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, which he also produced. Returning cast members included Simon Pegg as Benji and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, with Christopher McQuarrie as director. The film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success. Cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of Boris Karloff&#x27;s 1932 horror movie &quot;The Mummy&quot;. The new film, also titled &quot;The Mummy&quot;, received negative reviews and disappointed at the box office, though still grossed over . In 2018, Cruise again reprised Ethan Hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, &quot;&quot;. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series and grossed over at the box office. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise&#x27;s biggest commercial success to date.

=== 2020s: Franchise films===
In May 2020, it was reported that Cruise would be starring in and producing a movie shot in outer space. Doug Liman would be directing, writing, and co-producing. Both will fly to the International Space Station as part of a future Axiom Space mission in a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft. In May 2021, Cruise protested against the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) by returning all three of his Golden Globe Awards in light of controversy surrounding the HFPA, particularly its lack of diversity, specifically no black members, and ethical questions related to financial benefits to some of its members.

In 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Captain Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell in &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, a film which he also produced. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where Cruise earned an Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was released to widespread critical praise, with many reviewers deeming it superior to its predecessor. The film broke several box office records upon its release; earning over , becoming the highest-grossing film of his career. Cruise earned for the film, when combining ticket sales, his salary, and his cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenues.

Cruise reprised his role as Ethan Hunt in &quot;&quot; which was released in theaters on July 12, 2023. The film received critical acclaim, but was a box office disappointment due to the box-office and cultural phenomenon dubbed Barbenheimer, which was the same-day release of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s historical epic film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and Greta Gerwig&#x27;s fantasy comedy &quot;Barbie&quot;. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; praised &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; for its performances, action sequences and a satisfying ending, writing, &quot;This outing may be one-half of a two-part finale, but it gives audiences enough closure to stand on its own&quot;. In 2024, he appeared in the Paris 2024 Olympics closing ceremony to promote Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics, by jumping from the roof of the Stade de France stadium in Paris. He took the flag from Mayor Karen Bass and athlete Simone Biles.

Cruise will reprise the role in the second part, &quot;&quot;, due for release in May 2025. He will also star in an untitled film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu which will be his first film at Warner Bros. Pictures in ten years.

==Production==
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent Paula Wagner to form Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise&#x27;s films, the first being &quot;&quot; in 1996 which was also Cruise&#x27;s first project as a producer. In addition, Cruise has produced films in which he does not appear in, namely &quot;The Others&quot;, &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;, &quot;Narc&quot;, &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, and &quot;Without Limits&quot;.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as &quot;one of the most powerful—and richest—forces in Hollywood.&quot; Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Jerry Bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise&#x27;s tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise&#x27;s exceptional commercial prowess.

===Break with Paramount===
On August 22, 2006, Paramount Pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, chairman of Viacom (Paramount&#x27;s parent company) Sumner Redstone cited the economic damage to Cruise&#x27;s value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount&#x27;s announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms. Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount&#x27;s discontent over Cruise/Wagner&#x27;s exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; franchise.

===Management of United Artists===
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists. Cruise acted as a producer and starred in films for United Artists, while Wagner served as UA&#x27;s chief executive. Production began in 2007 of &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, &quot;Lions for Lambs&quot;, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retained her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise&#x27;s share amounted to 30 percent of the studio.

===Return to Paramount===
Cruise began working with Paramount again as a producer and star with &quot;&quot;, without Wagner, which was a critical and commercial success. He and Wagner would collaborate for the final time on the modestly successful &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; series, also for Paramount.

===Move to Warner Bros. Discovery===
In January 2024, it was announced that his production company was forming a new strategic partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery to develop and produce original and franchise films.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked Cruise as Hollywood&#x27;s most powerful actor, as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine&#x27;s 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor. The same year, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked him as the world&#x27;s most powerful celebrity. The founder of CinemaScore in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the &quot;two stars, it doesn&#x27;t matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up.&quot; October 10, 2006, was declared &quot;Tom Cruise Day&quot; in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of &quot;his love for and close association with Japan.&quot;

While reviewing &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruise&#x27;s 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the &quot;Tom Cruise Picture&quot;. Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture: the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise&#x27;s later films like &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; can also be considered to be part of this formula. &quot;Widescreenings&quot; compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film &quot;A Few Good Men:&quot;

Cruise is an aerobatic pilot and was inducted as part of the Living Legends of Aviation in 2010, receiving the Aviation Inspiration and Patriotism Award from the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy. In addition to other aircraft, Cruise owns a P-51 Mustang.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and relationships===

Cruise splits his time between homes in Beverly Hills, California; Clearwater, Florida; and the South of England, where Cruise has lived in various places such as Central London, Dulwich, East Grinstead, and Biggin Hill. In the early-to-mid-1980s, Cruise had relationships with Melissa Gilbert, Rebecca De Mornay, Patti Scialfa, and Cher.
Cruise married actress Mimi Rogers on May 9, 1987. They divorced on February 4, 1990. Rogers had grown up in Scientology and was one of its &#x27;auditors&#x27;; they met when Cruise became one of her clients. In a 1993 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Rogers discussed her split from Cruise and said that he had been considering becoming a monk, which affected their intimacy. Rogers later retracted the comments and claimed she had been misinterpreted. Rogers received a divorce settlement.

Cruise met his second wife, actress Nicole Kidman, on the set of their film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). On February 5, 2001, the couple&#x27;s spokesperson announced their separation. Cruise filed for divorce two days later, and their marriage was dissolved later that year, with Cruise citing irreconcilable differences. In a 2007 interview with &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, Kidman noted the incorrect reporting of a miscarriage early in her marriage: &quot;It was wrongly reported as miscarriage by everyone who picked up the story. So it&#x27;s huge news, and it didn&#x27;t happen. I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage.&quot;

Cruise was next romantically linked with Penélope Cruz, his co-star in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001). Their three-year relationship ended in 2004. An article in the October 2012 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; stated that several sources have said that after the breakup with Cruz, Scientologist leaders launched a secret project to find Cruise a new girlfriend. According to those sources, a series of &quot;auditions&quot; of Scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with Iranian-British actress Nazanin Boniadi, who subsequently left Scientology. Scientology and Cruise&#x27;s lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; of &quot;shoddy journalism&quot; and &quot;religious bigotry&quot;. Journalist Roger Friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-Scientologist Paul Haggis confirming the story.

In April 2005, Cruise began dating actress Katie Holmes. On April 27 that year, Cruise and Holmes—dubbed &quot;TomKat&quot; by the media—made their first public appearance together in Rome. A month later, Cruise publicly declared his love for Holmes on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;; he jumped on Winfrey&#x27;s yellow couch and stood there to make the announcement. On October 6, 2005, Cruise and Holmes announced they were expecting a child. In April 2006, their daughter Suri was born.

On November 18, Holmes and Cruise were married at the 15th-century castle Castello Orsini-Odescalchi in Bracciano, in a Scientologist ceremony attended by many Hollywood stars. Their publicists said the couple had &quot;officialized&quot; their marriage in Los Angeles the day before the Italian ceremony. There has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the Church of Scientology. David Miscavige, the head of Scientology, served as Cruise&#x27;s best man. On June 29, 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. On July 9, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. New York law requires all divorce documents remain sealed, so the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available. Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple&#x27;s daughter Suri from Scientology and that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the organization.

===Litigation===
In 1998, Cruise successfully sued the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality. In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine &quot;Actustar&quot; that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise, and Slater was ordered to pay to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment, and in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after he admitted that his claims were false.

Cruise also sued &quot;Bold Magazine&quot; publisher Michael Davis for , because Davis had alleged that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual. In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.

In 2009, magazine editor Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise&#x27;s behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on Sapir&#x27;s claim. In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against &quot;In Touch&quot; and &quot;Life &amp; Style&quot; magazines for defamation after they claimed Cruise had &quot;abandoned&quot; his six-year-old daughter. During deposition, Cruise admitted that &quot;he didn&#x27;t see his daughter for 110 days&quot;. The suit was settled the following year.

===Scientology advocacy===
Cruise was converted to Scientology by his first wife, Mimi Rogers, in 1986 and became an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology in the 2000s. His involvement in the organization was leaked by the tabloid &quot;Star&quot; in 1990, and he publicly announced he followed Scientology in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters. Cruise has said that Scientology, and Study Technology in particular, helped him overcome his dyslexia. Cruise has been a close friend of Scientology leader David Miscavige since the 1980s.

Several years after Cruise started studying Scientology, the organization&#x27;s leaders promised to share some Scientology secrets with him, including information about the extraterrestrial ruler Xenu. According to Janet Reitman&#x27;s book &quot;Inside Scientology: The Story of America&#x27;s Most Secretive Religion&quot; (2011), Cruise &quot;freaked out&quot; and took a step back from the Church to work on the film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; In 1999, Marty Rathbun was sent by David Miscavige to convince Cruise to return to the Church and continue his studies. Cruise later sparked controversy in the 2000s with his efforts to promote Scientology.

In the aftermath of 9/11, Cruise co-founded and raised donations for Downtown Medical to offer New York City rescue workers &quot;detoxification therapy&quot;, drawing criticism from medical professionals and firefighters. In late 2004, David Miscavige created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise for this work. Former Scientologist Paul Haggis has claimed that Cruise attempted to convert several celebrities to Scientology, including James Packer, Victoria and David Beckham, Jada Pinkett, Will Smith, and Steven Spielberg. Since 2008, Cruise has restricted interviewers from asking him about Scientology.

==== Political lobbying ====
As well as promoting various programs to introduce people to Scientology, Cruise campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Council of Paris revealed that Cruise had lobbied French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy and Senate President Jean-Claude Gaudin; they described Cruise as a militant spokesman for Scientology and barred any further dealings with him.

=== Controversies ===

==== Criticism of psychiatry ====

In January 2004, Cruise said, &quot;I think psychiatry should be outlawed.&quot; In 2005, he criticized actress Brooke Shields for using the drug Paxil (paroxetine), an antidepressant which she used to recover from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. In response, Shields argued that Cruise &quot;should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them.&quot; This led to a heated argument between Cruise and Matt Lauer on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; on June 24, 2005.

Medical authorities view Cruise&#x27;s comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. From &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;He may be right that psychotropic drugs are overused, sometimes misused; and that lifestyle changes (and exercise for depression) can be helpful. But he is wrong, as a celebrity, to add to the burden of those with a mental illness, who often fear seeking or continuing treatment because of the stigma still attached to their condition.&quot; Shields called Cruise&#x27;s comments &quot;a disservice to mothers everywhere&quot;. In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.

Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and psychoactive drugs that are routinely prescribed for treatment. It was reported that Cruise&#x27;s anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise&#x27;s presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor&#x27;s office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.

==== YouTube video removal ====

On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube by the Anonymous-linked group Project Chanology, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him. The Church of Scientology said the video had been &quot;pirated and edited&quot;, and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology. YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 15 million views.

==== Purported influence ====
In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise&#x27;s next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, his sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005. DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan. Such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on Scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with Katie Holmes.
Lawrence Wright&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&quot; and Alex Gibney&#x27;s 2015 television documentary adaptation of the same name cast a spotlight on Cruise&#x27;s role in Scientology. The book and the film both allege that the Scientology organization groomed romantic partners for Cruise and that Cruise used Sea Org and Rehabilitation Project Force workers as a source of free labor. In the film, Cruise&#x27;s former auditor Marty Rathbun claims that wife Nicole Kidman was wiretapped on Cruise&#x27;s suggestion, which Cruise&#x27;s lawyer denies. Cruise&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi later compared the Scientology organization&#x27;s auditioning of women to date Cruise and experiences with him to &quot;white slavery&quot;.

<text>The Smashing Pumpkins (also simply known as Smashing Pumpkins) is an American alternative rock band formed in Chicago in 1988 by frontman and guitarist Billy Corgan, guitarist James Iha, bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. The band has undergone several line-up changes since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the primary songwriter and sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup consists of Corgan, Chamberlin, and Iha. The band is known for its diverse, densely layered sound, which evolved throughout their career and has integrated elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, grunge, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, dream pop, and electronica.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Gish&quot; (1991), was well-received by critics and became an underground success. In the advent of alternative rock&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough, their second album, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; (1993), established the band&#x27;s popularity. Despite a tumultuous recording process, the album received widespread acclaim and has been lauded as one of the best albums in the genre. Their third album, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; (1995), furthered the band&#x27;s popularity; it debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, received a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and continued the band&#x27;s critical success. After the release of &quot;Adore&quot; (1998) and a two-part project in 2000—&quot;Machina&quot; and &quot;Machina II&quot;—the group disbanded due to internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales by the end of the 1990s. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were among the most critically and commercially successful bands of the 1990s, and an important act in the popularization of alternative rock.

In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record the band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled &quot;Teargarden by Kaleidyscope&quot;, which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project&#x27;s scope—&quot;Oceania&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Monuments to an Elegy&quot; in 2014. Chamberlin became a touring member in 2015, before officially rejoining with Iha in 2018. The reunited lineup then released the albums &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.&quot; (2018) and &quot;Cyr&quot; (2020), in addition to &quot;&quot; across three increments between 2022 and 2023. Schroeder departed from the band in October 2023. Following Schroeder&#x27;s departure, the band&#x27;s remaining members released &quot;Aghori Mhori Mei&quot; (2024).

==History==
===Early years: 1988–1991===

After the breakup of his gothic rock and metal band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida and returned to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and had the idea to start a band called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working at the store he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs (with the aid of a drum machine) which were heavily influenced by the Cure and New Order. The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988, at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D&#x27;arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of a band. After finding out that Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan got her to join the band and the trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After the show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum
machine with a live drummer.

Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan&#x27;s. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, &quot;We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.&quot; On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.
In 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album &quot;Light Into Dark&quot;, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, &quot;I Am One&quot;, in 1990 on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, &quot;Tristessa&quot;, on Sub Pop; then they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album &quot;Gish&quot; with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, for . In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane&#x27;s Addiction. &quot;Gish&quot; became a minor success, with the single &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the &quot;Lull&quot; EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and Guns N&#x27; Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.

With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, &quot;We&#x27;ve graduated now from &#x27;the next Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27; to &#x27;the next Nirvana&#x27;, now we&#x27;re &#x27;the next Pearl Jam&#x27;.&quot;

Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia, in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band&#x27;s desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with &quot;Gish&quot;, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan&#x27;s depression, meanwhile, had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding .
Despite all the problems in its recording, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; became the band&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and selling over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Alongside the band&#x27;s mounting mainstream recognition, the band&#x27;s reputation as careerists among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened. Indie rock band Pavement&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Range Life&quot; directly mocks the band in its lyrics, although Stephen Malkmus, lead singer of Pavement, has stated, &quot;I never dissed their music. I just dissed their status.&quot; Former Hüsker Dü frontman Bob Mould called them &quot;the grunge Monkees&quot;, and fellow Chicago musician/producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band, derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon (&quot;by, of and for the mainstream&quot;) and concluding their ultimate insignificance. Fred Armisen said the band simply &quot;flew past us&quot; in the 90s Chicago music scene after his own band Trenchmouth had produced five albums. The opening track and lead single of &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, directly addresses Corgan&#x27;s feud with the &quot;indie-world&quot;. In spite of the backlash, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; is often regarded as one of the greatest albums of the alternative rock genre, and one of the best albums of the 1990s.

In 1994 Virgin released the B-sides/rarities compilation &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot; which charted higher than &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; by reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Also released was a VHS cassette titled &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; featuring a mix of live performances and behind-the-scenes footage.

For Christmas 1994 Corgan gave ten copies of an informally self-released five-CD box set, &quot;Mashed Potatoes&quot;, to close friends of the band. It contained early demos, interview snippets and live recordings dating from 1988 to 1993. Music journalist Ned Raggett called it &quot;the holy grail of Smashing Pumpkins collectibles for the hardcore fanatic&quot;. It became available online in the early 2000s.

===&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;: 1995–1997===
During 1995, Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as &quot;&quot;The Wall&quot; for Generation X&quot;, and which became &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;the group&#x27;s most ambitious and accomplished work yet&quot;, &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;. The album spawned five singles—&quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be with You Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;—of which the first three were certified gold and all but &quot;Zero&quot; entered the Top 40. Many of the songs that did not make it onto &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; were released as B-sides to the singles, and were later compiled in &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot; box set. The set was originally limited to 200,000 copies, but more were produced to meet demand.
In 1996 the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;. Corgan&#x27;s look during this period—a shaved head, a long-sleeve black shirt with the word &quot;Zero&quot; printed on it, and silver pants—became iconic. That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;. With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and &quot;Zero&quot; shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.

In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band&#x27;s repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O&#x27;Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night&#x27;s performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her. However, while Corgan maintained that moshing&#x27;s &quot;time [had] come and gone&quot;, the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.

The band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story that in the past he&#x27;d &quot;gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe.&quot; But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, &quot;For nine years we have battled with Jimmy&#x27;s struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. … We wish [him] the best we have to offer&quot;. Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record, and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, &quot;The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music.&quot;

===&quot;Adore&quot;, &quot;Machina&quot;, and breakup: 1998–2000===
After the release of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, the Pumpkins contributed many songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song &quot;Eye&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins&#x27; previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his &quot;idea [was] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format.&quot; Later that year, the group contributed &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot; to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future, the band&#x27;s next album would feature few guitar-driven songs.
Recorded following the death of Corgan&#x27;s mother and his divorce, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Adore&quot; represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins&#x27; previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band&#x27;s earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although &quot;Adore&quot; received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States by the end of the year. The album nonetheless debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold three times as many copies overseas. The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of &quot;Adore&quot;. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of ticket sales to a local charity organization. The tour&#x27;s expenses were entirely funded out of the band&#x27;s own pockets. All told, the band donated over to charity as a result of the tour. On October 31, 1998, during Halloween, the band opened for Kiss at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, dressed in costume as the Beatles.

In 1999 the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed &quot;The Arising&quot;, which showcased both new and classic material. The lineup was short-lived, however, as the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;, and the band was subsequently dropped by Sharon Osbourne Management. Former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited for the &quot;Sacred and Profane&quot; tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release. Released in 2000, &quot;Machina&quot; was initially promoted as the Pumpkins&#x27; return to a more traditional rock sound, after the more gothic, electronic-sounding &quot;Adore&quot;. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, but quickly disappeared and as of 2007 had only been certified gold. Music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who described the album as &quot;one of the strongest of their career&quot;, noted that the stalled sales for &quot;Machina&quot; in comparison to teen pop ascendant at the time &quot;seems like concrete proof that a new wave of young pop fans has turned a deaf ear toward alternative rock.&quot;
On May 23, 2000, in a live radio interview on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band&#x27;s decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording. The group&#x27;s final album before the break-up, &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot;, was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs. Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer &quot;Machina II&quot; as a free download to anyone who bought &quot;Machina&quot;. When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.

On December 2, 2000, Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro, the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier. The four-and-a-half-hour-long show featured 35 songs spanning the group&#x27;s career, and attendees were given a recording of the band&#x27;s first concert at The Metro, &quot;Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88&quot;. The single &quot;Untitled&quot; was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show.

===Post-breakup: 2001–2004===
In 2001 the compilation &quot;Rotten Apples&quot; was released. The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a collection of B-sides and rarities called &quot;Judas O&quot;. The &quot;Greatest Hits Video Collection&quot; DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from &quot;Gish&quot; to &quot;Machina&quot; along with unreleased material. &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album &quot;Earphoria&quot;, previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.

Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan&#x27;s next project, the short-lived supergroup Zwan. The group&#x27;s only album, &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot;, was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001 Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album &quot;Get Ready&quot;. In October 2004 Corgan released his first book, &quot;Blinking with Fists&quot;, a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;, which he described as &quot;(picking) up the thread of the as-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins&quot;. Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, &quot;Walking Shade&quot;, was released in support of the album.

In addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/jazz fusion project band called Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. The group released an album in 2005 titled &quot;Life Begins Again&quot;. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track &quot;Lokicat&quot;. James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle, appearing on their &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; club tour and 2004 album, &quot;eMOTIVe&quot;. He has also been involved with other acts such as Chino Moreno&#x27;s Team Sleep and Vanessa and the O&#x27;s. He continues to work with Scratchie Records, his own record label, as well. D&#x27;arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of cocaine, but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.

Corgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, &quot;I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me.&quot; Corgan said in 2005, &quot;I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan.&quot; On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a &quot;mean-spirited drug addict&quot; and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that &quot;the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude&quot;. Iha responded to Corgan&#x27;s claims in 2005, saying, &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy.&quot;

===Reformation and &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;: 2005–2008===

On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his first solo album &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; to announce that he planned to reunite the band. &quot;For a year now&quot;, Corgan wrote, &quot;I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams&quot;. Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.

In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be a part of&quot; the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, &quot;Tarantula&quot; was released as the first single from the band&#x27;s forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.

The band&#x27;s new album, &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins&#x27; fanbase. Corgan would later admit, &quot;I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don&#x27;t just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that&quot;.

Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP &quot;American Gothic&quot; in January 2008 and the singles &quot;Superchrist&quot; and &quot;G.L.O.W.&quot; later that year. That November, the group released the DVD &quot;If All Goes Wrong&quot;, which chronicled the group&#x27;s 2007 concert residences in Asheville, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, &quot;The listening patterns have changed, so why are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track to set up the single? It&#x27;s done.&quot;

===&quot;Teargarden&quot; and &quot;Oceania&quot;: 2009–2013===
In March 2009 Corgan announced on the band&#x27;s website that Chamberlin had left the group and would be replaced. Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band was &quot;a positive move forward for me. I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don&#x27;t fully possess.&quot; Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, &quot;I am glad [Corgan] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right.&quot; Chamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which has released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear. In July 2009 Billy Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of the Seeds, who had recently died. The following month Corgan confirmed on the band&#x27;s website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair was working on new Pumpkins recordings.

The group announced plans to release a 44-track concept album, &quot;Teargarden by Kaleidyscope&quot;, for free over the Internet one track at a time. The first track, &quot;A Song for a Son&quot;, was released in December 2009 to moderate press acclaim. In March 2010 Ginger Reyes officially left the band, prompting an open call for auditions for a new bassist. In May, Nicole Fiorentino announced she had joined the band as bass player, and would be working on &quot;Teargarden by Kaleidyscope&quot;. The new lineup went on a world tour through to the end of 2010. One of the first shows with the new lineup was a concert to benefit Matthew Leone, bassist for the rock band Madina Lake, at the Metro on July 27, 2010. In late 2010 all four members contributed to the sessions for the third volume of &quot;Teargarden&quot;.

On April 26, 2011, Corgan announced that the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing a new album titled &quot;Oceania&quot;, which he labeled as &quot;an album within an album&quot; in regards to the &quot;Teargarden by Kaleidyscope&quot; project, in the fall. As with the previous recording sessions, all four band members contributed to the project. Also, the entire album catalog was to be remastered and reissued with bonus tracks, starting with &quot;Gish&quot; and &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; in November 2011. The pre-&quot;Gish&quot; demos, &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;, and &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; were released in 2012, with &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot; released the following year. &quot;Adore&quot; was released in 2014. &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; and the yet commercially unreleased &quot;Machina II/Friends and Enemies of Modern Music&quot; were expected to be combined, remixed, and released in the same year but were not released due to label hang-ups. The band did a thirteen-city US tour in October 2011 followed by a European tour in November and December.

&quot;Oceania&quot; was released on June 19, 2012, and received generally positive reviews. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the Billboard Independent. The album spawned two singles, &quot;The Celestials&quot; and &quot;Panopticon&quot;. The band proceeded to tour in support of the album, including a US tour involving playing the album in its entirety. By September 2012, Corgan stated that the band had already begun work on their next album. However, despite this, the band concentrated on touring, playing at Glastonbury Festival, Dour Festival and the Barclays Center, where they recorded &quot;&quot;, which was released on September 24, 2013.

===&quot;Monuments to an Elegy&quot;: 2014–2016===
On March 25, 2014, Corgan announced he had signed a new record deal with BMG, for two new albums, titled &quot;Monuments to an Elegy&quot; and &quot;Day for Night&quot;, respectively. In June, it was revealed that Mike Byrne was no longer in the band, to be replaced by Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe on the new album, and Fiorentino would not be recording on the album either. &quot;Monuments to an Elegy&quot; was released on December 5, 2014, to generally positive reviews. The band toured in support of the album starting on November 26, with Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s Brad Wilk filling in on drums and the Killers&#x27; Mark Stoermer filling in on bass. The follow-up proposed album &quot;Day For Night&quot; was cited for delayed late 2015 or early 2016 release.

Later in 2015 Corgan announced that the band would embark on a co-headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson, &quot;The End Times Tour&quot;, across July and August 2015. Prior to the co-headlining dates, the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum machines and tapes for percussion. When the time came for the co-headlining tour, plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows. On February 25, 2016, Corgan posted a video from a Los Angeles studio on the band&#x27;s Facebook account, giving an update on the writing process for the new songs for the upcoming album to be released after the &quot;In Plainsong&quot; tour.
The tour began in Portland, Oregon, on March 22, 2016.

===Iha and Chamberlin&#x27;s return; &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright&quot; and &quot;Cyr&quot;: 2018–2021===
On his birthday on March 26, 2016, original guitarist James Iha joined Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder on stage unannounced at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. He performed a few songs, including &quot;Mayonaise&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; marking his first appearance with the Smashing Pumpkins in 16 years. Iha also played at the second of the two Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel the following day, which was Easter Sunday. Iha joined the Pumpkins for a third time at their concert of April 14 at the Civic Opera House in Chicago. In July, Corgan began hinting of the possibility of reuniting the band original lineup, of himself, Iha, Wretzky, and Chamberlin, and in August, he stated he had begun reaching out to the original lineup about the feasibility of a reunion, including speaking to Wretzky for the first time in sixteen years. Despite the comments, Corgan would spend much of 2017 working on solo material – recording and releasing the solo album &quot;Ogilala&quot; and beginning work on another solo album for 2018. In June 2017 Chamberlin also mentioned the possibility of a reunion tour in 2018. In January 2018 Corgan shared a photo of himself, Iha, and Chamberlin together in recording studio. In February 2018 Corgan announced that he was working with music producer Rick Rubin on a future Smashing Pumpkins album, that there were currently 26 songs he was actively working on, and that &quot;the guitar feels once again like the preferred weapon of choice.&quot; Soon afterwards, Corgan shared a photo of sound equipment with Iha&#x27;s name on a label, as well as announcing recording was finished on the album.

On February 15, 2018, founding members Iha and Chamberlin rejoined the band. They embarked on the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour starting in July, with a focus on performing material from their first five studio albums. and sold over 350,000 tickets and sold-out arenas including The Forum, United Center, and Madison Square Garden. Original bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky claimed she had been offered a contract to rejoin the band but Corgan rescinded the offer soon after. Corgan released a statement denying the claims, stating &quot;Ms. Wretzky has repeatedly been invited out to play with the group, participate in demo sessions, or at the very least, meet face-to-face, and in each and every instance she always deferred&quot;. Jack Bates (son of Joy Division bassist Peter Hook) played bass on the tour. Bates previously toured with the Smashing Pumpkins in 2015. Multi-instrumentalist Katie Cole rejoined the band for the tour as well, singing backup vocals and playing keyboards and guitar.

In March 2018, Corgan mentioned the band planned to release two EPs in 2018, with the first tentatively planned for May. On June 8, 2018, the first single from the set of music, &quot;Solara&quot;, was released. On August 2, 2018, the band celebrated their 30th anniversary by performing in Holmdel, New Jersey. with several notable special guests including Courtney Love, Chino Moreno, Davey Havok, Peter Hook, Mark McGrath, and Dave Keuning and Mark Stoermer of the Killers. In September 2018, they announced the album &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.&quot;, released via Napalm Records on November 16, 2018, which debuted at number 54 on the Billboard 200 chart.
After touring through much of 2019, Corgan noted in January 2020 that the band was currently working on 21 songs for a future album release. On August 28, 2020, the band released the single and video for &quot;Cyr&quot;, along with a second track titled &quot;The Colour of Love&quot; from their album &quot;Cyr&quot;, which was released through their new record label Sumerian Records on November 27, 2020. It serves as the second part of the &quot;Shiny and Oh So Bright&quot; series. On September 25, 2020, the band released another single from &quot;Cyr&quot; that included the songs &quot;Confessions of a Dopamine Addict&quot; and &quot;Wrath&quot;. On October 9, 2020, the band released a third single for &quot;Cyr&quot; that featured the tracks &quot;Anno Satana&quot; and &quot;Birch Grove&quot;. On October 29, the band released &quot;Ramona&quot; and &quot;Wyttch&quot; as the fourth pair of singles. On November 20, 2020, the songs &quot;Purple Blood&quot; and &quot;Dulcet in E&quot; were released as the fifth and final single for &quot;Cyr.&quot; The following week, on November 27, 2020, the band released &quot;Cyr.&quot;

===&quot;Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts&quot; and &quot;Aghori Mhori Mei&quot;: 2022–present===
In late 2020, Corgan announced that the band had begun work on a double album to serve as a sequel to the overarching story of &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; and &quot;Machina: The Machines of God.&quot; The album was planned for release in 2021, however it wasn&#x27;t until September 19, 2022, that the album&#x27;s title, &quot;&quot;, was revealed. Each act was released on its own, with the dates in order being November 15, 2022, January 31, 2023, and May 5, 2023. All of the acts, along with ten extra songs, were compiled into a vinyl box set that was released the same day as the third grouping of songs. On February 22, 2022, the band announced on social media the Rock Invasion 2 Tour, which had previously been set to take place in spring 2020, postponed to fall 2020, and subsequently canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The newly announced incarnation of the tour had entirely new locations spanning eleven US cities accompanying the band&#x27;s spring festival appearances, and four performances in Mexico, their first since 2013. In May 2022, the band announced plans for the Spirits on Fire tour with Jane&#x27;s Addiction. In November 2022, The World is A Vampire Festival was announced for March 2023. The festival&#x27;s lineup included Interpol, Turnstile, Peter Hook &amp; The Light, Deafheaven, the Warning, and several others. In February 2023, the band announced that they would be bringing The World Is A Vampire Festival to Australia as a 10-date tour during the month of April. The lineup featured Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Amyl &amp; The Sniffers, Redhook, and Battlesnake, in addition to the wrestling matches similar to the singular date in Mexico. In between the band&#x27;s time in Mexico and Australia, they announced on March 28, 2023, that they would bring The World Is A Vampire to the United States and Canada as a summer tour across amphitheaters, indoor theaters, and one arena. The tour featured support from Stone Temple Pilots, Interpol, and Rival Sons, as well as select appearances by Corgan&#x27;s National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) wrestlers along with tapings for &quot;NWA Powerrr&quot;.
On October 19, 2023, Green Day played a small club show and handed out physical flyers that revealed in 2024 they would be touring the United States and Canada in stadiums with the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and the Linda Lindas. This tour was officially announced by all four bands on November 2, 2023, as The Saviors Tour. On October 24, 2023, it was announced in a statement posted on the band&#x27;s social media that longtime guitarist Jeff Schroeder had decided to leave the band &quot;to explore a slightly different path&quot;.

Following Schroeder&#x27;s departure, on January 5, 2024, Smashing Pumpkins announced via their social media channels that they were accepting applications via email for an additional guitarist. By January 17, the band had received over 10,000 submissions and employed eight people full-time to review each one. On April 26, the band announced that they had chosen Kiki Wong as their new touring guitarist, with Billy Corgan noting that he was a fan of hers &quot;before she submitted her name to be considered.&quot;

In June 2024, Corgan stated that the band had been spending the last 2 years working on a guitar-driven new studio album, partially in response to the negative reception of the emphasis of synthesizers on the &quot;Atum&quot; releases. The following month, the band announced their thirteenth album, &quot;Aghori Mhori Mei&quot;, would be released on August 2. The album would only be released digitally at first, before physical editions follow later.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==

According to drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, when Smashing Pumpkins first formed, each member had their own set of influences, few of which were shared by the whole band:At the beginning, [there were few common influences]. I came from a jazz background, my influences were Tony Williams, Jeff Beck, Return to Forever, Weather Report. Billy was very much into Joy Division, New Order, Bauhaus, but also was a closet Mahavishnu fan, and really liked that Yngwie Malmsteen stuff, progressive rock. James Iha was really into Johnny Marr, and D’arcy had her own trip as well.Since those early days, the direction of the Smashing Pumpkins has been dominated by lead guitarist, lead vocalist, keyboardist, bassist and primary songwriter Billy Corgan, who has been the band&#x27;s sole constant member since its inception. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, &quot;The music [of the Smashing Pumpkins] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers.&quot; Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group&#x27;s reunion, &quot;Everyone knows Billy doesn&#x27;t need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy [Chamberlin]—who he has on board.&quot; In a 2015 interview, Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band as &quot;sort of an open source collective&quot;, noting that &quot;[i]t&#x27;s whoever feels right at the time.&quot; Many of Corgan&#x27;s lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan&#x27;s angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; article that Corgan&#x27;s lyrics &quot;too often sound like sophomoric poetry&quot;, although he viewed the lyrics of later albums &quot;Adore&quot; and &quot;Machina&quot; as an improvement. The band&#x27;s songs have been described as &quot;anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan&#x27;s nightmare-land&quot; by journalist William Shaw.

The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; music has explored alternative rock, grunge, psychedelic rock, heavy metal, shoegaze, synth-pop, art rock, electronic rock, gothic rock, dream pop, psychedelia, college rock, punk rock, and progressive rock.

The band&#x27;s distinctive sound up until &quot;Adore&quot; involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; co-producer Flood called the &quot;Pumpkin guitar overdub army.&quot; Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on &quot;Gish&quot;, Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;; Corgan has stated that &quot;Soma&quot; alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts. While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question &quot;When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?&quot; This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan&#x27;s love of 1970s popular artists and bands such as David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.

Like many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü&#x27;s seminal album &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, &quot;Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.&quot; This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to &quot;Adore&quot; (described as &quot;arcane night music&quot; in prerelease promotion) and the &quot;Machina&quot; albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).
The Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that &quot;Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal&quot; and that they &quot;were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt&quot;, Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot; and Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot;. The song &quot;Zero&quot;, which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed &quot;cybermetal&quot;. Other bands Corgan cited as influences are Rainbow, Accept, Mercyful Fate, Dokken, Metallica, Slayer and Myrkur.

Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, the Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band&#x27;s early recordings; according to Corgan, &quot;In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that&#x27;s exactly what we had to do.&quot; Corgan felt that the band&#x27;s guitars &quot;are a mixture of heavy metal and 80s alternative rock. I think of Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;. Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as &quot;the Pumpkin chord&quot; (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played under it), used as the basis for &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Drown&quot;, and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, the Stooges, and Blue Cheer.

Regarding the band&#x27;s influence upon other groups, Greg Kot wrote in 2001, &quot;Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves.&quot; Still, some artists and bands have been influenced by the Pumpkins, such as Nelly Furtado, Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Evanescence, Third Eye Blind, Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, Tegan and Sara, Fall Out Boy, Rivers Cuomo, M83, Panic! at the Disco, Silversun Pickups, Vision Eternel, My Chemical Romance, and Code Orange. My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way has said that they pattern their career upon the Pumpkins&#x27;, including music videos. The members of fellow Chicago band Kill Hannah are friends with Corgan, and lead singer Mat Devine has compared his group to the Pumpkins.

The group has sold over 30 million albums worldwide as of October 2012, and sales in the United States alone reaching 19.75 million. &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; and &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; have both appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Music videos==

The Smashing Pumpkins have been praised as &quot;responsible for some of the most striking and memorable video clips&quot; and for having &quot;approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums&quot;. MTV&#x27;s 2001 anniversary special &quot;Testimony: 20 Years of Rock on MTV&quot; credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, &quot;We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff.&quot; The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake (&quot;Cherub Rock&quot;), Samuel Bayer (&quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (&quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot;, and &quot;Perfect&quot;). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, &quot;I know my [initial] versions are always darker, and they&#x27;re always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler.&quot; Videos like &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Rocket&quot;, and &quot;1979&quot; dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group&#x27;s videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;, with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.

The band was nominated for several MTV Video Music Awards during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won eight VMAs total for the &quot;1979&quot; and &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;. The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony. Of the &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; video, Corgan remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever had people react [like this]... it just seemed to touch a nerve.&quot;

Shortly after the band&#x27;s 2000 breakup, the &quot;Greatest Hits Video Collection&quot; was released, collecting the band&#x27;s music videos from 1991 to 2000 and including commentary from Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, Wretzky, and various music video directors with outtakes, live performances, and the extended &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; short film.

<text>Thomas Robert Malthus (; 13/14 February 1766 – 29 December 1834) was an English economist, cleric, and scholar influential in the fields of political economy and demography.

In his 1798 book &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;, Malthus observed that an increase in a nation&#x27;s food production improved the well-being of the population, but the improvement was temporary because it led to population growth, which in turn restored the original per capita production level. In other words, humans had a propensity to use abundance for population growth rather than for maintaining a high standard of living, a view and stance that has become known as the &quot;Malthusian trap&quot; or the &quot;Malthusian spectre&quot;. Populations had a tendency to grow until the lower class suffered hardship, want, and greater susceptibility to war, famine, and disease, a pessimistic view that is sometimes referred to as a Malthusian catastrophe. Malthus wrote in opposition to the popular view in 18th-century Europe that saw society as improving and in principle as perfectible.

Malthus considered population growth as inevitable whenever conditions improved, thereby precluding real progress towards a utopian society: &quot;The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.&quot; As an Anglican cleric, he saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behavior.Malthus wrote that &quot;the increase of population is necessarily limited by subsistence&quot;, &quot;population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase&quot;, and &quot;the superior power of population repress by moral restraint, vice, and misery.&quot;

Malthus criticised the Poor Laws for leading to inflation rather than improving the well-being of the poor. He supported taxes on grain imports (the Corn Laws). His views became influential and controversial across economic, political, social and scientific thought. Pioneers of evolutionary biology read him, notably Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Malthus&#x27;s failure to predict the Industrial Revolution was a frequent criticism of his theories.

Malthus laid the &quot;...theoretical foundation of the conventional wisdom that has dominated the debate, both scientifically and ideologically, on global hunger and famines for almost two centuries.&quot; He remains a much-debated writer.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas Robert Malthus was the sixth of seven children of Daniel Malthus and Henrietta Catherine, daughter of Daniel Graham, apothecary to kings George II and George III, and granddaughter of Thomas Graham, apothecary to kings George I and George II. Henrietta was depicted alongside her siblings in William Hogarth&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Graham Children&quot; (1742). Malthus was born at The Rookery, a &quot;small elegant mansion&quot; at Westcott, near Dorking in Surrey, which his father had bought—at that time called Chertgate Farm—and converted into &quot;a gentleman&#x27;s seat&quot;; the family sold it in 1768 and moved to &quot;a less extensive establishment at Albury, not far from Guildford&quot;. Malthus had a cleft lip and palate which affected his speech; such birth defects had occurred in previous generations of his family. His friend, the social theorist Harriet Martineau, who was hard of hearing, nevertheless stated that due to his sonorous voice he was the only person she could hear well without her ear trumpet. William Petersen and John Maynard Keynes describe Daniel Malthus as &quot;a gentleman of good family and independent means [...] [and] a friend of David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau&quot;. Daniel Malthus was son of Sydenham Malthus, who was a clerk of Chancery and director of the South Sea Company; he was also &quot;proprietor of several landed properties in the Home Counties and Cambridgeshire&quot;. Sydenham Malthus&#x27;s father, Daniel, had been apothecary to King William and later to Queen Anne; Daniel&#x27;s father, Rev. Robert Malthus, was appointed vicar of Northolt, Middlesex (now West London) under the regicide Cromwell, but &quot;evicted at the Restoration&quot;; he was described as &quot;an ancient divine, a man of strong reason, and mighty in the Scriptures, of great eloquence and fervour, though defective in elocution&quot;, due to &quot;a very great impediment in his utterance&quot; which has been concluded to be likely to have been a cleft palate. The young Malthus received his education at the Warrington Academy from 1782, where he was taught by Gilbert Wakefield. Warrington was a dissenting academy, which closed in 1783. Malthus continued for a period to be tutored by Wakefield at the latter&#x27;s home in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire.

Malthus entered Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1784. While there, he took prizes in English declamation, Latin and Greek, and graduated with honours, Ninth Wrangler in mathematics. His tutor was William Frend. He took the MA degree in 1791, and was elected a Fellow of Jesus College two years later. In 1789, he took orders in the Church of England, and became a curate at Oakwood Chapel (also Okewood) in the parish of Wotton, Surrey.

== Population growth ==

Malthus came to prominence for his 1798 publication, &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father&#x27;s associates (notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. He also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of William Godwin (1756–1836) and of the Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794). His assertions evoked questions and criticism, and between 1798 and 1826 he published six more versions of &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;, updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject.

The Malthusian controversy to which the &quot;Essay&quot; gave rise in the decades following its publication tended to focus attention on the birth rate and marriage rates. The neo-Malthusian controversy, comprising related debates of many years later, has seen a similar central role assigned to the numbers of children born.
The goal of Malthusian theory is to explain how population and food production expand, with the latter experiencing arithmetic growth and the former experiencing exponential growth. The controversy, however, concerns the relevance of Malthusian theory in the present world. This hypothesis is inapplicable in a number of ways. First, the hypothesis is rendered irrelevant, due to a disregard for technological advancement. This is because food production has increased as a result of technological advancements such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Second, the mathematical model employed to formulate the hypothesis is incorrect since it was constrained to England&#x27;s specific situation. Other findings, such as food production exceeding population increase, may be borne out if the modeling could employ wide locations like Australia. The Malthusian hypothesis is also limited by social change about family size, as individuals tend to prefer a manageable family owing to economic restrictions. 
Food production can also outpace population expansion, due to the industrial revolution. Another limitation of this theory is the belief that overall income is a key factor of population health, implying that wealthy countries will have various solutions for their rapidly rising populations. An expanding population can be considered as an increase of available human capacity for increasing food production. The static aspect of the Malthusian hypothesis, which is based on the rule of decreasing returns, limits its applicability. Finally, Malthusian Theory&#x27;s failure to determine whether birth rates match death rates hampered its application, because it was possible that the population was not rising as fast as food production due to the presence of deaths.

== Travel and further career ==
In 1799, Malthus made a European tour with William Otter, a close college friend, travelling part of the way with Edward Daniel Clarke and John Marten Cripps, visiting Germany, Scandinavia and Russia. Malthus used the tour to gather population data. Otter later wrote a &quot;Memoir&quot; of Malthus for the second (1836) edition of his &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;. During the Peace of Amiens of 1802 he travelled to France and Switzerland, in a party that included his relation and future wife Harriet.

In 1803, he became rector of Walesby, Lincolnshire.

In 1805, Malthus became Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company College in Hertfordshire. His students affectionately referred to him as &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Population&quot;, or &quot;web-toe&quot; Malthus.

Near the end of 1817, the proposed appointment of Graves Champney Haughton to the college was made a pretext by Randle Jackson and Joseph Hume to launch an attempt to close it down. Malthus wrote a pamphlet defending the college, which was reprieved by the East India Company within the same year, 1817.

In 1818, Malthus became a Fellow of the Royal Society.

== Malthus–Ricardo debate on political economy ==
During the 1820s, a setpiece intellectual discussion took place among the exponents of political economy, often called the Malthus–Ricardo debate after its leading figures, Malthus and theorist of free trade David Ricardo, both of whom had written books with the title &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;. Under examination were the nature and methods of political economy itself, while it was simultaneously under attack from others. The roots of the debate were in the previous decade. In &quot;The Nature of Rent&quot; (1815), Malthus had dealt with economic rent, a major concept in classical economics. Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his &quot;Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot; (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production—something caused by ownership rather than by free trade. Rent therefore represented a kind of negative money that landlords could pull out of the production of the land, by means of its scarcity. Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent to be a kind of economic surplus.

The debate developed over the economic concept of a general glut, and the possibility of failure of Say&#x27;s law. Malthus laid importance on economic development and the persistence of disequilibrium. The context was the post-war depression; Malthus had a supporter in William Blake, in denying that capital accumulation (saving) was always good in such circumstances, and John Stuart Mill attacked Blake on the fringes of the debate.

Ricardo corresponded with Malthus from 1817 about his &quot;Principles&quot;. He was drawn into considering political economy in a less restricted sense, which might be adapted to legislation and its multiple objectives, by the thought of Malthus. In &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; (1820) and elsewhere, Malthus addressed the tension, amounting to conflict he saw between a narrow view of political economy and the broader moral and political plane. Leslie Stephen wrote:

If Malthus and Ricardo differed, it was a difference of men who accepted the same first principles. They both professed to interpret Adam Smith as the true prophet, and represented different shades of opinion rather than diverging sects.

It is now considered that the different purposes seen by Malthus and Ricardo for political economy affected their technical discussion, and contributed to the lack of compatible definitions. For example, Jean-Baptiste Say used a definition of production based on goods and services and so queried the restriction of Malthus to &quot;goods&quot; alone.

In terms of public policy, Malthus was a supporter of the protectionist Corn Laws from the end of the Napoleonic Wars. He emerged as the only economist of note to support duties on imported grain. By encouraging domestic production, Malthus argued, the Corn Laws would guarantee British self-sufficiency in food.

== Later life ==
Malthus was a founding member in 1821 of the Political Economy Club, where John Cazenove tended to be his ally against Ricardo and Mill. He was elected in the beginning of 1824 as one of the ten royal associates of the Royal Society of Literature. He was also one of the first fellows of the Statistical Society, founded in March 1834. In 1827 he gave evidence to a committee of the House of Commons on emigration.

In 1827, he published &quot;Definitions in Political Economy&quot; The first chapter put forth &quot;Rules for the Definition and Application of Terms in Political Economy&quot;. In chapter 10, the penultimate chapter, he presented 60 numbered paragraphs putting forth terms and their definitions that he proposed should be used in discussing political economy following those rules. This collection of terms and definitions is remarkable for two reasons: first, Malthus was the first economist to explicitly organize, define, and publish his terms as a coherent glossary of defined terms; and second, his definitions were for the most part well-formed definitional statements. Between these chapters, he criticised several contemporary economists—Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, James Mill, John Ramsay McCulloch, and Samuel Bailey—for sloppiness in choosing, attaching meaning to, and using their technical terms.

McCulloch was the editor of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; of Edinburgh and replied cuttingly in a review printed on the front page of his newspaper in March 1827. He implied that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly , and his review of &quot;Definitions&quot; is largely a bitter defence of his own &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, and his counter-attack &quot;does little credit to his reputation&quot;, being largely &quot;personal derogation&quot; of Malthus. The purpose of Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Definitions&quot; was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus&#x27;s work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that there was nothing to be gained &quot;by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to&quot; words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch&#x27;s review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus&#x27;s critiques of other writers.

In spite of this and in the wake of McCulloch&#x27;s scathing review, the reputation of Malthus as economist dropped away for the rest of his life. On the other hand, Malthus did have supporters, including Thomas Chalmers, some of the Oriel Noetics, Richard Jones and William Whewell from Cambridge.

Malthus died suddenly of heart disease on 23 December 1834 at his father-in-law&#x27;s house. He was buried in Bath Abbey. His portrait, and descriptions by contemporaries, present him as tall and good-looking, but with a cleft lip and palate.

== Family ==
On 13 March 1804, Thomas Malthus married Harriet Eckersall, the eldest daughter of his first cousins John and Catherine Eckersall, who lived near Bath. Harriet became well-known at Haileybury College for hosting gatherings of notable scientists; eleven years younger than Thomas, she survived him by thirty years, remarrying after his death.

The couple had a son, Henry, and two daughters, Emily and Lucille. Henry, the eldest, became vicar of Effingham, Surrey in 1835 and of Donnington, Sussex in 1837; he married Sofia Otter (1807–1889), daughter of Bishop William Otter and died in August 1882, aged 76. Emily, the middle child, died in 1885, outliving her parents and siblings. Lucille, the youngest, died unmarried and childless in 1825, at age 17.

== &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; ==

Malthus argued in his &quot;Essay&quot; (1798) that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress:
Malthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits: &quot;positive&quot; checks, which raise the death rate; and &quot;preventive&quot; ones, which lower the birth rate. The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks: birth control, postponement of marriage and celibacy.

The rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus&#x27;s predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex pre-industrial societies. These findings are the basis for neo-Malthusian modern mathematical models of &quot;long-term historical dynamics&quot;.

Malthus wrote that in a period of resource abundance, a population could double in 25 years. However, the margin of abundance could not be sustained as population grew, leading to checks on population growth:
In later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (&quot;e.g.&quot;, hunger, disease, and war) would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, &quot;preventive checks&quot; to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability. Regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits, Malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions, such as the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit.

Of the relationship between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the cost of living (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the cost of food) to go up. Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages.

In the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on &quot;moral restraint&quot; as the best means of easing the poverty of the lower classes.&quot;

== Other works ==

=== 1800: &quot;The present high price of provisions&quot; ===
In this work, his first published pamphlet, Malthus argues against the notion prevailing in his locale that the greed of intermediaries caused the high price of provisions. Instead, Malthus says that the high price stems from the Poor Laws, which &quot;increase the parish allowances in proportion to the price of corn.&quot; Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force up the price of daily necessities. However, he concludes by saying that in time of scarcity such Poor Laws, by raising the price of corn more evenly, actually produce a &quot;beneficial&quot; effect.

=== 1814: &quot;Observations on the effects of the Corn Laws&quot; ===
Although government in Britain had regulated the prices of grain, the Corn Laws originated in 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars that year, Parliament passed legislation banning the importation of foreign corn into Britain until domestic corn cost 80 shillings per quarter. The high price caused the cost of food to increase and caused distress among the working classes in the towns. It led to serious rioting in London and to the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819.

In this pamphlet, printed during the parliamentary discussion, Malthus tentatively supported the free-traders. He argued that given the increasing cost of growing British corn, advantages accrued from supplementing it from cheaper foreign sources.

=== 1820: &quot;Principles of political economy&quot; ===
In 1820 Malthus published &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;.
(A second edition was posthumously published in 1836.) Malthus intended this work to rival Ricardo&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot; (1817). It, and his 1827 &quot;Definitions in political economy&quot;, defended Sismondi&#x27;s views on &quot;general glut&quot; rather than Say&#x27;s law, which in effect states &quot;there can be no general glut&quot;.

== Reception and influence ==

Malthus developed the theory of demand-supply mismatches that he called gluts. Discounted at the time, this theory foreshadowed later work by an admirer, John Maynard Keynes.

The vast bulk of continuing commentary on Malthus, however, extends and expands on the &quot;Malthusian controversy&quot; of the early 19th century. In Ireland where (writing to Ricardo in 1817) Malthus proposed that &quot;to give full effect to the natural resources of the country a great part of the population should be swept from the soil into large manufacturing and commercial Towns&quot;, a comparatively early contribution was &quot;Observations on the population and resources of Ireland&quot; (1821) by the polymath and physician Whitely Stokes. Finding fault in Malthus&#x27;s calculations and juxtapositions--&quot;the possible increase of man in America&quot; measured against &quot;the probable increase in [food] production in Great Britain&quot;—and insisting upon the advantages mankind derives from &quot;improved industry, improved conveyance, improvements in morals, government and religion&quot;, Stokes argued that Ireland&#x27;s difficulty lay not in her &quot;numbers&quot;, but in indifferent government.

== In popular culture ==

* Ebenezer Scrooge from &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens represents the perceived ideas of Malthus, famously illustrated by his explanation as to why he refuses to donate to the poor and destitute: &quot;If they would rather die they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population&quot;. In general, Dickens had some Malthusian concerns (evident in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Hard Times&quot; and other novels), and he concentrated his attacks on Utilitarianism and many of its proponents, like Jeremy Bentham, whom he thought of, along with Malthus, as unjust and inhumane.
* In &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley, a dystopian novel set in a World State which controls reproduction, women wear the &quot;Malthusian belt&quot;, containing &quot;the regulation supply of contraceptives&quot;.
* In the musical &quot;Urinetown&quot;, written by Greg Kotis and Mark Hollmann, the characters live in a society in which a fee must be paid in order to urinate, for a drought has made water incredibly scarce. A revolution starts with a &quot;pee for free&quot; agenda. At the end of the show, the revolution wins but the characters end up dying because water was not being conserved, unlike when the &#x27;pee fee&#x27; was in place. The penultimate line is &quot;Hail Malthus!&quot;
*In the film &quot;&quot;, the main villain called Thanos appears to be motivated by Malthusian views about population growth, and commits universal mass genocide known as The Blip.
* In &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, one of the games antagonists, Amalthus, is inspired by Malthus.
* In the song &quot;rät&quot; by Penelope Scott, Malthus is referenced in the verse &quot;I bit the apple &#x27;cuz I trusted you, But it tastes like Thomas Malthus&quot;.

== Epitaph ==

The epitaph of Malthus in Bath Abbey reads [with commas inserted for clarity]:
Sacred to the memory of the Rev THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS, long known to the lettered world by his admirable writings on the social branches of political economy, particularly by his essay on population.

One of the best men and truest philosophers of any age or country, raised by native dignity of mind above the misrepresentations of the ignorant and the neglect of the great, he lived a serene and happy life devoted to the pursuit and communication of truth, supported by a calm but firm conviction of the usefulness of his labors, content with the approbation of the wise and good.

His writings will be a lasting monument of the extent and correctness of his understanding.

The spotless integrity of his principles, the equity and candour of his nature, his sweetness of temper, urbanity of manners and tenderness of heart, his benevolence and his piety are the still dearer recollections of his family and friends.
Born 14 February 1766 – Died 29 December 1834.

<text>The Tengwar () script is an artificial script, one of several scripts created by J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Within the context of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world, the Tengwar were invented by the Elf Fëanor, and used first to write the Elvish languages Quenya and Telerin. Later a great number of Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages were written using the Tengwar, including Sindarin. Tolkien used Tengwar to write English: most of Tolkien&#x27;s Tengwar samples are actually in English.

== Internal history and terminology ==

Within the context of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world, the Tengwar were invented by the Elf Fëanor in Valinor, and used first to write the Elven tongues Quenya and Telerin. According to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Jewels&quot;, at the time Fëanor created his script, he introduced a change in terminology. He called a letter, a written representation of a spoken phoneme (&quot;tengwë&quot;), a &quot;tengwa&quot;. Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a &quot;sarat&quot; (from &quot;*sar&quot; &quot;incise&quot;). The alphabet of Rúmil of Tirion, on which Fëanor supposedly based his own work, was known as Sarati. It later became known as &quot;Tengwar of Rúmil&quot;.

The plural of &quot;tengwa&quot; is &quot;Tengwar&quot;, and this is the name by which Fëanor&#x27;s writing system became known. Since, however, in commonly used modes, an individual &quot;tengwa&quot; was equivalent to a consonant, the term &quot;tengwa&quot; in the fiction became equivalent to &quot;consonant sign&quot;, and the vowel signs were known as &quot;ómatehtar&quot;. By loan-translation, the Tengwar became known as &quot;tîw&quot; (singular &quot;têw&quot;) in Sindarin, when they were introduced to Beleriand. The letters of the earlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called &quot;cirth&quot; (singular &quot;certh&quot;, probably from &quot;*kirte&quot; &quot;cutting&quot;, and thus semantically analogous to Quenya &quot;sarat&quot;). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as &quot;certa&quot;, plural &quot;certar&quot;.

== External history ==

=== Precursors ===

The sarati, a script developed by Tolkien in the late 1910s and described in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon 13&quot;, anticipates many features of the Tengwar: vowel representation by diacritics (which is found in many Tengwar varieties); different Tengwar shapes; and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features (though inconsistent).

Even closer to the Tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon 14&quot;, which Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925. It features many Tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel found in some Tengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an arrangement that is very similar to one of the primary Tengwar in the classical Quenya &quot;mode&quot;.

In his &quot;An Introduction to Elvish&quot;, Jim Allan compared the Tengwar with the London merchant Francis Lodwick&#x27;s 1686 &quot;Universal Alphabet&quot;, both on grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound features, and of the actual letter shapes.

=== Tengwar ===

The Tengwar script was probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s. &quot;The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription&quot;, the first published Tengwar sample, dates to 1937. The full explanation of the Tengwar was published in Appendix E of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1955.

The &quot;Mellonath Daeron Index of Tengwar Specimina&quot; (DTS) lists most of the known samples of Tengwar by Tolkien.

There are only a few known samples predating publication of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (many of them published posthumously):

* &quot;The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription&quot;, published 1937
* &quot;Middle Page from the Book of Mazarbul&quot;
* &quot;Last Page from the Book of Mazarbul, Last Line&quot;, this and the above one originally prepared for inclusion in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;
* &quot;Steinborg Drawing Title&quot;
* &quot;Ilbereth&#x27;s Greeting&quot; from The Father Christmas Letters, dating to 1937
* &quot;The Treebeard Page&quot;
* &quot;Edwin Lowdham&#x27;s Manuscript&quot; from The Notion Club Papers has Old English language text written in Tengwar (with a few Adûnaic and Quenya words), dating to 1945/6.
* The Brogan Tengwa-greetings, appearing in &quot;The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, No. 118, tentatively dated to 1948

The following samples presumably predate the Lord of the Rings, but were not explicitly dated: 

* &quot;Elvish Script Sample I, II, III&quot;, with parts of the English poems &quot;Errantry&quot; and &quot;Bombadil&quot;, first published in the &quot;Silmarillion Calendar 1978&quot;, later in &quot;Pictures by J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, 
* &quot;So Lúthien&quot;, a page of the English &quot;Lay of Leithian&quot; text

== Description ==

=== Letters ===

The most notable characteristic of the Tengwar script is that the shapes of the letters correspond to the distinctive features of the sounds they represent. The Quenya consonant system has five places of articulation: labial, dental, palatal, velar, and glottal. The velars distinguish between plain and labialized (that is, articulated with rounded lips, or followed by a sound). Each point of articulation, and the corresponding tengwa series, has a name in the classical Quenya mode. Dental sounds are called &quot;Tincotéma&quot; and are represented with the Tengwar in column I. Labial sounds are called &quot;Parmatéma&quot;, and represented by the column II Tengwar; velar sounds are called &quot;Calmatéma&quot;, represented by column III; and labialized velar sounds are called &quot;Quessetéma&quot;, represented by the &quot;Tengwar&quot; of column IV. Palatal sounds are called &quot;Tyelpetéma&quot; and have no tengwa series of their own, but are represented by column III letters with an added diacritic for following .

Similarly shaped letters reflect not only similar places of articulation, but also similar manners of articulation. In the classical Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.

==== Regularly formed ====

Most letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a vertical stem (either long or short) and either one or two rounded bows (which may or may not be underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).

These principal letters are divided into four series (&quot;témar&quot;) that correspond to the main places of articulation and into six grades (&quot;tyeller&quot;) that correspond to the main manners of articulation. Both vary among modes.

Each series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem descending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent the voiceless stop consonants for that series. For the classical Quenya mode, they are , , and , and the series are named &quot;tincotéma&quot;, &quot;parmatéma&quot;, &quot;calmatéma&quot;, and &quot;quessetéma&quot;, respectively; téma means &quot;series&quot; in Quenya.

In rows of the &quot;general use&quot;, there are the following correspondences between letter shapes and manners of articulation:

* Doubling the bow turns the voiceless consonant into a voiced one.
* Raising the stem above the line turns it into the corresponding fricative.
* Shortening it (so it is only the height of the bow) creates the corresponding nasal. In most modes, the signs with shortened stem and single bow do not correspond to the voiceless nasals, but to the approximants.

In addition to these variations of the Tengwar shapes, there is yet another variation, the use of stems that are extended both above and below the line. This shape may correspond to other consonant variations required. Except for some English abbreviations, it is not used in any of the better known Tengwar modes, but it occurs in a Quenya mode where the tengwa Parma with extended stem is used for and the tengwa Calma with extended stem is used for . The Tengwar with raised stems sometimes occur in glyph variants that look like extended stems, as seen in the inscription of the One Ring.

An example from the &quot;parmatéma&quot; (the signs with a closed bow on the right side) in the &quot;general use&quot; of the Tengwar is:

* The basic sign, named &quot;parma&quot;, (with descending stem) represents (it happens to look much like the Latin letter &quot;P&quot;).
* With the bow doubled, &quot;umbar&quot;, it represents .
* With a raised stem, &quot;formen&quot;, it represents .
* With a raised stem and a doubled bow, &quot;ampa&quot;, it represents generally but possibly (depending upon the language).
* With a short stem and double bow, &quot;&quot;, it represents .
* With short stem and single bow, &quot;vala&quot;, it represents , or if that has the phonological behaviour of a sonorant (e.g. in Quenya).

In languages such as Quenya, which do not contain any voiced fricatives other than &quot;v&quot;, the raised stem + doubled bow row is used for the common nasal+stop sequences (&quot;nt&quot;, &quot;mp&quot;, &quot;nk&quot;, &quot;nqu&quot;). In such cases, the &quot;w&quot; sign in the previous paragraph is used for &quot;v&quot;. In the mode of Beleriand, found on the door to Moria, the bottom &quot;tyellë&quot; is used for nasals (e.g., &quot;vala&quot; is used for ) and the fifth &quot;tyellë&quot; for doubled nasals (&quot;&quot; for ).

==== Irregularly formed ====

There are additional letters that do not have regular shapes. They may represent, e.g., , , and . Their use varies considerably from mode to mode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien&#x27;s writings for use in their modes.

=== &quot;Tehtar&quot; diacritics ===

A &quot;tehta&quot; (Quenya &quot;marking&quot;) is a diacritic placed above or below the tengwa. They can represent vowels, consonant doubling, or nasal sound.

As Tolkien explained in Appendix E of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the &quot;tehtar&quot; for vowels resemble Latin diacritics: circumflex (î) , acute (í) , dot (i) , left curl (ı̔) , and right curl (ı̓) . Long vowels, excepting , may be indicated by doubling the signs. Some languages from which is absent or in which compared to it appears sparsely, such as the Black Speech, use left curl for ; other languages swap the signs for and .

A vowel occurring alone is drawn on the vowel carrier, which resembles dotless i (ı) for a short vowel or dotless j (ȷ) for a long vowel.

== Modes ==

Just as with any alphabetic writing system, every specific language written in Tengwar requires a specific orthography, depending on the phonology of that language. These Tengwar orthographies are usually called &quot;modes&quot;. Some modes follow pronunciation, while others follow traditional orthography.

Some modes map the basic consonants to , , and (classical mode in chart at right), while others use them to represent , , and (general mode at right). The other main difference is in the fourth &quot;tyellë&quot; below, where those letters with raised stems and doubled bows can be either voiced fricatives, as in Sindarin (general mode at right), or nasalized stops, as in Quenya (classical mode).

=== Ómatehtar ===

In some modes, called &quot;ómatehtar&quot; (or &quot;vowel tehtar&quot;) modes, the vowels are represented with diacritics called &quot;tehtar&quot; (Quenya for &#x27;signs&#x27;; corresponding singular: &quot;tehta&quot;, &#x27;sign&#x27;). These ómatehtar modes can be considered abugidas rather than true alphabets. In some ómatehtar modes, the consonant signs feature an inherent vowel.

&quot;Ómatehtar&quot; modes can vary in that the vowel stroke can be placed either on top of the consonant preceding it, as in Quenya, or on the consonant following, as in Sindarin, English, and the notorious Black Speech inscription on the One Ring.

=== Full writing ===

In the &quot;full writing&quot; modes, the consonants and the vowels are represented by Tengwar. Only one such mode is well known. It is called the &quot;mode of Beleriand&quot; and one can read it on the Doors of Durin.

=== Modes for other languages ===

Since the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar at the end of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, others have created modes for other languages such as English, Spanish, German, Swedish, French, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian and Welsh. Modes have also been devised for other constructed languages; Esperanto and Lojban.

Tolkien had used multiple modes for English, including full writing and ómatehtar alphabetic modes, phonetic full modes and phonetic ómatehtar modes known from documents published after his death.

== Encoding schemes ==

=== Legacy encoding ===

The contemporary de facto standard in the Tengwar user community maps the Tengwar characters onto the ISO 8859-1 character encoding following the example of the Tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major flaw: If no corresponding Tengwar font is installed, a string of nonsense characters appears.

Since there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1&#x27;s 191 codepoints for all the signs used in Tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a &quot;Tengwar A&quot; font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1, overlapping with the first font.

For each Tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are used depending on the width of the character which bears it.

Other Tengwar typefaces with this encoding include Johan Winge&#x27;s Tengwar Annatar, Måns Björkman&#x27;s Tengwar Parmaitë, Enrique Mombello&#x27;s Tengwar Élfica or Michal Nowakowski&#x27;s Tengwar Formal (note that most of these differ in details).

The following sample shows the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights written in English, according to the traditional English orthography. It should look similar to the picture at the top of the page, but if no Tengwar font is installed, it will appear as a jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1 characters will appear instead.

Note: Some browsers may not display these characters properly.

=== Unicode ===

Michael Everson made a proposal to include the Tengwar in the Unicode standard in 1997. The range to U+160FF in the SMP was tentatively allocated for Tengwar in the 2023 Unicode roadmap.

=== ConScript Unicode Registry ===

Tengwar are included in the unofficial ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR), which assigns codepoints in the Private Use Area. Tengwar are mapped to the range U+E000–U+E07F. The following Unicode sample (which repeats the one above) is meaningful when viewed under a typeface supporting Tengwar glyphs in the area defined in the ConScript Tengwar proposal.

Some typefaces that support this proposal are Everson Mono, Tengwar Telcontar, Constructium, Tengwar Formal Unicode, and FreeMonoTengwar (James Kass&#x27;s Code2000 and Code2001 use an older, incompatible version of the proposal). The eight “Aux” variant fonts of Kurinto (such as Kurinto Text Aux, Book Aux, Sans Aux) also support Tengwar.





==In popular culture ==

Tengwar has been used in Tolkien fandom since the publication of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the 1950s.

With the exception of John Rhys-Davies, the actors playing the Fellowship of the Ring in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy have Tengwar tattoos of the English word &quot;nine&quot;.

Footballers such as Sergio Agüero and Fernando Torres have tattoos with their first name in Tengwar on their forearms.

<doc id="31471" wikidata="Q193744" url="?curid=31471" title="Tori Amos">
<text>Tori Amos (born Myra Ellen Amos; August 22, 1963) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. She is a classically trained musician with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Having already begun composing instrumental pieces on piano, Amos won a full scholarship to the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University at the age of five, the youngest person ever to have been admitted. She had to leave at the age of eleven when her scholarship was discontinued for what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as &quot;musical insubordination&quot;. Amos was the lead singer of the short-lived 1980s pop-rock group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s. Her songs focus on a broad range of topics, including sexuality, feminism, politics, and religion.

Her charting singles include &quot;Crucify&quot;, &quot;Silent All These Years&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Cornflake Girl&quot;, &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, &quot;Professional Widow&quot;, &quot;Spark&quot;, &quot;1000 Oceans&quot;, &quot;Flavor&quot; and &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;. Amos has received five MTV VMA nominations and eight Grammy Award nominations, and won an Echo Klassik award for her &quot;Night of Hunters&quot; classical crossover album. She is listed on VH1&#x27;s 1999 &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll&quot; at number 71.

==Early life and education==
Amos is the third child of Mary Ellen (née Copeland) and Edison McKinley Amos. She was born on August 22, 1963 at the Old Catawba Hospital in Newton, North Carolina, during a trip from their Georgetown home in Washington, D.C., and was named Myra Ellen Amos.

Some of Amos&#x27;s ancestors were Confederate soldiers. In her memoir, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, she talks about the experience of these Confederate ancestors, Margaret Little and Grandaddy Calvin Rice, during the American Civil War.

When she was two years old, her family relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, where her father had moved his Methodist ministry from its original base in Washington, D.C. Her older brother and sister took piano lessons, but Tori did not need them. From the time she could reach the piano, she taught herself to play: when she was two, she could reproduce pieces of music she had only heard once, and, by the age of three, she was composing her own songs. She has described seeing music as structures of light since early childhood, an experience consistent with chromesthesia:

At five, she became the youngest student ever admitted to the preparatory division of the Peabody Institute. She studied classical piano at Peabody from 1968 to 1974. In 1974, when she was eleven, her scholarship was discontinued, and she was asked to leave. Amos has asserted that she lost the scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music, coupled with her dislike for reading from sheet music.

In 1972, the Amos family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, where her father became pastor of the Good Shepherd United Methodist church. At thirteen, Amos began playing at gay bars and piano bars, chaperoned by her father.

Amos won a county teen talent contest in 1977, singing a song called &quot;More Than Just a Friend&quot;. As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School, she co-wrote &quot;Baltimore&quot; with her brother, Mike Amos, for a competition involving the Baltimore Orioles. The song did not win the contest but became her first single, released as a 7-inch single pressed locally for family and friends in 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side, &quot;Walking With You&quot;. Before this, she had performed under her middle name, Ellen, and was considering the stage name &quot;Sammy Jaye&quot; at the time, but permanently adopted &quot;Tori&quot; after a friend&#x27;s boyfriend told her she looked like a Torrey pine, a tree native to the West Coast.

==Career==

===1979–1989: Career beginnings and Y Kant Tori Read===
By the time she was 17, Amos had a stock of homemade demo tapes that her father regularly sent out to record companies and producers. Producer Narada Michael Walden responded favorably: he and Amos cut some tracks together, but none were released. Eventually, Atlantic Records responded to one of the tapes, and, when A&amp;R man Jason Flom flew to Baltimore to audition her in person, the label was convinced and signed her.

In 1984, Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit in the Washington, D.C. area.

In 1986, Amos formed a musical group called Y Kant Tori Read, named for her difficulty with sight-reading. In addition to Amos, the group was composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. The band went through several iterations of songwriting and recording; Amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time. Finally, in July 1988, the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album, &quot;Y Kant Tori Read&quot;, was released. Although its producer, Joe Chiccarelli, stated that Amos was very happy with the album at the time, Amos has since criticized it, once remarking: &quot;The only good thing about that album is my ankle high boots.&quot;

Following the album&#x27;s commercial failure and the group&#x27;s subsequent disbanding, Amos began working with other artists (including Stan Ridgway, Sandra Bernhard, and Al Stewart) as a backup vocalist. She also recorded a song called &quot;Distant Storm&quot; (which she did not write), which was used in the film &quot;China O&#x27;Brien.&quot; In the credits, the song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good. Amos recorded the vocals for the song in 1988, for $150; she was unaware for several years that the song had actually been heard in a film. Other than the appearance in the film itself, &quot;Distant Storm&quot; has never been commercially issued in any format.

===1990–1995: &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; and &quot;Under the Pink&quot;===

Despite the disappointing reaction to &quot;Y Kant Tori Read&quot;, Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, which, in 1989, wanted a new record by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented. The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton, Eric Rosse, Will MacGregor, Carlo Nuccio, and Dan Nebenzal, resulting in &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;, an album recounting her religious upbringing, sexual awakening, struggle to establish her identity, and sexual assault. This album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough, entering the British charts in January 1992 at Number 15. &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; was released in the United States in February 1992 and slowly but steadily began to attract listeners, gaining more attention with the video for the single &quot;Silent All These Years&quot;.

Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record, &quot;Under the Pink&quot;. The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, a significantly higher position than the preceding album&#x27;s position at No. 54 on the same chart. However, the album found its biggest success in the UK, debuting at number one upon release in February 1994.

===1996–2000: &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot;, and &quot;To Venus and Back&quot;===

Her third solo album, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, was released in January 1996. Prior to its release, the first single, &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot; became the first full song released for streaming online prior to an album&#x27;s release.

The album was recorded in a church in Delgany, County Wicklow, Ireland, with Amos taking advantage of the church&#x27;s acoustics. For this album, Amos used the harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord as well as the piano. The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability. Despite the album&#x27;s erratic lyrical content and instrumentation, the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; is Amos&#x27; most successful simultaneous transatlantic release, reaching No. 2 on the UK Top 40 and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 upon its release.

Fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives, Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall, UK converted into the state-of-the-art recording studio of Martian Engineering Studios.

&quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; and &quot;To Venus and Back&quot;, released in May 1998 and September 1999, respectively, differ greatly from previous albums. Amos&#x27; trademark acoustic, piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronica and dance music with vocal washes. The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood and Amos&#x27; own miscarriages and marriage. Reviews for &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; were mostly favorable and praised Amos&#x27; continued artistic originality. Debut sales for &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; are Amos&#x27; best to date, selling 153,000 copies in its first week. &quot;To Venus and Back&quot;, a two-disc release of original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour, received mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a digital download.

===2001–2004: &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot; and &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;===
Shortly after giving birth to her daughter, Amos decided to record a cover album, taking songs written by men about women and reversing the gender roles to reflect a woman&#x27;s perspective. That became &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;, released in September 2001. The album is Amos&#x27; first concept album, with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song. Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with Atlantic without giving them original songs; Amos felt that since 1998, the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label.

With her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint, Amos signed to Epic in late 2001. In October 2002, Amos released &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot;, another concept album. Described as a &quot;sonic novel&quot;, the album explores Amos&#x27; alter ego, Scarlet, intertwined with her cross-country concert tour following 9/11. Through the songs, Amos explores such topics as the history of America, American people, Native American history, pornography, masochism, homophobia and misogyny. The album had a strong debut at No. 7 on the Billboard 200. &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; is Amos&#x27; last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA.

Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003. Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group. Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label, Epic/Sony Music Entertainment, merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industry&#x27;s decline.

===2005–2008: &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; and &quot;American Doll Posse&quot;===

Amos released two more albums with Epic, &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; (2005) and &quot;American Doll Posse&quot; (2007). Both albums received generally favorable reviews. &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping, which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of &quot;The Beekeeper&quot;, Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, &quot;American Doll Posse&quot;, before inviting the label to listen to it. &quot;American Doll Posse&quot;, another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the &quot;posse&quot;) who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amos&#x27;. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature. Like its predecessor, &quot;American Doll Posse&quot; debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.

During her tenure with Epic Records, Amos also released a retrospective collection titled &quot;Tales of a Librarian&quot; (2003) through her former label, Atlantic Records; a two-disc DVD set &quot;Fade to Red&quot; (2006) containing most of Amos&#x27; solo music videos, released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino; a five disc box set titled &quot;A Piano: The Collection&quot; (2006), celebrating Amos&#x27; 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions, also released through Rhino; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours, &quot;The Original Bootlegs&quot; (2005) and &quot;Legs &amp; Boots&quot; (2007) through Epic Records.

===2008–2011: &quot;Abnormally Attracted to Sin&quot; and &quot;Midwinter Graces&quot;===

In May 2008, Amos announced that, due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic Records, she had negotiated an end to her contract with the record label, and would be operating independently of major record labels on future work. In September of the same year, Amos released a live album and DVD, &quot;Live at Montreux 1991/1992&quot;, through Eagle Rock Entertainment, of two performances she gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in her career while promoting her debut solo album, &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;. By December, after a chance encounter with chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, Doug Morris, Amos signed a &quot;joint venture&quot; deal with Universal Republic Records.

&quot;Abnormally Attracted to Sin&quot;, Amos&#x27; tenth solo studio album and her first album released through Universal Republic, was released in May 2009 to mostly positive reviews. The album debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, making it Amos&#x27; seventh album to do so. &quot;Abnormally Attracted to Sin&quot;, admitted Amos, is a &quot;personal album&quot;, not a conceptual one, with the album exploring themes of power, boundaries, and the subjective view of sin. Continuing her distribution deal with Universal Republic, Amos released &quot;Midwinter Graces&quot;, her first seasonal album, in November of the same year. The album features reworked versions of traditional carols, as well as original songs written by Amos.

During her contract with the label, Amos recorded vocals for two songs for David Byrne&#x27;s collaboration album with Fatboy Slim, titled &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;, which was released in April 2010. In July of the same year, the DVD &quot;Tori Amos- Live from the Artists Den&quot; was released exclusively through Barnes &amp; Noble.

After a brief tour from June to September 2010, Amos released a live album &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; in December the same year, recorded in Moscow on September 3, 2010. The limited edition set included a signature edition Lomography Diana F+ camera, along with two lenses, a roll of film and one of five photographs taken of Amos during her time in Moscow. The set was released exclusively through her website and only 2000 copies were produced.

===2011–2015: &quot;Night of Hunters&quot;, &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, and &quot;Unrepentant Geraldines&quot;===
In September 2011, Amos released her first classical-style music album, &quot;Night of Hunters&quot;, featuring variations on a theme to pay tribute to composers such as Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Granados, Satie and Schubert, on the Deutsche Grammophon label, a division of Universal Music Group. Amos recorded the album with several musicians, including the Apollon Musagète string quartet.

To mark the 20th anniversary of her debut album, &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; (1992), Amos released an album of songs from her back catalogue re-worked and re-recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. The album, titled &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, was released in October 2012 through Deutsche Grammophon.

On May 1, 2012, Amos announced the formation of her own record label, Transmission Galactic, which she said she intended to use to develop new artists.

In 2013, Amos collaborated with the Bullitts on the track &quot;Wait Until Tomorrow&quot; from their debut album, &quot;They Die by Dawn &amp; Other Short Stories&quot;. She also stated in an interview that a new album and tour would materialize in 2014 and that it would be a &quot;return to contemporary music&quot;.

September 2013 saw the launch of Amos&#x27; musical project adaptation of George MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;The Light Princess&quot;, along with book writer Samuel Adamson and Marianne Elliott. It premiered at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre and ended in February 2014. &quot;The Light Princess&quot; and its lead actress, Rosalie Craig, were nominated for Best Musical and Best Musical Performance respectively at the Evening Standard Award. Craig won the Best Musical Performance category.

Amos&#x27; 14th studio album, &quot;Unrepentant Geraldines&quot;, was released on May 13, 2014, via Mercury Classics/Universal Music Classics in the US. Its first single, &quot;Trouble&#x27;s Lament&quot;, was released on March 28. The album was supported by the Unrepentant Geraldines Tour which began May 5, 2014, in Cork and continued across Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia, ending in Brisbane on November 21, 2014. In Sydney, Amos performed two orchestral concerts, reminiscent of the Gold Dust Orchestral Tour, with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra at the Sydney Opera House.

According to a press release, &quot;Unrepentant Geraldines&quot; was a &quot;return to her core identity as a creator of contemporary songs of exquisite beauty following a series of more classically-inspired and innovative musical projects of the last four years. [It is] both one further step in the artistic evolution of one of the most successful and influential artists of her generation, and a return to the inspiring and personal music that Amos is known for all around the world.&quot;

The 2-CD set &quot;The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)&quot; was released on October 9, 2015, via Universal/Mercury Classics. Apart from the original cast performances, the recording also includes two songs from the musical (&quot;Highness in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Darkest Hour&#x27;) performed by Amos.

During the summer of 2017, Amos launched three songs from the album: &quot;Cloud Riders&quot;, &quot;Up the Creek&quot;, and &quot;Reindeer King&quot;, the latter featuring string arrangements by John Philip Shenale. Produced by Amos, the album explores topics like American politics and environmental issues, mixed with mythological elements and first-person narrations. &quot;Native Invader&quot; obtained a score of 76 out of 100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

On November 9, 2020, Amos announced the release of a holiday-themed EP entitled &quot;Christmastide&quot; on December 4, digitally and on limited-edition vinyl. The EP consists of four original songs and features her first work with bandmates Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans since 2009. Amos recorded the EP remotely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On September 20, 2021, Amos announced her sixteenth studio album, &quot;Ocean to Ocean&quot;, which was released on October 29. The album was written and recorded in Cornwall during lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and explores &quot;a universal story of going to rock bottom and renewing yourself all over again&quot;. Amos embarked on a European and United States tour in support of the album in 2022, and continued to support the album in 2023 with a European Tour in March and April and additional US dates in June and July . Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans were featured on drums and bass guitar respectively, their first collaboration with Amos on an album since 2009&#x27;s &quot;Midwinter Graces&quot;.

On November 1, 2024, Amos announced the release of a live album, &quot;Diving Deep Live&quot;, on December 6, 2024, consisting of recordings from her 2022-23 tour in support of &quot;Ocean to Ocean&quot;. it was released on double vinyl, on cd and digitally.

On February 28, 2025, Amos released a surprise album, &quot;The Music of Tori and the Muses&quot;, as a companion project to her illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;Tori and the Muses&quot;, published on March 4. The album featured nine original songs and featured Jon Evans on bass guitar and Matt Chamberlain on drums. Touring drummer Ash Soan featured on drums on the tracks &quot;Knocking&quot;, &quot;Spike&#x27;s Lament&quot;, and &quot;Rain Brings Change&quot;.

==In print==
Amos and her music have been the subject of numerous official and unofficial books, as well as academic critique, including &quot;Tori Amos: Lyrics&quot; (2001) illustrated by Herb Leonhard, and an earlier biography, &quot;Tori Amos: All These Years&quot; (1996) by Kalen Rogers.

Released in conjunction with &quot;The Beekeeper&quot;, Amos co-authored an autobiography with rock music journalist Ann Powers titled &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (2005). The book&#x27;s subject is Amos&#x27; interest in mythology and religion, exploring her songwriting process, rise to fame, and her relationship with Atlantic Records.

Image Comics released &quot;Comic Book Tattoo&quot; (2008), a collection of comic stories, each based on or inspired by songs recorded by Amos. Editor Rantz Hoseley worked with Amos to gather 80 different artists for the book, including Neil Gaiman, Carla Speed McNeil, Mark Buckingham, C.B. Cebulski, Nikki Cook, Hope Larson, John Ney Reiber, Ryan Kelly, Pia Guerra, David Mack, and Leah Moore.

&quot;Tori Amos: In the Studio&quot; (2011) by Jake Brown features an in-depth look at Amos&#x27; career, discography, and recording process. &quot;Sing Us a Song, Piano Woman: Female Fans and the Music of Tori Amos&quot; (2013) by Adrienne Trier-Bieniek explores the ways women are represented in pop culture and the many-layered relationships female fans build with feminist musicians in general and with Tori Amos in particular.

&quot;Tori Amos&#x27; Boys for Pele&quot; (2018) by Amy Gentry uses a blend of memoir, criticism, and aesthetic theory in order to argue that the aesthetics of disgust are useful of thinking in a broader way about women&#x27;s experience of all art forms. Amos released her second memoir, called &quot;Resistance: A Songwriter&#x27;s Story of Hope, Change, and Courage&quot; on May 5, 2020.

&quot;Tori Amos: Little Earthquakes&quot; (2022) by Tori Amos and Neil Gaiman is an official graphic novel celebrating 30 years of Tori Amos&#x27; breakout album &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;.

Written by Amos and illustrated by Demelsa Haughton, the children&#x27;s book &quot;Tori and the Muses&quot; will be released on March 4, 2025.

==Personal life==
Amos married English sound engineer Mark Hawley on February 22, 1998. They have one daughter, Natashya Lórien Hawley, born September 5, 2000. They live in Bude, UK.

Amos&#x27;s mother, Mary Ellen, died on May 11, 2019.

Early in her professional career, Amos befriended author Neil Gaiman, who became a fan after she referred to him in the song &quot;Tear in Your Hand&quot; and also in print interviews. Although created before the two met, the character Delirium from Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series is inspired by Amos; Gaiman has stated that they &quot;steal shamelessly from each other&quot;. She wrote the foreword to his collection &quot;&quot;; he in turn wrote the introduction to &quot;Comic Book Tattoo&quot;. Gaiman is godfather to her daughter, and a poem written for her birth, &quot;Blueberry Girl&quot;, was published as a children&#x27;s book of the same name in 2009. In 2019, Amos performed the British standard &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; over the closing credits of season one of Gaiman&#x27;s TV series &quot;Good Omens&quot;, based on the novel of the same name written by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.

===Activism===
In June 1994, the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), a toll-free help line in the US connecting callers with their local rape crisis center, was founded. Amos stated in a 1994 interview that she was raped at knife point when she was 22 and did not report the incident to the authorities. She answered the ceremonial first call to launch the hotline. She was the first national spokesperson for the organization and has continued to be closely associated with RAINN. On August 18, 2013, a concert in honor of her 50th birthday was held, an event which raised money for RAINN. On August 22, 2020, Amos appeared on a panel called Artistry &amp; Activism at the diversity and inclusion digital global conference CARLA.

===Relationship with Cherokee culture ===

Amos has frequently referred to Native American culture, history, and spirituality in her music and visual art, as well as making personal connections with the culture. She has spoken about ancestors on her mother&#x27;s side she said were of Cherokee descent. 

Of particular importance to her as a child was her maternal grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, whom she has cited as a great source of inspiration and guidance, offering a pantheistic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother&#x27;s traditional Christianity. She has said her great-grandmother evaded the Trail of Tears by taking refuge in the Great Smoky Mountains, her family&#x27;s place of residence. Amos took a trip through the Smokies which formed the creative basis for her album &quot;Native Invader&quot;. While talking to &quot;The Guardian&quot; about taking Ayahuasca and attending sweatlodge ceremonies with her sister, Amos has also said, &quot;I&#x27;m not in a position to speak for First Nation people – that&#x27;s a sacred task.&quot;

===Legacy===
Artists who have been influenced and/or admire Amos&#x27;s work include Alanis Morissette, Amy Lee of Evanescence, Olly Alexander of Years &amp; Years, Justin Timberlake, Olivia Rodrigo, Leighton Meester, and Jack Colwell.

In 2003, Amos was voted fifth best touring act by the readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Her concerts are notable for their changing set lists from night to night.

;Little Earthquakes Tour

The tour kicked off with its European leg in Rome, Italy, on May 28, 2007, which lasted through July, concluding in Israel; the Australian leg took place during September; the North American leg lasted from October to December 16, 2007, when the tour concluded in Los Angeles. Amos opened each show dressed as one of the four non-Tori personae from the album, then Amos would emerge as herself to perform for the remaining two-thirds of the show. The entire concert tour featured 93 concerts, and 27 full-length concerts of the North American tour were released as official bootlegs in the &quot;Legs and Boots&quot; series.
;Sinful Attraction Tour

<text>In molecular biology, a transcription factor (TF) (or sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding to a specific DNA sequence. The function of TFs is to regulate—turn on and off—genes in order to make sure that they are expressed in the desired cells at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism. Groups of TFs function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division, cell growth, and cell death throughout life; cell migration and organization (body plan) during embryonic development; and intermittently in response to signals from outside the cell, such as a hormone. There are approximately 1600 TFs in the human genome. Transcription factors are members of the proteome as well as regulome.

TFs work alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes.

A defining feature of TFs is that they contain at least one DNA-binding domain (DBD), which attaches to a specific sequence of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate. TFs are grouped into classes based on their DBDs. Other proteins such as coactivators, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, kinases, and methylases are also essential to gene regulation, but lack DNA-binding domains, and therefore are not TFs.

TFs are of interest in medicine because TF mutations can cause specific diseases, and medications can be potentially targeted toward them.

== Number ==

Transcription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression and are, as a consequence, found in all living organisms. The number of transcription factors found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more transcription factors per gene.

There are approximately 2800 proteins in the human genome that contain DNA-binding domains, and 1600 of these are presumed to function as transcription factors, though other studies indicate it to be a smaller number. Therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for transcription factors, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins. Furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct transcription factors, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different transcription factors (see, for example, hepatocyte nuclear factors). Hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human transcription factors easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development.

== Mechanism ==
Transcription factors bind to either enhancer or promoter regions of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate based on recognizing specific DNA motifs. Depending on the transcription factor, the transcription of the adjacent gene is either up- or down-regulated. Transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. These mechanisms include:
* stabilize or block the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA
* catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins. The transcription factor can either do this directly or recruit other proteins with this catalytic activity. Many transcription factors use one or the other of two opposing mechanisms to regulate transcription:
** histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity – acetylates histone proteins, which weakens the association of DNA with histones, which make the DNA more accessible to transcription, thereby up-regulating transcription
** histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity – deacetylates histone proteins, which strengthens the association of DNA with histones, which make the DNA less accessible to transcription, thereby down-regulating transcription
* recruit coactivator or corepressor proteins to the transcription factor DNA complex

== Function ==

Transcription factors are one of the groups of proteins that read and interpret the genetic &quot;blueprint&quot; in the DNA. They bind to the DNA and help initiate a program of increased or decreased gene transcription. As such, they are vital for many important cellular processes. Below are some of the important functions and biological roles transcription factors are involved in:

=== Basal transcriptional regulation ===

In eukaryotes, an important class of transcription factors called general transcription factors (GTFs) are necessary for transcription to occur. Many of these GTFs do not actually bind DNA, but rather are part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with RNA polymerase directly. The most common GTFs are TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (see also TATA binding protein), TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The preinitiation complex binds to promoter regions of DNA upstream to the gene that they regulate.

=== Differential enhancement of transcription ===
Other transcription factors differentially regulate the expression of various genes by binding to enhancer regions of DNA adjacent to regulated genes. These transcription factors are critical to making sure that genes are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount, depending on the changing requirements of the organism.

==== Development ====

Many transcription factors in multicellular organisms are involved in development. Responding to stimuli, these transcription factors turn on/off the transcription of the appropriate genes, which, in turn, allows for changes in cell morphology or activities needed for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation. The Hox transcription factor family, for example, is important for proper body pattern formation in organisms as diverse as fruit flies to humans. Another example is the transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene, which plays a major role in determining sex in humans.

==== Response to intercellular signals ====

Cells can communicate with each other by releasing molecules that produce signaling cascades within another receptive cell. If the signal requires upregulation or downregulation of genes in the recipient cell, often transcription factors will be downstream in the signaling cascade. Estrogen signaling is an example of a fairly short signaling cascade that involves the estrogen receptor transcription factor: Estrogen is secreted by tissues such as the ovaries and placenta, crosses the cell membrane of the recipient cell, and is bound by the estrogen receptor in the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. The estrogen receptor then goes to the cell&#x27;s nucleus and binds to its DNA-binding sites, changing the transcriptional regulation of the associated genes.

==== Response to environment ====

Not only do transcription factors act downstream of signaling cascades related to biological stimuli but they can also be downstream of signaling cascades involved in environmental stimuli. Examples include heat shock factor (HSF), which upregulates genes necessary for survival at higher temperatures, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which upregulates genes necessary for cell survival in low-oxygen environments, and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), which helps maintain proper lipid levels in the cell.

==== Cell cycle control ====

Many transcription factors, especially some that are proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors, help regulate the cell cycle and as such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cells. One example is the Myc oncogene, which has important roles in cell growth and apoptosis.

==== Pathogenesis ====

Transcription factors can also be used to alter gene expression in a host cell to promote pathogenesis. A well studied example of this are the transcription-activator like effectors (TAL effectors) secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria. When injected into plants, these proteins can enter the nucleus of the plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. TAL effectors contain a central repeat region in which there is a simple relationship between the identity of two critical residues in sequential repeats and sequential DNA bases in the TAL effector&#x27;s target site. This property likely makes it easier for these proteins to evolve in order to better compete with the defense mechanisms of the host cell.

== Regulation ==

It is common in biology for important processes to have multiple layers of regulation and control. This is also true with transcription factors: Not only do transcription factors control the rates of transcription to regulate the amounts of gene products (RNA and protein) available to the cell but transcription factors themselves are regulated (often by other transcription factors). Below is a brief synopsis of some of the ways that the activity of transcription factors can be regulated:

=== Synthesis ===

Transcription factors (like all proteins) are transcribed from a gene on a chromosome into RNA, and then the RNA is translated into protein. Any of these steps can be regulated to affect the production (and thus activity) of a transcription factor. An implication of this is that transcription factors can regulate themselves. For example, in a negative feedback loop, the transcription factor acts as its own repressor: If the transcription factor protein binds the DNA of its own gene, it down-regulates the production of more of itself. This is one mechanism to maintain low levels of a transcription factor in a cell.

=== Nuclear localization ===

In eukaryotes, transcription factors (like most proteins) are transcribed in the nucleus but are then translated in the cell&#x27;s cytoplasm. Many proteins that are active in the nucleus contain nuclear localization signals that direct them to the nucleus. But, for many transcription factors, this is a key point in their regulation. Important classes of transcription factors such as some nuclear receptors must first bind a ligand while in the cytoplasm before they can relocate to the nucleus.

=== Activation ===

Transcription factors may be activated (or deactivated) through their signal-sensing domain by a number of mechanisms including:
* ligand binding – Not only is ligand binding able to influence where a transcription factor is located within a cell but ligand binding can also affect whether the transcription factor is in an active state and capable of binding DNA or other cofactors (see, for example, nuclear receptors).
* phosphorylation – Many transcription factors such as STAT proteins must be phosphorylated before they can bind DNA.
* interaction with other transcription factors (&quot;e.g.&quot;, homo- or hetero-dimerization) or coregulatory proteins

=== Accessibility of DNA-binding site ===

In eukaryotes, DNA is organized with the help of histones into compact particles called nucleosomes, where sequences of about 147 DNA base pairs make ~1.65 turns around histone protein octamers. DNA within nucleosomes is inaccessible to many transcription factors. Some transcription factors, so-called pioneer factors are still able to bind their DNA binding sites on the nucleosomal DNA. For most other transcription factors, the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motors such as chromatin remodelers. Alternatively, the nucleosome can be partially unwrapped by thermal fluctuations, allowing temporary access to the transcription factor binding site. In many cases, a transcription factor needs to compete for binding to its DNA binding site with other transcription factors and histones or non-histone chromatin proteins. Pairs of transcription factors and other proteins can play antagonistic roles (activator versus repressor) in the regulation of the same gene.

=== Availability of other cofactors/transcription factors ===

Most transcription factors do not work alone. Many large TF families form complex homotypic or heterotypic interactions through dimerization. For gene transcription to occur, a number of transcription factors must bind to DNA regulatory sequences. This collection of transcription factors, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase. Thus, for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the transcription factor must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary.
Cofactors are proteins that modulate the effects of transcription factors. Cofactors are interchangeable between specific gene promoters; the protein complex that occupies the promoter DNA and the amino acid sequence of the cofactor determine its spatial conformation. For example, certain steroid receptors can exchange cofactors with NF-κB, which is a switch between inflammation and cellular differentiation; thereby steroids can affect the inflammatory response and function of certain tissues.

=== Interaction with methylated cytosine ===

Transcription factors and methylated cytosines in DNA both have major roles in regulating gene expression. (Methylation of cytosine in DNA primarily occurs where cytosine is followed by guanine in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; DNA sequence, a CpG site.) Methylation of CpG sites in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription, while methylation of CpGs in the body of a gene increases expression. TET enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene.

The DNA binding sites of 519 transcription factors were evaluated. Of these, 169 transcription factors (33%) did not have CpG dinucleotides in their binding sites, and 33 transcription factors (6%) could bind to a CpG-containing motif but did not display a preference for a binding site with either a methylated or unmethylated CpG. There were 117 transcription factors (23%) that were inhibited from binding to their binding sequence if it contained a methylated CpG site, 175 transcription factors (34%) that had enhanced binding if their binding sequence had a methylated CpG site, and 25 transcription factors (5%) were either inhibited or had enhanced binding depending on where in the binding sequence the methylated CpG was located.

TET enzymes do not specifically bind to methylcytosine except when recruited (see DNA demethylation). Multiple transcription factors important in cell differentiation and lineage specification, including NANOG, SALL4A, WT1, EBF1, PU.1, and E2A, have been shown to recruit TET enzymes to specific genomic loci (primarily enhancers) to act on methylcytosine (mC) and convert it to hydroxymethylcytosine hmC (and in most cases marking them for subsequent complete demethylation to cytosine). TET-mediated conversion of mC to hmC appears to disrupt the binding of 5mC-binding proteins including MECP2 and MBD (Methyl-CpG-binding domain) proteins, facilitating nucleosome remodeling and the binding of transcription factors, thereby activating transcription of those genes. EGR1 is an important transcription factor in memory formation. It has an essential role in brain neuron epigenetic reprogramming. The transcription factor EGR1 recruits the TET1 protein that initiates a pathway of DNA demethylation. EGR1, together with TET1, is employed in programming the distribution of methylation sites on brain DNA during brain development and in learning (see Epigenetics in learning and memory).

== Structure ==


Transcription factors are modular in structure and contain the following domains:
* DNA-binding domain (DBD), which attaches to specific sequences of DNA (enhancer or promoter. Necessary component for all vectors. Used to drive transcription of the vector&#x27;s transgene promoter sequences) adjacent to regulated genes. DNA sequences that bind transcription factors are often referred to as response elements.
* Activation domain (AD), which contains binding sites for other proteins such as transcription coregulators. These binding sites are frequently referred to as activation functions (AFs), Transactivation domain (TAD) or Trans-activating domain TAD, not to be confused with topologically associating domain (TAD).
* An optional signal-sensing domain (SSD) (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a ligand-binding domain), which senses external signals and, in response, transmits these signals to the rest of the transcription complex, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression. Also, the DBD and signal-sensing domains may reside on separate proteins that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression.

=== DNA-binding domain ===

The portion (domain) of the transcription factor that binds DNA is called its DNA-binding domain. Below is a partial list of some of the major families of DNA-binding domains/transcription factors:

=== Response elements ===

The DNA sequence that a transcription factor binds to is called a transcription factor-binding site or response element.

Transcription factors interact with their binding sites using a combination of electrostatic (of which hydrogen bonds are a special case) and Van der Waals forces. Due to the nature of these chemical interactions, most transcription factors bind DNA in a sequence specific manner. However, not all bases in the transcription factor-binding site may actually interact with the transcription factor. In addition, some of these interactions may be weaker than others. Thus, transcription factors do not bind just one sequence but are capable of binding a subset of closely related sequences, each with a different strength of interaction.

For example, although the consensus binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) is TATAAAA, the TBP transcription factor can also bind similar sequences such as TATATAT or TATATAA.

Because transcription factors can bind a set of related sequences and these sequences tend to be short, potential transcription factor binding sites can occur by chance if the DNA sequence is long enough. It is unlikely, however, that a transcription factor will bind all compatible sequences in the genome of the cell. Other constraints, such as DNA accessibility in the cell or availability of cofactors may also help dictate where a transcription factor will actually bind. Thus, given the genome sequence, it is still difficult to predict where a transcription factor will actually bind in a living cell.

Additional recognition specificity, however, may be obtained through the use of more than one DNA-binding domain (for example tandem DBDs in the same transcription factor or through dimerization of two transcription factors) that bind to two or more adjacent sequences of DNA.

== Clinical significance ==
Transcription factors are of clinical significance for at least two reasons: (1) mutations can be associated with specific diseases, and (2) they can be targets of medications.

=== Disorders ===
Due to their important roles in development, intercellular signaling, and cell cycle, some human diseases have been associated with mutations in transcription factors.

Many transcription factors are either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and, thus, mutations or aberrant regulation of them is associated with cancer. Three groups of transcription factors are known to be important in human cancer: (1) the NF-kappaB and AP-1 families, (2) the STAT family and (3) the steroid receptors.

Below are a few of the better-studied examples:

=== Potential drug targets ===
Approximately 10% of currently prescribed drugs directly target the nuclear receptor class of transcription factors. Examples include tamoxifen and bicalutamide for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer, respectively, and various types of anti-inflammatory and anabolic steroids. In addition, transcription factors are often indirectly modulated by drugs through signaling cascades. It might be possible to directly target other less-explored transcription factors such as NF-κB with drugs. Transcription factors outside the nuclear receptor family are thought to be more difficult to target with small molecule therapeutics since it is not clear that they are &quot;drugable&quot; but progress has been made on Pax2 and the notch pathway.

== Role in evolution ==
Gene duplications have played a crucial role in the evolution of species. This applies particularly to transcription factors. Once they occur as duplicates, accumulated mutations encoding for one copy can take place without negatively affecting the regulation of downstream targets. However, changes of the DNA binding specificities of the single-copy Leafy transcription factor, which occurs in most land plants, have recently been elucidated. In that respect, a single-copy transcription factor can undergo a change of specificity through a promiscuous intermediate without losing function. Similar mechanisms have been proposed in the context of all alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and the role of transcription factors in the evolution of all species.

== Role in biocontrol activity ==
The transcription factors have a role in resistance activity which is important for successful biocontrol activity. The resistant to oxidative stress and alkaline pH sensing were contributed from the transcription factor Yap1 and Rim101 of the &quot;Papiliotrema terrestris&quot; LS28 as molecular tools revealed an understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the biocontrol activity which supports disease management programs based on biological and integrated control.

== Analysis ==

There are different technologies available to analyze transcription factors. On the genomic level, DNA-sequencing and database research are commonly used. The protein version of the transcription factor is detectable by using specific antibodies. The sample is detected on a western blot. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the activation profile of transcription factors can be detected. A multiplex approach for activation profiling is a TF chip system where several different transcription factors can be detected in parallel.

The most commonly used method for identifying transcription factor binding sites is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This technique relies on chemical fixation of chromatin with formaldehyde, followed by co-precipitation of DNA and the transcription factor of interest using an antibody that specifically targets that protein. The DNA sequences can then be identified by microarray or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine transcription factor binding sites. If no antibody is available for the protein of interest, DamID may be a convenient alternative.

== Classes ==

As described in more detail below, transcription factors may be classified by their (1) mechanism of action, (2) regulatory function, or (3) sequence homology (and hence structural similarity) in their DNA-binding domains. They are also classified by 3D structure of their DBD and the way it contacts DNA.

=== Mechanistic ===

There are two mechanistic classes of transcription factors:
* General transcription factors are involved in the formation of a preinitiation complex. The most common are abbreviated as TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. They are ubiquitous and interact with the core promoter region surrounding the transcription start site(s) of all class II genes.
* Upstream transcription factors are proteins that bind somewhere upstream of the initiation site to stimulate or repress transcription. These are roughly synonymous with specific transcription factors, because they vary considerably depending on what recognition sequences are present in the proximity of the gene.

=== Functional ===

Transcription factors have been classified according to their regulatory function:
* I. Constitutive – present in all cells at all times, constantly active, all being activators. Very likely playing an important facilitating role in the transcription of many chromosomal genes, possibly in genes that seem to be always transcribed (e.g., structural proteins like tubulin and actin, and ubiquitous metabolic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)). E.g.: general transcription factors, Sp1, NF1, CCAAT
* II. Regulatory (conditionally active) – require activation.
** II.A Developmental (cell-type specific) – beginning in a fertilized egg. Once expressed, require no additional activation. E.g.:GATA, HNF, PIT-1, MyoD, Myf5, Hox, Winged Helix
** II.B Signal-dependent – may be either developmentally restricted in their expression or present in most or all cells, but all are inactive (or minimally active) until cells containing such proteins are exposed to the appropriate intra- or extracellular signal.
*** II.B.1 Extracellular ligand (endocrine or paracrine)-dependent – nuclear receptors.
*** II.B.2 Intracellular ligand (autocrine)-dependent – activated by small intracellular molecules. E.g.: SREBP, p53, orphan nuclear receptors.
*** II.B.3 Cell surface receptor-ligand interaction-dependent – activated by second messenger signaling cascades.
**** II.B.3.a Constitutive nuclear factors activated by serine phosphorylation – residing within the nucleus. The serine phosphorylation enzymes can be activated by two main routes:
***** G protein-coupled receptors upon ligand binding increase intracellular levels of second messengers (cAMP, IP3, DAG, calcium) which, in turn, activate protein serine-threonine kinase enzymes (such as PKA, PKC).
***** Receptor tyrosine kinases upon ligand binding trigger other pathways that finally terminate in serine phosphorylation of the abundant resident nuclear transcription factors.
***** Examples include: CREB, AP-1, Mef2
**** II.B.3.b Latent cytoplasmic factors – residing in the cytoplasm when inactive. Structurally and chemically very diverse group, and so are their activation pathways. E.g.: STAT, R-SMAD, NF-κB, Notch, TUBBY, NFAT

== Transcription factor databases ==
There are numerous databases cataloging information about transcription factors, but their scope and utility vary dramatically. Some may contain only information about the actual proteins, some about their binding sites, or about their target genes. Examples include the following:
* footprintDB-- a metadatabase of multiple databases, including JASPAR and others
* JASPAR: database of transcription factor binding sites for eukaryotes
* PlantTFD: Plant transcription factor database
* TcoF-DB: Database of transcription co-factors and transcription factor interactions
* TFcheckpoint: database of human, mouse and rat TF candidates
* transcriptionfactor.org (now commercial, selling reagents)
* MethMotif.org: An integrative cell-specific database of transcription factor binding motifs coupled with DNA methylation profiles.

<text>Elsa Katrine Hattestad (née Solberg; born 18 April 1966) is a retired Norwegian track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. During her career, she was a European, World, and Olympic Champion, and broke the world record twice. Her personal best, set in 2000, of 69.48 m is the Norwegian record. It also ranks her fifth on the overall list.

==Career==
Hattestad made her international debut at the 1981 European Junior Championships, finishing fifth. The following year, at the age of just 16, she competed in the European Championships for seniors. By the beginning of the 1990s, Hattestad was one of the best female javelin throwers in the world. In 1993, she won her first major international title, the World Championships in Stuttgart as well as the IAAF Golden Four. To that, she added the 1994 European title. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, she won the bronze medal. The following year, she regained the World Championships. At the 1999 World Championships, she lost the title again, finishing third, but in 2000 she won the only title missing in her career with a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Sydney.

==Personal life==
In her youth, she was a promising handball player in her country, playing for a club in the second tier of the Norwegian league system.

She has four children with her former husband Anders Hattestad. They divorced in 2017.

<text>Thebaine (paramorphine), also known as codeine methyl enol ether, is an opiate alkaloid, its name coming from the Greek Θῆβαι, &quot;Thēbai&quot; (Thebes), an ancient city in Upper Egypt. A minor constituent of opium, thebaine is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects. At high doses, it causes convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning. The synthetic enantiomer (+)-thebaine does show analgesic effects apparently mediated through opioid receptors, unlike the inactive natural enantiomer (−)-thebaine. While thebaine is not used therapeutically, it is the main alkaloid extracted from &quot;Papaver bracteatum&quot; (Iranian opium / Persian poppy) and can be converted industrially into a variety of compounds, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine, butorphanol and etorphine.

Thebaine is controlled under international law, is listed as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the United Kingdom, is controlled as an analog of a Schedule II drug per the Analog Act in the United States, and is controlled with its derivatives and salts, as a Schedule I substance of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in Canada. The 2013 US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) aggregate manufacturing quota for thebaine (ACSCN 9333) was unchanged from the previous year at 145 metric tons.

This alkaloid is biosynthetically related to salutaridine, oripavine, morphine and reticuline.

In 2012 there was an amounted 146,000 kilograms of thebaine produced. In 2013, Australia was the main producer of poppy straw rich in thebaine, followed by Spain and then France. By 2017, worldwide thebaine production dropped to 2,008 kg. Together, those three countries accounted for about 99 per cent of global production of such poppy straw. The Papaver bracteatum seed capsules are the primary source of thebaine, with the stem additionally yielding a significant amount.

The Canberra Times of 16 November 2022 reported that four batches of Hoyts brand poppy seeds were being recalled due to unusually high levels of thebaine, and that at least twelve people in New South Wales had required medical attention after ingesting them. As of 15 November 2022, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is coordinating a national recall of a number of poppy seed products due to the potential presence of thebaine.

<text>Christian theosophy, also known as Boehmian theosophy and theosophy, refers to a range of positions within Christianity that focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of divinity and the origin and purpose of the universe. They have been characterized as mystical philosophies. Theosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to illumination and salvation.

While general theosophy concerns the universal aspects of diverse esoteric traditions, including Hinduism and Buddhism, Christian theosophy is limited to Jewish and Christian elements. The founding of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob Böhme. Jewish Kabbalah was also formative for Christian theosophy from Böhme on.

In 1875, the term &quot;theosophy&quot; was adopted and revived by the Theosophical Society, an esoteric organization that spawned a spiritual movement also called Theosophy. In the 20th century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

==Etymology and terminology==
Theosophy comes from the Greek &#x27; (), which combines &#x27; (θεός), &quot;God&quot; and &quot;&quot; (), &quot;wisdom&quot;. Its etymological meaning is thus &quot;wisdom of God.&quot;

The term &quot;theosophia&quot; appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early church fathers, as a synonym for theology: the &quot;theosophoi&quot; are &quot;those knowing divine things&quot;. The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history. The adjective &quot;theosophos&quot; (θεόσοφος) &quot;wise in divine things&quot; was applied by Iamblichus to the gymnosophists (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian yogis or sadhus.

Scholars of esotericism such as Godwin and Faivre differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by Helena Blavatsky by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy. Followers of Blavatsky&#x27;s movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers. Several Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey and Franz Hartmann — were also theosophers.

Antoine Faivre suggested in 1998 that it be called &quot;Boehmian theosophy&quot;, although he himself more often uses the term Christian theosophy.

The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE. The 13th-century work &quot;Summa philosophiae&quot; attributed to Robert Grosseteste made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In the &quot;Summa&quot;, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen were described as those whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms denoted the opposite of the present-day meaning.

During the Renaissance, use of the term diverged to refer to gnostic knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits. Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of Paracelsus (1493–1541). The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century &quot;Theosophia&quot; by Johannes Arboreus provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.

==Historical development==
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Christian theosophy and Pietism arose in response to the orthodoxy of the Lutheran Reformation.

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word &quot;theosophy&quot;, even though Böhme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Böhme himself. Moreover, Böhme gave the word &quot;theosophy&quot; a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating nature with God. Böhme&#x27;s work has been described as being &quot;foundational&quot; for Christian theosophy. There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific. Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618–1699), Robert Fludd (1574–1637), John Pordage (1608–1681), Jane Leade (1623–1704), Henry More (1614–1687), Pierre Poiret (1646–1719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616–1680). Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries. In Athanasius Kircher&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot; (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to Neo-Platonism, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term &quot;theosophy&quot; was still &quot;practically absent&quot; throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century. Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century. Johann Jakob Brucker (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word &quot;theosophy&quot; was often used in conjunction with pansophy. The term &quot;theosophy&quot; is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.

In England, Robert Hindmarsh, a printer with a Methodist background, formed a &quot;Theosophical Society&quot; in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg. This society was renamed in 1785 as &quot;The British Society for the Propagation of the Doctrines of the New Church&quot;, consisting of Swedenborgian based beliefs. In France, Denis Diderot gave the word &quot;&quot; more attention than other encyclopedias of this period by including an article on it in his &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, published during the French Enlightenment. The article dealt mostly with Paracelsus and essentially plagiarized Brucker&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;.

Groups such as the Martinist Order founded by Papus in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as Vladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: &quot;although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in &#x27;integral knowledge,&#x27; what Solovyov terms &#x27;theosophy.

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that &quot;Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends.&quot;

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the &quot;theosophic current&quot; or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought (i.e., alchemy, astrology, Neo-Alexandrian Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Paracelsism—that is, the studying of the &quot;prognostications&quot; of Paracelsus—philosophia occulta and Rosicrucianism).

Faivre noted that there are &quot;obvious similarities&quot; between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier theosophy &quot;belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type&quot;, while that of modern Theosophy &quot;reveals a more universal aspect&quot;. Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences &quot;are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier&quot;. Theosophists like Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge wrote about Jakob Böhme&#x27;s philosophy. Böhme was also an important influence on the ideas of Franz Hartmann, the founder in 1886 of the German branch of the Theosophical Society. Hartmann described the writings of Böhme as “the most valuable and useful treasure in spiritual literature.”

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. Their departure point therefore may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences, and the theosopher&#x27;s aim is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. Antoine Faivre notes, &quot;the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word&#x27;s original sense of &#x27;discovering&#x27;) the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail.&quot; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy. The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

&quot;Theosophy&quot;:
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind. 
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==
The scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff described Christian theosophy as &quot;one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism&quot;.

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written. The French scholar Antoine Faivre had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl von Eckartshausen and Christian theosophy.
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre&#x27;s definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; and therefore creates an &quot;ideal&quot; type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.

<doc id="31482" wikidata="Q131251" url="?curid=31482" title="Tangent">
<text>In geometry, the tangent line (or simply tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is, intuitively, the straight line that &quot;just touches&quot; the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is tangent to the curve at a point if the line passes through the point on the curve and has slope , where &quot;f&quot;″ is the derivative of &quot;f&quot;. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

The point where the tangent line and the curve meet or intersect is called the point of tangency. The tangent line is said to be &quot;going in the same direction&quot; as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.
The tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a &quot;tangent line approximation&quot;, the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.

Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that &quot;just touches&quot; the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; .

The word &quot;tangent&quot; comes from the Latin , &quot;to touch&quot;.

==History==

Euclid makes several references to the tangent ( &quot;ephaptoménē&quot;) to a circle in book III of the &quot;Elements&quot; (c. 300 BC). In Apollonius&#x27; work &quot;Conics&quot; (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being &quot;a line such that no other straight line could fall between it and the curve&quot;.

Archimedes (c.  287 – c.  212 BC) found the tangent to an Archimedean spiral by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.

In the 1630s Fermat developed the technique of adequality to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adequality is similar to taking the difference between formula_1 and formula_2 and dividing by a power of formula_3. Independently Descartes used his method of normals based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.

These methods led to the development of differential calculus in the 17th century. Many people contributed. Roberval discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.
René-François de Sluse and Johannes Hudde found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents. Further developments included those of John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, leading to the theory of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.
An 1828 definition of a tangent was &quot;a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it&quot;. This old definition prevents inflection points from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of Leibniz, who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve; in modern terminology, this is expressed as: the tangent to a curve at a point on the curve is the limit of the line passing through two points of the curve when these two points tends to .

==Tangent line to a plane curve==
The intuitive notion that a tangent line &quot;touches&quot; a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines (secant lines) passing through two points, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at &quot;A&quot; is the limit when point &quot;B&quot; approximates or tends to &quot;A&quot;. The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as &quot;differentiability.&quot; For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which &quot;point &quot;B&quot;&quot; approaches the vertex.

At most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an &quot;inflection point&quot;. Circles, parabolas, hyperbolas and ellipses do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a cubic function, which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each period of the sine.

Conversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a triangle and not intersecting it otherwise—where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In convex geometry, such lines are called supporting lines.

===Analytical approach===
The geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the tangent line problem, was one of the central questions leading to the development of calculus in the 17th century. In the second book of his &quot;Geometry&quot;, René Descartes of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, &quot;And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know&quot;.

====Intuitive description====
Suppose that a curve is given as the graph of a function, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). To find the tangent line at the point &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)), consider another nearby point &quot;q&quot; = (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;h&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot; + &quot;h&quot;)) on the curve. The slope of the secant line passing through &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; is equal to the difference quotient

formula_4

As the point &quot;q&quot; approaches &quot;p&quot;, which corresponds to making &quot;h&quot; smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value &quot;k&quot;, which is the slope of the tangent line at the point &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;k&quot; is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:

formula_5

====More rigorous description====
To make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value &quot;k&quot;. The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit. Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at &quot;p&quot; and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near &quot;p&quot;. Then there is a unique value of &quot;k&quot; such that, as &quot;h&quot; approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to &quot;k&quot;, and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of &quot;h&quot;, if &quot;h&quot; is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function &quot;f&quot;. This limit is the derivative of the function &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;, denoted &quot;f&quot; ′(&quot;a&quot;). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:

: formula_6

Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the power function, trigonometric functions, exponential function, logarithm, and their various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.

====How the method can fail====
Calculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function &quot;f&quot; is &quot;non-differentiable&quot;. There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.

The graph &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;1/3 illustrates the first possibility: here the difference quotient at &quot;a&quot; = 0 is equal to &quot;h&quot;1/3/&quot;h&quot; = &quot;h&quot;−2/3, which becomes very large as &quot;h&quot; approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.

The graph &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2/3 illustrates another possibility: this graph has a &quot;cusp&quot; at the origin. This means that, when &quot;h&quot; approaches 0, the difference quotient at &quot;a&quot; = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of &quot;x&quot;. Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which &quot;y&quot;=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in algebraic geometry, as a &quot;double tangent&quot;.

The graph &quot;y&quot; = |&quot;x&quot;| of the absolute value function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point &quot;q&quot; approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point &quot;q&quot; approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope −1. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a &quot;corner&quot;.

Finally, since differentiability implies continuity, the contrapositive states &quot;discontinuity&quot; implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity

===Equations===
When the curve is given by &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) then the slope of the tangent is formula_7
so by the point–slope formula the equation of the tangent line at (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) is

:formula_8

where (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at formula_9.

When the curve is given by &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), the tangent line&#x27;s equation can also be found by using polynomial division to divide formula_10 by formula_11; if the remainder is denoted by formula_12, then the equation of the tangent line is given by

:formula_13

When the equation of the curve is given in the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by implicit differentiation, giving

:formula_14

The equation of the tangent line at a point (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) = 0 is then

:formula_15

This equation remains true if

:formula_16

in which case the slope of the tangent is infinite. If, however,

:formula_17

the tangent line is not defined and the point (&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) is said to be singular.
For algebraic curves, computations may be simplified somewhat by converting to homogeneous coordinates. Specifically, let the homogeneous equation of the curve be &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) = 0 where &quot;g&quot; is a homogeneous function of degree &quot;n&quot;. Then, if (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) lies on the curve, Euler&#x27;s theorem implies
formula_18
It follows that the homogeneous equation of the tangent line is

:formula_19

The equation of the tangent line in Cartesian coordinates can be found by setting &quot;z&quot;=1 in this equation.

To apply this to algebraic curves, write &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) as

:formula_20

where each &quot;u&quot;&quot;r&quot; is the sum of all terms of degree &quot;r&quot;. The homogeneous equation of the curve is then

:formula_21

Applying the equation above and setting &quot;z&quot;=1 produces

:formula_22

as the equation of the tangent line. The equation in this form is often simpler to use in practice since no further simplification is needed after it is applied.

If the curve is given parametrically by

:formula_23

then the slope of the tangent is

:formula_24

giving the equation for the tangent line at formula_25 as

:formula_26

If 

:formula_27

the tangent line is not defined. However, it may occur that the tangent line exists and may be computed from an implicit equation of the curve.

===Normal line to a curve===
The line perpendicular to the tangent line to a curve at the point of tangency is called the &quot;normal line&quot; to the curve at that point. The slopes of perpendicular lines have product −1, so if the equation of the curve is &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) then slope of the normal line is
:formula_28
and it follows that the equation of the normal line at (X, Y) is
:formula_29
Similarly, if the equation of the curve has the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 then the equation of the normal line is given by
:formula_30

If the curve is given parametrically by
:formula_23
then the equation of the normal line is
:formula_32

===Angle between curves===

The angle between two curves at a point where they intersect is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point. More specifically, two curves are said to be tangent at a point if they have the same tangent at a point, and orthogonal if their tangent lines are orthogonal.

===Multiple tangents at a point===

The formulas above fail when the point is a singular point. In this case there may be two or more branches of the curve that pass through the point, each branch having its own tangent line. When the point is the origin, the equations of these lines can be found for algebraic curves by factoring the equation formed by eliminating all but the lowest degree terms from the original equation. Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables (or by translating the curve) this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.

For example, the equation of the limaçon trisectrix shown to the right is
:formula_33
Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives
:formula_34
which, when factored, becomes
:formula_35
So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.

When the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the left and right derivatives are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve &quot;y&quot; = |&quot;x&quot; | is not differentiable at &quot;x&quot; = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes −1 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.

Sometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; 2/3, for which both the left and right derivatives at &quot;x&quot; = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation &quot;x&quot; = 0.

==Tangent line to a space curve==
==Tangent circles==

Two distinct circles lying in the same plane are said to be &quot;tangent&quot; to each other if they meet at exactly one point.

If points in the plane are described using Cartesian coordinates, then two circles, with radii formula_36 and centers formula_37 and formula_38 are tangent to each other whenever

:formula_39

The two circles are called &quot;externally tangent&quot; if the distance between their centres is equal to the sum of their radii,

:formula_40

or &quot;internally tangent&quot; if the distance between their centres is equal to the difference between their radii:

:formula_41

==Tangent plane to a surface==
The tangent plane to a surface at a given point &quot;p&quot; is defined in an analogous way to the tangent line in the case of curves. It is the best approximation of the surface by a plane at &quot;p&quot;, and can be obtained as the limiting position of the planes passing through 3 distinct points on the surface close to &quot;p&quot; as these points converge to &quot;p&quot;. Mathematically, if the surface is given by a function formula_42, the equation of the tangent plane at point formula_43 can be expressed as:

formula_44.

Here, formula_45 and formula_46 are the partial derivatives of the function formula_47 with respect to formula_48 and formula_49 respectively, evaluated at the point formula_50. In essence, the tangent plane captures the local behavior of the surface at the specific point &quot;p&quot;. It&#x27;s a fundamental concept used in calculus and differential geometry, crucial for understanding how functions change locally on surfaces.

==Higher-dimensional manifolds==

More generally, there is a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional tangent space at each point of a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional manifold in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

<text>Thomas Jonathan &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (January 21, 1824 – May 10, 1863) was a Confederate general and military officer who served during the American Civil War. He played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the eastern theater of the war until his death. Military historians regard him as one of the most gifted tactical commanders in U.S. history.

Born in what was then part of Virginia (now in West Virginia), Jackson received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, graduating in the class of 1846. He served in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Chapultepec. From 1851 to 1861, he taught at the Virginia Military Institute.

When Virginia seceded from the United States in May 1861 after the Battle of Fort Sumter, Jackson joined the Confederate States Army. He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July, providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault. Thus Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. compared him to a &quot;stone wall&quot;, which became his enduring nickname.

Jackson performed exceptionally well in various campaigns over the next two years. On May 2, 1863, he was accidentally shot by Confederate pickets. He lost his left arm to amputation. Weakened by his wounds, he died of pneumonia eight days later. Jackson&#x27;s death proved a severe setback for the Confederacy. After his death, his military exploits developed a legendary quality, becoming an important element of the pseudohistorical ideology of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot;.

==Ancestry==
Thomas Jonathan Jackson was a great-grandson of John Jackson (1715/1719–1801) and Elizabeth Cummins (also known as Elizabeth Comings and Elizabeth Needles) (1723–1828). John Jackson was an Irish Protestant from Coleraine, County Londonderry, Ireland. While living in London, England, he was convicted of the capital crime of larceny for stealing £170; the judge at the Old Bailey sentenced him to seven years penal transportation. Elizabeth, a strong, blonde woman almost tall, born in London, was also convicted of felony larceny in an unrelated case for stealing 19 pieces of silver, jewelry, and fine lace, and received a similar sentence. They both were transported on the merchant ship &quot;Litchfield&quot;, which departed London in May 1749 with 150 convicts. John and Elizabeth met on board and were in love by the time the ship arrived at Annapolis, Maryland. Although they were sent to different locations in Maryland for their bond service, the couple married in July 1755.

The family migrated west across the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle near Moorefield, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1758. In 1770, they moved farther west to the Tygart Valley. They began to acquire large parcels of virgin farming land near the present-day town of Buckhannon, including 3,000 acres (12 km2) in Elizabeth&#x27;s name. John and his two teenage sons were early recruits for the American Revolutionary War, fighting in the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780; John finished the war as captain and served as a lieutenant of the Virginia militia after 1787. While the men were in the Army, Elizabeth converted their home to a haven, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Fort&quot;, for refugees from Indian attacks.

John and Elizabeth had eight children. Their second son was Edward Jackson (1759–1828), and Edward&#x27;s third son was Jonathan Jackson, Thomas&#x27;s father. Jonathan&#x27;s mother died on April 17, 1796. Three years later, on October 13, 1799, his father married Elizabeth Wetherholt, and they had nine more children.

==Early life==

===Early childhood===
Thomas Jackson was born in the town of Clarksburg, Harrison County, Virginia, on January 21, 1824. He was the third child of Julia Beckwith (née Neale) Jackson (1798–1831) and Jonathan Jackson (1790–1826), an attorney. Both of Jackson&#x27;s parents were natives of Virginia. The family already had two young children and were living in Clarksburg, in what is now West Virginia, when Thomas was born. He was named for his maternal grandfather. There is some dispute about the actual location of Jackson&#x27;s birth. A historical marker on the floodwall in Parkersburg, West Virginia, claims that he was born in a cabin near that spot when his mother was visiting her parents who lived there. There are writings which indicate that in Jackson&#x27;s early childhood, he was called &quot;The Real Macaroni&quot;, though the origin of the nickname and whether it really existed are unclear.

Thomas&#x27;s sister Elizabeth (age six) died of typhoid fever on March 6, 1826, with two-year-old Thomas at her bedside. His father also died of typhoid fever on March 26, 1827, after nursing his daughter. Jackson&#x27;s mother gave birth to his sister Laura Ann the day after Jackson&#x27;s father died. Julia Jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with much debt and three young children (including the newborn). She sold the family&#x27;s possessions to pay the debts. She declined family charity and moved into a small rented one-room house. Julia took in sewing and opened a private school to support herself and her three young children for about four years.

In 1830, Julia Neale Jackson remarried, against the wishes of her friends. Her new husband, Captain Blake B. Woodson, an attorney, did not like his stepchildren. Warren, Julia&#x27;s eldest son, moved to live with his uncle Alfred Neale near Parkersburg, and at the age of sixteen, he was hired to teach in Upshur County. Julia moved to Fayette County with her other two children, Thomas and Laura. Julia remained in such poor health, and caring for the children was such a strain on her strength, that she agreed to let their Grandmother Jackson take them to her home in Lewis County, about four miles north of Weston, where she lived with her unmarried daughters and sons. One of these sons was sent to Fayette County to care for the children by the grandmother. When he arrived and the purpose of his visit was revealed, there was quite a commotion among the children, who were very reluctant to leave their mother. Thomas, now six years old, slipped away to the nearby woods, where he hid, only returning to the house at nightfall. After a day or two of coaxing and numerous bribes, the uncle finally persuaded the children to make the trip, which took several days, with the help of their mother. When they arrived at their destination, they became the pets of an indulgent grandmother, two maiden aunts, and several bachelor uncles, all of whom were known for their great kindness of heart and strong family attachment. Thomas and Laura were indulged in every way, and to an extent well calculated to spoil them. In August 1835, Thomas and Laura&#x27;s grandmother died.

The following year, after giving birth to Thomas&#x27;s half-brother Willam Wirt Woodson, Julia died of complications, leaving her three older children orphaned. Julia was buried in an unmarked grave in a homemade coffin in Westlake Cemetery along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in Fayette County within the corporate limits of present-day Ansted, West Virginia.

===Working and teaching at Jackson&#x27;s Mill===
As their mother&#x27;s health continued to fail, Jackson and his sister Laura Ann were sent to live with their half-uncle, Cummins Jackson, who owned a grist mill in Jackson&#x27;s Mill (near present-day Weston in Lewis County in central West Virginia). Their older brother, Warren, went to live with other relatives on his mother&#x27;s side of the family, but he later died of tuberculosis in 1841 at the age of twenty. Thomas and Laura Ann returned from Jackson&#x27;s Mill in November 1831 to be at their dying mother&#x27;s bedside. They spent four years together at the Mill before being separated—Laura Ann was sent to live with her mother&#x27;s family, Thomas to live with his Aunt Polly (his father&#x27;s sister) and her husband, Isaac Brake, on a farm four miles from Clarksburg. Thomas was treated by Brake as an outsider and, having suffered verbal abuse for over a year, ran away from the family. When his cousin in Clarksburg urged him to return to Aunt Polly&#x27;s, he replied, &quot;Maybe I ought to, ma&#x27;am, but I am not going to.&quot; He walked eighteen miles through mountain wilderness to Jackson&#x27;s Mill, where he was welcomed by his uncles and he remained there for the following seven years.

Cummins Jackson was strict with Thomas, who looked up to Cummins as a schoolteacher. Jackson helped around the farm, tending sheep with the assistance of a sheepdog, driving teams of oxen and helping harvest wheat and corn. Formal education was not easily obtained, but he attended school when and where he could. Much of Jackson&#x27;s education was self-taught. He once made a deal with one of his uncle&#x27;s slaves to provide him with pine knots in exchange for reading lessons; Thomas would stay up at night reading borrowed books by the light of those burning pine knots. Virginia law forbade teaching a slave, free black or mulatto to read or write; nevertheless, Jackson secretly taught the slave, as he had promised. Once literate, the young slave fled to Canada via the Underground Railroad. In his later years at Jackson&#x27;s Mill, Thomas served as a schoolteacher.
===Brother against sister===
The Civil War has sometimes been referred to as a war of &quot;brother against brother&quot;, but in the case of the Jackson family, it was brother against sister. Laura Jackson Arnold was close to her brother Thomas until the Civil War period. As the war loomed, she became a staunch Unionist in a somewhat divided Harrison County. She was so strident in her beliefs that she expressed mixed feelings upon hearing of Thomas&#x27;s death. One Union officer said that she seemed depressed at hearing the news, but her Unionism was stronger than her family bonds. In a letter, he wrote that Laura had said that she &quot;would rather know that he was dead than to have him a leader in the rebel army&quot;. Her Union sentiment also estranged her later from her husband, Jonathan Arnold.

==Early military career==
===West Point===
In 1842, Jackson was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Because of his inadequate schooling, he had difficulty with the entrance examinations and began his studies at the bottom of his class. Displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life, he became one of the hardest working cadets in the academy, and moved steadily up the academic rankings. Jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the Class of 1846. General Daniel Harvey Hill later remembered that Jackson&#x27;s peers at West Point had said of Jackson, &quot;If the course had been one year longer he would have graduated at the head of his class&quot;.

=== U.S. Army and the Mexican War ===
Jackson began his United States Army career as a second lieutenant in Company K of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. His unit proceeded through Pennsylvania, down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, and from there the troops embarked for Point Isabel, Texas, from where they were sent to fight in the Mexican–American War. Jackson&#x27;s unit was directed to report to General Taylor and proceed immediately via Matamoros and Camargo to Monterey and then to Saltillo. Prior to the Battle of Buena Vista, Lieutenant Jackson&#x27;s unit was ordered to withdraw from General Taylor&#x27;s army and march to the mouth of the Rio Grande, where they would be transferred to Veracruz. He served at the Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Contreras, Chapultepec, and Mexico City, eventually earning two brevet promotions, and the regular army rank of first lieutenant. It was in Mexico that Jackson first met Robert E. Lee.

During the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847, he refused what he felt was a &quot;bad order&quot; to withdraw his troops. Confronted by his superior, he explained his rationale, claiming withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel. His judgment proved correct, and a relieving brigade was able to exploit the advantage Jackson had broached. In contrast to this display of strength of character, he obeyed what he also felt was a &quot;bad order&quot; when he raked a civilian throng with artillery fire after the Mexican authorities failed to surrender Mexico City at the hour demanded by the U.S. forces. The former episode, and later aggressive action against the retreating Mexican army, earned him field promotion to the brevet rank of major.

After the war, Jackson was briefly assigned to units in New York, and later to Florida during the Second Interbellum of the Seminole Wars, during which the Americans were attempting to force the remaining Seminoles to move west. He was stationed briefly at Fort Casey before being named second-in-command at Fort Meade, a small fort about thirty miles south of Tampa. His commanding officer was Major William H. French. Jackson and French disagreed often, and filed numerous complaints against each other. Jackson stayed in Florida less than a year.

==Lexington and the Virginia Military Institute==

In the spring of 1851, Jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, or Physics, and Instructor of Artillery.

Jackson was disliked as a teacher, with his students nicknaming him &quot;Tom Fool&quot;, believing that Jackson &quot;could never be anything more than a colonel, half soldier and half preacher&quot;. He memorized his lectures and then recited them to the class. Students who came to ask for help were given the same explanation as before. If a student asked for help a second time, Jackson simply repeated the explanation slower and more deliberately. In 1856, a group of alumni attempted to have Jackson removed from his position.

The founder of VMI and one of its first two faculty members was John Thomas Lewis Preston. Preston&#x27;s second wife, Margaret Junkin Preston, was the sister of Jackson&#x27;s first wife, Elinor. In addition to working together on the VMI faculty, Preston taught Sunday School with Jackson and served on his staff during the Civil War.

===Slavery===
Jackson was not known to the white inhabitants of Lexington, instead mostly being known by many of the African Americans in town, both slaves and free blacks. In 1855, he organized Sunday School classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church. His second wife, Mary Anna Jackson, taught with Jackson, as &quot;he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children, believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race, to lift them up&quot;. The pastor, Dr. William Spottswood White, described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students: &quot;In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully. His discipline was systematic and firm, but very kind. ... His servants reverenced and loved him, as they would have done a brother or father. ... He was emphatically the black man&#x27;s friend.&quot; He addressed his students by name and they referred to him as &quot;Marse Major&quot;.

Jackson owned six slaves in the late 1850s. Three (Hetty, Cyrus, and George, a mother and two teenage sons) were received as part of the dowry at his marriage to Mary Anna Jackson. Another slave, Albert, requested that Jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom; he was employed as a waiter in one of the Lexington hotels and Jackson rented him to VMI. Amy also requested that Jackson purchase her from a public slave auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper. The sixth, Emma, was a four-year-old orphan with a learning disability, accepted by Jackson from an aged widow and presented to his second wife, Mary Anna, as a welcome-home gift. After Jackson was shot at Chancellorsville, a slave &quot;Jim Lewis, had stayed with Jackson in the small house as he lay dying&quot;. Mary Anna Jackson, in her 1895 memoir, said, &quot;our servants ... without the firm guidance and restraint of their master, the excitement of the times proved so demoralizing to them that he deemed it best for me to provide them with good homes among the permanent residents&quot;. James Robertson wrote about Jackson&#x27;s view on slavery:

===Marriages and family life===
While an instructor at VMI in 1853, Thomas Jackson married Elinor &quot;Ellie&quot; Junkin, whose father, George Junkin, was president of Washington College (later named Washington and Lee University) in Lexington. An addition was built onto the president&#x27;s residence for the Jacksons, and when Robert E. Lee became president of Washington College he lived in the same home, now known as the Lee–Jackson House. Ellie gave birth to a stillborn son on October 22, 1854, experiencing a hemorrhage an hour later that proved fatal.

After a tour of Europe, Jackson married again, in 1857. Mary Anna Morrison was from North Carolina, where her father was the first president of Davidson College. Her sister, Isabella Morrison, was married to Daniel Harvey Hill. Mary Anna had a daughter named Mary Graham on April 30, 1858, but the baby died less than a month later. Another daughter was born in 1862, shortly before her father&#x27;s death. The Jacksons named her Julia Laura, after his mother and sister.

Jackson purchased the only house he ever owned while in Lexington. Built in 1801, the brick town house at 8 East Washington Street was purchased by Jackson in 1859. He lived in it for two years before being called to serve in the Confederacy. Jackson never returned to his home.

===John Brown raid aftermath===
In November 1859, at the request of the governor of Virginia, Major William Gilham led a contingent of the VMI Cadet Corps to Charles Town to provide an additional military presence at the hanging of militant abolitionist John Brown on December 2, following his raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry on October 16. Major Jackson was placed in command of the artillery, consisting of two howitzers manned by twenty-one cadets.

==Civil War==
In April 1861, after Virginia seceded from the Union and as the American Civil War broke out, Jackson was ordered by the Governor of Virginia to report with the VMI cadet corps to Richmond and await further orders. Upon arrival, Jackson was appointed a Major of Engineers in the Provisional Army of Virginia, which was a short lived force commanded by Robert E. Lee, prior to Virginia fully augmenting into forces of the Confederacy. After Jackson protested such a low rank, the Virginia Governor appointed him a Colonel of Virginia Infantry which in May 1861 was augmented to a Colonel in the Confederate Army. Jackson then became a drill master for some of the many new recruits in the Confederate Army.

On April 27, 1861, Virginia Governor John Letcher ordered Colonel Jackson to take command at Harpers Ferry, where he would assemble and command the unit which later gained fame as the &quot;Stonewall Brigade&quot;, consisting of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 27th, and 33rd Virginia Infantry regiments. These units were from the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia, where Jackson located his headquarters throughout the first two years of the war, as well as counties in western Virginia. Jackson became known for his relentless drilling of his troops; he believed discipline was vital to success on the battlefield. Following raids on the B&amp;O Railroad on May 24, he was promoted to brigadier general on June 17, 1861. Jackson continued to wear a blue Union Army uniform up to this point, having only access to his old VMI major&#x27;s jacket, and would not be issued with a gray Confederate uniform until 1862.

===First Battle of Bull Run===

Jackson rose to prominence and earned his most famous nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861. As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault, Jackson&#x27;s brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill, demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men. While under heavy fire for several continuous hours, Jackson received a wound, breaking the middle finger of his left hand about midway between the hand and knuckle, the ball passing on the side next to the index finger. The troops of South Carolina, commanded by Gen. Barnard Elliott Bee Jr. had been overwhelmed, and he rode up to Jackson in despair, exclaiming, &quot;They are beating us back!&quot; &quot;Then,&quot; said Jackson, &quot;we will give them the bayonet!&quot; As he rode back to his command, Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, &quot;There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!&quot; There is some controversy over Bee&#x27;s statement and intent, which could not be clarified because he was killed almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Joseph E. Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson&#x27;s failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee&#x27;s and Francis S. Bartow&#x27;s brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee&#x27;s statement was meant to be pejorative: &quot;Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!&quot;

Regardless of the controversy and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson&#x27;s brigade, which would thenceforth be known as the Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson. During the battle, Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward with the palm facing forward – interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat. His hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated. After the battle, Jackson was promoted to major general (October 7, 1861) and given command of the Valley District, with headquarters in Winchester.

===Valley Campaign===

In the spring of 1862, Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac approached Richmond from the southeast in the Peninsula Campaign. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell&#x27;s large corps was poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks&#x27;s army threatened the Shenandoah Valley. Jackson was ordered by Richmond to operate in the Valley to defeat Banks&#x27;s threat and prevent McDowell&#x27;s troops from reinforcing McClellan.

Jackson possessed the attributes to succeed against his poorly coordinated and sometimes timid opponents: a combination of great audacity, excellent knowledge and shrewd use of the terrain, and an uncommon ability to inspire his troops to great feats of marching and fighting.

The campaign started with a tactical defeat at Kernstown on March 23, 1862, when faulty intelligence led him to believe he was attacking a small detachment. But it became a strategic victory for the Confederacy, because his aggressiveness suggested that he possessed a much larger force, convincing President Abraham Lincoln to keep Banks&#x27; troops in the Valley and McDowell&#x27;s 30,000-man corps near Fredericksburg, subtracting about 50,000 soldiers from McClellan&#x27;s invasion force. As it transpired, it was Jackson&#x27;s only defeat in the Valley.

By adding Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s large division and Maj. Gen. Edward &quot;Allegheny&quot; Johnson&#x27;s small division, Jackson increased his army to 17,000 men. He was still significantly outnumbered, but attacked portions of his divided enemy individually at McDowell, defeating both Brig. Gens. Robert H. Milroy and Robert C. Schenck. He defeated Banks at Front Royal and Winchester, ejecting him from the Valley. Lincoln decided that the defeat of Jackson was an immediate priority (though Jackson&#x27;s orders were solely to keep Union forces occupied and away from Richmond). He ordered Irvin McDowell to send 20,000 men to Front Royal and Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont to move to Harrisonburg. If both forces could converge at Strasburg, Jackson&#x27;s only escape route up the Valley would be cut.

After a series of maneuvers, Jackson defeated Frémont&#x27;s command at Cross Keys and Brig. Gen. James Shields at Port Republic on June 8–9. Union forces were withdrawn from the Valley.

It was a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver. Jackson pressed his army to travel in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of 60,000. Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the oxymoronic nickname &quot;foot cavalry&quot;. He became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until he was eventually eclipsed by Lee) and lifted the morale of the Southern public.

===Peninsula===
McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign toward Richmond stalled at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1. After the Valley Campaign ended in mid-June, Jackson and his troops were called to join Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia in defense of the capital. By using a railroad tunnel under the Blue Ridge Mountains and then transporting troops to Hanover County on the Virginia Central Railroad, Jackson and his forces made a surprise appearance in front of McClellan at Mechanicsville. Reports had last placed Jackson&#x27;s forces in the Shenandoah Valley; their presence near Richmond added greatly to the Union commander&#x27;s overestimation of the strength and numbers of the forces before him. This proved a crucial factor in McClellan&#x27;s decision to re-establish his base at a point many miles downstream from Richmond on the James River at Harrison&#x27;s Landing, essentially a retreat that ended the Peninsula Campaign and prolonged the war almost three more years.

Jackson&#x27;s troops served well under Lee in the series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, but Jackson&#x27;s own performance in those battles is generally considered to be poor. He arrived late at Mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle. He was late at Savage&#x27;s Station. At White Oak Swamp he failed to employ fording places to cross White Oak Swamp Creek, attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge, which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity to intervene decisively at the Battle of Glendale, which was raging nearby. At Malvern Hill Jackson participated in the futile, piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched Union infantry and massed artillery, and suffered heavy casualties (but this was a problem for all of Lee&#x27;s army in that ill-considered battle). The reasons for Jackson&#x27;s sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days are disputed, although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the Shenandoah Valley was probably a significant factor. Both Jackson and his troops were completely exhausted. An explanation for this and other lapses by Jackson was tersely offered by his colleague and brother in-law General Daniel Harvey Hill: &quot;Jackson&#x27;s genius never shone when he was under the command of another.&quot;

===Second Bull Run to Fredericksburg===

The military reputations of Lee&#x27;s corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee&#x27;s army, whereas his counterpart, James Longstreet, more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics. Jackson has been described as the army&#x27;s hammer, Longstreet its anvil. In the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862 this stereotype did not hold true. Longstreet commanded the Right Wing (later to become known as the First Corps) and Jackson commanded the Left Wing. Jackson started the campaign under Lee&#x27;s orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of Union Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia. The Hotchkiss journal shows that Jackson, most likely, originally conceived the movement. In the journal entries for March 4 and 6, 1863, General Stuart tells Hotchkiss that &quot;Jackson was entitled to all the credit&quot; for the movement and that Lee thought the proposed movement &quot;very hazardous&quot; and &quot;reluctantly consented&quot; to the movement. At Manassas Junction, Jackson was able to capture all of the supplies of the Union Army depot. Then he had his troops destroy all of it, for it was the main depot for the Union Army. Jackson then retreated and then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28–29, the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Pope launched repeated assaults against Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefield.

On August 30, Pope came to believe that Jackson was starting to retreat, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union army&#x27;s left with over 25,000 men. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope&#x27;s army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground.

When Lee decided to invade the North in the Maryland Campaign, Jackson took Harpers Ferry, then hastened to join the rest of the army at Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they fought McClellan in the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg). Antietam was primarily a defensive battle against superior odds, although McClellan failed to exploit his advantage. Jackson&#x27;s men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield and, at the end of the day, successfully resisted a breakthrough on the southern end when Jackson&#x27;s subordinate, Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill, arrived at the last minute from Harpers Ferry. The Confederate forces held their position, but the battle was extremely bloody for both sides, and Lee withdrew the Army of Northern Virginia back across the Potomac River, ending the invasion. On October 10, Jackson was promoted to lieutenant general, being ranked just behind Lee and Longstreet and his command was redesignated the Second Corps.

Before the armies camped for winter, Jackson&#x27;s Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right flank of the Confederate line at the Battle of Fredericksburg, in what became a Confederate victory. Just before the battle, Jackson was delighted to receive a letter about the birth of his daughter, Julia Laura Jackson, on November 23. Also before the battle, Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, Lee&#x27;s dashing and well-dressed cavalry commander, presented to Jackson a fine general&#x27;s frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond. Jackson&#x27;s previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements, its buttons removed by admiring ladies. Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart, saying that although the coat was too handsome for him, he would cherish it as a souvenir. His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner, which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb. Jackson was so embarrassed with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months.

===Chancellorsville===

At the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia faced a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac, led by its new commanding general, Major General Joseph Hooker. Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker&#x27;s new southern thrust – he decided to divide his forces. Jackson and his entire corps went on an aggressive flanking maneuver to the right of the Union lines. While riding with his infantry in a wide berth well south and west of the Federal line of battle, Jackson employed Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance regarding the exact location of the Union right and rear. The results were far better than even Jackson could have hoped. Fitzhugh Lee found the entire right side of the Federal lines in the middle of open field, guarded merely by two guns that faced westward, as well as the supplies and rear encampments. The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion, completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away. What happened next is given in Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s own words:

Jackson immediately returned to his corps and arranged his divisions into a line of battle to charge directly into the oblivious Federal right. The Confederates marched silently until they were merely several hundred feet from the Union position, then released a cry and full charge. Many of the Federal soldiers were captured without a shot fired, the rest were driven into a full rout. Jackson pursued back toward the center of the Federal line until dusk.

As Jackson and his staff were returning to camp on May 2, sentries of the 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment mistook the group for a Union cavalry force. The sentries shouted &quot;Halt, who goes there?&quot;, but fired before evaluating the reply; frantic shouts by Jackson&#x27;s staff identifying the party were replied to by Major John D. Barry with the retort, &quot;It&#x27;s a damned Yankee trick! Fire!&quot; A second volley was fired in response. Jackson was hit by three bullets: two in the left arm and one in the right hand. Several of Jackson&#x27;s men and many horses were killed in the attack. Incoming artillery rounds and darkness led to confusion, and Jackson was dropped from his stretcher while being evacuated. Surgeon Hunter McGuire amputated Jackson&#x27;s left arm, and Jackson was moved to Fairfield plantation at Guinea Station. Thomas Chandler, the owner, offered the use of his home for Jackson&#x27;s treatment, but Jackson suggested using Chandler&#x27;s plantation office building instead.

==Death==

Confederate General Robert E. Lee wrote Jackson after learning of Jackson&#x27;s injuries, stating: &quot;Could I have directed events, I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead.&quot; Jackson died of complications from pneumonia on May 10, 1863, eight days after he was shot.

Dr. McGuire wrote an account of Jackson&#x27;s final hours and last words:

Jackson&#x27;s fatal bullet was withdrawn, examined, and found to be 67 caliber (0.67 inches, 17 mm), a type in service with the Confederate forces; Union troops in the area were using 58 caliber balls. This was one of the first instances of forensic ballistics identification derived from a firearm projectile.

His body was moved to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Richmond for the public to mourn, and he was then moved to be buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia. The arm that was amputated on May 2 was buried separately by Jackson&#x27;s chaplain (Beverly Tucker Lacy), at the J. Horace Lacy house, &quot;Ellwood&quot;, (now preserved at the Fredericksburg National Battlefield) in the Wilderness of Orange County, near the field hospital.

Jackson&#x27;s body was buried in &quot;ordinary dress,&quot; but wearing a military coat. His coffin was draped with a Confederate flag and had a glass plate so that his face could be seen during public mourning. His funeral proceeded with great pomp: all pallbearers were generals (including James Longstreet), four white horses pulled the hearse, and a crowd two miles long followed the procession. In the course of public mourning, 20,000 people visited the body.

Upon hearing of Jackson&#x27;s death, Robert E. Lee mourned the loss of both a friend and a trusted commander. As Jackson lay dying, Lee sent a message through Chaplain Lacy, saying: &quot;Give General Jackson my affectionate regards, and say to him: he has lost his left arm but I my right.&quot; The night Lee learned of Jackson&#x27;s death, he told his cook: &quot;William, I have lost my right arm&quot;, and, &quot;I&#x27;m bleeding at the heart.&quot;

&quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; reported Jackson&#x27;s death on May 23, 1863, as follows:
==Personal life==
Jackson&#x27;s sometimes unusual command style and personality traits, combined with his frequent success in battle, contribute to his legacy as one of the greatest generals of the Civil War. He was martial and stern in attitude and profoundly religious, a deacon in the Presbyterian Church. One of his many nicknames was &quot;Old Blue Lights&quot;, a term applied to a military man whose evangelical zeal burned with the intensity of the blue light used for night-time display.

===Physical ailments===
Jackson held a lifelong belief that one of his arms was longer than the other, and thus usually held the &quot;longer&quot; arm up to equalize his circulation. He was described as a &quot;champion sleeper&quot;, and occasionally even fell asleep with food in his mouth. Jackson suffered a number of ailments, for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy, popular in America at that time, visiting establishments at Oswego, New York (1850) and Round Hill, Massachusetts (1860) although with little evidence of success. Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the U.S. Army as an artillery officer.

A recurring story concerns Jackson&#x27;s love of lemons, which he allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia (indigestion). General Richard Taylor, son of President Zachary Taylor, wrote a passage in his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: &quot;Where Jackson got his lemons &#x27;no fellow could find out,&#x27; but he was rarely without one.&quot; However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of Jackson&#x27;s contemporaries, including members of his staff, his friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons. Jackson thought of a lemon as a &quot;rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could be obtained from the enemy&#x27;s camp&quot;. Jackson was fond of all fruits, particularly peaches, &quot;but he enjoyed with relish lemons, oranges, watermelons, apples, grapes, berries, or whatever was available&quot;.

===Religion===
Jackson&#x27;s religion has often been discussed. His biographer, Robert Lewis Dabney, suggested that &quot;It was the fear of God which made him so fearless of all else.&quot; Jackson himself had said, &quot;My religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.&quot;

Stephen W. Sears states that &quot;Jackson was fanatical in his Presbyterian faith, and it energized his military thought and character. Theology was the only subject he genuinely enjoyed discussing. His dispatches invariably credited an ever-kind Providence.&quot; According to Sears, &quot;this fanatical religiosity had drawbacks. It warped Jackson&#x27;s judgment of men, leading to poor appointments; it was said he preferred good Presbyterians to good soldiers.&quot; James I. Robertson, Jr. suggests that Jackson was &quot;a Christian soldier in every sense of the word&quot;. According to Robertson, Jackson &quot;thought of the war as a religious crusade&quot;, and &quot;viewed himself as an Old Testament warrior—like David or Joshua—who went into battle to slay the Philistines&quot;.

Jackson encouraged the Confederate States Army revival that occurred in 1863, although it was probably more of a grass-roots movement than a top-down revival. Jackson strictly observed the Sunday Sabbath. James I. Robertson, Jr. notes that &quot;no place existed in his Sunday schedule for labor, newspapers, or secular conversation&quot;.

===Command style===
In command, Jackson was extremely secretive about his plans and extremely meticulous about military discipline. This secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates, who were often not aware of his overall operational intentions until the last minute, and who complained of being left out of key decisions.

Robert E. Lee could trust Jackson with deliberately undetailed orders that conveyed Lee&#x27;s overall objectives, what modern doctrine calls the &quot;end state&quot;. This was because Jackson had a talent for understanding Lee&#x27;s sometimes unstated goals, and Lee trusted Jackson with the ability to take whatever actions were necessary to implement his end state requirements. Few of Lee&#x27;s subsequent corps commanders had this ability. At Gettysburg, this resulted in lost opportunities. With a defeated and disorganized Union Army trying to regroup on high ground near town and vulnerable, Lee sent one of his new corps commanders, Richard S. Ewell, discretionary orders that the heights (Cemetery Hill and Culp&#x27;s Hill) be taken &quot;if practicable&quot;. Without Jackson&#x27;s intuitive grasp of Lee&#x27;s orders or the instinct to take advantage of sudden tactical opportunities, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault, and this failure is considered by historians to be the greatest missed opportunity of the battle.

===Horsemanship===
Jackson had a poor reputation as a horseman. One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was &quot;a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled as though it had seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his stirrup leather six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse&#x27;s back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse&#x27;s foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one.&quot; His horse was named &quot;Little Sorrel&quot; (also known as &quot;Old Sorrel&quot;), a small chestnut gelding which was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm. He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.)

===Mourning his death===
After the war, Jackson&#x27;s wife and young daughter Julia moved from Lexington to North Carolina. Mary Anna Jackson wrote two books about her husband&#x27;s life, including some of his letters. She never remarried, and was known as the &quot;Widow of the Confederacy&quot;, living until 1915. His daughter Julia married, and bore children, but she died of typhoid fever at the age of 26 years.

===Legacy===
Many theorists through the years have postulated that if Jackson had lived, Lee might have prevailed at Gettysburg. Certainly Jackson&#x27;s discipline and tactical sense were sorely missed.

As a boy, General George Patton (of World War II fame) prayed next to two portraits of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, whom he assumed were God and Jesus. He once told Dwight D. Eisenhower &quot;I will be your Jackson.&quot; General Douglas MacArthur called Robert L. Eichelberger his Stonewall Jackson. Chesty Puller idolized Jackson, and carried George Henderson&#x27;s biography of Jackson with him on campaigns. Alexander Vandegrift also idolized Jackson.

His last words, &quot;Let us cross over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees&quot; were the inspiration for the title of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;Across the River and into the Trees&quot;.

===Descendants===
Jackson&#x27;s grandson and great-grandson, both namesakes, Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian (1888–1952) and Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian Jr. (1915–1944), both graduated from West Point. The elder Christian was a career US Army officer who served during both World Wars and rose to the rank of brigadier general. Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian&#x27;s parents were William Edmund Christian and Julia Laura Christian. Julia was the daughter of Stonewall Jackson and his bride Mary Anna Morrison.

The younger Christian was a colonel in command of the 361st Fighter Group flying P-51 Mustangs in the European Theater of Operations in World War II when he was killed in action in August 1944; his personal aircraft, &quot;Lou IV&quot;, was one of the most photographed P-51s in the war.

===Commemorations===
As an important element of the ideology of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, Jackson has been commemorated in numerous ways, including with statues, currency, and postage. A poem penned during the war soon became a popular song, &quot;Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Way&quot;. The Stonewall Brigade Band is still active today.

West Virginia&#x27;s Stonewall Jackson State Park is named in his honor. Nearby, at Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s historical childhood home, his uncle&#x27;s grist mill is the centerpiece of a historical site at the Jackson&#x27;s Mill Center for Lifelong Learning and State 4-H Camp. The facility, located near Weston, serves as a special campus for West Virginia University and the WVU Extension Service.

During a training exercise in Virginia by U.S. Marines in 1921, the Marine commander, General Smedley Butler, was told by a local farmer that Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s arm was buried nearby under a granite marker, to which Butler replied, &quot;Bosh! I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong!&quot; Butler found the arm in a box under the marker. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one, and reburied the arm. He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson&#x27;s arm; the plaque is no longer on the marker but can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield Visitor Center.

Beginning in 1904 the Commonwealth of Virginia celebrated Jackson&#x27;s birthday as a state holiday; the observance was eliminated, with Election Day as a replacement holiday, effective July 2020.

Jackson is featured on the 1925 Stone Mountain Memorial half-dollar.

A Stonewall Jackson Monument was unveiled on October 11, 1919, in Richmond, Virginia. It was removed on July 1, 2020, during the 2020–2021 United States racial unrest.

<text>Tertiary education (higher education, or post-secondary education) is the educational level following the completion of secondary education.

The World Bank defines tertiary education as including universities, colleges, and vocational schools. &quot;Higher education&quot; is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education beyond secondary education is known as &quot;further education&quot; in the United Kingdom, or included under the category of &quot;continuing education&quot; in the United States.

Tertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees. Higher education represents levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the 2011 version of the International Standard Classification of Education structure. Tertiary education at a nondegree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.

UNESCO stated that tertiary education focuses on learning endeavors in specialized fields. It includes academic and higher vocational education.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on the future of work argues that given the future of work and the increasing role of technology in value chains, tertiary education is becoming even more relevant for workers to compete in the labor market.

==Definition==

Higher education, also called post-secondary education, third-level or tertiary education, is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. This consists of universities, colleges and polytechnics that offer formal degrees beyond high school or secondary school education.

The International Standard Classification of Education in 1997 initially classified all tertiary education together in the 1997 version of its schema. They were referred to as level 5 and doctoral studies at level 6. In 2011, this was refined and expanded in the 2011 version of the structure. Higher education at undergraduate level, masters and doctoral level became levels 6, 7, and 8. Nondegree level tertiary education, sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education was reordered as level 4, with level 5 for some higher courses.

In the days when few pupils progressed beyond primary education or basic education, the term &quot;higher education&quot; was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion. This is the origin of the term &quot;high school&quot; for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (United Kingdom and Australia).

== Global progress ==

Globally, the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education increased from 19% in 2000 to 38% in 2017, with the female enrollment ratio exceeding the male ratio by 4 percentage points.

The tertiary gross enrollment ratio ranges from 9% in low-income countries to 77% in high-income countries, where, after rapid growth in the 2000s, reached a plateau in the 2010s.

Between now and 2030, the biggest increase in tertiary enrollment ratios is expected in middle-income countries, where it will reach 52%. Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) commits countries to providing lifelong learning opportunities for all, including tertiary education.

This commitment is monitored through the global indicator for target 4.3 in the sustainable development goal 4 (SDG 4), which measures the participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, whether for work or non-work purposes.

===The right of access to higher education===
The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments. The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that &quot;higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education&quot;. In Europe, Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education.

===Criticism===
In 1994, the UNESCO Salamanca Statement called on the international community to endorse the approach of inclusive education, including at the tertiary level. Since this time the world has witnessed the global massification of tertiary education, yet this explosion of facilities and enrollment has largely entrenched and exacerbated the exclusion of people with disabilities. This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income contexts, where university completion rates for students with disabilities are much lower compared to completion rates of students without disabilities.

Some tertiary schools have been criticized as having permitted or actively encouraged grade inflation. In addition, certain scholars contend that the supply of graduates in some fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, aggravating graduate unemployment, underemployment and credentialism.

==Influence on views==
Graduates of tertiary education are likely to have different worldviews and moral values than non-graduates. Research indicates that graduates are more likely to have libertarian principles with less adherence to social hierarchies. Graduates are also more likely to embrace cultural and ethnic diversity and express more positive views towards minority groups. For international relationships, graduates are more likely to favor openness, supporting policies like free trade, open borders, the European Union, and more liberal policies regarding international migration.

==Providers==
In the U.S., higher education is provided by universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, conservatories, and institutes of technology, and certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, universities of applied sciences, trade schools, and other career-based colleges that award degrees. Tertiary education at a nondegree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.

Higher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work, as exists in medical schools and dental schools, and social services activities of universities.
Within the realm of teaching, it includes both the &quot;undergraduate&quot; level, and beyond that, &quot;graduate-level&quot; (or &quot;postgraduate&quot; level). The latter level of education is often referred to as graduate school, especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, fluency in speaking and writing, problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.

===Recognition of studies===
The Lisbon Recognition Convention stipulates that degrees and periods of study must be recognised in all of the Signatory Parties of the convention.
== History ==


The oldest known institutions of higher education are credited to Dynastic Egypt, with Pr-Anx (houses of life) built as libraries and scriptoriums, containing works on law, architecture, mathematics, and medicine, and involved in the training of &quot;swnw&quot; and &quot;swnwt&quot; (male and female doctors); extant Egyptian papyri from the 3rd millennia BC are in several collections.

In the Greek world, Plato&#x27;s Academy ( - 86 BC), Aristotle&#x27;s Lyceum ( - 86 BC) and other philosophical-mathematical schools became models for other establishments, particularly in Alexandria of Egypt, under the Ptolemies.

In South Asia, the city of Taxila, later the great Buddhist monastery of Nalanda ( - 1197 CE), attracted students and professors even from distant regions.

In China, the Han dynasty established chairs to teach the Five Confucean Classics, in the Grand School, Taixue (), to train cadres for the imperial administration. All these higher-learning institutions became models for other schools within their sphere of cultural influence.

In 425 CE, the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II innovated as he established the Pandidakterion, with a faculty of 31 professors, to train public servants. In the 7th and 8th centuries, &quot;cathedral schools&quot; were created in Western Europe. Meanwhile, the first Medresahs were founded in the Moslem empire – initially mere primary schools in the premises of major mosques, which gradually evolved toward secondary, later higher education. However high the intellectual level of these schools could be, it would be anachronistic to call them &quot;universities&quot;. Their organization and purposes were markedly different from the corporations of students and teachers, independent from both the Church and the State, which established themselves from the 12th century in Western Europe as &quot;Universitas Studiorum&quot;.
According to UNESCO and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco is the oldest existing continually operating higher educational institution in the world. and is occasionally referred to as the oldest university by scholars. Undoubtedly, there are older institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Ez-Zitouna in Montfleury, Tunis, was first established in 737. The University of Bologna, Italy, founded in 1088, is the world&#x27;s oldest university in continuous operation, and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute, as the word &quot;universitas&quot; was coined at its foundation. 

===20th century===
Since World War II, developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent. In many developed countries, participation in higher education has continued to increase towards universal or, what Trow later called, open access, where over half of the relevant age group participate in higher education. Higher education is important to national economies, both as an industry, in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy. College educated workers have commanded a measurable wage premium and are much less likely to become unemployed than less educated workers.

===21st century===
In recent years, universities have been criticized for permitting or actively encouraging grade inflation. Widening participation can increase the supply of graduates in individual fields of study over the demand for their skills, aggravating graduate unemployment, underemployment, overqualification and educational inflation. Some commentators have suggested that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education is rapidly making certain aspects of the traditional higher education system obsolete. The Israeli-funded Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy and some Israeli media have claimed that involvement and funding by Qatar in higher education in the US has resulted in what they regard as growing anti-Semitism on campuses, in particular in connection with Israel–Hamas war protests.

==Statistics==
The total expenditure on tertiary education (ISCED levels 5 to 8) as a percentage of GDP for individual countries is shown in the following table
The percentage of adults who have attained individual tertiary education levels by country is shown in the following table.

A 2014 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development states that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men. Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25–34 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55–64), were being educated at university.

== United Kingdom ==
Under devolution in the United Kingdom, education is administered separately in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. In England, the term &quot;tertiary education&quot; aligns with the global term &quot;higher education&quot; (i.e. post-18 study). In 2018 the Welsh Government adopted the term &quot;tertiary education&quot; to refer to post-16 education and training in Wales. Since the 1970s, however, specialized further education colleges in England and Wales have called themselves &quot;tertiary colleges&quot; although being part of the secondary education process. These institutions cater for both school leavers and adults, thus combining the main functions of an FE college and a sixth form college. Generally, district councils with such colleges have adopted a tertiary system or structure where a single local institution provides all the 16–19 and adult education, and where schools do not universally offer sixth forms (i.e. schools only serve ages 11–16). However the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 has effectively prevented the creation of new tertiary colleges.

==Canada==


== Australia ==
Within Australia &quot;tertiary education&quot; refers to continuing studies after a student completes secondary school. Tertiary education options include universities, technical and further education (TAFE) or private universities.

== United States ==

The higher education system in the United States is decentralized and regulated independently by each state with accreditors playing a key role in ensuring institutions meet minimum standards. It is large and diverse with institutions that are privately governed and institutions that are owned and operated by state and local governments. Some private institutions are affiliated with religious organizations whereas others are secular with enrollment ranging from a few dozen to tens of thousands of students. The United States Department of Education presents a broad-spectrum view of tertiary education and detailed information on the nation&#x27;s educational structure, accreditation procedures, and connections to state as well as federal agencies and entities.

The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education provides one framework for classifying U.S. colleges and universities in several different ways. US tertiary education also includes various non-profit organizations promoting professional development of individuals in the field of higher education and helping expand awareness of related issues like international student services and complete campus internationalization.

== European Union ==
Although tertiary education in the EU includes university, it can differ from country to country.

=== France ===
After going to nursery school (French: école maternelle), elementary school (French: école primaire), middle school (French: collège), and high school (French: lycée), a student may go to university, but may also stop at that point.

===Italy===
Education in Italy is compulsory from 6 to 16 years of age, and is divided into five stages: kindergarten (&quot;scuola dell&#x27;infanzia&quot;), primary school (&quot;scuola primaria&quot; or &quot;scuola elementare&quot;), lower secondary school (&quot;scuola secondaria di primo grado&quot; or &quot;scuola media inferiore&quot;), upper secondary school (&quot;scuola secondaria di secondo grado&quot; or &quot;scuola media superiore&quot;) and university (&quot;università&quot;). Education is free in Italy and free education is available to children of all nationalities who are residents in Italy. Italy has both a private and public education system.

Italy has a large and international network of public or state-affiliated universities and schools offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Italy constitute the main percentage of tertiary education in Italy and are managed under the supervision of Italian&#x27;s Ministry of Education.

Italian universities are among the oldest universities in the world; the University of Bologna (founded in 1088) notably, is the oldest one ever; also, University of Naples Federico II are is the world&#x27;s oldest state-funded university in continuous operation. Most universities in Italy are state-supported. 33 Italian universities were ranked among the world&#x27;s top 500 in 2019, the third-largest number in Europe after the United Kingdom and Germany.

There are also a number of Superior Graduate Schools (&quot;Grandes écoles&quot;) or &quot;Scuola Superiore Universitaria&quot;, which offer officially recognized titles, including the &quot;Diploma di Perfezionamento&quot; equivalent to a Doctorate, &quot;Dottorato di Ricerca&quot; i.e. Research Doctorate or &quot;Doctor Philosophiae&quot; i.e. PhD. Some of them also organize master&#x27;s degree courses. There are three Superior Graduate Schools with &quot;university status&quot;, three institutes with the status of Doctoral Colleges, which function at graduate and post-graduate level. Nine further schools are direct offshoots of the universities (i.e. do not have their own &#x27;university status&#x27;). The first one is the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (founded in 1810 by Napoleon as a branch of École Normale Supérieure), taking the model of organization from the famous École Normale Supérieure. These institutions are commonly referred to as &quot;Schools of Excellence&quot; (i.e. &quot;Scuole di Eccellenza&quot;).

Italy hosts a broad variety of universities, colleges and academies. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologna is likely the oldest in the world. In 2009, the University of Bologna is, according to The Times, the only Italian college in the top 200 World Universities. Milan&#x27;s Bocconi University has been ranked among the top 20 best business schools in the world by The Wall Street Journal international rankings, especially thanks to its M.B.A. program, which in 2007 placed it no. 17 in the world in terms of graduate recruitment preference by major multinational companies. Bocconi was also ranked by Forbes as the best worldwide in the specific category Value for Money. In May 2008, Bocconi overtook several traditionally top global business schools in the Financial Times Executive education ranking, reaching no. 5 in Europe and no. 15 in the world.

Other top universities and polytechnics are the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, the LUISS in Rome, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the Politecnico di Milano (which in 2011 was ranked as the 48th best technical university in the world by QS World University Rankings), the University of Rome La Sapienza (which in 2005 was Europe&#x27;s 33rd best university, and ranks among Europe&#x27;s 50 and the world&#x27;s 150 best colleges and in 2013, the Center for World University Rankings ranked the Sapienza University of Rome 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its &quot;World University Rankings&quot;.) and the University of Milan (whose research and teaching activities have developed over the years and have received important international recognition). This university is the only Italian member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), a prestigious group of twenty research-intensive European Universities. It has also been awarded ranking positions such as 1st in Italy and 7th in Europe (The Leiden Ranking – Universiteit Leiden).

<doc id="31489" wikidata="Q901979" url="?curid=31489" title="Trimix (breathing gas)">
<text>Trimix is a breathing gas consisting of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen. It is used in deep commercial diving, during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques, and in advanced recreational diving.

The helium is included as a substitute for some of the nitrogen, to reduce the narcotic effect of the breathing gas at depth and to reduce the work of breathing. With a mixture of three gases it is possible to create mixes suitable for different depths or purposes by adjusting the proportions of each gas. Oxygen content can be optimised for the depth to limit the risk of toxicity, and the inert component balanced between nitrogen (which is cheap but narcotic) and helium (which is not narcotic and reduces work of breathing, but is more expensive and can increase heat loss).

The mixture of helium and oxygen with a 0% nitrogen content is generally known as heliox. This is frequently used as a breathing gas in deep commercial diving operations, where it is often recycled to save the expensive helium component. Analysis of two-component gases is much simpler than three-component gases.

== Function of the helium ==
The main reason for adding helium to the breathing mix is to reduce the proportions of nitrogen and oxygen below those of air, to allow the gas mix to be breathed safely on deep dives. A lower proportion of nitrogen is required to reduce nitrogen narcosis and other physiological effects of the gas at depth. Helium has very little narcotic effect. A lower proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of oxygen toxicity on deep dives.

The lower density of helium reduces breathing resistance at depth. Work of breathing can limit the use of breathing gas mixtures in underwater breathing apparatus, as with increasing depth a point may be reached where work of breathing exceeds the available effort from the diver. Beyond this point accumulation of carbon dioxide will eventually result in severe and debilitating hypercapnia, which, if not corrected quickly, will cause the diver to attempt to breathe faster, exacerbating the work of breathing, which will lead to loss of consciousness and a high risk of drowning.

Because of its low molecular weight, helium enters and leaves tissues by diffusion more rapidly than nitrogen as the pressure is increased or reduced (this is called on-gassing and off-gassing). Because of its lower solubility, helium does not load tissues as heavily as nitrogen, but at the same time the tissues can not support as high an amount of helium when super-saturated. In effect, helium is a faster gas to saturate and desaturate, which is a distinct advantage in saturation diving, but less so in bounce diving, where the increased rate of off-gassing is largely counterbalanced by the equivalently increased rate of on-gassing.

Some divers suffer from compression arthralgia during deep descent, and trimix has been shown to help avoid or delay the symptoms of compression arthralgia.

==Disadvantages of the helium==
Helium conducts heat six times faster than air, so helium-breathing divers often carry a separate supply of a different gas to inflate drysuits. This is to avoid the risk of hypothermia caused by using helium as inflator gas. Argon, carried in a small, separate tank connected only to the inflator of the drysuit, is preferred to air, since air conducts heat 50% faster than argon. Dry suits (if used together with a buoyancy compensator) still require a minimum of inflation to avoid &quot;squeezing&quot;, i.e. damage to skin caused by pinching by tight dry suit folds.

Helium dissolves into tissues (this is called on-gassing) more rapidly than nitrogen as the ambient pressure is increased. A consequence of the higher loading in some tissues is that many decompression algorithms require deeper decompression stops than a similar pressure exposure dive using air, and helium is more likely to come out of solution and cause decompression sickness following a fast ascent.

In addition to physiological disadvantages, the use of trimix also has economic and logistic disadvantages. The price of helium increased by over 51% between the years 2000 and 2011. This price increase affects open-circuit divers more than closed-circuit divers due to the larger volume of helium consumed on a typical trimix dive. Additionally, as trimix fills require more expensive analysis equipment than air and nitrox fills, there are fewer trimix filling stations. The relative scarcity of trimix filling stations may necessitate going far out of one&#x27;s way in order to procure the necessary mix for a deep dive that requires the gas.

==Advantages of controlling the oxygen fraction==
Lowering the oxygen content of a breathing gas mixture increases the maximum operating depth and duration of the dive before which oxygen toxicity becomes a limiting factor. Most trimix divers limit their working oxygen partial pressure [PO2] to 1.4 bar and may reduce the PO2 further to 1.3 bar or 1.2 bar depending on the depth, the duration and the kind of breathing system used. A maximum oxygen partial pressure of 1.4 bar for the active sectors of the dive, and 1.6 bar for decompression stops is recommended by several recreational and technical diving certification agencies for open circuit, and 1.2 bar or 1.3 bar as maximum for the active sectors of a dive on closed-circuit rebreather. Increasing the oxygen fraction in a trimix to be used as a decompression gas can accelerate decompression with a lowered risk of isobaric counter diffusion complications.

==Advantages of keeping some nitrogen in the mix==
Retaining nitrogen in trimix can contribute to the prevention of High Pressure Nervous Syndrome, a problem that can occur when breathing heliox at depths beyond about . Nitrogen is also much less expensive than helium.

==Naming conventions==

The term trimix implies that the gas has three functional components, which are helium, nitrogen and oxygen. Since the nitrogen and all or part of the oxygen is usually provided from air, the other components of ordinary atmospheric air are generally ignored. Conventionally, the composition of a mix is specified by its oxygen percentage, helium percentage and optionally the balance percentage, nitrogen, in that order. For example, a mix named &quot;trimix 10/70&quot; or trimix 10/70/20, consisting of 10% oxygen, 70% helium, 20% nitrogen is suitable for a dive. Hyperoxic trimix is sometimes referred to as Helitrox, TriOx, or HOTx (High Oxygen Trimix) with the &quot;x&quot; in HOTx representing the mixture&#x27;s fraction of helium as a percentage.

The basic term Trimix is sufficient, modified as appropriate with the terms hypoxic, normoxic and hyperoxic, and the usual forms for indicating constituent gas fraction, to describe any possible ratio of gases, but the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) uses the term &quot;helitrox&quot; for hyperoxic 26/17 Trimix, i.e. 26% oxygen, 17% helium, 57% nitrogen. Helitrox requires decompression stops similar to Nitrox-I (EAN32) and has a maximum operating depth of , where it has an equivalent narcotic depth of . This allows diving throughout the usual recreational range, while decreasing decompression obligation and narcotic effects compared to air. GUE and UTD also promote hyperoxic trimix for this depth range, but prefer the term &quot;TriOx&quot;.

The use of trimix as a breathing gas while diving is called trimix diving, and is a sub-category of mixed gas diving, also sometimes referred to simply as gas diving.

==Applications==
In open-circuit scuba, two classes of trimix are commonly used: &quot;&quot; trimix—with a minimum PO2 at the surface of 0.18 and &quot;&quot; trimix—with a PO2 less than 0.18 at the surface. A hypoxic mix such as &quot;19/30&quot; is used in the depth range; a hypoxic mix such as &quot;10/50&quot; is used for deeper diving, as a bottom gas only, and cannot safely be breathed at shallow depths where the PO2 is less than 0.18 bar.

In fully closed-circuit rebreathers that use trimix diluents, the mix in the breathing loop can be &quot;&quot; (meaning more oxygen than in air, as in enriched air nitrox) in shallow water, because the rebreather automatically adds oxygen to maintain a specific partial pressure of oxygen. Hyperoxic trimix is also sometimes used on open circuit scuba, to reduce decompression obligations.

==Blending==
Gas blending of trimix generally involves mixing helium and oxygen with air to the desired proportions and pressure. Two methods are in common use:

Partial pressure blending is done by decanting oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then topping up the mix with air from a diving air compressor. To ensure an accurate mix, after each helium and oxygen transfer, the mix is allowed to cool, its pressure is measured and further gas is decanted until the correct pressure is achieved. This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations. Corrections can be made for temperature effect, but this requires accurate monitoring of the temperature of the mixture inside the cylinder, which is generally not available.

A second method called &#x27;continuous blending&#x27; is done by mixing oxygen and helium into the intake air of a compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into mixing tubes in the intake air stream using flow meters or analysis of the oxygen content after oxygen addition and before and after the helium addition, and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator or bleed orifice is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made. The benefit of such a system is that the helium delivery tank pressure need not be as high as that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be &#x27;topped up&#x27; to best mix after the dive. This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium. Drawbacks may be that the high heat of compression of helium results in the compressor overheating, especially in hot weather. Temperature of the trimix entering the analyser should be kept constant for best reliability of the analysis, and the analyser should be calibrated at ambient temperature before use. The mixing tube is a very simple device, and DIY versions of the continuous blend units can be made for a relatively low cost compared to the cost of analysers and compressor.

===Choice of mixture composition===

The ratio of gases in a particular mix is chosen to give a safe maximum operating depth and comfortable equivalent narcotic depth for the planned dive. Safe limits for mix of gases in trimix are generally accepted to be a maximum partial pressure of oxygen (PO2—see Dalton&#x27;s law) of 1.0 to 1.6 bar and maximum equivalent narcotic depth of . At , &quot;12/52&quot; has a PO2 of 1.3 bar and an equivalent narcotic depth of .

===&quot;Standard&quot; mixes===
Although theoretically trimix can be blended with almost any combination of helium and oxygen, a number of &quot;standard&quot; mixes have evolved (such as 21/35, 18/45 and 15/55—see &quot;Naming conventions&quot;). Most of these mixes originated from starting by decanting a given pressure of helium into an empty cylinder, and then topping up the mix with 32% nitrox. The &quot;standard&quot; mixes evolved because of three coinciding factors — the desire to keep the equivalent narcotic depth (END) of the mix at approximately , the requirement to keep the partial pressure of oxygen at 1.4 ATA or below at the deepest point of the dive, and the fact that many dive shops stored standard 32% nitrox in banks, which simplifies mixing. The use of standard mixes makes it relatively easy to top up diving cylinders after a dive using residual mix — only helium and banked nitrox are needed to top up the residual gas from the last fill.

The method of mixing a known nitrox mix with helium allows analysis of the fractions of each gas using only an oxygen analyser, since the ratio of the oxygen fraction in the final mix to the oxygen fraction in the initial nitrox gives the fraction of nitrox in the final mix, hence the fractions of the three components are easily calculated. It is demonstrably true that the END of a nitrox-helium mixture at its maximum operating depth (MOD) is equal to the MOD of the nitrox alone.

====Heliair====

Heliair is a breathing gas consisting of mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and helium and is often used during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques. This term, first used by Sheck Exley, is mostly used by Technical Diving International (TDI).

It is easily blended from helium and air and so has a fixed 21:79 ratio of oxygen to nitrogen with the balance consisting of a variable amount of helium. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;poor man&#x27;s trimix&quot;, because it is much easier to blend than trimix blends with variable oxygen content, since all that is required is to insert the requisite partial pressure of helium, and then top up with air from a conventional compressor. The more complicated (and dangerous) step of adding pure oxygen at pressure required to blend trimix is absent when blending heliair.

Heliair blends are similar to the standard Trimix blends made with helium and Nitrox 32, but with a deeper END at MOD.
Heliair will always have less than 21% oxygen, and will be hypoxic (less than 17% oxygen) for mixes with more than 20% helium.

==History as a diving gas==

*1919: Professor Elihu Thomson speculates that helium could be used instead of nitrogen to reduce the breathing resistance at great depth. Heliox was used with air tables resulting in a high incidence of decompression sickness, so the use of helium was discontinued.
*1924: The US Navy begins examining helium&#x27;s potential usage and by the mid-1920s lab animals were exposed to experimental chamber dives using heliox. Soon, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) had been successfully decompressed from deep dives.
*1937: Several test dives are conducted with helium mixtures, including salvage diver Max &quot;Gene&quot; Nohl&#x27;s dive to 127 meters.
*1939: US Navy uses heliox in USS &quot;Squalus&quot; salvage operation. Heliox usage, coupled with the absence of decrement in co-ordination and cognitive function in the salvage divers, confirms Behnke&#x27;s theory of nitrogen narcosis.
*1965: Nic Flemming&#x27;s work to study sand ribbons in the English Channel becomes the first to compare diver performance while breathing air and heliox in the open water.
*1963: First saturation dives using trimix as part of Project Genesis.
*1970: Hal Watts recovers two bodies at Mystery Sink (126 m).
*1979: A research team headed by Peter B. Bennett at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory begins the &quot;Atlantis Dive Series&quot; which proves the mechanisms behind the use of trimix to prevent High Pressure Nervous Syndrome symptoms.
*1983: Cave diver Jochen Hasenmayer uses heliox to a depth of 212 meters. Depth is later repeated by Sheck Exley in 1987.
*1987: First mass use of trimix and heliox: Wakulla Springs Project. Exley teaches non-commercial divers in relation to trimix usage in cave diving.
*1991: Billy Deans commences teaching of trimix diving for recreational diving. Tom Mount develops first trimix training standards (IANTD). Use of trimix spreads rapidly to North East American wreck diving community.
*1992: The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) develops &quot;Monitor Mix&quot; for dives to the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;. This mix became NOAA Trimix I, with decompression tables designed by Bill Hamilton published in the NOAA Diving Manual.
*1992: NOAA obtains training from Key West Divers to conduct the first NOAA-sponsored trimix dives on the wreck of the USS &quot;Monitor&quot; off Cape Hatteras, NC.
*1994: Combined UK/USA team, including wreck divers John Chatterton and Gary Gentile, successfully completes a series of wreck dives on the &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot; expedition to a depth of 100 meters using trimix.
*1994: Sheck Exley and Jim Bowden use &quot;heliair&quot; at Zacaton in the first attempt to make an open circuit scuba dive to 1000 ft. Exley, at the time holding the world record for an 881-foot dive, passes out and dies around 900 feet; Bowden aborts at 925 feet and survives despite several life-threatening obstacles.
*2001: John Bennett becomes the first scuba diver to dive to , using trimix.
*2005: David Shaw sets depth record for using a trimix rebreather, and dies while repeating the dive to attempt to recover the body of another diver.
*2015: The United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit shows that bounce dives using trimix are not more decompression efficient than dives on heliox.

==Training and certification==

Technical diver training and certification agencies may differentiate between levels of trimix diving qualifications, The usual distinction is between normoxic trimix and hypoxic trimix, sometimes also called full trimix. The basic distinction is that for hypoxic trimix diving the dive cannot be started on the bottom mix, and procedures for use of a &quot;travel mix&quot; for the first part of the descent, and gas switching during the descent to avoid oxygen toxicity are added to the required skills. Longer decompression using a larger variety of mixtures may also complicate procedures. In closed circuit rebreather diving, use of a hypoxic diluent prevents the diver from conducting a diluent flush at shallow depths while breathing from the loop, so that it remains possible at the maximum depth of the dive, where it may be more critical.

<text>Theoretical chemistry is the branch of chemistry which develops theoretical generalizations that are part of the theoretical arsenal of modern chemistry: for example, the concepts of chemical bonding, chemical reaction, valence, the surface of potential energy, molecular orbitals, orbital interactions, and molecule activation.

==Overview==
Theoretical chemistry unites principles and concepts common to all branches of chemistry. Within the framework of theoretical chemistry, there is a systematization of chemical laws, principles and rules, their refinement and detailing, the construction of a hierarchy. The central place in theoretical chemistry is occupied by the doctrine of the interconnection of the structure and properties of molecular systems. It uses mathematical and physical methods to explain the structures and dynamics of chemical systems and to correlate, understand, and predict their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. In the most general sense, it is explanation of chemical phenomena by methods of theoretical physics. In contrast to theoretical physics, in connection with the high complexity of chemical systems, theoretical chemistry, in addition to approximate mathematical methods, often uses semi-empirical and empirical methods.

In recent years, it has consisted primarily of quantum chemistry, i.e., the application of quantum mechanics to problems in chemistry. Other major components include molecular dynamics, statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions, reaction networks, polymerization, catalysis, molecular magnetism and spectroscopy.

Modern theoretical chemistry may be roughly divided into the study of chemical structure and the study of chemical dynamics. The former includes studies of: electronic structure, potential energy surfaces, and force fields; vibrational-rotational motion; equilibrium properties of condensed-phase systems and macro-molecules. Chemical dynamics includes: bimolecular kinetics and the collision theory of reactions and energy transfer; unimolecular rate theory and metastable states; condensed-phase and macromolecular aspects of dynamics.

== Branches of theoretical chemistry ==
;Quantum chemistry: The application of quantum mechanics or fundamental interactions to chemical and physico-chemical problems. Spectroscopic and magnetic properties are between the most frequently modelled.
;Computational chemistry:The application of scientific computing to chemistry, involving approximation schemes such as Hartree–Fock, post-Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, semiempirical methods (such as PM3) or force field methods. Molecular shape is the most frequently predicted property. Computers can also predict vibrational spectra and vibronic coupling, but also acquire and Fourier transform Infra-red Data into frequency information. The comparison with predicted vibrations supports the predicted shape.
;Molecular modelling: Methods for modelling molecular structures without necessarily referring to quantum mechanics. Examples are molecular docking, protein-protein docking, drug design, combinatorial chemistry. The fitting of shape and electric potential are the driving factor in this graphical approach.
;Molecular dynamics: Application of classical mechanics for simulating the movement of the nuclei of an assembly of atoms and molecules. The rearrangement of molecules within an ensemble is controlled by Van der Waals forces and promoted by temperature.
;Molecular mechanics: Modeling of the intra- and inter-molecular interaction potential energy surfaces via potentials. The latter are usually parameterized from ab initio calculations.
;Mathematical chemistry: Discussion and prediction of the molecular structure using mathematical methods without necessarily referring to quantum mechanics. Topology is a branch of mathematics that allows researchers to predict properties of flexible finite size bodies like clusters.
;Chemical kinetics: Theoretical study of the dynamical systems associated to reactive chemicals, the activated complex and their corresponding differential equations.
;Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics): The use of computer and informational techniques, applied to crop information to solve problems in the field of chemistry.
;Chemical engineering: The application of chemistry to industrial processes to conduct research and development. This allows for development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes.
;Chemical thermodynamics: The study of the relationship between heat, work, and energy in chemical reactions and processes, with focus on entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy to understand reaction spontaneity and equilibrium.
;Statistical mechanics: The application of statistical mechanics to predict and explain thermodynamic properties of chemical systems, connecting molecular behavior with macroscopic properties.

== Closely related disciplines ==

Historically, the major field of application of theoretical chemistry has been in the following fields of research:
*Atomic physics: The discipline dealing with electrons and atomic nuclei.
*Molecular physics: The discipline of the electrons surrounding the molecular nuclei and of movement of the nuclei. This term usually refers to the study of molecules made of a few atoms in the gas phase. But some consider that molecular physics is also the study of bulk properties of chemicals in terms of molecules.
*Physical chemistry and chemical physics: Chemistry investigated via physical methods like laser techniques, scanning tunneling microscope, etc. The formal distinction between both fields is that physical chemistry is a branch of chemistry while chemical physics is a branch of physics. In practice this distinction is quite vague. 
*Many-body theory: The discipline studying the effects which appear in systems with large number of constituents. It is based on quantum physics – mostly second quantization formalism – and quantum electrodynamics.

Hence, theoretical chemistry has emerged as a branch of research. With the rise of the density functional theory and other methods like molecular mechanics, the range of application has been extended to chemical systems which are relevant to other fields of chemistry and physics, including biochemistry, condensed matter physics, nanotechnology or molecular biology.

<text>The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World () is a book by Danish author and statistician Bjørn Lomborg which focuses on the author&#x27;s view of environmental economics and issues. It was first published in Danish in 1998 by Centrum, and in English by Cambridge University Press in 2001.

Lomborg was inspired by an interview with economist Julian Lincoln Simon to undertake an assessment of publicly available data, and published his findings as a series of articles in &quot;Politiken&quot;. These formed the basis of the book, in which Lomborg argues against a range of what he considers overly pessimistic claims about environmental issues and their impact on human prosperity. Lomborg argues that environmentalists&#x27; concerns over pollution, environmental degradation, decline in natural resources, and climate change are overstated, and outlines his opposition to policy responses like the Kyoto Protocol, deeming them insufficient and causing more harm than good based on cost–benefit analysis. He argues in favour of focus instead being channelled to poverty reduction and combating diseases.

The book generated great controversy and negative reviews upon its release. Lomborg&#x27;s assertions, methodology and representation of sources were criticised by scientists and groups both in Denmark and internationally. Positive reception in some popular media outlets contrasted sharply with this, and this combined with the ensuing debate aided the book&#x27;s profile.

The author was formally investigated by the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) for scientific dishonesty, which confirmed the accusation and lack of expertise in relevant fields used in the book. The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation criticised procedural aspects drawn by the DCSD, though decided not to reinvestigate. &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; established Lomborg&#x27;s profile as an opponent of the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2007, Lomborg published a follow-up work titled &quot;Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist&#x27;s Guide to Global Warming&quot;.

== Background ==

The book was written by Bjørn Lomborg, a Danish statistician who worked at Aarhus University. The ideas and writing for the book began in the 1990s. He was inspired by an interview with Julian Lincoln Simon which was published in the magazine &quot;Wired&quot;, in which Simon claimed that calculations he had conducted with publicly available data led him to conclude that standard doomsday conceptions of the state of the world were incorrect. He assumed Simon&#x27;s views were the product of his American conservative thinking, but in 1997, Lomborg undertook a similar assessment with some of his students and came to similar conclusions as Simon. 

In 1998, Lomborg published four articles in the Danish newspaper, &quot;Politiken,&quot; outlining his research and study. These attracted media coverage and controversy in Denmark. These findings were published as a book in Danish on 22 September 1998 as &quot;Verdens Sande Tilstand&quot; (&quot;The True State of the World&quot;) by Centrum. and as &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; in English, by Cambridge University Press in 2001. Sections on global warming, notes and references were expanded in the English edition.

== Contents ==
&quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;&#x27;s subtitle refers to the &quot;State of the World&quot; report, published annually since 1984 by the Worldwatch Institute. Lomborg designated the report &quot;one of the best-researched and academically most ambitious environmental policy publications,&quot; but criticized it for using short-term trends to predict disastrous consequences, in cases where long-term trends would not support the same conclusions.

In establishing its arguments, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; examined a wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies, including environmental economics and science, and came to a set of conclusions and recommendations. Lomborg&#x27;s work directly challenged what it framed as &quot;the Litany of our ever deteriorating environment&quot; by interpreting data from around 3,000 mostly secondary sources. The author suggests that environmentalists have diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues in ways that were economically damaging. He portrays his book as an unbiased and scientific refutation of the claims of environmental groups. Much of the book&#x27;s methodology and integrity have been subject to criticism, which argue that Lomborg distorted the fields of research he covers.

&quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is arranged around four major themes:
# Human prosperity from an economic and demographic point of view. He argues prosperity, life expectancy, food and hunger and health have improved over the past centuries in most parts of the world, despite ongoing challenges such as HIV/AIDS. He dismisses Thomas Malthus&#x27; theory that increases in the world&#x27;s population lead to widespread hunger. 
# Human prosperity from an ecological point of view. Lomborg examines the state of natural resources and draws a conclusion that contrasts to that of the well known report &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;. He argues that food is increasing, with the exception of fish which is depleting. He argues that there is no indication of widespread deforestation, and economic growth is a solution to the issue in developing countries. Lomborg asserts that rare materials and oil are not being depleted as fast as is claimed, and that improvements of technology will provide people with fossil fuels for years to come. Lomborg says that water conflicts will not take place because they are not cost-effective, and argues in favour of better water management.
# Pollution as a threat to human prosperity. He connects air pollution and water pollution with economic growth, and argues that faster economic growth will reduce their impacts. He also says that fears over waste are overblown given the percentage of land they can take up.
# Future threats to human prosperity. Lomborg puts forward his main assertion that based on cost-benefit analysis, environmental threats to human prosperity are overstated and policy responses are misguided. He states his view that links between pesticide use and cancer are exaggerated and that biodiversity loss and species extinction have little impact on human prosperity. On global warming, Lomborg accepts its occurrence but expresses doubts over computer modelling and argues that policy responses such as the Kyoto Protocol have greater costs than benefits.
Lomborg&#x27;s main argument is that the vast majority of environmental problems—such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS—are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty. He concludes that challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. 

== Reception ==

The book generally received negative reviews from the scientific community, focusing on the author&#x27;s methodology, data issues, theories and concepts. The most common critiques were the selective use of data, followed by referencing, and lack of focus on the environmental movement. Most environmental scientists argued that the book was deeply flawed, and that the state of the environment was not clearly represented. In some cases, reviews were harsh in both content and tone.

The Danish Ecological Council, an advisory committee on environmental issues, published a &quot;counter-publication&quot; which criticised Lomborg&#x27;s methods and approach in his book. The publication was released in 1999 as &quot;Fremtidens Pris&quot; (&quot;The Price of the Future&quot;), written by 18 contributors of various disciplines. 

The Union of Concerned Scientists published a critique of the book, highlighting reviews by Peter Gleick, Jerry D. Mahlman, Thomas Lovejoy, Norman Myers, Jeffrey Harvey, E. O. Wilson and Stuart Pimm. They concluded that the book fits squarely in a tradition of contrarian environmental works, which may gain temporary prominence but ultimately fail to stand up to scientific scrutiny. Harvey compared the book unfavourably to University undergraduate quality, and added &quot;ecology is the most complex of sciences and Lomborg has never done a shred of work in the field&quot;. In a letter, Wilson said that the greatest regret he had about the book was &quot;the time wasted by scientists correcting the misinformation created.&quot;

In January 2002, a heading from &quot;Scientific American&quot; read, &quot;Misleading Math about the Earth&quot; and contained set of essays written by scientists on the book. The article concluded that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; misrepresented both scientific evidence and opinion. The journal also refused Lomborg&#x27;s request of publishing a defense print of 32 pages, rather a page in the later May issue in 2002. The magazine later published his complete rebuttal on its website, along with the counter rebuttals of John Rennie and John P. Holdren.

&quot;Nature&quot; also published a harsh review of Lomborg&#x27;s book, in which Stuart Pimm of the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation at Columbia University and Jeff Harvey of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology wrote: &quot;Like bad term papers, Lomborg&#x27;s text relies heavily on secondary sources. Out of around 2,000 references, about 5% come from news sources and 30% from web downloads — readily accessible, therefore, but frequently not peer reviewed.&quot; They continued that &quot;the text employs the strategy of those who, for example, argue that gay men aren&#x27;t dying of AIDS, that Jews weren&#x27;t singled out by the Nazis for extermination, and so on.&quot;

Peter Gleick was also highly critical, stating &quot;there is nothing original or unique in Lomborg&#x27;s book. Many of his criticisms have appeared in... previous works—and even in the work of environmental scientists themselves. What is new, perhaps, is the scope and variety of the errors he makes.&quot; David Pimentel wrote a critical review in &quot;Population and Environment&quot;, particularly taking issue with Lomborg&#x27;s argument on soil erosion, pesticides, deforestation and water resources. He concluded that &quot;as an agricultural scientist and ecologist, I wish I could share Lomborg&#x27;s optimistic views, but my investigations and that of countless scientists leads me to a more conservative outlook.&quot; Roger A. Pielke, meanwhile, defended Lomborg and the book, describing the debate as an example of politicising science.

The 12 December 2001 issue of &quot;Grist&quot; devoted an issue to &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;, with a series of essays from various scientists challenging individual sections. A separate article examining the book&#x27;s overall approach by Kathryn Schulz took issue with the framing of Lomborg&#x27;s conclusions, asking &quot;[why] does he weigh the environment only against hospitals and childcare, rather than against, say, industry subsidies and defense spending?&quot;.

Legal scholar David Shoenbrod was one of the defenders of Lomborg. In March 2003, the &quot;New York Law School Law Review&quot; published an examination of the critical reviews of &quot;Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; from the &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; magazines by Shoenbrod and then-Senior Law Student Christi Wilson of New York Law School. The authors defend Lomborg, say that the book is &quot;largely free from factual errors&quot;, and characterise the scientific community&#x27;s response to the book as a &quot;disingenuous attack&quot;, using legal arguments that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert witness in the field of statistics, given that his testimony would be appropriately restricted to his area of expertise.

== Media coverage ==
The book was widely cited in conservative media and groups who oppose environmental regulations. Influential UK newsweekly &quot;The Economist&quot; supported Lomborg&#x27;s views, publishing an advance essay by Lomborg in which he detailed his &quot;litany&quot;, and following up with a highly favorable review and supportive coverage. It stated that &quot;This is one of the most valuable books on public policy—not merely environmental policy—to have been written for the intelligent general reader in the past ten years...&quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is a triumph.&quot;

In a profile of Lomborg preceding the book&#x27;s publication &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;The primary target of the book, a substantial work of analysis with almost 3,000 footnotes, are statements made by environmental organizations like the Worldwatch Institute, the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace.&quot; In August 2001, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published three exclusive essays by Lomborg and hosted an online debate with him, describing him as &quot;Europe&#x27;s most controversial environmental thinker&quot;. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; deemed Lomborg&#x27;s work &quot;a superbly documented and readable book.&quot; In &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; Denis Dutton claimed that &quot;Bjørn Lomborg&#x27;s good news about the environment is bad news for Green ideologues. His richly informative, lucid book is now the place from which environmental policy decisions must be argued. In fact, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, in 1962. It&#x27;s a magnificent achievement.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty&#x27;s concern for the fate of the planet.&quot;
Chris Lavers gave a mixed review in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, saying Lomborg &quot;is clearly committed to rubbishing the views of hand-picked environmentalists, frequently the very silly ones such as Ehrlich, whom professionals have been ignoring for decades&quot; and criticising his framing of deforestation.

In a BBC column from 23 August 2001, veteran BBC environmental correspondent Alex Kirby wrote:
:I am neither a statistician nor a scientist, and I lack the skill to judge Lomborg&#x27;s reworkings of the statistics of conventional wisdom. But I am worried that on virtually every topic he touches, he reaches conclusions radically different from almost everybody else. That seems to suggest that most scientists are wrong, short-sighted, naïve, interested only in securing research funds, or deliberately dancing to the campaigners&#x27; tune. Most I know are honest, intelligent and competent. So it beggars belief to suppose that Professor Lomborg is the only one in step, every single time.

Kirby&#x27;s first concern was not with the extensive research and statistical analysis, but the conclusions drawn from them, concluding: &quot;In the rational world that Bjørn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one. But the real world is messier, more unpredictable—and more impatient.&quot;

=== Reception of media coverage ===
Shortly after its release, the World Resources Institute and World Wide Fund for Nature published a nine-point critique of Lomborg&#x27;s work and credentials specifically targeted at journalists, advising them to &quot;proceed with caution&quot; in their coverage of the book. One critical article, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist: A Case Study in the Manufacture of News&quot;, attributes the book&#x27;s media success to its initial, influential supporters, who linked its message to a European visit from United States president George W. Bush.

Richard C. Bell, writing for Worldwatch argued that many reviews in prominent publications were written by individuals with prior association with Lomborg, &quot;instead of seeking scientists with a critical perspective.&quot; In &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, a review was published by the Competitive Enterprise Institute&#x27;s Ronald Bailey, someone &quot;who had earlier written a book called The True State of the World, from which much of Lomborg&#x27;s claims were taken.&quot; Bell also criticized the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, whose Sunday Book World assigned the book review to Denis Dutton, identified as &quot;a professor of philosophy who lectures on the dangers of pseudoscience at the science faculties of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand&quot;, and the editor of the web site Arts and Letters Daily. Bell noted that &quot;The &quot;Post&quot; did not tell its readers that Dutton&#x27;s web site features links to the Global Climate Coalition, an anti-Kyoto consortium of oil and coal businesses, and to the messages of Julian Simon—the man whose denial that global warming was occurring apparently gave Lomborg the idea for his book in the first place.&quot;

== Pieing incident ==

On 5 September 2001, at a promotional event at a Borders book shop in Oxford, England, British environmentalist author Mark Lynas threw a cream pie in Lomborg&#x27;s face. While doing so, he said &quot;I wanted to put a Baked Alaska in his smug face in solidarity with the native Indian and Eskimo people in Alaska&quot;. In a post on Indymedia titled &quot;Why I pied Lomborg&quot;, Lynas stated &quot;Lomborg specialises in presenting the reader with false choices—such as the assertion that money not spent on preventing climate change could be spent on bringing clean water to the developing world, thereby saving more lives per dollar of expenditure. Of course, in the real world, these are not the kind of choices we are faced with.&quot; Lynas also commented on the difficulty of challenging Lomborg&#x27;s book, arguing &quot;his work, as flawed as it is, has clearly been very time-consuming and meticulous. In a busy and under funded world, few people have the time or background knowledge to plow though 3,000 footnotes checking his sources. It is impressively interdisciplinary.&quot; 

Lomborg said he was &quot;stunned&quot; by the incident, but &quot;at least the pie tasted good&quot;. Lynas later apologised to Lomborg and said that he regretted pieing him. The two would later be on &quot;friendly&quot; terms.

==Accusations of scientific dishonesty==
After the publication of &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;, Lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty. Several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against Lomborg to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD), a body under Denmark&#x27;s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a &quot;debate&quot; publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges stated that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

===Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty investigation===
A six-month review took place and on 6 January 2003, a 17-page DCSD ruling was released, in which the Committees decided that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; showed &quot;systematic one-sidedness&quot; and was scientifically dishonest, but Lomborg was innocent of wrongdoing due to a lack of expertise in the relevant fields. The investigation heavily relied on published reviews of the book.

The DCSD cited &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; for fabrication of data, selective discarding of unwanted results (selective citation), deliberately misleading use of statistical methods, distorted interpretation of conclusions, plagiarism and deliberate misinterpretation of others&#x27; results.

Lomborg defended his work, challenging the committee for not identifying specific errors. He also argued the report could jeopardise his employment at the Danish Institute for Environmental Assessment and some of his critics attempted to do this, although government officials denied his posting would be impacted.

The DCSD decision about Lomborg led to a petition from some Danish social scientists, calling for the body to be abolished and arguing the body cannot hold the book to the same standards as medical and natural sciences. Another group of around 600 Danish scientists, many of them from medical and natural science fields, collected signatures in support of the DCSD. The ruling was also debated in parliament, and science minister Helge Sander asked the Danish Research Agency to establish a working group to scrutinise the DCSD&#x27;s procedures.

===Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation review and response===
On 13 February 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint against the DCSD&#x27;s decision with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI), which oversees the group. On 17 December, the Ministry released a report identifying a number of procedural errors had made, although did not refute any criticisms of the book. It criticised the DCSD for not identifying specific areas of error and for not providing an opportunity for Lomborg to respond before the report&#x27;s publication.

The Ministry then remitted the case to the DCSD, and instructed the DCSD to decide whether to reinvestigate. On 12 March 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.

== Legacy ==
Jim Giles wrote a 2003 retrospective on the book in &quot;Nature&quot;, saying it was &quot;packed with facts and figures, yet it was the emotional response that it inspired that will be best remembered,&quot; and argued that it would have little long-lasting influence. Giles suggested the intense critical reaction from scientists and environmental groups was driven by fears that the book&#x27;s talking points would be adopted by the Bush administration, but their criticisms conversely boosted sales and Lomborg&#x27;s profile. Cambridge University Press said sales of the book quadrupled in the month following negative reviews in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Jeffrey Harvey, who had debated Lomborg several times by 2003, admitted that the tone of attacks on Lomborg could have been counterproductive. In 2005, an article by a group of non-climatologist scientists published in the &quot;Journal of Information Ethics&quot;, claimed that most criticism against the book was unjustified, and that the scientific community had misused their authority to suppress the author. The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of the journal by Kåre Fog who asserts that, &quot;despite the ministry&#x27;s decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid.&quot; He also rejected the Galileo hypothesis, &quot;that Lomborg is a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.&quot; 

Another article published in the &quot;Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences&quot; in 2010, recounted the controversy surrounding the book and criticised the author and publisher, saying &quot;the question remains why a book that contains so many flaws by someone without any scientific credentials has received so much public attention.&quot; The article also pointed to contradiction of the principles of environmental economics in the book. They concluded that &quot;the book is anyway sure to go down in history as an unreliable source of information and argumentation, being one of the most severely criticized texts issued ever by a prestigious academic publisher&quot;. 

Despite the controversy, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; established Lomborg as a public figure and prominent critic of the scientific consensus on climate change. He was named one of the &quot;Time&quot; 100 most influential people in 2004, and established the Copenhagen Consensus to institutionalize his views. He was also appointed director of the Environmental Assessment Institute in Denmark. By 2004, some polluting industries bodies had already quoted Lomborg or invited him to speak to further their agendas. &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; was followed by &quot;Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist&#x27;s Guide to Global Warming&quot;, which was published in 2007.
