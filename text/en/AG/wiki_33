<text>A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis. A statistical hypothesis test typically involves a calculation of a test statistic. Then a decision is made, either by comparing the test statistic to a critical value or equivalently by evaluating a &quot;p&quot;-value computed from the test statistic. Roughly 100 specialized statistical tests have been defined.

==History==

While hypothesis testing was popularized early in the 20th century, early forms were used in the 1700s. The first use is credited to John Arbuthnot (1710), followed by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1770s), in analyzing the human sex ratio at birth; see .

===Choice of null hypothesis===

Paul Meehl has argued that the epistemological importance of the choice of null hypothesis has gone largely unacknowledged. When the null hypothesis is predicted by theory, a more precise experiment will be a more severe test of the underlying theory. When the null hypothesis defaults to &quot;no difference&quot; or &quot;no effect&quot;, a more precise experiment is a less severe test of the theory that motivated performing the experiment. An examination of the origins of the latter practice may therefore be useful:

1778: Pierre Laplace compares the birthrates of boys and girls in multiple European cities. He states: &quot;it is natural to conclude that these possibilities are very nearly in the same ratio&quot;. Thus, the null hypothesis in this case that the birthrates of boys and girls should be equal given &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;.

1900: Karl Pearson develops the chi squared test to determine &quot;whether a given form of frequency curve will effectively describe the samples drawn from a given population.&quot; Thus the null hypothesis is that a population is described by some distribution predicted by theory. He uses as an example the numbers of five and sixes in the Weldon dice throw data.

1904: Karl Pearson develops the concept of &quot;contingency&quot; in order to determine whether outcomes are independent of a given categorical factor. Here the null hypothesis is by default that two things are unrelated (e.g. scar formation and death rates from smallpox). The null hypothesis in this case is no longer predicted by theory or conventional wisdom, but is instead the principle of indifference that led Fisher and others to dismiss the use of &quot;inverse probabilities&quot;.

==Modern origins and early controversy==
Modern significance testing is largely the product of Karl Pearson (&quot;p&quot;-value, Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test), William Sealy Gosset (Student&#x27;s t-distribution), and Ronald Fisher (&quot;null hypothesis&quot;, analysis of variance, &quot;significance test&quot;), while hypothesis testing was developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (son of Karl). Ronald Fisher began his life in statistics as a Bayesian (Zabell 1992), but Fisher soon grew disenchanted with the subjectivity involved (namely use of the principle of indifference when determining prior probabilities), and sought to provide a more &quot;objective&quot; approach to inductive inference.

Fisher emphasized rigorous experimental design and methods to extract a result from few samples assuming Gaussian distributions. Neyman (who teamed with the younger Pearson) emphasized mathematical rigor and methods to obtain more results from many samples and a wider range of distributions. Modern hypothesis testing is an inconsistent hybrid of the Fisher vs Neyman/Pearson formulation, methods and terminology developed in the early 20th century.

Fisher popularized the &quot;significance test&quot;. He required a null-hypothesis (corresponding to a population frequency distribution) and a sample. His (now familiar) calculations determined whether to reject the null-hypothesis or not. Significance testing did not utilize an alternative hypothesis so there was no concept of a Type II error (false negative).

The &quot;p&quot;-value was devised as an informal, but objective, index meant to help a researcher determine (based on other knowledge) whether to modify future experiments or strengthen one&#x27;s faith in the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing (and Type I/II errors) was devised by Neyman and Pearson as a more objective alternative to Fisher&#x27;s &quot;p&quot;-value, also meant to determine researcher behaviour, but without requiring any inductive inference by the researcher.

Neyman &amp; Pearson considered a different problem to Fisher (which they called &quot;hypothesis testing&quot;). They initially considered two simple hypotheses (both with frequency distributions). They calculated two probabilities and typically selected the hypothesis associated with the higher probability (the hypothesis more likely to have generated the sample). Their method always selected a hypothesis. It also allowed the calculation of both types of error probabilities.

Fisher and Neyman/Pearson clashed bitterly. Neyman/Pearson considered their formulation to be an improved generalization of significance testing (the defining paper was abstract; Mathematicians have generalized and refined the theory for decades). Fisher thought that it was not applicable to scientific research because often, during the course of the experiment, it is discovered that the initial assumptions about the null hypothesis are questionable due to unexpected sources of error. He believed that the use of rigid reject/accept decisions based on models formulated before data is collected was incompatible with this common scenario faced by scientists and attempts to apply this method to scientific research would lead to mass confusion.

The dispute between Fisher and Neyman–Pearson was waged on philosophical grounds, characterized by a philosopher as a dispute over the proper role of models in statistical inference.

Events intervened: Neyman accepted a position in the University of California, Berkeley in 1938, breaking his partnership with Pearson and separating the disputants (who had occupied the same building). World War II provided an intermission in the debate. The dispute between Fisher and Neyman terminated (unresolved after 27 years) with Fisher&#x27;s death in 1962. Neyman wrote a well-regarded eulogy. Some of Neyman&#x27;s later publications reported &quot;p&quot;-values and significance levels.

The modern version of hypothesis testing is a hybrid of the two approaches that resulted from confusion by writers of statistical textbooks (as predicted by Fisher) beginning in the 1940s (but signal detection, for example, still uses the Neyman/Pearson formulation). Great conceptual differences and many caveats in addition to those mentioned above were ignored. Neyman and Pearson provided the stronger terminology, the more rigorous mathematics and the more consistent philosophy, but the subject taught today in introductory statistics has more similarities with Fisher&#x27;s method than theirs.

Sometime around 1940, authors of statistical text books began combining the two approaches by using the &quot;p&quot;-value in place of the test statistic (or data) to test against the Neyman–Pearson &quot;significance level&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Hypothesis testing and philosophy intersect. Inferential statistics, which includes hypothesis testing, is applied probability. Both probability and its application are intertwined with philosophy. Philosopher David Hume wrote, &quot;All knowledge degenerates into probability.&quot; Competing practical definitions of probability reflect philosophical differences. The most common application of hypothesis testing is in the scientific interpretation of experimental data, which is naturally studied by the philosophy of science.

Fisher and Neyman opposed the subjectivity of probability. Their views contributed to the objective definitions. The core of their historical disagreement was philosophical.

Many of the philosophical criticisms of hypothesis testing are discussed by statisticians in other contexts, particularly correlation does not imply causation and the design of experiments.
Hypothesis testing is of continuing interest to philosophers.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/bjps/axl003&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Statistics is increasingly being taught in schools with hypothesis testing being one of the elements taught. Many conclusions reported in the popular press (political opinion polls to medical studies) are based on statistics. Some writers have stated that statistical analysis of this kind allows for thinking clearly about problems involving mass data, as well as the effective reporting of trends and inferences from said data, but caution that writers for a broad public should have a solid understanding of the field in order to use the terms and concepts correctly. An introductory college statistics class places much emphasis on hypothesis testing – perhaps half of the course. Such fields as literature and divinity now include findings based on statistical analysis (see the Bible Analyzer). An introductory statistics class teaches hypothesis testing as a cookbook process. Hypothesis testing is also taught at the postgraduate level. Statisticians learn how to create good statistical test procedures (like &quot;z&quot;, Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and chi-squared). Statistical hypothesis testing is considered a mature area within statistics, but a limited amount of development continues.

An academic study states that the cookbook method of teaching introductory statistics leaves no time for history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed more than a decade ago, and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.

==Performing a frequentist hypothesis test in practice==
The typical steps involved in performing a frequentist hypothesis test in practice are:
# Define a hypothesis (claim which is testable using data).
# Select a relevant statistical test with associated test statistic T.
# Derive the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis from the assumptions. In standard cases this will be a well-known result. For example, the test statistic might follow a Student&#x27;s t distribution with known degrees of freedom, or a normal distribution with known mean and variance.
# Select a significance level (&quot;α&quot;), the maximum acceptable false positive rate. Common values are 5% and 1%.
# Compute from the observations the observed value tobs of the test statistic T.
# Decide to either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative or not reject it. The Neyman-Pearson decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis H0 if the observed value tobs is in the critical region, and not to reject the null hypothesis otherwise.

=== Practical example ===
The difference in the two processes applied to the radioactive suitcase example (below):
* &quot;The Geiger-counter reading is 10. The limit is 9. Check the suitcase.&quot;
* &quot;The Geiger-counter reading is high; 97% of safe suitcases have lower readings. The limit is 95%. Check the suitcase.&quot;
The former report is adequate, the latter gives a more detailed explanation of the data and the reason why the suitcase is being checked.

Not rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean the null hypothesis is &quot;accepted&quot; per se (though Neyman and Pearson used that word in their original writings; see the Interpretation section).

The processes described here are perfectly adequate for computation. They seriously neglect the design of experiments considerations.

It is particularly critical that appropriate sample sizes be estimated before conducting the experiment.

The phrase &quot;test of significance&quot; was coined by statistician Ronald Fisher.

===Interpretation===
When the null hypothesis is true and statistical assumptions are met, the probability that the p-value will be less than or equal to the significance level formula_1 is at most formula_1. This ensures that the hypothesis test maintains its specified false positive rate (provided that statistical assumptions are met).

The &quot;p&quot;-value is the probability that a test statistic which is at least as extreme as the one obtained would occur under the null hypothesis. At a significance level of 0.05, a fair coin would be expected to (incorrectly) reject the null hypothesis (that it is fair) in 1 out of 20 tests on average. The &quot;p&quot;-value does not provide the probability that either the null hypothesis or its opposite is correct (a common source of confusion).

If the &quot;p&quot;-value is less than the chosen significance threshold (equivalently, if the observed test statistic is in the critical region), then we say the null hypothesis is rejected at the chosen level of significance. If the &quot;p&quot;-value is &quot;not&quot; less than the chosen significance threshold (equivalently, if the observed test statistic is outside the critical region), then the null hypothesis is not rejected at the chosen level of significance.

In the &quot;lady tasting tea&quot; example (below), Fisher required the lady to properly categorize all of the cups of tea to justify the conclusion that the result was unlikely to result from chance. His test revealed that if the lady was effectively guessing at random (the null hypothesis), there was a 1.4% chance that the observed results (perfectly ordered tea) would occur.

===Use and importance===
Statistics are helpful in analyzing most collections of data. This is equally true of hypothesis testing which can justify conclusions even when no scientific theory exists. In the Lady tasting tea example, it was &quot;obvious&quot; that no difference existed between (milk poured into tea) and (tea poured into milk). The data contradicted the &quot;obvious&quot;.

Real world applications of hypothesis testing include:
* Testing whether more men than women suffer from nightmares
* Establishing authorship of documents
* Evaluating the effect of the full moon on behavior
* Determining the range at which a bat can detect an insect by echo
* Deciding whether hospital carpeting results in more infections
* Selecting the best means to stop smoking
* Checking whether bumper stickers reflect car owner behavior
* Testing the claims of handwriting analysts

Statistical hypothesis testing plays an important role in the whole of statistics and in statistical inference. For example, Lehmann (1992) in a review of the fundamental paper by Neyman and Pearson (1933) says: &quot;Nevertheless, despite their shortcomings, the new paradigm formulated in the 1933 paper, and the many developments carried out within its framework continue to play a central role in both the theory and practice of statistics and can be expected to do so in the foreseeable future&quot;.

Significance testing has been the favored statistical tool in some experimental social sciences (over 90% of articles in the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot; during the early 1990s). Other fields have favored the estimation of parameters (e.g. effect size). Significance testing is used as a substitute for the traditional comparison of predicted value and experimental result at the core of the scientific method. When theory is only capable of predicting the sign of a relationship, a directional (one-sided) hypothesis test can be configured so that only a statistically significant result supports theory. This form of theory appraisal is the most heavily criticized application of hypothesis testing.

===Cautions===
&quot;If the government required statistical procedures to carry warning labels like those on drugs, most inference methods would have long labels indeed.&quot; This caution applies to hypothesis tests and alternatives to them.

The successful hypothesis test is associated with a probability and a type-I error rate. The conclusion &quot;might&quot; be wrong.

The conclusion of the test is only as solid as the sample upon which it is based. The design of the experiment is critical. A number of unexpected effects have been observed including:
* The clever Hans effect. A horse appeared to be capable of doing simple arithmetic.
* The Hawthorne effect. Industrial workers were more productive in better illumination, and most productive in worse.
* The placebo effect. Pills with no medically active ingredients were remarkably effective.
A statistical analysis of misleading data produces misleading conclusions. The issue of data quality can be more subtle. In forecasting for example, there is no agreement on a measure of forecast accuracy. In the absence of a consensus measurement, no decision based on measurements will be without controversy.

Publication bias: Statistically nonsignificant results may be less likely to be published, which can bias the literature.

Multiple testing: When multiple true null hypothesis tests are conducted at once without adjustment, the overall probability of Type I error is higher than the nominal alpha level.

Those making critical decisions based on the results of a hypothesis test are prudent to look at the details rather than the conclusion alone. In the physical sciences most results are fully accepted only when independently confirmed. The general advice concerning statistics is, &quot;Figures never lie, but liars figure&quot; (anonymous).

==Definition of terms==

The following definitions are mainly based on the exposition in the book by Lehmann and Romano:

*Statistical hypothesis: A statement about the parameters describing a population (not a sample).
*Test statistic: A value calculated from a sample without any unknown parameters, often to summarize the sample for comparison purposes.
*: Any hypothesis which specifies the population distribution completely.
*Composite hypothesis: Any hypothesis which does &quot;not&quot; specify the population distribution completely.
*Null hypothesis (H0) 
*Positive data: Data that enable the investigator to reject a null hypothesis.
*Alternative hypothesis (H1) 
thumb|260x260px|Suppose the data can be realized from an N(0,1) distribution. For example, with a chosen significance level α = 0.05, from the Z-table, a one-tailed critical value of approximately 1.645 can be obtained. The one-tailed critical value Cα ≈ 1.645 corresponds to the chosen significance level. The critical region [Cα, ∞) is realized as the tail of the standard normal distribution.
*s of a statistical test are the boundaries of the acceptance region of the test. The acceptance region is the set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is not rejected. Depending on the shape of the acceptance region, there can be one or more than one critical value. 
**&#x27; / &#x27;: The set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is rejected.
*Power of a test (1 − &quot;β&quot;)
* Size: For simple hypotheses, this is the test&#x27;s probability of &quot;incorrectly&quot; rejecting the null hypothesis. The false positive rate. For composite hypotheses this is the supremum of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis over all cases covered by the null hypothesis. The complement of the false positive rate is termed specificity in biostatistics. (&quot;This is a specific test. Because the result is positive, we can confidently say that the patient has the condition.&quot;) See sensitivity and specificity and type I and type II errors for exhaustive definitions.
*Significance level of a test (&quot;α)&quot;
*&quot;p&quot;-value 
*: A predecessor to the statistical hypothesis test (see the Origins section). An experimental result was said to be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of statistical evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The statistical hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used for the modern version which is now part of statistical hypothesis testing.
*Conservative test: A test is conservative if, when constructed for a given nominal significance level, the true probability of &quot;incorrectly&quot; rejecting the null hypothesis is never greater than the nominal level.
*Exact test

A statistical hypothesis test compares a test statistic (&quot;z&quot; or &quot;t&quot; for examples) to a threshold. The test statistic (the formula found in the table below) is based on optimality. For a fixed level of Type I error rate, use of these statistics minimizes Type II error rates (equivalent to maximizing power). The following terms describe tests in terms of such optimality:

*Most powerful test: For a given &quot;size&quot; or &quot;significance level&quot;, the test with the greatest power (probability of rejection) for a given value of the parameter(s) being tested, contained in the alternative hypothesis.
*Uniformly most powerful test (UMP)

==Nonparametric bootstrap hypothesis testing==
Bootstrap-based resampling methods can be used for null hypothesis testing. A bootstrap creates numerous simulated samples by randomly resampling (with replacement) the original, combined sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is correct. The bootstrap is very versatile as it is distribution-free and it does not rely on restrictive parametric assumptions, but rather on empirical approximate methods with asymptotic guarantees. Traditional parametric hypothesis tests are more computationally efficient but make stronger structural assumptions. In situations where computing the probability of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is hard or impossible (due to perhaps inconvenience or lack of knowledge of the underlying distribution), the bootstrap offers a viable method for statistical inference.

==Examples==
===Human sex ratio===

The earliest use of statistical hypothesis testing is generally credited to the question of whether male and female births are equally likely (null hypothesis), which was addressed in the 1700s by John Arbuthnot (1710), and later by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1770s).

Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710, and applied the sign test, a simple non-parametric test. In every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. Considering more male or more female births as equally likely, the probability of the observed outcome is 0.582, or about 1 in 4,836,000,000,000,000,000,000,000; in modern terms, this is the &quot;p&quot;-value. Arbuthnot concluded that this is too small to be due to chance and must instead be due to divine providence: &quot;From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.&quot; In modern terms, he rejected the null hypothesis of equally likely male and female births at the &quot;p&quot; = 1/282 significance level.

Laplace considered the statistics of almost half a million births. The statistics showed an excess of boys compared to girls. He concluded by calculation of a &quot;p&quot;-value that the excess was a real, but unexplained, effect.

===Lady tasting tea===
In a famous example of hypothesis testing, known as the &quot;Lady tasting tea&quot;, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a colleague of Fisher, claimed to be able to tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (&lt; 5%). A pattern of 4 successes corresponds to 1 out of 70 possible combinations (p≈ 1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.

===Courtroom trial===
A statistical test procedure is comparable to a criminal trial; a defendant is considered not guilty as long as his or her guilt is not proven. The prosecutor tries to prove the guilt of the defendant. Only when there is enough evidence for the prosecution is the defendant convicted.

In the start of the procedure, there are two hypotheses formula_3: &quot;the defendant is not guilty&quot;, and formula_4: &quot;the defendant is guilty&quot;. The first one, formula_3, is called the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;. The second one, formula_4, is called the &quot;alternative hypothesis&quot;. It is the alternative hypothesis that one hopes to support.

The hypothesis of innocence is rejected only when an error is very unlikely, because one does not want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called &quot;error of the first kind&quot; (i.e., the conviction of an innocent person), and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an &quot;error of the second kind&quot; (acquitting a person who committed the crime), is more common.

A criminal trial can be regarded as either or both of two decision processes: guilty vs not guilty or evidence vs a threshold (&quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;). In one view, the defendant is judged; in the other view the performance of the prosecution (which bears the burden of proof) is judged. A hypothesis test can be regarded as either a judgment of a hypothesis or as a judgment of evidence.

===Philosopher&#x27;s beans===
The following example was produced by a philosopher describing scientific methods generations before hypothesis testing was
formalized and popularized.
Few beans of this handful are white.
Most beans in this bag are white.
Therefore: Probably, these beans were taken from another bag.
This is an hypothetical inference.
The beans in the bag are the population. The handful are the sample. The null hypothesis is that the sample originated from the population. The criterion for rejecting the null-hypothesis is the &quot;obvious&quot; difference in appearance (an informal difference in the mean). The interesting result is that consideration of a real population and a real sample produced an imaginary bag. The philosopher was considering logic rather than probability. To be a real statistical hypothesis test, this example requires the formalities of a probability calculation and a comparison of that probability to a standard.

A simple generalization of the example considers a mixed bag of beans and a handful that contain either very few or very many white beans. The generalization considers both extremes. It requires more calculations and more comparisons to arrive at a formal answer, but the core philosophy is unchanged; If the composition of the handful is greatly different from that of the bag, then the sample probably originated from another bag. The original example is termed a one-sided or a one-tailed test while the generalization is termed a two-sided or two-tailed test.

The statement also relies on the inference that the sampling was random. If someone had been picking through the bag to find white beans, then it would explain why the handful had so many white beans, and also explain why the number of white beans in the bag was depleted (although the bag is probably intended to be assumed much larger than one&#x27;s hand).

===Clairvoyant card game===
A person (the subject) is tested for clairvoyance. They are shown the back face of a randomly chosen playing card 25 times and asked which of the four suits it belongs to. The number of hits, or correct answers, is called &quot;X&quot;.

As we try to find evidence of their clairvoyance, for the time being the null hypothesis is that the person is not clairvoyant. The alternative is: the person is (more or less) clairvoyant.

If the null hypothesis is valid, the only thing the test person can do is guess. For every card, the probability (relative frequency) of any single suit appearing is 1/4. If the alternative is valid, the test subject will predict the suit correctly with probability greater than 1/4. We will call the probability of guessing correctly &quot;p&quot;. The hypotheses, then, are:
* null hypothesis formula_7     (just guessing)
and
* alternative hypothesis formula_8    (true clairvoyant).

When the test subject correctly predicts all 25 cards, we will consider them clairvoyant, and reject the null hypothesis. Thus also with 24 or 23 hits. With only 5 or 6 hits, on the other hand, there is no cause to consider them so. But what about 12 hits, or 17 hits? What is the critical number, &quot;c&quot;, of hits, at which point we consider the subject to be clairvoyant? How do we determine the critical value &quot;c&quot;? With the choice &quot;c&quot;=25 (i.e. we only accept clairvoyance when all cards are predicted correctly) we&#x27;re more critical than with &quot;c&quot;=10. In the first case almost no test subjects will be recognized to be clairvoyant, in the second case, a certain number will pass the test. In practice, one decides how critical one will be. That is, one decides how often one accepts an error of the first kind – a false positive, or Type I error. With &quot;c&quot; = 25 the probability of such an error is:

and hence, very small. The probability of a false positive is the probability of randomly guessing correctly all 25 times.

Being less critical, with &quot;c&quot; = 10, gives:

Thus, &quot;c&quot; = 10 yields a much greater probability of false positive.

Before the test is actually performed, the maximum acceptable probability of a Type I error (&quot;α&quot;) is determined. Typically, values in the range of 1% to 5% are selected. (If the maximum acceptable error rate is zero, an infinite number of correct guesses is required.) Depending on this Type 1 error rate, the critical value &quot;c&quot; is calculated. For example, if we select an error rate of 1%, &quot;c&quot; is calculated thus:

From all the numbers c, with this property, we choose the smallest, in order to minimize the probability of a Type II error, a false negative. For the above example, we select: formula_9.
== Variations and sub-classes ==
Statistical hypothesis testing is a key technique of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, although the two types of inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly &quot;deciding&quot; that a default position (null hypothesis) is incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null hypothesis were true. This probability of making an incorrect decision is &quot;not&quot; the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor whether any specific alternative hypothesis is true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and alternative hypothesis are treated on a more equal basis.

One naïve Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing is to base decisions on the posterior probability, but this fails when comparing point and continuous hypotheses. Other approaches to decision making, such as Bayesian decision theory, attempt to balance the consequences of incorrect decisions across all possibilities, rather than concentrating on a single null hypothesis. A number of other approaches to reaching a decision based on data are available via decision theory and optimal decisions, some of which have desirable properties. Hypothesis testing, though, is a dominant approach to data analysis in many fields of science. Extensions to the theory of hypothesis testing include the study of the power of tests, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Such considerations can be used for the purpose of sample size determination prior to the collection of data.

== Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing ==
An example of Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing (or null hypothesis statistical significance testing) can be made by a change to the radioactive suitcase example. If the &quot;suitcase&quot; is actually a shielded container for the transportation of radioactive material, then a test might be used to select among three hypotheses: no radioactive source present, one present, two (all) present. The test could be required for safety, with actions required in each case. The Neyman–Pearson lemma of hypothesis testing says that a good criterion for the selection of hypotheses is the ratio of their probabilities (a likelihood ratio). A simple method of solution is to select the hypothesis with the highest probability for the Geiger counts observed. The typical result matches intuition: few counts imply no source, many counts imply two sources and intermediate counts imply one source. Notice also that usually there are problems for proving a negative. Null hypotheses should be at least falsifiable.

Neyman–Pearson theory can accommodate both prior probabilities and the costs of actions resulting from decisions. The former allows each test to consider the results of earlier tests (unlike Fisher&#x27;s significance tests). The latter allows the consideration of economic issues (for example) as well as probabilities. A likelihood ratio remains a good criterion for selecting among hypotheses.

The two forms of hypothesis testing are based on different problem formulations. The original test is analogous to a true/false question; the Neyman–Pearson test is more like multiple choice. In the view of Tukey the former produces a conclusion on the basis of only strong evidence while the latter produces a decision on the basis of available evidence. While the two tests seem quite different both mathematically and philosophically, later developments lead to the opposite claim. Consider many tiny radioactive sources. The hypotheses become 0,1,2,3... grains of radioactive sand. There is little distinction between none or some radiation (Fisher) and 0 grains of radioactive sand versus all of the alternatives (Neyman–Pearson). The major Neyman–Pearson paper of 1933 also considered composite hypotheses (ones whose distribution includes an unknown parameter). An example proved the optimality of the (Student&#x27;s) &quot;t&quot;-test, &quot;there can be no better test for the hypothesis under consideration&quot; (p 321). Neyman–Pearson theory was proving the optimality of Fisherian methods from its inception.

Fisher&#x27;s significance testing has proven a popular flexible statistical tool in application with little mathematical growth potential. Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing is claimed as a pillar of mathematical statistics, creating a new paradigm for the field. It also stimulated new applications in statistical process control, detection theory, decision theory and game theory. Both formulations have been successful, but the successes have been of a different character.

The dispute over formulations is unresolved. Science primarily uses Fisher&#x27;s (slightly modified) formulation as taught in introductory statistics. Statisticians study Neyman–Pearson theory in graduate school. Mathematicians are proud of uniting the formulations. Philosophers consider them separately. Learned opinions deem the formulations variously competitive (Fisher vs Neyman), incompatible or complementary. The dispute has become more complex since Bayesian inference has achieved respectability.

The terminology is inconsistent. Hypothesis testing can mean any mixture of two formulations that both changed with time. Any discussion of significance testing vs hypothesis testing is doubly vulnerable to confusion.

Fisher thought that hypothesis testing was a useful strategy for performing industrial quality control, however, he strongly disagreed that hypothesis testing could be useful for scientists.
Hypothesis testing provides a means of finding test statistics used in significance testing. The concept of power is useful in explaining the consequences of adjusting the significance level and is heavily used in sample size determination. The two methods remain philosophically distinct. They usually (but &quot;not always&quot;) produce the same mathematical answer. The preferred answer is context dependent. While the existing merger of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson theories has been heavily criticized, modifying the merger to achieve Bayesian goals has been considered.

==Criticism==
Criticism of statistical hypothesis testing fills volumes. Much of the criticism can be summarized by the following issues:
* The interpretation of a &quot;p&quot;-value is dependent upon stopping rule and definition of multiple comparison. The former often changes during the course of a study and the latter is unavoidably ambiguous. (i.e. &quot;p values depend on both the (data) observed and on the other possible (data) that might have been observed but weren&#x27;t&quot;).
* Confusion resulting (in part) from combining the methods of Fisher and Neyman–Pearson which are conceptually distinct.
* Emphasis on statistical significance to the exclusion of estimation and confirmation by repeated experiments.
* Rigidly requiring statistical significance as a criterion for publication, resulting in publication bias. Most of the criticism is indirect. Rather than being wrong, statistical hypothesis testing is misunderstood, overused and misused.
* When used to detect whether a difference exists between groups, a paradox arises. As improvements are made to experimental design (e.g. increased precision of measurement and sample size), the test becomes more lenient. Unless one accepts the absurd assumption that all sources of noise in the data cancel out completely, the chance of finding statistical significance in either direction approaches 100%. However, this absurd assumption that the mean difference between two groups cannot be zero implies that the data cannot be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) because the expected difference between any two subgroups of i.i.d. random variates is zero; therefore, the i.i.d. assumption is also absurd.
*Layers of philosophical concerns. The probability of statistical significance is a function of decisions made by experimenters/analysts. If the decisions are based on convention they are termed arbitrary or mindless while those not so based may be termed subjective. To minimize type II errors, large samples are recommended. In psychology practically all null hypotheses are claimed to be false for sufficiently large samples so &quot;...it is usually nonsensical to perform an experiment with the &quot;sole&quot; aim of rejecting the null hypothesis.&quot; &quot;Statistically significant findings are often misleading&quot; in psychology. Statistical significance does not imply practical significance, and correlation does not imply causation. Casting doubt on the null hypothesis is thus far from directly supporting the research hypothesis.
*&quot;[I]t does not tell us what we want to know&quot;. Lists of dozens of complaints are available.

Critics and supporters are largely in factual agreement regarding the characteristics of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): While it can provide critical information, it is &quot;inadequate as the sole tool for statistical analysis&quot;. &quot;Successfully rejecting the null hypothesis may offer no support for the research hypothesis.&quot; The continuing controversy concerns the selection of the best statistical practices for the near-term future given the existing practices. However, adequate research design can minimize this issue. Critics would prefer to ban NHST completely, forcing a complete departure from those practices, while supporters suggest a less absolute change.

Controversy over significance testing, and its effects on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review, medical journal publishers have recognized the obligation to publish some results that are not statistically significant to combat publication bias, and a journal (&quot;Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis&quot;) has been created to publish such results exclusively. Textbooks have added some cautions, and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the size of the sample required to produce significant results. Few major organizations have abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so. For instance, in 2023, the editors of the Journal of Physiology &quot;strongly recommend the use of estimation methods for those publishing in The Journal&quot; (meaning the magnitude of the effect size (to allow readers to judge whether a finding has practical, physiological, or clinical relevance) and confidence intervals to convey the precision of that estimate), saying &quot;Ultimately, it is the physiological importance of the data that those publishing in The Journal of Physiology should be most concerned with, rather than the statistical significance.&quot;

==Alternatives==

A unifying position of critics is that statistics should not lead to an accept-reject conclusion or decision, but to an estimated value with an interval estimate; this data-analysis philosophy is broadly referred to as estimation statistics. Estimation statistics can be accomplished with either frequentist or Bayesian methods.

Critics of significance testing have advocated basing inference less on p-values and more on confidence intervals for effect sizes for importance, prediction intervals for confidence, replications and extensions for replicability, meta-analyses for generality :. But none of these suggested alternatives inherently produces a decision. Lehmann said that hypothesis testing theory can be presented in terms of conclusions/decisions, probabilities, or confidence intervals: &quot;The distinction between the ... approaches is largely one of reporting and interpretation.&quot;

Bayesian inference is one proposed alternative to significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)). For example, Bayesian parameter estimation can provide rich information about the data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain priors that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the &quot;t&quot;-test and has also contrasted Bayesian estimation for assessing null values with Bayesian model comparison for hypothesis testing. Two competing models/hypotheses can be compared using Bayes factors. Bayesian methods could be criticized for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the prior probabilities nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.

Advocates of a Bayesian approach sometimes claim that the goal of a researcher is most often to objectively assess the probability that a hypothesis is true based on the data they have collected. Neither Fisher&#x27;s significance testing, nor Neyman–Pearson hypothesis testing can provide this information, and do not claim to. The probability a hypothesis is true can only be derived from use of Bayes&#x27; Theorem, which was unsatisfactory to both the Fisher and Neyman–Pearson camps due to the explicit use of subjectivity in the form of the prior probability. Fisher&#x27;s strategy is to sidestep this with the &quot;p&quot;-value (an objective &quot;index&quot; based on the data alone) followed by &quot;inductive inference&quot;, while Neyman–Pearson devised their approach of &quot;inductive behaviour&quot;.

<text>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; for best juvenile fiction. The book is recognized as a classic in children&#x27;s literature and is one of the best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold.

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit of the title, who joins the wizard Gandalf and the thirteen dwarves of Thorin&#x27;s Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves&#x27; home and treasure from the dragon Smaug. Bilbo&#x27;s journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.

The story is told in the form of a picaresque or episodic quest; several chapters introduce a new type of monster or threat as Bilbo progresses through the landscape. Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdom by accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey, and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict. Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien&#x27;s own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story. The author&#x27;s scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in mythology and fairy tales are often noted as influences, but more recent fiction including adventure stories and the works of William Morris also played a part.

The publisher was encouraged by the book&#x27;s critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien&#x27;s work progressed on its successor, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, he made retrospective accommodations for it in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien&#x27;s changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled. The work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.

== Narrative ==

=== Characters ===

Bilbo Baggins, the protagonist, is a respectable, reserved and well-to-do hobbit—a race resembling short humans with furry, leathery feet who live in underground houses and are mainly farmers and gardeners. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. Thorin Oakenshield is the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin&#x27;s grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.

The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as the twelve other dwarves of the company; two types of elves: both puckish and more serious warrior types; Men; man-eating trolls; boulder-throwing giants; evil cave-dwelling goblins; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak; immense and heroic eagles who also speak; evil wolves, or Wargs, who are allied with the goblins; Elrond the sage; Gollum, a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake; Beorn, a man who can assume bear form; and Bard the Bowman, a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town.

=== Plot ===

Gandalf tricks Bilbo Baggins into hosting a party for Thorin Oakenshield and his band of twelve dwarves (Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur), who go over their plans to reclaim their ancient home, Lonely Mountain, and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug. Gandalf unveils Thror&#x27;s map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition&#x27;s &quot;burglar&quot;. The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, joins despite himself.

The group travels into the wild. Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell, where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf kills the goblin king and rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him in a game, each posing a riddle until one of them cannot solve it. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out of the tunnels, but if he fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles. They rest in the house of the skin-changer Beorn.

The company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood without Gandalf, who has other responsibilities. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug&#x27;s demise. The expedition reaches the mountain and finds the secret door. The dwarves send a reluctant Bilbo inside to scout the dragon&#x27;s lair. He steals a great cup and, while conversing with Smaug, spots a gap in the ancient dragon&#x27;s armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruders, flies off to destroy the town. A thrush overhears Bilbo&#x27;s report of Smaug&#x27;s vulnerability and tells Lake-town resident Bard. Smaug wreaks havoc on the town, until Bard shoots an arrow into the chink in Smaug&#x27;s armour, killing the dragon.

When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, the most-treasured heirloom of Thorin&#x27;s family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men request compensation for Lake-town&#x27;s destruction and settlement of old claims on the treasure. When Thorin refuses to give them anything, they besiege the mountain. However, Thorin manages to send a message to his kinfolk in the Iron Hills and reinforces his position. Bilbo slips out and gives the Arkenstone to the besiegers, hoping to head off a war. When they offer the jewel to Thorin in exchange for treasure, Bilbo reveals how they obtained it. Thorin, furious at what he sees as betrayal, banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable when Dain, Thorin&#x27;s second cousin, arrives with an army of dwarf warriors.

Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn, who fights in his bear form and kills the goblin general, do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.

Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returns home a very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left. Years later, he writes the story of his adventures.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Background ===

In the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, including &quot;Goblin Feet&quot; and &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked&quot;, a reworking of the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot;. His creative endeavours at this time also included letters from Father Christmas to his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warring gnomes and goblins, and a helpful polar bear—alongside the creation of elven languages and an attendant mythology, including &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, which he had been creating since 1917. These works all saw posthumous publication.

In a 1955 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien recollects that he began &quot;The Hobbit&quot; one day early in the 1930s. While he was marking School Certificate papers, he found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, &quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.&quot; By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including C. S. Lewis and a student of Tolkien&#x27;s named Elaine Griffiths. In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen &amp; Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien. In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner&#x27;s favourable comments settled Allen &amp; Unwin&#x27;s decision to publish Tolkien&#x27;s book.

=== Setting ===

The setting of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as described on its original dust jacket, is &quot;ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men&quot; in an unnamed fantasy world. The world is shown on the endpaper map as &quot;Western Lands&quot; westward and &quot;Wilderland&quot; as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, he decided these stories could fit into the legendarium he had been working on privately for decades. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; became the end of the &quot;Third Age&quot; of Middle Earth within Arda. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published as &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and other posthumous works.

=== Illustration and design ===

Tolkien&#x27;s correspondence and publisher&#x27;s records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: &quot;In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen &amp; Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.&quot;

Even the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished &quot;Thror&#x27;s Map&quot; to be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the &quot;moon letter&quot; runes on the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, &quot;Thror&#x27;s map&quot;, and the &quot;Map of Wilderland&quot; (see Rhovanion), both printed in black and red on the paper&#x27;s cream background.

Originally Allen &amp; Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien&#x27;s first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher&#x27;s staff that they opted to include them without raising the book&#x27;s price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: &quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water&quot;, &quot;The Trolls&quot;, &quot;The Mountain Path&quot;, &quot;The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate&quot;, &quot;Beorn&#x27;s Hall&quot;, &quot;Mirkwood&quot;, &quot;The Elvenking&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Lake Town&quot;, &quot;The Front Gate&quot;, and &quot;The Hall at Bag-End&quot;. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.

Satisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.

The publisher&#x27;s production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author&#x27;s. The spine shows runes: two &quot;þ&quot; (Thrain and Thror) runes and one &quot;d&quot; (door). The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien&#x27;s style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.

Once illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (&quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water&quot;) in colour and the addition of new colour plates: &quot;Rivendell&quot;, &quot;Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes&quot;, &quot;Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elves&quot; and &quot;Conversation with Smaug&quot;, which features a dwarvish curse written in Tolkien&#x27;s invented script Tengwar, and signed with two &quot;þ&quot; (&quot;Th&quot;) runes. The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen &amp; Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception of &quot;Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes&quot;.

Different editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions. Some cheaper editions, particularly paperback, are not illustrated except with the maps. &quot;The Children&#x27;s Book Club&quot; edition of 1942 includes the black-and-white pictures but no maps, an anomaly. Douglas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; is illustrated with many black-and-white drawings taken from translations of the story into some 25 languages.

Tolkien&#x27;s use of runes, both as decorative devices and as magical signs within the story, has been cited as a major cause for the popularization of runes within &quot;New Age&quot; and esoteric literature, stemming from Tolkien&#x27;s popularity with the elements of counter-culture in the 1970s.

=== Genre ===

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; takes cues from narrative models of children&#x27;s literature, as shown by its omniscient narrator and characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, and morally ambiguous Bilbo. The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes &quot;safe&quot; from &quot;dangerous&quot; in its geography. Both are key elements of works intended for children, as is the &quot;home-away-home&quot; (or &quot;there and back again&quot;) plot structure typical of the Bildungsroman. While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly, the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel. The scholar Lois R. Kuznets comments that the &quot;obtrusive narrator&quot; is part of a standard &quot;rhetoric of childhood&quot;; C. W. Sullivan III adds that Tolkien may have taken the idea of an intrusive narrator from the medieval texts &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. Emer O&#x27;Sullivan, in her &quot;Comparative Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, notes &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as one of a handful of children&#x27;s books that have been accepted into mainstream literature, alongside Jostein Gaarder&#x27;s &quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot; (1991) and J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series (1997–2007).

Tolkien intended &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a &quot;fairy-story&quot; and wrote it in a tone suited to addressing children; he said later that the book was not specifically written for children, but had rather been created out of his interest in mythology and legend. Many of the initial reviews refer to the work as a fairy story. However, according to Jack Zipes writing in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales&quot;, Bilbo is an atypical character for a fairy tale. The work is much longer than Tolkien&#x27;s ideal proposed in his essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;. Many fairy tale motifs, such as the repetition of similar events seen in the dwarves&#x27; arrival at Bilbo&#x27;s and Beorn&#x27;s homes, and folklore themes, such as trolls turning to stone, are to be found in the story.

The book is popularly called (and often marketed as) a fantasy novel, but like &quot;Peter Pan and Wendy&quot; by J. M. Barrie and &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; by George MacDonald, both of which influenced Tolkien and contain fantasy elements, it is primarily identified as being children&#x27;s literature. The two genres are not mutually exclusive, so some definitions of high fantasy include works for children by authors such as L. Frank Baum and Lloyd Alexander alongside the works of Gene Wolfe and Jonathan Swift, which are more often considered adult literature. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has been called &quot;the most popular of all twentieth-century fantasies written for children&quot;. Jane Chance, however, considers the book to be a children&#x27;s novel only in the sense that it appeals to the child in an adult reader. Sullivan credits the first publication of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as an important step in the development of high fantasy, and further credits the 1960s paperback debuts of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as essential to the creation of a mass market for fiction of this kind as well as the fantasy genre&#x27;s current status.

=== Style ===

Tolkien&#x27;s prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as given the existence of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams&#x27; &quot;Watership Down&quot; and Peter Beagle&#x27;s &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, accepts readers into the fictional world, rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality. While &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children&#x27;s and Anglo-Saxon literature), has his own linguistic style separate from those of the main characters.

The basic form of the story is that of a quest, told in episodes. For the most part of the book, each chapter introduces a different denizen of the Wilderland, some helpful and friendly towards the protagonists, and others threatening or dangerous. However the general tone is kept light-hearted, being interspersed with songs and humour. One example of the use of song to maintain tone is when Thorin and Company are kidnapped by goblins, who, when marching them into the underworld, sing:

This onomatopoeic singing undercuts the dangerous scene with a sense of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well, as seen in the foolishness and Cockney dialect of the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors. The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model of &quot;The Icelandic Journals&quot; by William Morris, an important literary influence on Tolkien.

== Influences ==

=== Norse mythology ===

Tolkien&#x27;s works show many influences from Norse mythology, reflecting his lifelong passion for those stories and his academic interest in Germanic philology. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is no exception to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages, especially from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. Examples include the names of the dwarves, Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Dwalin, Balin, Dain, Nain, and Thorin Oakenshield, along with Gandalf which was a dwarf-name in the Norse. But while their names are Norse, the characters of the dwarves are based on fairy tales such as &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Snow-White and Rose-Red&quot; as collected by the Brothers Grimm, while the latter tale may have influenced the character of Beorn.

Tolkien&#x27;s use of descriptive names such as &quot;Misty Mountains&quot; and &quot;Bag End&quot; echoes the names used in Old Norse sagas. The names of the dwarf-friendly ravens, such as Roäc, are derived from the Old Norse words for &quot;raven&quot; and &quot;rook&quot;, but their peaceful characters are unlike the typical carrion birds from Old Norse and Old English literature. Tolkien is not simply skimming historical sources for effect: the juxtaposition of old and new styles of expression is seen by the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey as one of the major themes explored in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Maps figure in both saga literature and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

=== Old English literature ===

Themes from Old English literature, especially from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, shape the ancient world which Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, counted the epic among his &quot;most valued sources&quot; for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Tolkien was one of the first critics to treat &quot;Beowulf&quot; as a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, with his 1936 lecture &quot;&quot;. Tolkien borrowed several elements from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon. Certain descriptions in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; seem to have been lifted straight out of &quot;Beowulf&quot; with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders. Likewise, Tolkien&#x27;s descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Other specific plot elements and features in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; that show similarities to &quot;Beowulf&quot; include the title of &quot;thief&quot;, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug&#x27;s personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town. Tolkien refines parts of &quot;Beowulf&quot; plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon&#x27;s intellect and personality.

Named swords of renown, adorned with runes, similarly have Old English connections. In using his elf-sword, Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the sword &quot;Sting&quot; we see Bilbo&#x27;s acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon&#x27;s hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring &quot;Beowulf&quot; and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, &quot;The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of &quot;Beowulf&quot; would say much the same.&quot; The name of the wizard Radagast is taken from the name of the Slavic deity Radogost.

=== Medieval and mythological sources ===

The representation of the dwarves in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding the Jewish people and their history. The dwarves&#x27; characteristics of being dispossessed of their ancient homeland at the Lonely Mountain, and living among other groups whilst retaining their own culture are all derived from the medieval image of Jews, whilst their warlike nature stems from accounts in the Hebrew Bible. The Dwarvish calendar invented for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reflects the Jewish calendar which begins in late autumn. And although Tolkien denied that he used allegory, the dwarves taking Bilbo out of his complacent existence has been seen as an eloquent metaphor for the &quot;impoverishment of Western society without Jews.&quot;

The scholar of literature James L. Hodge describes the story as picaresque, a genre of fiction in which a hero relies on his wits to survive a series of risky episodes. Hodge further likens Bilbo&#x27;s admittedly unheroic business of burglary to the trickster role of some pagan gods and mythical figures: Hermes steals cattle from Apollo, Prometheus and Coyote steal fire, Odin steals the mead of poetry, and so on. Hodge quotes the psychiatrist Carl Jung as saying that the figure of the trickster occurs in every age, whether in sacred rites or picaresque stories. Jaume Albero Poveda similarly calls the &quot;comical episodes&quot; like the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum &quot;typical of the picaresque novel&quot;.

=== 19th century fiction ===

Tolkien wished to imitate the prose and poetry romances of the 19th-century Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris in style and approach. The Desolation of Smaug, portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, is a motif explicitly borrowed from Morris. The Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns writes that Bilbo&#x27;s character and adventures match many details of Morris&#x27;s expedition in Iceland. She comments, for instance, that the humorous drawings of Morris riding through the wilds of Iceland by his friend the artist Edward Burne-Jones can serve well as models for Bilbo on his adventures.

Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Black Douglas&quot; and of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain, Gilles de Retz. Incidents in both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; are similar in narrative and style to the novel, and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.

The Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker has catalogued a lengthy series of parallels between &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and Jules Verne&#x27;s 1864 &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. These include, among other things, a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment that direct the adventurers to the goals of their quests.

Tolkien&#x27;s portrayal of goblins in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was particularly influenced by George MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot;. However, MacDonald&#x27;s influence on Tolkien was more profound than the shaping of individual characters and episodes; his works helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role of fantasy within his Christian faith.

== Critical analysis ==

=== Themes ===

The evolution and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is central to the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seen in psychological terms as a Bildungsroman rather than a traditional quest. The Jungian concept of individuation is also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbo&#x27;s personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves. Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge. The analogue of the &quot;underworld&quot; and the hero returning from it with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythic archetypes regarding initiation and male coming-of-age as described by Joseph Campbell. 
Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from the &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot; (which Tolkien had written on in 1929), and a Christian understanding of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Shippey comments that Bilbo is nothing like a king, and that Chance&#x27;s talk of &quot;types&quot; just muddies the waters, though he agrees with her that there are &quot;self-images of Tolkien&quot; throughout his fiction; and she is right, too, in seeing Middle-earth as a balance between creativity and scholarship, &quot;Germanic past and Christian present&quot;.

The overcoming of greed and selfishness has been seen as the central moral of the story. Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters&#x27; simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels, it is only by the Arkenstone&#x27;s influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices &quot;coveting&quot; and &quot;malignancy&quot;, come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and &quot;at your services&quot; he had previously bestowed. In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in the &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, and there are connections between the words &quot;Arkenstone&quot; and &quot;Silmaril&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented etymologies.

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; employs themes of animism. An important concept in anthropology and child development, animism is the idea that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the &quot;Doctor Dolittle Theme&quot; in &quot;The History of The Hobbit&quot;, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These sapient beings include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien&#x27;s other works, and mentions the &quot;roots of mountains&quot; and &quot;feet of trees&quot; in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate. Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: &quot;...The first men to talk of &#x27;trees and stars&#x27; saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was &#x27;myth-woven and elf-patterned&#x27;.&quot;

=== Interpretation ===

As in plot and setting, Tolkien brings his literary theories to bear in forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum&#x27;s riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters&#x27; individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Smaug is the main antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode reflects and references the dragon of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence. Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend of St. George. Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of Pandæmonium with its &quot;Belched fire and rolling smoke&quot; in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Of all the characters, Smaug&#x27;s speech is the most modern, using idioms such as &quot;Don&#x27;t let your imagination run away with you!&quot;

Just as Tolkien&#x27;s literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien&#x27;s experiences. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; may be read as Tolkien&#x27;s parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile. The tale as such explores the theme of heroism. As Janet Brennan Croft notes, Tolkien&#x27;s literary reaction to war at this time differed from most post-war writers by eschewing irony as a method for distancing events and instead using mythology to mediate his experiences. Similarities to the works of other writers who faced the Great War are seen in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, including portraying warfare as anti-pastoral: in &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, both the area under the influence of Smaug before his demise and the setting for the Battle of Five Armies later are described as barren, damaged landscapes. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; makes a warning against repeating the tragedies of World War I, and Tolkien&#x27;s attitude as a veteran may well be summed up by Bilbo&#x27;s comment: &quot;Victory after all, I suppose! Well, it seems a very gloomy business.&quot;

== Reception ==

On its publication in October 1937, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in the UK and the US, including &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Catholic World&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot;. C. S. Lewis, friend of Tolkien (and later author of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; between 1949 and 1954), writing in &quot;The Times&quot; reports:

The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar&#x27;s with the poet&#x27;s grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib &quot;originality.&quot;

Lewis compares the book to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongside &quot;Flatland&quot;, &quot;Phantastes&quot;, and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. W. H. Auden, in his review of the sequel &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, calls &quot;The Hobbit&quot; &quot;one of the best children&#x27;s stories of this century&quot;. Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien, and they became friends.

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was nominated for the Carnegie Medal, and awarded a prize from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; for best juvenile fiction of 1938. More recently, the book has been recognized as &quot;Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)&quot; in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Books of the Century&quot; poll in &quot;Books for Keeps&quot;. In 2012 it was ranked number 14 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

Publication of the sequel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; altered many critics&#x27; reception of the work. Instead of approaching &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a children&#x27;s book in its own right, critics such as Randel Helms picked up on the idea of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as being a &quot;prelude&quot;, relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a presentist interpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original&#x27;s value as a children&#x27;s book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book&#x27;s influence on these genres. Commentators such as Paul Kocher, John D. Rateliff and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers&#x27; expectations of tone and style.

== Publication ==

George Allen &amp; Unwin published the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; on 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews. This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed the dust jacket as well. Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York reset type for an American edition, to be released early in 1938, in which four of the illustrations would be colour plates. Allen &amp; Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937. Despite the book&#x27;s popularity, paper rationing due to World War II and not ending until 1949 meant that the Allen &amp; Unwin edition of the book was often unavailable during this period.

Subsequent editions in English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978 and 1995. Numerous English-language editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; have been produced by several publishers, making it one of the best-selling books of all time with over 100 million copies sold by 2012. In addition, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has been translated into over sixty languages, with more than one published version for some languages.

=== Revisions ===

In December 1937 &quot;The Hobbit&quot; publisher, Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted &quot;more about hobbits&quot;. Tolkien subsequently began work on &quot;The New Hobbit&quot;, which would eventually become &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a course that would not only change the context of the original story, but lead to substantial changes to the character of Gollum.

In the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably. In the second edition edits, to reflect the new concept of the One Ring and its corrupting abilities, Tolkien made Gollum more aggressive towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring. The encounter ends with Gollum&#x27;s curse, &quot;Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!&quot; This presages Gollum&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Tolkien sent this revised version of the chapter &quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot; to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but he heard nothing back for years. When he was sent galley proofs of a new edition, Tolkien was surprised to find that the sample text had been incorporated. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the original version of the riddle game is explained as a lie made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the &quot;true&quot; account. The revised text became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and the US.

Tolkien began a new version in 1960, attempting to adjust the tone of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to its sequel. He abandoned the new revision at chapter three after he received criticism that it &quot;just wasn&#x27;t &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, implying it had lost much of its light-hearted tone and quick pace.

After an unauthorized paperback edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; appeared from Ace Books in 1965, Houghton Mifflin and Ballantine asked Tolkien to refresh the text of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to renew the US copyright. This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien took the opportunity to align the narrative more closely to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and to cosmological developments from his still unpublished &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; as it stood at that time. These were mostly small edits; for example, changing the phrase &quot;elves that are now called Gnomes&quot; from the first, and second editions, on page 63, to &quot;High Elves of the West, my kin&quot; in the third edition. Tolkien had used &quot;gnome&quot; in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of the High Elves—the Noldor (or &quot;Deep Elves&quot;)—thinking that &quot;gnome&quot;, derived from the Greek &quot;gnosis&quot; (knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of the term&#x27;s association with garden gnomes, Tolkien abandoned the term. This edition also introduced a new version of the history of Erebor. In the original story, Erebor was founded by Thorin&#x27;s grandfather Thror, and the Arkenstone discovered by his father Thrain. However, to correct a note on the map saying that Thrain had been King Under the Mountain, Tolkien introduced a distant ancestor Thrain I in the third edition text, who both founded the kingdom and discovered the Arkenstone.

=== Posthumous critical editions ===
Since the author&#x27;s death, two critical editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; have been published, providing commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In his 1988 &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot;, Douglas Anderson provides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them works by Tove Jansson.

With &quot;The History of The Hobbit&quot;, published in two parts in 2007, John D. Rateliff provides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien&#x27;s scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. In addition, Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling of the first three chapters, which sought to harmonise &quot;The Hobbit&quot; with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien&#x27;s text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.

===Commercial success and collectors&#x27; market===

While reliable figures are difficult to obtain, estimated global sales of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; run between 35 and 100 million copies since 1937. In the UK &quot;The Hobbit&quot; has not retreated from the top 5,000 bestselling books measured by Nielsen BookScan since 1998, when the index began, achieving a three-year sales peak rising from 33,084 (2000) to 142,541 (2001), 126,771 (2002) and 61,229 (2003), ranking it at the 3rd position in Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Evergreen&quot; book list. The enduring popularity of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; makes early printings of the book attractive collectors&#x27; items. The first printing of the first English-language edition can sell for between £6,000 and £20,000 at auction, while the price for a signed first edition has reached over £60,000.

==Legacy==

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;===

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; sequel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure in the same sequence: the stories are both quests starting at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel&#x27;s main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); they engage another group of elves (Mirkwood/Lothlórien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/the Dead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Esgaroth/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off/the Scouring of the Shire). Scholars including Paul H. Kocher and Randel Helms have documented the similarities.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; contains several more supporting scenes, and has a more sophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not. Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a story for children, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien&#x27;s concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.

===In education===

The style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers&#x27; literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works of Dickens and Shakespeare. Further, it may exercise the reading skills of advanced younger readers better than much modern fiction for teenagers. Educationalists have seen &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a means to encourage literacy among 11- to 14-year-old boys in particular.

===Adaptations===

&quot;The Hobbit&quot; has been adapted many times for a variety of media, starting with a March 1953 stage production by St. Margaret&#x27;s School, Edinburgh. The first motion picture adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was Gene Deitch&#x27;s 1966 short film of cartoon stills.
In 1968, BBC Radio 4 broadcast an 8-part radio drama version by Michael Kilgarriff. 
In 1974, Nicol Williamson recorded an abridged version of the book on 4 long-playing records for the Argo Records label, voicing all the characters. 
In 1977, Rankin/Bass made an animated film based on the book. In 1978, Romeo Muller won a Peabody Award for his teleplay, though critics described it as &quot;execrable&quot; and &quot;confusing&quot;. A children&#x27;s opera composed by Dean Burry appeared in 2004 in Toronto.
Between 2012 and 2014, Peter Jackson&#x27;s three-part live-action film version appeared on cinema screens.
Several computer and video games have been based on the story, including a 1982 game by Beam Software.
During the COVID-19 lockdown, Andy Serkis read the whole of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to raise money for charity. He then recorded the work again as an audiobook, with cover art by Alan Lee.

<doc id="30296" wikidata="Q1666873" url="?curid=30296" title="Tax Freedom Day">
<text>Tax Freedom Day is a concept developed and trademarked by American businessman Dallas Hostetler, which aims to calculate the first day of the year on which a nation as a whole has theoretically earned enough income to pay its taxes. Every dollar that is officially considered income by the government is counted, and every payment to the government that is officially considered a tax is counted. Taxes at all levels of government – local, state and federal – are included.

== History and methodology ==
The concept of Tax Freedom Day was developed in 1948 by Florida businessman Dallas Hostetler, who trademarked the phrase &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; and calculated it each year for the next two decades. In 1971, Hostetler retired and transferred the trademark to the Tax Foundation.

==United States==

In the United States, the &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; is annually calculated by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank. Their results are as follows:
==Around the world==
Many other companies and organizations in countries throughout the world now produce their own &quot;Tax Freedom Day&quot; analysis. According to the Tax Foundation, Tax Freedom Day reports are currently being published in eight countries. Due to the different ways that nations collect and categorize public finance data, however, Tax Freedom Days are not necessarily directly comparable from one country to another.

===European Union===

A 2010 study published in L&#x27;Anglophone, a Brussels newspaper, compared the tax burdens of &quot;Average Joes&quot; in each of the 27 EU member states and projected the Tax Freedom Day for workers earning a typical wage. Income taxes, social security contributions (by the employee and the employer) and projected VAT contributions were included in the calculations.

Regarding the discrepancy between their calculation of August 3 as the typical Belgian worker&#x27;s Tax Freedom Day and that of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC), L&#x27;Anglophone&#x27;s authors wrote:


==Criticism==
In the book &quot;Filthy Lucre: Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism&quot;, philosopher Joseph Heath criticizes the idea that tax-paying is inherently different from consumption:

It would make just as much sense to declare an annual &quot;mortgage freedom day&quot;, in order to let mortgage owners know what day they &quot;stop working for the bank and start working for themselves&quot;. ...But who cares? Homeowners are not really &quot;working for the bank&quot;; they&#x27;re merely financing their own consumption. After all, they&#x27;re the ones living in the house, not the bank manager.
===Mathematical===
For Canada, the Fraser Institute also includes a &quot;Personal Tax Freedom Day Calculator&quot; that estimates a customized Tax Freedom Day based on additional variables such as age of household head, sex of household head, marital status and number of children. However, the Fraser Institute&#x27;s figures have been disputed. For example, a 2005 study by Osgoode Hall Law Professor Neil Brooks argued that the Fraser Institute&#x27;s Tax Freedom Day analysis includes flawed accounting, including the exclusion of several important forms of income and overstating tax figures, moving the date nearly two months later.

In America, while Tax Freedom Day presents an &quot;average American&quot; tax burden, it is not a tax burden typical for an American. That is, the tax burdens of most Americans are substantially overstated by Tax Freedom Day. The larger tax bills associated with higher incomes increases the average tax burden above that of most Americans.

The Tax Foundation defends its methodology by pointing out that Tax Freedom Day is the U.S. economy&#x27;s overall average tax burden—not the tax burden of the &quot;average&quot; American, which is how it is often misinterpreted by members of the media. Tax Foundation materials do not use the phrase &quot;tax burden of the average American&quot;, although members of the media often make this mistake.

Another criticism is that the calculation includes capital gains taxes but not capital gains income, thus overstating the tax burden. For example, in the late 1990s the US Tax Freedom Day moved later, reaching its latest date ever in 2000, but this was largely due to capital gains taxes on the bull market of that era rather than an increase in tax rates. In other words, variations in capital gains income and their associated taxes cause changes in the amount of taxes, but not in the income used in the calculation of Tax Freedom Day.

The Tax Foundation argues that the Tax Freedom Day calculation does not include capital gains as income because it uses income and tax data directly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). BEA has never counted capital gains as income since they don&#x27;t represent current production available to pay taxes, and so the Tax Foundation excludes them as well. Additionally, the Tax Foundation argues that the exclusion of capital gains income is irrelevant in most years since including capital gains would only shift Tax Freedom Day by 1 percent in either direction in most years. A 1 percent change would represent 3.65 days. From 1968 to 2019 the date has never left the 21-day range of April 13 to May 3.

<text>A tax is a mandatory financial charge or levy imposed on an individual or legal entity by a governmental organization to support government spending and public expenditures collectively or to regulate and reduce negative externalities. Tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behavior aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax relief. The first known taxation occurred in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as labor equivalent.

All countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some countries levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of yearly income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual&#x27;s income and corporate income. Countries or sub-units often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, environmental taxes, payroll taxes, duties, or tariffs. It is also possible to levy a tax on tax, as with a gross receipts tax.

In economic terms (circular flow of income), taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This affects economic growth and welfare, which can be increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, as although taxation is deemed necessary by consensus for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner through the government provision of public goods and public services, others such as libertarians are anti-taxation and denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying taxation as theft or extortion through coercion along with the use of force. Within market economies, taxation is considered the most viable option to operate the government (instead of widespread state ownership of the means of production), as taxation enables the government to generate revenue without heavily interfering with the market and private businesses; taxation preserves the efficiency and productivity of the private sector by allowing individuals and companies to make their own economic decisions, engage in flexible production, competition, and innovation as a result of market forces.

Certain countries (usually small in size or population, which results in a smaller infrastructure and social expenditure) function as tax havens by imposing minimal taxes on the personal income of individuals and corporate income. These tax havens attract capital from abroad (particularly from larger economies) while resulting in loss of tax revenues within other non-haven countries (through base erosion and profit shifting).
==Overview==

Legal and economic definitions of taxes differ, such that many transfers to governments are not considered taxes by economists. For example, some transfers to the public sector are comparable to prices. Examples include tuition at public universities and fees for utilities provided by local governments. Governments also obtain resources by &quot;creating&quot; money and coins (for example, by printing bills and by minting coins), through voluntary gifts (for example, contributions to public universities and museums), by imposing penalties (such as traffic fines), by borrowing and confiscating criminal proceeds. From the view of economists, a tax is a non-penal, yet compulsory transfer of resources from the private to the public sector, levied on a basis of predetermined criteria and without reference to specific benefits received.

In modern taxation systems, governments levy taxes in money, but in-kind and &quot;corvée&quot; taxation are characteristic of traditional or pre-capitalist states and their functional equivalents. The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in politics and economics. Tax collection is performed by a government agency such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom, the Canada Revenue Agency or the Australian Taxation Office. When taxes are not fully paid, the state may impose civil penalties (such as fines or forfeiture) or criminal penalties (such as incarceration) on the non-paying entity or individual.

==Purposes and effects==

The levying of taxes aims to raise revenue to fund governing, to alter prices in order to affect demand, or to regulate some form of cost or benefit. States and their functional equivalents throughout history have used the money provided by taxation to carry out many functions. Some of these include expenditures on economic infrastructure (roads, public transportation, sanitation, legal systems, public security, public education, public health systems), military, scientific research &amp; development, culture and the arts, public works, distribution, data collection and dissemination, public insurance, and the operation of government itself. A government&#x27;s ability to raise taxes is called its fiscal capacity.

When expenditures exceed tax revenue, a government accumulates government debt. A portion of taxes may be used to service past debts. Governments also use taxes to fund welfare and public services. These services can include education systems, pensions for the elderly, unemployment benefits, transfer payments, subsidies and public transportation. Energy, water and waste management systems are also common public utilities.

According to the proponents of the chartalist theory of money creation, taxes are not needed for government revenue, as long as the government in question is able to issue fiat money. According to this view, the purpose of taxation is to maintain the stability of the currency, express public policy regarding the distribution of wealth, subsidizing certain industries or population groups or isolating the costs of certain benefits, such as highways or social security.

==Types==
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publishes an analysis of the tax systems of member countries. As part of such analysis, OECD has developed a definition and system of classification of internal taxes, generally followed below. In addition, many countries impose taxes (tariffs) on the import of goods.

===Income Taxation===

====Income tax====

Many jurisdictions tax the income of individuals and of business entities, including corporations. Generally, the authorities impose a tax on net profits from a business, on net gains, and on other income. Computation of income subject to tax may be determined under accounting principles used in the jurisdiction, which tax-law principles in the jurisdiction may modify or replace. The incidence of taxation varies by system, and some systems may be viewed as progressive or regressive. Rates of tax may vary or be constant (flat) by income level. Many systems allow individuals certain personal allowances and other non-business reductions to taxable income, although business deductions tend to be favored over personal deductions.

Tax-collection agencies often collect personal income tax on a pay-as-you-earn basis, with corrections made after the end of the tax year. These corrections take one of two forms:

* payments to the government, from taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year
* tax refunds from the government to those who have overpaid

Income-tax systems often make deductions available that reduce the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to count against another – for example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business income tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.

====Negative income tax====

In economics, a negative income tax (abbreviated NIT) is a progressive income tax system where people earning below a certain amount receive supplemental payment from the government instead of paying taxes to the government.

====Capital gains====

Most jurisdictions imposing an income tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital-gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital.

====Corporate====

Corporate tax refers to income tax, capital tax, net-worth tax, or other taxes imposed on corporations. Rates of tax and the taxable base for corporations may differ from those for individuals or for other taxable persons.

===Social-security contributions===
Many countries provide publicly funded retirement or healthcare systems. In connection with these systems, the country typically requires employers or employees to make compulsory payments. These payments are often computed by reference to wages or earnings from self-employment. Tax rates are generally fixed, but a different rate may be imposed on employers than on employees. Some systems provide an upper limit on earnings subject to the tax. A few systems provide that the tax is payable only on wages above a particular amount. Such upper or lower limits may apply for retirement but not for health-care components of the tax. Some have argued that such taxes on wages are a form of &quot;forced savings&quot; and not really a tax, while others point to redistribution through such systems between generations (from newer cohorts to older cohorts) and across income levels (from higher income levels to lower income-levels) which suggests that such programs are really taxed and spending programs.

===Payroll or workforce===
Unemployment and similar taxes are often imposed on employers based on the total payroll. These taxes may be imposed in both the country and sub-country levels.

===Wealth===
A wealth tax is levied on the total value of personal assets, including: bank deposits, real estate, assets in insurance and pension plans, ownership of unincorporated businesses, financial securities, and personal trusts. Liabilities (primarily mortgages and other loans) are typically deducted, hence it is sometimes called a net wealth tax.

===Property===
Recurrent property taxes may be imposed on immovable property (real property) and on some classes of movable property. In addition, recurrent taxes may be imposed on the net wealth of individuals or corporations. Many jurisdictions impose inheritance tax on property at time of inheritance or gift tax at the time of gift transfer. Some jurisdictions impose taxes on financial or capital transactions.

====Property taxes====

A property tax (or millage tax) is an &quot; ad valorem&quot; tax levy on the value of a property that the owner of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. There are three general varieties of property: land, improvements to land (immovable human-made things, e.g. buildings), and personal property (movable things). Real estate or realty is the combination of land and improvements to the land.

Property taxes are usually charged on a recurrent basis (e.g., yearly). A common type of property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of real estate, where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695, the government of England levied a window tax, with the result that one can still see listed buildings with windows bricked up in order to save their owner&#x27;s money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common types of event-driven property taxes are stamp duty, charged upon change of ownership, and inheritance tax, which many countries impose on the estates of the deceased.

In contrast with a tax on real estate (land and buildings), a land-value tax (or LVT) is levied only on the unimproved value of the land (&quot;land&quot; in this instance may mean either the economic term, i.e., all-natural resources, or the natural resources associated with specific areas of the Earth&#x27;s surface: &quot;lots&quot; or &quot;land parcels&quot;). Proponents of the land-value tax argue that it is economically justified, as it will not deter production, distort market mechanisms or otherwise create deadweight losses the way other taxes do.

When real estate is held by a higher government unit or some other entity not subject to taxation by the local government, the taxing authority may receive a payment in lieu of taxes to compensate it for some or all of the foregone tax revenues.

In many jurisdictions (including many American states), there is a general tax levied periodically on residents who own personal property (personalty) within the jurisdiction. Vehicle and boat registration fees are subsets of this kind of tax. The tax is often designed with blanket coverage and large exceptions for things like food and clothing. Household goods are often exempt when kept or used within the household. Any otherwise non-exempt object can lose its exemption if regularly kept outside the household. Thus, tax collectors often monitor newspaper articles for stories about wealthy people who have lent art to museums for public display, because the artworks have then become subject to personal property tax. If an artwork had to be sent to another state for some touch-ups, it may have become subject to personal property tax in &quot;that&quot; state as well.

====Inheritance====

Inheritance tax, also called estate tax, are taxes that arise for inheritance or inherited income. In United States tax law, there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax: the former taxes the personal representatives of the deceased, while the latter taxes the beneficiaries of the estate. However, this distinction does not apply in other jurisdictions; for example, if using this terminology UK inheritance tax would be an estate tax. 

====Expatriation====

An expatriation tax is a tax on individuals who renounce their citizenship or residence. The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual&#x27;s property. One example is the United States under the &quot;American Jobs Creation Act&quot;, where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a higher tax rate.

====Transfer====

Historically, in many countries, a contract needs to have a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the value of the transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the United States, transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.

====Wealth (net worth)====

Some countries&#x27; governments will require a declaration of the taxpayers&#x27; balance sheet (assets and liabilities), and from that exact a tax on net worth (assets minus liabilities), as a percentage of the net worth, or a percentage of the net worth exceeding a certain level. The tax may be levied on &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;legal persons.&quot;

===Goods and services===
====Value added====

A value-added tax (VAT), also known as Goods and Services Tax (GST), Single Business Tax, or Turnover Tax in some countries, applies the equivalent of a sales tax to every operation that creates value. To give an example, sheet steel is imported by a machine manufacturer. That manufacturer will pay the VAT on the purchase price, remitting that amount to the government. The manufacturer will then transform the steel into a machine, selling the machine for a higher price to a wholesale distributor. The manufacturer will collect the VAT on the higher price but will remit to the government only the excess related to the &quot;value-added&quot; (the price over the cost of the sheet steel). The wholesale distributor will then continue the process, charging the retail distributor the VAT on the entire price to the retailer, but remitting only the amount related to the distribution mark-up to the government. The last VAT amount is paid by the eventual retail customer who cannot recover any of the previously paid VAT. For a VAT and sales tax of identical rates, the total tax paid is the same, but it is paid at differing points in the process.

VAT is usually administrated by requiring the company to complete a VAT return, giving details of VAT it has been charged (referred to as input tax) and VAT it has charged to others (referred to as output tax). The difference between output tax and input tax is payable to the Local Tax Authority.

Many tax authorities have introduced automated VAT which has increased accountability and auditability, by utilizing computer systems, thereby also enabling anti-cybercrime offices as well.

====Sales====

Sales taxes are levied when a commodity is sold to its final consumer. Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The question of whether they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities, and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend a higher proportion of their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic &quot;You pay for what you spend&quot; tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.

A small number of U.S. states rely entirely on sales taxes for state revenue, as those states do not levy a state income tax. Such states tend to have a moderate to a large amount of tourism or inter-state travel that occurs within their borders, allowing the state to benefit from taxes from people the state would otherwise not tax. In this way, the state is able to reduce the tax burden on its citizens. The U.S. states that do not levy a state income tax are Alaska, Tennessee, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington state, and Wyoming. Additionally, New Hampshire and Tennessee levy state income taxes only on dividends and interest income. Of the above states, only Alaska and New Hampshire do not levy a state sales tax. Additional information can be obtained at the Federation of Tax Administrators website.

In the United States, there is a growing movement for the replacement of all federal payroll and income taxes (both corporate and personal) with a national retail sales tax and monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens. The tax proposal is named FairTax. In Canada, the federal sales tax is called the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and now stands at 5%. The provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Prince Edward Island also have a provincial sales tax [PST]. The provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, and Ontario have harmonized their provincial sales taxes with the GST—Harmonized Sales Tax [HST], and thus is a full VAT. The province of Quebec collects the Quebec Sales Tax [QST] which is based on the GST with certain differences. Most businesses can claim back the GST, HST, and QST they pay, and so effectively it is the final consumer who pays the tax.

====Excises====

An excise duty is an indirect tax imposed upon goods during the process of their manufacture, production or distribution, and is usually proportionate to their quantity or value. Excise duties were first introduced into England in the year 1643, as part of a scheme of revenue and taxation devised by parliamentarian John Pym and approved by the Long Parliament. These duties consisted of charges on beer, ale, cider, cherry wine, and tobacco, to which list were afterward added paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and sweets. The basic principle of excise duties was that they were taxes on the production, manufacture, or distribution of articles which could not be taxed through the customs house, and revenue derived from that source is called excise revenue proper. The fundamental conception of the term is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles (a customs duty).

Excises (or exemptions from them) are also used to modify consumption patterns of a certain area (social engineering). For example, a high excise is used to discourage alcohol consumption, relative to other goods. This may be combined with hypothecation if the proceeds are then used to pay for the costs of treating illness caused by alcohol use disorder. Similar taxes may exist on tobacco, pornography, marijuana etc., and they may be collectively referred to as &quot;sin taxes&quot;. A carbon tax is a tax on the consumption of carbon-based non-renewable fuels, such as petrol, diesel-fuel, jet fuels, and natural gas. The object is to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. In the United Kingdom, vehicle excise duty is an annual tax on vehicle ownership.

===Tariff===

An import or export tariff (also called customs duty or impost) is a charge for the movement of goods through a political border. Tariffs discourage trade, and they may be used by governments to protect domestic industries. A proportion of tariff revenues is often hypothecated to pay the government to maintain a navy or border police. The classic ways of cheating a tariff are smuggling or declaring a false value of goods. Tax, tariff and trade rules in modern times are usually set together because of their common impact on industrial policy, investment policy, and agricultural policy. A trade bloc is a group of allied countries agreeing to minimize or eliminate tariffs against trade with each other, and possibly to impose protective tariffs on imports from outside the bloc. A customs union has a common external tariff, and the participating countries share the revenues from tariffs on goods entering the customs union.

In some societies, tariffs also could be imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods between regions (or via specific internal gateways). A notable example is the &quot;likin&quot;, which became an important revenue source for local governments in the late Qing China.

===Other===

====License fees====
Occupational taxes or license fees may be imposed on businesses or individuals engaged in certain businesses. Many jurisdictions impose a tax on vehicles.

====Poll====

A poll tax, also called a &quot;per capita tax&quot;, or &quot;capitation tax&quot;, is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It is an example of the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11–16) was a form of the poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes, therefore, do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the new poll tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the &#x27;Poll Tax Riots&#x27;.

====Other====
Some types of taxes have been proposed but not actually adopted in any major jurisdiction. These include:
* Bank tax
* Financial transaction taxes including currency transaction taxes

===Descriptive labels===

====Ad valorem and per unit====

An &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax is one where the tax base is the value of a good, service, or property. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value-added taxes are different types of ad valorem tax. An ad valorem tax is typically imposed at the time of a transaction (sales tax or value-added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).

In contrast to ad valorem taxation is a &quot;per unit&quot; tax, where the tax base is the quantity of something, regardless of its price. An excise tax is an example.

====Consumption====

Consumption tax refers to any tax on non-investment spending and can be implemented by means of a sales tax, consumer value-added tax, or by modifying an income tax to allow for unlimited deductions for investment or savings.

====Environmental====

This includes natural resources consumption tax, greenhouse gas tax (i.e. carbon tax), &quot;sulfuric tax&quot;, and others. The stated purpose is to reduce the environmental impact by repricing. Economists describe environmental impacts as negative externalities. As early as 1920, Arthur Pigou suggested a tax to deal with externalities (see also the section on Increased economic welfare below). The proper implementation of environmental taxes has been the subject of a long-lasting debate.

====Proportional, progressive, regressive, and lump sum====
An important feature of tax systems is the percentage of the tax burden as it relates to income or consumption. The terms progressive, regressive, and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high, from high to low, or proportionally. The terms describe a distribution effect, which can be applied to any type of tax system (income or consumption) that meets the definition.
* A progressive tax is a tax imposed so that the effective tax rate increases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases.
* The opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax, where the effective tax rate decreases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases. This effect is commonly produced where means testing is used to withdraw tax allowances or state benefits.
* In between is a proportional tax, where the effective tax rate is fixed, while the amount to which the rate is applied increases.
* A lump-sum tax is a tax that is a fixed amount, no matter the change in circumstance of the taxed entity. This in actuality is a regressive tax as those with lower income must use a higher percentage of their income than those with higher income and therefore the effect of the tax reduces as a function of income.

The terms can also be used to apply meaning to the taxation of select consumption, such as a tax on luxury goods and the exemption of basic necessities may be described as having progressive effects as it increases a tax burden on high end consumption and decreases a tax burden on low end consumption.

====Direct and indirect====

Taxes are sometimes referred to as &quot;direct taxes&quot; or &quot;indirect taxes&quot;. The meaning of these terms can vary in different contexts, which can sometimes lead to confusion. An economic definition, by Atkinson, states that &quot;...direct taxes may be adjusted to the individual characteristics of the taxpayer, whereas indirect taxes are levied on transactions irrespective of the circumstances of buyer or seller.&quot; According to this definition, for example, income tax is &quot;direct&quot;, and sales tax is &quot;indirect&quot;. 
In law, the terms may have different meanings. In U.S. constitutional law, for instance, direct taxes refer to poll taxes and property taxes, which are based on simple existence or ownership. Indirect taxes are imposed on events, rights, privileges, and activities. Thus, a tax on the sale of the property would be considered an indirect tax, whereas the tax on simply owning the property itself would be a direct tax.

===Fees and effective===
Governments may charge user fees, tolls, or other types of assessments in exchange of particular goods, services, or use of property. These are generally not considered &quot;taxes&quot;, as long as they are levied as payment for a direct benefit to the individual paying. Such fees include:
* Tolls: a fee charged to travel via a road, bridge, tunnel, canal, waterway or other transportation facilities. Historically tolls have been used to pay for public bridge, road, and tunnel projects. They have also been used in privately constructed transport links. The toll is likely to be a fixed charge, possibly graduated for vehicle type, or for distance on long routes.
* User fees, such as those charged for use of parks or other government-owned facilities.
* Ruling fees charged by governmental agencies to make determinations in particular situations.

Some scholars refer to certain economic effects as taxes, though they are not levies imposed by governments. These include:
* Inflation tax: the economic disadvantage suffered by holders of cash and cash equivalents in one denomination of currency due to the effects of expansionary monetary policy
* Financial repression: Government policies such as interest-rate caps on government debt, financial regulations such as reserve requirements and capital controls, and barriers to entry in markets where the government owns or controls businesses.

==History==

The first known system of taxation was in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC, in the First Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The earliest and most widespread forms of taxation were the corvée and the tithe. The corvée was forced labor provided to the state by peasants too poor to pay other forms of taxation (&quot;labor&quot; in ancient Egyptian is a synonym for taxes). Records from the time document that the Pharaoh would conduct a biennial tour of the kingdom, collecting tithes from the people. Other records are granary receipts on limestone flakes and papyrus. Early taxation is also described in the Bible. In Genesis (chapter 47, verse 24 – the New International Version), it states &quot;But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children&quot;. Samgharitr is the name mentioned for the Tax collector in the Vedic texts. In Hattusa, the capital of the Hittite Empire, grains were collected as a tax from the surrounding lands, and stored in silos as a display of the king&#x27;s wealth.

In the Persian Empire, a regulated and sustainable tax system was introduced by Darius I the Great in 500 BC; the Persian system of taxation was tailored to each Satrapy (the area ruled by a Satrap or provincial governor). At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 Satrapies in the Empire and each was assessed according to its supposed productivity. It was the responsibility of the Satrap to collect the due amount and to send it to the treasury, after deducting his expenses (the expenses and the power of deciding precisely how and from whom to raise the money in the province, offer maximum opportunity for rich pickings). The quantities demanded from the various provinces gave a vivid picture of their economic potential. For instance, Babylon was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities; 1,000 silver talents and four months supply of food for the army. India, a province fabled for its gold, was to supply gold dust equal in value to the very large amount of 4,680 silver talents. Egypt was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (and, later, of the Roman Empire) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This tax was exclusively levied on Satrapies based on their lands, productive capacity and tribute levels.

The Rosetta Stone, a tax concession issued by Ptolemy V in 196 BC and written in three languages &quot;led to the most famous decipherment in history—the cracking of hieroglyphics&quot;.

In the Roman Republic, taxes were collected from individuals at the rate of between 1% and 3% of the assessed value of their total property. However, since it was extremely difficult to facilitate the collection of the tax, the government auctioned it every year. The winning tax farmers (called &quot;publicani&quot;) paid the tax revenue to the government in advance and then kept the taxes collected from individuals. The &quot;publicani&quot; paid the tax revenue in coins, but collected the taxes using other exchange media, thus relieving the government of the work to carry out the currency conversion themselves. The revenue payment essentially worked as a loan to the government, which paid interest on it. Although this scheme was a profitable enterprise for the government as well as the &quot;publicani&quot;, it was later replaced by a direct tax system by the emperor Augustus; after which, each province was obliged to pay 1% tax on wealth and a flat rate on each adult. This brought about regular census and shifted the tax system more towards taxing an individual&#x27;s income rather than wealth.

Islamic rulers imposed Zakat (a tax on Muslims) and Jizya (a poll tax on conquered non-Muslims). In India this practice began in the 11th century.

===Trends===
Numerous records of government tax collection in Europe since at least the 17th century are still available today. But taxation levels are hard to compare to the size and flow of the economy since production numbers are not as readily available. Government expenditures and revenue in France during the 17th century went from about 24.30 million &quot;livres&quot; in 1600–10 to about 126.86 million &quot;livres&quot; in 1650–59 to about 117.99 million &quot;livres&quot; in 1700–10 when government debt had reached 1.6 billion &quot;livres&quot;. In 1780–89, it reached 421.50 million &quot;livres&quot;. Taxation as a percentage of production of final goods may have reached 15–20% during the 17th century in places such as France, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia. During the war-filled years of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, tax rates in Europe increased dramatically as war became more expensive and governments became more centralized and adept at gathering taxes. This increase was greatest in England, Peter Mathias and Patrick O&#x27;Brien found that the tax burden increased by 85% over this period. Another study confirmed this number, finding that per capita tax revenues had grown almost sixfold over the eighteenth century, but that steady economic growth had made the real burden on each individual only double over this period before the industrial revolution. Effective tax rates were higher in Britain than France in the years before the French Revolution, twice in per capita income comparison, but they were mostly placed on international trade. In France, taxes were lower but the burden was mainly on landowners, individuals, and internal trade and thus created far more resentment.

Taxation as a percentage of GDP 2016 was 45.9% in Denmark, 45.3% in France, 33.2% in the United Kingdom, 26% in the United States, and among all OECD members an average of 34.3%.

===Forms===
In monetary economies prior to fiat banking, a critical form of taxation was seigniorage, the tax on the creation of money.

Other obsolete forms of taxation include:
* Scutage, which is paid in lieu of military service; strictly speaking, it is a commutation of a non-tax obligation rather than a tax as such but functioning as a tax in practice.
* Tallage, a tax on feudal dependents.
* Tithe, a tax-like payment (one-tenth of one&#x27;s earnings or agricultural produce), paid to the Church (and thus too specific to be a tax in strict technical terms). This should not be confused with the modern practice of the same name which is normally voluntary.
* (Feudal) aids, a type of tax or due that was paid by a vassal to his lord during feudal times.
* Danegeld, a medieval land tax originally raised to pay off raiding Danes and later used to fund military expenditures.
* Carucage, a tax which replaced the Danegeld in England.
* Tax farming, the principle of assigning the responsibility for tax revenue collection to private citizens or groups.
* Socage, a feudal tax system based on land rent.
* Burgage, a feudal tax system based on land rent.

Some principalities taxed windows, doors, or cabinets to reduce consumption of imported glass and hardware. Armoires, hutches, and wardrobes were employed to evade taxes on doors and cabinets. In some circumstances, taxes are also used to enforce public policy like congestion charge (to cut road traffic and encourage public transport) in London. In Tsarist Russia, taxes were clamped on beards. Today, one of the most-complicated taxation systems worldwide is in Germany. Three-quarters of the world&#x27;s taxation literature refers to the German system. Under the German system, there are 118 laws, 185 forms, and 96,000 regulations, spending €3.7 billion to collect the income tax. In the United States, the IRS has about 1,177 forms and instructions, 28.4111 megabytes of Internal Revenue Code which contained 3.8 million words as of 1 February 2010, numerous tax regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations, and supplementary material in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Today, governments in more advanced economies (i.e. Europe and North America) tend to rely more on direct taxes, while developing economies (i.e. several African countries) rely more on indirect taxes.

==Economic effects==
In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government of a nation. Adam Smith writes in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; that

:&quot;…the economic incomes of private people are of three main types: rent, profit, and wages. Ordinary taxpayers will ultimately pay their taxes from at least one of these revenue sources. The government may intend that a particular tax should fall exclusively on rent, profit, or wages – and that another tax should fall on all three private income sources jointly. However, many taxes will inevitably fall on resources and persons very different from those intended … Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect.&quot;

The side-effects of taxation (such as economic distortions) and theories about how best to tax are an important subject in microeconomics. Taxation is almost never a simple transfer of wealth. Economic theories of taxation approach the question of how to maximize economic welfare through taxation.

A 2019 study looking at the impact of tax cuts for different income groups, it was tax cuts for low-income groups that had the greatest positive impact on employment growth. Tax cuts for the wealthiest top 10% had a small impact.

===Incidence===

Law establishes from whom a tax is collected. In many countries, taxes are imposed on businesses (such as corporate taxes or portions of payroll taxes). However, who ultimately pays the tax (the tax &quot;burden&quot;) is determined by the marketplace as taxes become embedded into production costs. Economic theory suggests that the economic effect of tax does not necessarily fall at the point where it is legally levied. For instance, a tax on employment paid by employers will impact the employee, at least in the long run. The greatest share of the tax burden tends to fall on the most inelastic factor involved—the part of the transaction which is affected least by a change in price. So, for instance, a tax on wages in a town will (at least in the long run) affect property-owners in that area.

Depending on how quantities supplied and demanded to vary with price (the &quot;elasticities&quot; of supply and demand), a tax can be absorbed by the seller (in the form of lower pre-tax prices), or by the buyer (in the form of higher post-tax prices). If the elasticity of supply is low, more of the tax will be paid by the supplier. If the elasticity of demand is low, more will be paid by the customer; and, contrariwise for the cases where those elasticities are high. If the seller is a competitive firm, the tax burden is distributed over the factors of production depending on the elasticities thereof; this includes workers (in the form of lower wages), capital investors (in the form of loss to shareholders), landowners (in the form of lower rents), entrepreneurs (in the form of lower wages of superintendence) and customers (in the form of higher prices).

To show this relationship, suppose that the market price of a product is $1.00 and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be collected from the seller. If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop the price of the product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).

===Increased economic welfare===

====Government spending====
The purpose of taxation is to provide for government spending without inflation. The provision of public goods such as roads and other infrastructure, schools, a social safety net, public health systems, national defense, law enforcement, and a courts system increases the economic welfare of society if the benefit outweighs the costs involved.

====Pigovian====
The existence of a tax can &quot;increase&quot; economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a negative externality associated with a good (meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer) then a free market will trade too much of that good. By taxing the good, the government can raise revenue to address specific problems while increasing overall welfare.

The goal is to tax people when they are creating societal costs in addition to their personal costs. By taxing goods with negative externalities, the government attempts to increase economic efficiency while raising revenues.

This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou who wrote about it in his 1920 book &quot;The Economics of Welfare&quot;.

Pigovian taxes might target the undesirable production of greenhouse gases which cause climate change (namely a carbon tax), polluting fuels (such as petrol), water or air pollution (namely an ecotax), goods which incur public healthcare costs (such as alcohol or tobacco), and excess demand of certain public goods (such as traffic congestion pricing). The idea is to aim taxes at people that cause an above-average amount of societal harm so the free market incorporates all costs as opposed to only personal costs, with the benefit of lowering the overall tax burden for people who cause less societal harm.

====Reduced inequality====
Progressive taxation generally reduces economic inequality, even when the tax revenue is not redistributed from higher-income individuals to lower-income individuals. However, in a highly specific condition, progressive taxation increases economic inequality when lower-income individuals consume goods and services produced by higher-income individuals, who in turn consume only from other higher-income individuals (trickle-up effect).

===Reduced economic welfare===
Most taxes (see below) have side effects that reduce economic welfare, either by mandating unproductive labor (compliance costs) or by creating distortions to economic incentives (deadweight loss and perverse incentives).

====Cost of compliance====
Although governments must spend money on tax collection activities, some of the costs, particularly for keeping records and filling out forms, are borne by businesses and by private individuals. These are collectively called costs of compliance. More complex tax systems tend to have higher compliance costs. This fact can be used as the basis for practical or moral arguments in favor of tax simplification (such as the FairTax or OneTax, and some flat tax proposals).

====Deadweight costs====
In the absence of negative externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In a competitive market, the price of a particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.

Most taxes—including income tax and sales tax—can have significant deadweight costs. The only way to avoid deadweight costs in an economy that is generally competitive is to refrain from taxes that change economic incentives. Such taxes include the land value tax, where the tax is on a good in completely inelastic supply. By taxing the value of unimproved land as opposed to what&#x27;s built on it, a land value tax does not increase taxes on landowners for improving their land. This is opposed to traditional property taxes which reward land abandonment and disincentivize construction, maintenance, and repair. Another example of a tax with few deadweight costs is a lump sum tax such as a poll tax (head tax) which is paid by all adults regardless of their choices. Arguably a windfall profits tax which is entirely unanticipated can also fall into this category.

Deadweight loss does not account for the effect taxes have in leveling the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry with a small amount of very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.

====Perverse incentives====
Complexity of the tax code in developed economies offers perverse tax incentives. The more details of tax policy there are, the more opportunities for legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion. These not only result in lost revenue but involve additional costs: for instance, payments made for tax advice are essentially deadweight costs because they add no wealth to the economy. Perverse incentives also occur because of non-taxable &#x27;hidden&#x27; transactions; for instance, a sale from one company to another might be liable for sales tax, but if the same goods were shipped from one branch of a corporation to another, no tax would be payable.

To address these issues, economists often suggest simple and transparent tax structures that avoid providing loopholes. Sales tax, for instance, can be replaced with a value added tax which disregards intermediate transactions.

==In developing countries==
Following Nicolas Kaldor&#x27;s research, public finance in developing countries is strongly tied to state capacity and financial development. As state capacity develops, states not only increase the level of taxation but also the pattern of taxation. With larger tax bases and the diminishing importance of trading tax, income tax gains more importance.
According to Tilly&#x27;s argument, state capacity evolves as a response to the emergence of war. War is an incentive for states to raise taxes and strengthen states&#x27; capacity. Historically, many taxation breakthroughs took place during wartime. The introduction of income tax in Britain was due to the Napoleonic War in 1798. The US first introduced income tax during the Civil War. Taxation is constrained by the fiscal and legal capacities of a country. Fiscal and legal capacities also complement each other. A well-designed tax system can minimize efficiency loss and boost economic growth. With better compliance and better support to financial institutions and individual property, the government will be able to collect more tax. Although wealthier countries have higher tax revenue, economic growth does not always translate to higher tax revenue. For example, in India, increases in exemptions lead to the stagnation of income tax revenue at around 0.5% of GDP since 1986.

Researchers for EPS PEAKS stated that the core purpose of taxation is revenue mobilization, providing resources for National Budgets, and forming an important part of macroeconomic management. They said economic theory has focused on the need to &quot;optimize&quot; the system through balancing efficiency and equity, understanding the impacts on production, and consumption as well as distribution, redistribution, and welfare.

They state that taxes and tax relief have also been used as a tool for behavioral change, to influence investment decisions, labor supply, consumption patterns, and positive and negative economic spillovers (externalities), and ultimately, the promotion of economic growth and development. The tax system and its administration also play an important role in state-building and governance, as a principal form of &quot;social contract&quot; between the state and citizens who can, as taxpayers, exert accountability on the state as a consequence.

The researchers wrote that domestic revenue forms an important part of a developing country&#x27;s public financing as it is more stable and predictable than Overseas Development Assistance and necessary for a country to be self-sufficient. They found that domestic revenue flows are, on average, already much larger than ODA, with aid worth less than 10% of collected taxes in Africa as a whole.

However, in a quarter of African countries Overseas Development Assistance does exceed tax collection, with these more likely to be non-resource-rich countries. This suggests countries making the most progress replacing aid with tax revenue tend to be those benefiting disproportionately from rising prices of energy and commodities.

The author found tax revenue as a percentage of GDP varying greatly around a global average of 19%. This data also indicates countries with higher GDP tend to have higher tax to GDP ratios, demonstrating that higher income is associated with more than proportionately higher tax revenue. On average, high-income countries have tax revenue as a percentage of GDP of around 22%, compared to 18% in middle-income countries and 14% in low-income countries.

In high-income countries, the highest tax-to-GDP ratio is in Denmark at 47% and the lowest is in Kuwait at 0.8%, reflecting low taxes from strong oil revenues. The long-term average performance of tax revenue as a share of GDP in low-income countries has been largely stagnant, although most have shown some improvement in more recent years. On average, resource-rich countries have made the most progress, rising from 10% in the mid-1990s to around 17% in 2008. Non-resource-rich countries made some progress, with average tax revenues increasing from 10% to 15% over the same period.

Many low-income countries have a tax-to-GDP ratio of less than 15% which could be due to low tax potentials, such as a limited taxable economic activity, or low tax effort due to policy choice, non-compliance, or administrative constraints.

Some low-income countries have relatively high tax-to-GDP ratios due to resource tax revenues (e.g. Angola) or relatively efficient tax administration (e.g. Kenya, Brazil) whereas some middle-income countries have lower tax-to-GDP ratios (e.g. Malaysia) which reflect a more tax-friendly policy choice.

While overall tax revenues have remained broadly constant, the global trend shows trade taxes have been declining as a proportion of total revenues (IMF, 2011), with the share of revenue shifting away from border trade taxes towards domestically levied sales taxes on goods and services. Low-income countries tend to have a higher dependence on trade taxes, and a smaller proportion of income and consumption taxes when compared to high-income countries.

One indicator of the taxpaying experience was captured in the &quot;Doing Business&quot; survey, which compares the total tax rate, time spent complying with tax procedures, and the number of payments required through the year, across 176 countries. The &quot;easiest&quot; countries in which to pay taxes are located in the Middle East with the UAE ranking first, followed by Qatar and Saudi Arabia, most likely reflecting low tax regimes in those countries. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are among the &quot;hardest&quot; to pay with the Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Guinea and Chad in the bottom 5, reflecting higher total tax rates and a greater administrative burden to comply.

===Key facts===
The below facts were compiled by EPS PEAKS researchers:
* Trade liberalization has led to a decline in trade taxes as a share of total revenues and GDP.
* Resource-rich countries tend to collect more revenue as a share of GDP, but this is more volatile. Sub-Saharan African countries that are resource-rich have performed better tax collecting than non-resource-rich countries, but revenues are more volatile from year to year. By strengthening revenue management, there are huge opportunities for investment for development and growth.
* Developing countries have an informal sector representing an average of around 40%, perhaps up to 60% in some. Informal sectors feature many small informal traders who may not be efficient in bringing into the tax net since the cost of collection is high and revenue potential limited (although there are broader governance benefits). There is also an issue of non-compliant companies who are &quot;hard to tax&quot;, evading taxes and should be brought into the tax net.
* In many low-income countries, the majority of revenue is collected from a narrow tax base, sometimes because of a limited range of taxable economic activities. There is therefore dependence on few taxpayers, often multinationals, that can exacerbate the revenue challenge by minimizing their tax liability, in some cases abusing a lack of capacity in revenue authorities, sometimes through transfer pricing abuse.
* Developing and developed countries face huge challenges in taxing multinationals and international citizens. Estimates of tax revenue losses from evasion and avoidance in developing countries are limited by a lack of data and methodological shortcomings, but some estimates are significant.
* Countries use incentives to attract investment but doing this may be unnecessarily giving up revenue as evidence suggests that investors are influenced more by economic fundamentals like market size, infrastructure, and skills, and only marginally by tax incentives (IFC investor surveys). For example, even though the Government of Armenia supports the IT sector and seeks to improve the investment climate, the small size of the domestic market, low wages, low demand for productivity enhancement tools, financial constraints, high software piracy rates, and other factors make growth in this sector a slow process. Meaning that tax incentives do not contribute to the development of the sector as much as it is thought to contribute. Support towards the IT industry and tax incentives were established in the 2000s in Armenia, and this example showcases that such policies are not the guarantee of rapid economic growth.
* In low-income countries, compliance costs are high, they are lengthy processes, frequent tax payments, bribes and corruption.
* Administrations are often under-resourced, resources are not effectively targeted on areas of greatest impact, and mid-level management is weak. Coordination between domestic and customs is weak, which is especially important for VAT. Weak administration, governance, and corruption tend to be associated with low revenue collections (IMF, 2011).
* Evidence on the effect of aid on tax revenues is inconclusive. Tax revenue is more stable and sustainable than aid. While a disincentive effect of aid on revenue may be expected and was supported by some early studies, recent evidence does not support that conclusion, and in some cases, points towards higher tax revenue following support for revenue mobilization.
* Of all regions, Africa has the highest total tax rates borne by the business at 57.4% of the profit on average but has reduced the most since 2004, from 70%, partly due to introducing VAT and this is likely to have a beneficial effect on attracting investment.
* Fragile states are less able to expand tax revenue as a percentage of GDP and any gains are more difficult to sustain. Tax administration tends to collapse if conflict reduces state-controlled territory or reduces productivity. As economies are rebuilt after conflicts, there can be good progress in developing effective tax systems. Liberia expanded from 10.6% of GDP in 2003 to 21.3% in 2011. Mozambique increased from 10.5% of GDP in 1994 to around 17.7% in 2011.

=== Summary ===
Aid interventions in revenue can support revenue mobilization for growth, improve tax system design and administrative effectiveness, and strengthen governance and compliance. The author of the Economics Topic Guide found that the best aid modalities for revenue depend on country circumstances, but should aim to align with government interests and facilitate effective planning and implementation of activities under evidence-based tax reform. Lastly, she found that identifying areas for further reform requires country-specific diagnostic assessment: broad areas for developing countries identified internationally (e.g. IMF) include, for example, property taxation for local revenues, strengthening expenditure management, and effective taxation of extractive industries and multinationals.

==Views==

===Support===

According to most political philosophies, taxes are justified as they fund activities that are necessary and beneficial to society. Additionally, progressive taxation can be used to reduce economic inequality in a society. According to this view, taxation in modern nation-states benefit the majority of the population and social development. A common presentation of this view, paraphrasing various statements by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. is &quot;Taxes are the price of civilization&quot;.

It can also be argued that in a democracy, because the government is the party performing the act of imposing taxes, society as a whole decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution&#x27;s &quot;No taxation without representation&quot; slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, &quot;An old tax is a good tax&quot;. Conservatives advocate the &quot;fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government &#x27;services&#x27;.&quot; Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision of a wide range of services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Anthony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. American libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty.

Compulsory taxation of individuals, such as income tax, is often justified on grounds including territorial sovereignty, and the social contract. Defenders of business taxation argue that it is an efficient method of taxing income that ultimately flows to individuals, or that separate taxation of business is justified on the grounds that commercial activity necessarily involves the use of publicly established and maintained economic infrastructure, and that businesses are in effect charged for this use. Georgist economists argue that all of the economic rent collected from natural resources (land, mineral extraction, fishing quotas, etc.) is unearned income, and belongs to the community rather than any individual. They advocate a high tax (the &quot;Single Tax&quot;) on land and other natural resources to return this unearned income to the state, but no other taxes.

===Against===

Because payment of tax is compulsory and enforced by the legal system, rather than voluntary like crowdfunding, some political philosophies view taxation as theft, extortion, slavery, as a violation of property rights, or tyranny, accusing the government of levying taxes via force and coercive means. Objectivists, anarcho-capitalists, and right-wing libertarians see taxation as government aggression through the lens of the non-aggression principle. The view that democracy legitimizes taxation is rejected by those who argue that the right to property is inalienable, and consequently cannot be abridged by the government. According to Ludwig von Mises, &quot;society as a whole&quot; should not make such decisions, due to methodological individualism. Some libertarian opponents of taxation claim that governmental protection, such as police and defense forces, might be replaced by market alternatives such as private defense agencies, arbitration agencies or voluntary contributions.

Murray Rothbard argued in &quot;The Ethics of Liberty&quot; in 1982 that taxation is theft and that tax resistance is therefore legitimate: &quot;Just as no one is morally required to answer a robber truthfully when he asks if there are any valuables in one&#x27;s house, so no one can be morally required to answer truthfully similar questions asked by the state, e.g., when filling out income tax returns.&quot;

Many view government spending as an inefficient use of capital, and that the same projects that the government seeks to develop can be developed by private companies at much lower costs. This line of argument holds that government workers are not as personally invested in the efficiency of the projects, so the overspending happens at every step of the way. In the same regard, many public officials are not elected for their project management skills, so the projects can be mishandled. In the United States, President George W. Bush proposed in his 2009 budget &quot;to terminate or reduce 151 discretionary programs&quot; which were inefficient or ineffective.

Additionally, critics of taxation note that the process of taxation, not only unjustly takes money of citizens, it also unjustly takes considerable time away from citizens. For example, it is estimated by the American Action Forum that Americans spend 6.5 billion hours annually preparing their taxes. This is equivalent of roughly 741,501 years of life lost every year to complete tax forms and other related paperwork.

===Socialism===
Karl Marx assumed that taxation would be unnecessary after the advent of communism and looked forward to the &quot;withering away of the state&quot;. In socialist economies such as that of China, taxation played a minor role, since most government income was derived from the ownership of enterprises, and it was argued by some that monetary taxation was not necessary. While the morality of taxation is sometimes questioned, most arguments about taxation revolve around the degree and method of taxation and associated government spending, not taxation itself.

===Choice===

Tax choice is the theory that taxpayers should have more control with how their individual taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value. This would end real estate speculation, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz&#x27;s Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency because—as George also noted—public spending raises land value.

===Geoism===

Geoists (Georgists and geolibertarians) state that taxation should primarily collect economic rent, in particular the value of land, for both reasons of economic efficiency as well as morality. The efficiency of using economic rent for taxation is (as economists agree) due to the fact that such taxation cannot be passed on and does not create any dead-weight loss, and that it removes the incentive to speculate on land. Its morality is based on the Geoist premise that private property is justified for products of labor but not for land and natural resources.

Economist and social reformer Henry George opposed sales taxes and protective tariffs for their negative impact on trade. He also believed in the right of each person to the fruits of their own labor and productive investment. Therefore, income from paid labor and proper capital should remain untaxed. For this reason many Geoists—in particular those that call themselves geolibertarian—share the view with libertarians that these types of taxation (but not all) are immoral and even theft. George stated there should be one single tax: the Land Value Tax, which is considered both efficient and moral. Demand for specific land is dependent on nature, but even more so on the presence of communities, trade, and government infrastructure, particularly in urban environments. Therefore, the economic rent of land is not the product of one particular individual and it may be claimed for public expenses. According to George, this would end real estate bubbles, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz&#x27;s Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency for financing public goods because those raise land value.

John Locke stated that whenever labor is mixed with natural resources, such as is the case with improved land, private property is justified under the proviso that there must be enough other natural resources of the same quality available to others. Geoists state that the Lockean proviso is violated wherever land value is greater than zero. Therefore, under the assumed principle of equal rights of all people to natural resources, the occupier of any such land must compensate the rest of society to the amount of that value. For this reason, geoists generally believe that such payment cannot be regarded as a true &#x27;tax&#x27;, but rather a compensation or fee. This means that while Geoists also regard taxation as an instrument of social justice, contrary to social democrats and social liberals they do not regard it as an instrument of redistribution but rather a &#x27;predistribution&#x27; or simply a correct distribution of the commons.

Modern geoists note that land in the classical economic meaning of the word referred to all natural resources, and thus also includes resources such as mineral deposits, water bodies and the electromagnetic spectrum, to which privileged access also generates economic rent that must be compensated. Under the same reasoning most of them also consider pigouvian taxes as compensation for environmental damage or privilege as acceptable and even necessary.

==Theories==
===Laffer curve===
In economics, the Laffer curve is a theoretical representation of the relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation. It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by thought experiment. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate there is no longer any incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the extreme value theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph that starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation, and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.

One potential result of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point will become counterproductive for raising further tax revenue. A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are sometimes controversial. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.

===Optimal===
Most governments take revenue that exceeds that which can be provided by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes that give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes in terms of social welfare. The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the elasticity of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there are most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function, which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable to a greater or lesser extent. If individuals experience diminishing returns from income, then the optimum distribution of income for society involves a progressive income tax. Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.

===Rates===
Taxes are most often levied as a percentage, called the &quot;tax rate&quot;. An important distinction when talking about tax rates is to distinguish between the marginal rate and the effective tax rate. The effective rate is the total tax paid divided by the total amount the tax is paid on, while the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar of income earned. For example, if income is taxed on a formula of 5% from $0 up to $50,000, 10% from $50,000 to $100,000, and 15% over $100,000, a with income of $175,000 would pay a total of $18,750 in taxes.

:Tax calculation
::(0.05*50,000) + (0.10*50,000) + (0.15*75,000) = 18,750

:The &quot;effective rate&quot; would be 10.7%:
::18,750/175,000 = 0.107

: The &quot;marginal rate&quot; would be 15%.

<text>Transhumanism is a philosophical and intellectual movement that advocates the enhancement of the human condition by developing and making widely available new and future technologies that can greatly enhance longevity, cognition, and well-being.

Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. Some transhumanists speculate that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into beings of such vastly greater abilities as to merit the label of posthuman beings.

Another topic of transhumanist research is how to protect humanity against existential risks from artificial general intelligence, asteroid impact, gray goo, high-energy particle collision experiments, natural or synthetic pandemic, and nuclear warfare.

The biologist Julian Huxley popularised the term &quot;transhumanism&quot; in a 1957 essay. The contemporary meaning of the term was foreshadowed by one of the first professors of futurology, a man who changed his name to FM-2030. In the 1960s, he taught &quot;new concepts of the human&quot; at The New School when he began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles, and worldviews &quot;transitional&quot; to posthumanity as &quot;transhuman&quot;. The assertion laid the intellectual groundwork for the British philosopher Max More to begin articulating the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy in 1990, organizing in California a school of thought that has since grown into the worldwide transhumanist movement.

Influenced by seminal works of science fiction, the transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives, including philosophy and religion.

In 2017, Penn State University Press, in cooperation with philosopher Stefan Lorenz Sorgner and sociologist James Hughes, established the &quot;Journal of Posthuman Studies&quot; as the first academic journal explicitly dedicated to the posthuman, with the goal of clarifying the notions of posthumanism and transhumanism, as well as comparing and contrasting both.

Despite its professed strong attachment to the values of liberalism and forward-thinking, some critics argue transhumanism is a dangerous resurgence of many discriminatory attitudes and elitist ideals of the discredited eugenics movements of the past.

==History==
===Precursors of transhumanism===
According to Nick Bostrom, transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for immortality in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, as well as in historical quests for the Fountain of Youth, the Elixir of Life, and other efforts to stave off aging and death.

Transhumanists draw upon and claim continuity from intellectual and cultural traditions such as the ancient philosophy of Aristotle or the scientific tradition of Roger Bacon. In his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante coined the word &quot;trasumanar&quot; meaning &quot;to transcend human nature, to pass beyond human nature&quot; in the first canto of Paradiso.

The interweaving of transhumanist aspirations with the scientific imagination can be seen in the works of some precursors of Enlightenment such as Francis Bacon. One of the early precursors to transhumanist ideas is René Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Method&quot; (1637), in which Descartes envisions a new kind of medicine that can grant both physical immortality and stronger minds.

In his first edition of &quot;Political Justice&quot; (1793), William Godwin included arguments favoring the possibility of &quot;earthly immortality&quot; (what would now be called physical immortality). Godwin explored the themes of life extension and immortality in his gothic novel &quot;St. Leon&quot;, which became popular (and notorious) at the time of its publication in 1799, but is now mostly forgotten. &quot;St. Leon&quot; may have inspired his daughter Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

Ether Day, marking a significant milestone in human history, celebrated its 175th anniversary on October 16, 2021. It was on this day that dentist William T. G. Morton achieved a groundbreaking feat by administering the first public ether anesthesia in Boston. This breakthrough not only allowed for the alleviation of pain with a reasonable level of risk but also helped protect people from psychological trauma by inducing .

There is debate about whether the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche can be considered an influence on transhumanism, despite its exaltation of the &quot;Übermensch&quot; (overhuman), due to its emphasis on self-actualization rather than technological transformation. The transhumanist philosophies of More and Sorgner have been influenced strongly by Nietzschean thinking. By contrast, &quot;The Transhumanist Declaration&quot; &quot;advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in artificial intellects, humans, posthumans, or non-human animals)&quot;.

The late 19th- to early 20th-century movement known as Russian cosmism, by Russian philosopher N. F. Fyodorov, is noted for anticipating transhumanist ideas. In 1966, FM-2030 (formerly F. M. Esfandiary), a futurist who taught &quot;new concepts of the human&quot; at The New School, in New York City, began to identify people who adopt technologies, lifestyles and worldviews transitional to posthumanity as &quot;transhuman&quot;.

===Early transhumanist thinking===
Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist J. B. S. Haldane in his essay &quot;Daedalus: Science and the Future&quot;, which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, &quot;indecent and unnatural&quot;. In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of eugenics, ectogenesis (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics such as health and intelligence.

His article inspired academic and popular interest. J. D. Bernal, a crystallographer at Cambridge, wrote &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot; in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through bionic implants and cognitive enhancement. These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.

The biologist Julian Huxley is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article. But the term derives from a 1940 paper by the Canadian philosopher W. D. Lighthall. Huxley describes transhumanism in these terms:

Huxley&#x27;s definition differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 1980s. The ideas raised by these thinkers were explored in the science fiction of the 1960s, notably in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, in which an alien artifact grants transcendent power to its wielder.

Japanese Metabolist architects produced a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to &quot;encourage active metabolic development of our society&quot; through design and technology. In the Material and Man section of the manifesto, Noboru Kawazoe suggests that:After several decades, with the rapid progress of communication technology, every one will have a &quot;brain wave receiver&quot; in his ear, which conveys directly and exactly what other people think about him and vice versa. What I think will be known by all the people. There is no more individual consciousness, only the will of mankind as a whole.

===Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity===
The concept of the technological singularity, or the ultra-rapid advent of superhuman intelligence, was first proposed by the British cryptologist I. J. Good in 1965:
Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s. Over the succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers, such as Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil, who oscillated between the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein. The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in the last decades of the 20th century. In 1972, Robert Ettinger, whose 1964 &quot;Prospect of Immortality&quot; founded the cryonics movement, contributed to the conceptualization of &quot;transhumanity&quot; with his 1972 &quot;Man into Superman.&quot; FM-2030 published the &quot;Upwingers Manifesto&quot; in 1973.

===Growth of transhumanism===
The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s at the University of California, Los Angeles, which became the main center of transhumanist thought. Here, FM-2030 lectured on his &quot;Third Way&quot; futurist ideology. At the EZTV Media venue, frequented by transhumanists and other futurists, Natasha Vita-More presented &quot;Breaking Away&quot;, her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth&#x27;s gravity as they head into space. FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles, which included students from FM-2030&#x27;s courses and audiences from Vita-More&#x27;s artistic productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the &quot;Transhumanist Arts Statement&quot; and in 1988 she produced the cable TV show &quot;TransCentury Update &quot;on transhumanity, a program that reached over 100,000 viewers.

In 1986, Eric Drexler published &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology,&quot; which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and molecular assemblers, and founded the Foresight Institute. As the first nonprofit organization to research, advocate for, and perform cryonics, the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of &quot;Extropy Magazine&quot; was published by Max More and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which took the form of the &quot;Principles of Extropy,&quot; and laid the foundation of modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition:

In 1992, More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute, a catalyst for networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture. In 1998, philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), an international non-governmental organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy. In 2002, the WTA modified and adopted &quot;The Transhumanist Declaration.&quot; &quot;The Transhumanist FAQ&quot;, prepared by the WTA (later Humanity+), gave two formal definitions for transhumanism:

In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist visions and needed to be addressed. A particular concern is equal access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders. In 2006, a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre-leftward positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James Hughes. In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute ceased operations of the organization, saying that its mission was &quot;essentially completed&quot;. This left the World Transhumanist Association as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to &quot;Humanity+&quot;. In 2012, the transhumanist Longevity Party had been initiated as an international union of people who promote the development of scientific and technological means to significant life extension that now has more than 30 national organisations throughout the world.

The Mormon Transhumanist Association was founded in 2006. By 2012, it had hundreds of members.

The first transhumanist elected member of a parliament was Giuseppe Vatinno, in Italy.

== Theory ==
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of posthumanism and how this philosophical movement should be conceptualised with regard to transhumanism. Transhumanism is often referred to as a variant or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative, Christian and progressive critics.

A common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and which eventually will supplement or supersede it. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. biological uplift), but clings to a &quot;posthuman future&quot; as the final goal of participant evolution.

Nevertheless, the idea of creating intelligent artificial beings (proposed, for example, by roboticist Hans Moravec) has influenced transhumanism. Moravec&#x27;s ideas and transhumanism have also been characterised as a &quot;complacent&quot; or &quot;apocalyptic&quot; variant of posthumanism and contrasted with &quot;cultural posthumanism&quot; in humanities and the arts. While such a &quot;cultural posthumanism&quot; would offer resources for rethinking the relationships between humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete concepts of the &quot;autonomous liberal subject&quot;, but are expanding its &quot;prerogatives&quot; into the realm of the posthuman. Transhumanist self-characterisations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment thinking correspond with this view.

Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the humanist freethought movement and argue that transhumanists differ from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological approaches to resolving human concerns (i.e. technocentrism) and on the issue of mortality. Other progressives have argued that posthumanism, in its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from concerns about social justice, from the reform of human institutions and from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward narcissistic longings to transcend the human body in quest of more exquisite ways of being.

The philosophy of transhumanism is closely related to technoself studies, an interdisciplinary domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of human identity in a technological society and focusing on the changing nature of relationships between humans and technology.

=== Aims ===


While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply reason, science and technology to reduce poverty, disease, disability, and malnutrition around the globe, transhumanism is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life, while seeking to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical barriers.

Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans enhance themselves beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution.

Some theorists such as Ray Kurzweil think that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical technological advances, but possibly a technological singularity, which may fundamentally change the nature of human beings. Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable, but some are concerned about the dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity&#x27;s future welfare, including ones that emerging technologies could create. In contrast, some proponents of transhumanism view it as essential to humanity&#x27;s survival. For instance, Stephen Hawking points out that the &quot;external transmission&quot; phase of human evolution, where knowledge production and knowledge management is more important than transmission of information via evolution, may be the point at which human civilization becomes unstable and self-destructs, one of Hawking&#x27;s explanations for the Fermi paradox. To counter this, Hawking emphasizes either self-design of the human genome or mechanical enhancement (e.g., brain-computer interface) to enhance human intelligence and reduce aggression, without which he implies human civilization may be too stupid collectively to survive an increasingly unstable system, resulting in societal collapse.

While many people believe that all transhumanists are striving for immortality, that is not necessarily true. Hank Pellissier, managing director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (2011–2012), surveyed transhumanists. He found that, of the 818 respondents, 23.8% did not want immortality. Some of the reasons argued were boredom, Earth&#x27;s overpopulation, and the desire &quot;to go to an afterlife&quot;.

=== Empathic fallibility and conversational consent ===

Certain transhumanist philosophers hold that since all assumptions about what others experience are fallible, and that therefore all attempts to help or protect beings that are incapable of correcting what others assume about them, no matter how well-intentioned, are in danger of actually hurting them, all sentient beings deserve to be sapient. These thinkers argue that the ability to discuss in a falsification-based way constitutes a threshold that is not arbitrary at which it becomes possible for someone to speak for themself in a way that is independent of exterior assumptions. They also argue that all beings capable of experiencing something deserve to be elevated to this threshold if they are not at it, typically saying that the underlying change that leads to the threshold is an increase in the preciseness of the brain&#x27;s ability to discriminate. This includes increasing the neuron count and connectivity in animals as well as accelerating the development of connectivity to shorten or ideally skip non-sapient childhood incapable of independently deciding for oneself. Transhumanists of this description stress that the genetic engineering that they advocate is general insertion into both the somatic cells of living beings and in germ cells, and not purging of people without the modifications, deeming the latter not only unethical but also unnecessary due to the possibilities of efficient genetic engineering.

=== Ethics ===

Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understand and evaluate possibilities for overcoming biological limitations by drawing on futurology and various fields of ethics. Unlike many philosophers, social critics, and activists who morally value preservation of natural systems, transhumanists see the concept of the specifically natural as problematically nebulous at best and an obstacle to progress at worst. In keeping with this, many prominent transhumanist advocates, such as Dan Agin, call transhumanism&#x27;s critics, on the political right and left jointly, &quot;bioconservatives&quot; or &quot;bioluddites&quot;, the latter term alluding to the 19th-century anti-industrialisation social movement that opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines.

A belief of counter-transhumanism is that transhumanism can cause unfair human enhancement in many areas of life, but specifically on the social plane. This can be compared to steroid use, where athletes who use steroids in sports have an advantage over those who do not. The same disparity may happen when people have certain neural implants that give them an advantage in the workplace and in education. Additionally, according to M.J. McNamee and S.D. Edwards, many fear that the improvements afforded by a specific, privileged section of society will lead to a division of the human species into two different species. The idea of two human species, one at a great physical and economic advantage over with the other, is troublesome at best. One may be incapable of breeding with the other, and may by consequence of lower physical health and ability, be considered of a lower moral standing than the other.

Nick Bostrom has said that transhumanism advocates for the wellbeing of all sentient beings, including non-human animals, extraterrestrials, and artificial forms of life. This view is reiterated by David Pearce, who advocates the use of biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings.

=== Currents ===
There is a variety of opinions within transhumanist thought. Many of the leading transhumanist thinkers hold views that are under constant revision and development. Some distinctive currents of transhumanism are identified and listed here in alphabetical order:
* Abolitionism, the concept of using biotechnology to eradicate suffering in all sentient beings. 
* Democratic transhumanism, a political ideology synthesizing liberal democracy, social democracy, radical democracy and transhumanism.
* Equalism, a socioeconomic theory based upon the idea that emerging technologies will put an end to social stratification through even distribution of resources in the technological singularity era.
* Extropianism, an early school of transhumanist thought characterized by a set of principles advocating a proactive approach to human evolution.
* Immortalism, a moral ideology based upon the belief that radical life extension and technological immortality is possible and desirable, and advocating research and development to ensure its realization.
* Libertarian transhumanism, a political ideology synthesizing libertarianism and transhumanism.
* Postgenderism, a social philosophy which seeks the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species through the application of advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies.
*Postpoliticism, a transhumanist political proposal that aims to create a &quot;postdemocratic state&quot; based on reason and free access of enhancement technologies to people.
*Singularitarianism, a moral ideology based upon the belief that a technological singularity is possible, and advocating deliberate action to effect it and ensure its safety.
* Technogaianism, an ecological ideology based upon the belief that emerging technologies can help restore Earth&#x27;s environment and that developing safe, clean, alternative technology should therefore be an important goal of environmentalists.

=== Spirituality ===
Although many transhumanists are atheists, agnostics, or secular humanists, some have religious or spiritual views. Despite the prevailing secular attitude, some transhumanists pursue hopes traditionally espoused by religions, such as immortality, while several controversial new religious movements from the late 20th century have explicitly embraced transhumanist goals of transforming the human condition by applying technology to alter the mind and body, such as Raëlism. But most thinkers associated with the transhumanism focus on the practical goals of using technology to help achieve longer and healthier lives, while speculating that future understanding of neurotheology and the application of neurotechnology will enable humans to gain greater control of altered states of consciousness, which were commonly interpreted as spiritual experiences, and thus achieve more profound self-knowledge. Transhumanist Buddhists have sought to explore areas of agreement between various types of Buddhism and Buddhist-derived meditation and mind-expanding neurotechnologies. They have been criticised for appropriating mindfulness as a tool for transcending humanness.

Some transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the theoretical implication that human consciousness may someday be transferred to alternative media (a speculative technique commonly known as mind uploading). One extreme formulation of this idea that interests some transhumanists is the proposal of the Omega Point by Christian cosmologist Frank Tipler. Drawing upon ideas in digitalism, Tipler has advanced the notion that the collapse of the Universe billions of years hence could create the conditions for the perpetuation of humanity in a simulated reality within a megacomputer and thus achieve a form of &quot;posthuman godhood&quot;. Before Tipler, the term Omega Point was used by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and Jesuit theologian who saw an evolutionary telos in the development of an encompassing noosphere, a global consciousness.

Viewed from the perspective of some Christian thinkers, the idea of mind uploading is asserted to represent a denigration of the human body, characteristic of gnostic manichaean belief. Transhumanism and its presumed intellectual progenitors have also been described as neo-gnostic by non-Christian and secular commentators.

The first dialogue between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference at the University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted transhumanism for offering no eternal truths or relationship with the divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that people with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.

Since 2006, the Mormon Transhumanist Association sponsors conferences and lectures on the intersection of technology and religion. The Christian Transhumanist Association was established in 2014.

Since 2009, the American Academy of Religion holds a &quot;Transhumanism and Religion&quot; consultation during its annual meeting, where scholars in the field of religious studies seek to identify and critically evaluate any implicit religious beliefs that might underlie key transhumanist claims and assumptions; consider how transhumanism challenges religious traditions to develop their own ideas of the human future, in particular the prospect of human transformation, whether by technological or other means; and provide critical and constructive assessments of an envisioned future that place greater confidence in nanotechnology, robotics and information technology to achieve virtual immortality and create a superior posthuman species.

The physicist and transhumanist thinker Giulio Prisco states that &quot;cosmist religions based on science, might be our best protection from reckless pursuit of superintelligence and other risky technologies.&quot; He also recognizes the importance of spiritual ideas, such as those of Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, to the origins of the transhumanism movement.

== Practice ==
While some transhumanists take an abstract and theoretical approach to the perceived benefits of emerging technologies, others have offered specific proposals for modifications to the human body, including heritable ones. Transhumanists are often concerned with methods of enhancing the human nervous system. Though some, such as Kevin Warwick, propose modification of the peripheral nervous system, the brain is considered the common denominator of personhood and is thus a primary focus of transhumanist ambitions.

In fact, Warwick has gone a lot further than merely making a proposal. In 2002 he had a 100 electrode array surgically implanted into the median nerves of his left arm to link his nervous system directly with a computer and thus to also connect with the internet. As a consequence, he carried out a series of experiments. He was able to directly control a robot hand using his neural signals and to feel the force applied by the hand through feedback from the fingertips. He also experienced a form of ultrasonic sensory input and conducted the first purely electronic communication between his own nervous system and that of his wife who also had electrodes implanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As proponents of self-improvement and body modification, transhumanists tend to use existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity. Depending on their age, some transhumanists express concern that they will not live to reap the benefits of future technologies. However, many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in cryonics to make the latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method.

While most transhumanist theory focuses on future technologies and the changes they may bring, many today are already involved in the practice on a very basic level. It is not uncommon for many to receive cosmetic changes to their physical form via cosmetic surgery, even if it is not required for health reasons. Human growth hormones attempt to alter the natural development of shorter children or those who have been born with a physical deficiency. Doctors prescribe medicines such as Ritalin and Adderall to improve cognitive focus, and many people take &quot;lifestyle&quot; drugs such as Viagra, Propecia, and Botox to restore aspects of youthfulness that have been lost in maturity.

Other transhumanists, such as cyborg artist Neil Harbisson, use technologies and techniques to improve their senses and perception of reality. Harbisson&#x27;s antenna, which is permanently implanted in his skull, allows him to sense colours beyond human perception such as infrareds and ultraviolets.

=== Technologies of interest ===

Transhumanists support the emergence and convergence of technologies including nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science (NBIC), as well as hypothetical future technologies like simulated reality, artificial intelligence, superintelligence, 3D bioprinting, mind uploading, chemical brain preservation and cryonics. They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human. Therefore, they support the recognition or protection of cognitive liberty, morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties, so as to guarantee individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil&#x27;s book &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; and Michio Kaku&#x27;s book &quot;Physics of the Future&quot; outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race.

Some reports on the converging technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character. At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Defense, which is interested in the battlefield advantages they would provide to the supersoldiers of the United States and its allies. There has already been a brain research program to &quot;extend the ability to manage information&quot;, while military scientists are now looking at stretching the human capacity for combat to a maximum 168 hours without sleep.

Neuroscientist Anders Sandberg has been practicing on the method of scanning ultra-thin sections of the brain. This method is being used to help better understand the architecture of the brain. It is currently being used on mice. This is the first step towards hypothetically uploading contents of the human brain, including memories and emotions, onto a computer.

Some detractors have criticized transhumanists&#x27; views on human enhancement, arguing that the pursuit of radical transformation could undermine human dignity and identity. Critics also contend that transhumanists often underestimate the ethical complexities and potential unintended consequences of their proposed technologies, such as exacerbating social inequalities or creating unforeseen risks to individuals and society. These concerns have led to debates about whether transhumanist ideals prioritize technological progress over considerations of moral and societal responsibility ().

== Debate ==
The very notion and prospect of human enhancement and related issues arouse public controversy. Criticisms of transhumanism and its proposals take two main forms: those objecting to the likelihood of transhumanist goals being achieved (practical criticisms) and those objecting to the moral principles or worldview sustaining transhumanist proposals or underlying transhumanism itself (ethical criticisms). Critics and opponents often see transhumanists&#x27; goals as posing threats to human values.

The human enhancement debate is, for some, framed by the opposition between strong bioconservatism and transhumanism. The former opposes any form of human enhancement, whereas the latter advocates for all possible human enhancements. But many philosophers hold a more nuanced view in favour of some enhancements while rejecting the transhumanist carte blanche approach.

Some of the most widely known critiques of the transhumanist program are novels and fictional films. These works, despite presenting imagined worlds rather than philosophical analyses, are used as touchstones for some of the more formal arguments. Various arguments have been made to the effect that a society that adopts human enhancement technologies may come to resemble the dystopia depicted in the 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley.

On another front, some authors consider humanity already transhuman, because medical advances in recent centuries have significantly altered our species. But this has not happened in a conscious and therefore transhumanistic way. From such a perspective, transhumanism is perpetually aspirational: as new technologies become mainstream, the adoption of new yet-unadopted technologies becomes a new shifting goal.

=== Feasibility ===
In a 1992 book, sociologist Max Dublin pointed to many past failed predictions of technological progress and argued that modern futurist predictions would prove similarly inaccurate. He also objected to what he saw as scientism, fanaticism and nihilism by a few in advancing transhumanist causes. Dublin also said that historical parallels existed between Millenarian religions and Communist doctrines.

Although generally sympathetic to transhumanism, public health professor Gregory Stock is skeptical of the technical feasibility and mass appeal of the cyborgization of humanity predicted by Raymond Kurzweil, Hans Moravec and Kevin Warwick. He said that, throughout the 21st century, many humans will be deeply integrated into systems of machines, but remain biological. Primary changes to their own form and character would arise not from cyberware, but from the direct manipulation of their genetics, metabolism and biochemistry.

In her 1992 book &quot;Science as Salvation&quot;, philosopher Mary Midgley traces the notion of achieving immortality by transcendence of the material human body (echoed in the transhumanist tenet of mind uploading) to a group of male scientific thinkers of the early 20th century, including J. B. S. Haldane and members of his circle. She characterizes these ideas as &quot;quasi-scientific dreams and prophesies&quot; involving visions of escape from the body coupled with &quot;self-indulgent, uncontrolled power-fantasies&quot;. Her argument focuses on what she perceives as the pseudoscientific speculations and irrational, fear-of-death-driven fantasies of these thinkers, their disregard for laymen and the remoteness of their eschatological visions.

Another critique is aimed mainly at &quot;algeny&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;alchemy&quot; and &quot;genetics&quot;), which Jeremy Rifkin defined as &quot;the upgrading of existing organisms and the design of wholly new ones with the intent of &#x27;perfecting&#x27; their performance&quot;. It emphasizes the issue of biocomplexity and the unpredictability of attempts to guide the development of products of biological evolution. This argument, elaborated in particular by the biologist Stuart Newman, is based on the recognition that cloning and germline genetic engineering of animals are error-prone and inherently disruptive of embryonic development. Accordingly, so it is argued, it would create unacceptable risks to use such methods on human embryos. Performing experiments, particularly ones with permanent biological consequences, on developing humans would thus be in violation of accepted principles governing research on human subjects (see the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki). Moreover, because improvements in experimental outcomes in one species are not automatically transferable to a new species without further experimentation, it is claimed that there is no ethical route to genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages.

As a practical matter, international protocols on human subject research may not present a legal obstacle to attempts by transhumanists and others to improve their offspring by germinal choice technology. According to legal scholar Kirsten Rabe Smolensky, existing laws protect parents who choose to enhance their child&#x27;s genome from future liability arising from adverse outcomes of the procedure.

Transhumanists and other supporters of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar as there is a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. But bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome, the proteins it specifies and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in bioinformatics, Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans. Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as a safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.

Thinkers who defend the likelihood of accelerating change point to a past pattern of exponential increases in humanity&#x27;s technological capacities. Kurzweil developed this position in his 2005 book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot;.

=== Intrinsic immorality ===
Some argue that, in transhumanist thought, humans attempt to substitute themselves for God. The 2002 Vatican statement &quot;Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God,&quot; stated that &quot;changing the genetic identity of man as a human person through the production of an infrahuman being is radically immoral&quot;, implying, that &quot;man has full right of disposal over his own biological nature&quot;. The statement also argues that creation of a superhuman or spiritually superior being is &quot;unthinkable&quot;, since true improvement can come only through religious experience and &quot;realizing more fully the image of God&quot;. Christian theologians and lay activists of several churches and denominations have expressed similar objections to transhumanism and claimed that Christians attain in the afterlife what radical transhumanism promises, such as indefinite life extension or the abolition of suffering. In this view, transhumanism is just another representative of the long line of utopian movements which seek to create &quot;heaven on earth&quot;. On the other hand, religious thinkers allied with transhumanist goals such as the theologians Ronald Cole-Turner and Ted Peters hold that the doctrine of &quot;co-creation&quot; provides an obligation to use genetic engineering to improve human biology.

Other critics target what they claim to be an instrumental conception of the human body in the writings of Minsky, Moravec, and some other transhumanists. Reflecting a strain of feminist criticism of the transhumanist program, philosopher Susan Bordo points to &quot;contemporary obsessions with slenderness, youth and physical perfection&quot;, which she sees as affecting both men and women, but in distinct ways, as &quot;the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture.&quot; Some critics question other social implications of the movement&#x27;s focus on body modification. Political scientist Klaus-Gerd Giesen, in particular, has asserted that transhumanism&#x27;s concentration on altering the human body represents the logical yet tragic consequence of atomized individualism and body commodification within a consumer culture.

Bostrom responds that the desire to regain youth, specifically, and transcend the natural limitations of the human body, in general, is pan-cultural and pan-historical, not uniquely tied to the culture of the 20th century. He argues that the transhumanist program is an attempt to channel that desire into a scientific project on par with the Human Genome Project and achieve humanity&#x27;s oldest hope, rather than a puerile fantasy or social trend.

=== Loss of human identity ===
In his 2003 book &quot;Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age&quot;, environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued at length against many of the technologies that are postulated or supported by transhumanists, including germinal choice technology, nanomedicine and life extension strategies. He claims that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to &quot;improve&quot; themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome technologically. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish.

Biopolitical activist Jeremy Rifkin and biologist Stuart Newman accept that biotechnology has the power to make profound changes in organismal identity. They argue against the genetic engineering of human beings because they fear the blurring of the boundary between human and artifact. Philosopher Keekok Lee sees such developments as part of an accelerating trend in modernization in which technology has been used to transform the &quot;natural&quot; into the &quot;artefactual&quot;. In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of &quot;monsters&quot; such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic. The film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and the novels &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot; (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people as well as subhumans. Such critics propose that strict measures be implemented to prevent what they portray as dehumanizing possibilities from ever happening, usually in the form of an international ban on human genetic engineering.

Science journalist Ronald Bailey claims that McKibben&#x27;s historical examples are flawed and support different conclusions when studied more closely. For example, few groups are more cautious than the Amish about embracing new technologies, but, though they shun television and use horses and buggies, some are welcoming the possibilities of gene therapy since inbreeding has afflicted them with a number of rare genetic diseases. Bailey and other supporters of technological alteration of human biology also reject the claim that life would be experienced as meaningless if some human limitations are overcome with enhancement technologies as extremely subjective.

Writing in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, Bailey has accused opponents of research involving the modification of animals as indulging in alarmism when they speculate about the creation of subhuman creatures with human-like intelligence and brains resembling those of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Bailey insists that the aim of conducting research on animals is simply to produce human health care benefits.

A different response comes from transhumanist personhood theorists who object to what they characterize as the anthropomorphobia fueling some criticisms of this research, which science fiction writer Isaac Asimov termed the &quot;Frankenstein complex&quot;. For example, Woody Evans argues that, provided they are self-aware, human clones, human-animal chimeras and uplifted animals would all be unique persons deserving of respect, dignity, rights, responsibilities, and citizenship. They conclude that the coming ethical issue is not the creation of so-called monsters, but what they characterize as the &quot;yuck factor&quot; and &quot;human-racism&quot;, that would judge and treat these creations as monstrous. In book 3 of his &quot;Corrupting the Image&quot; series, Douglas Hamp goes so far as to suggest that the Beast of John&#x27;s Apocalypse is himself a hybrid who will induce humanity to take &quot;the mark of the Beast,&quot; in the hopes of obtaining perfection and immortality.

At least one public interest organization, the U.S.-based Center for Genetics and Society, was formed, in 2001, with the specific goal of opposing transhumanist agendas that involve transgenerational modification of human biology, such as full-term human cloning and germinal choice technology. The Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future of the Chicago-Kent College of Law critically scrutinizes proposed applications of genetic and nanotechnologies to human biology in an academic setting.

=== Socioeconomic effects ===
Some critics of libertarian transhumanism have focused on the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which divisions between rich and poor are on the rise. Bill McKibben, for example, suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a &quot;genetic divide&quot;. Even Lee M. Silver, the biologist and science writer who coined the term &quot;reprogenetics&quot; and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically engineered &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot; if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies. The 1997 film &quot;Gattaca&quot; depicts a dystopian society in which one&#x27;s social class depends entirely on genetic potential and is often cited by critics in support of these views.

These criticisms are also voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, especially self-described democratic transhumanists, who believe that the majority of current or future social and environmental issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) must be addressed by a combination of political and technological solutions (like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book &quot;Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future&quot;, argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives, must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.

Sometimes, as in the writings of Leon Kass, the fear is that various institutions and practices judged as fundamental to civilized society would be damaged or destroyed. In his 2002 book &quot;Our Posthuman Future&quot; and in a 2004 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine article, political economist and philosopher Francis Fukuyama designates transhumanism as the world&#x27;s most dangerous idea because he believes it may undermine the egalitarian ideals of democracy (in general) and liberal democracy (in particular) through a fundamental alteration of &quot;human nature&quot;. Social philosopher Jürgen Habermas makes a similar argument in his 2003 book &quot;The Future of Human Nature&quot;, in which he asserts that moral autonomy depends on not being subject to another&#x27;s unilaterally imposed specifications. Habermas thus suggests that the human &quot;species ethic&quot; would be undermined by embryo-stage genetic alteration. Critics such as Kass and Fukuyama hold that attempts to significantly alter human biology are not only inherently immoral, but also threaten the social order. Alternatively, they argue that implementation of such technologies would likely lead to the &quot;naturalizing&quot; of social hierarchies or place new means of control in the hands of totalitarian regimes. AI pioneer Joseph Weizenbaum criticizes what he sees as misanthropic tendencies in the language and ideas of some of his colleagues, in particular Minsky and Moravec, which, by devaluing the human organism per se, promotes a discourse that enables divisive and undemocratic social policies.

In a 2004 article in the libertarian monthly &quot;Reason,&quot; science journalist Ronald Bailey contested Fukuyama&#x27;s assertions by arguing that political equality has never rested on the facts of human biology. He asserts that liberalism was founded not on the proposition of effective equality of human beings, or &quot;de facto&quot; equality, but on the assertion of an equality in political rights and before the law, or &quot;de jure&quot; equality. Bailey asserts that the products of genetic engineering may well ameliorate rather than exacerbate human inequality, giving to the many what were once the privileges of the few. Moreover, he argues, &quot;the crowning achievement of the Enlightenment is the principle of tolerance&quot;. In fact, he says, political liberalism is already the solution to the issue of human and posthuman rights since in liberal societies the law is meant to apply equally to all, no matter how rich or poor, powerful or powerless, educated or ignorant, enhanced or unenhanced. Other thinkers sympathetic to transhumanist ideas, such as Russell Blackford, have also objected to the appeal to tradition and what they see as alarmism involved in &quot;Brave New World&quot;-type arguments.

==== Cultural aesthetics ====
In addition to the socioeconomic risks and implications of transhumanism, there are indeed implications and possible consequences in regard to cultural aesthetics. Currently, there are a number of ways in which people choose to represent themselves in society. The way in which a person dresses, hair styles, and body alteration all serve to identify the way a person presents themselves and is perceived by society. According to Foucault, society already governs and controls bodies by making them feel watched. This &quot;surveillance&quot; of society dictates how the majority of individuals choose to express themselves aesthetically.

One of the risks outlined in a 2004 article by Jerold Abrams is the elimination of differences in favor of universality. This, he argues, will eliminate the ability of individuals to subvert the possibly oppressive, dominant structure of society by way of uniquely expressing themselves externally. Such control over a population would have dangerous implications of tyranny. Yet another consequence of enhancing the human form not only cognitively, but physically, will be the reinforcement of &quot;desirable&quot; traits which are perpetuated by the dominant social structure.

=== New eugenics ===

The tradition of human enhancement originated with the eugenics movement that was once prominent in the biological sciences, and was later politicized in various ways. This continuity is especially clear in the case of Julian Huxley himself.

The major transhumanist organizations strongly condemn the coercion involved in such policies and reject the racist and classist assumptions on which they were based, along with the pseudoscientific notions that eugenic improvements could be accomplished in a practically meaningful time frame through selective human breeding. Instead, most transhumanist thinkers advocate a &quot;new eugenics&quot;, a form of egalitarian liberal eugenics. In their 2000 book &quot;From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice&quot;, non-transhumanist bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler have argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals&#x27; reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements. Most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term &quot;eugenics&quot; (preferring &quot;germinal choice&quot; or &quot;reprogenetics&quot;) to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.

Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to human-posthuman caste warfare.

=== Existential risks ===
In his 2003 book &quot;Our Final Hour&quot;, British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees argues that advanced science and technology bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, he calls for tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness. Advocates of the precautionary principle, such as many in the environmental movement, also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life.

Transhumanists do not necessarily rule out specific restrictions on emerging technologies so as to lessen the prospect of existential risk. Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter-productive as opposed to the technogaian current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series &quot;Connections&quot;, science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change, including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the &quot;status quo&quot; of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet&#x27;s resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, clean, alternative technology, rather than fostering what it considers to be anti-scientific views and technophobia.

Nick Bostrom argues that even barring the occurrence of a singular global catastrophic event, basic Malthusian and evolutionary forces facilitated by technological progress threaten to eliminate the positive aspects of human society.

One transhumanist solution proposed by Bostrom to counter existential risks is control of differential technological development, a series of attempts to influence the sequence in which technologies are developed. In this approach, planners would strive to retard the development of possibly harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of likely beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful effects of others.

In their 2021 book &quot;Calamity Theory&quot;, Joshua Schuster and Derek Woods critique existential risks by arguing against Bostrom’s transhumanist perspective, which emphasizes controlling and mitigating these risks through technological advancements. They contend that this approach relies too much on fringe science and speculative technologies and fails to address deeper philosophical and ethical problems about the nature of human existence and its limitations. Instead, they advocate an approach more grounded in secular existentialist philosophy, focusing on mental fortitude, community resilience, international peacebuilding, and environmental stewardship to better cope with existential risks.

==== Antinatalism and pronatalism ====
Although most people focus on the scientific and technological barriers on the road to human enhancement, Robbert Zandbergen argues that contemporary transhumanists&#x27; failure to critically engage the cultural current of antinatalism is a far bigger obstacle to a posthuman future. Antinatalism is a stance seeking to discourage, restrict, or terminate human reproduction to solve existential problems. If transhumanists fail to take this threat to human continuity seriously, they run the risk of seeing the collapse of the entire edifice of radical enhancement.

Simone and Malcolm Collins, founders of Pronatalist.org, are activists known primarily for their views and advocacy related to a secular and voluntaristic form of pronatalism, a stance encouraging higher birth rates to reverse demographic decline and its negative implications for the viability of modern societies and the possibility of a better future. Critical of transhumanism, they have expressed concern that life extension would worsen the problem of gerontocracy, causing toxic imbalances in power. The Collinses lament that voluntarily childfree transhumanists who &quot;want to live forever believe they are the epitome of centuries of human cultural and biological evolution. They don’t think they can make kids that are better than them.&quot;

==In news media== 
=== Common enemy to anti-democratic movements ===
Transhumanism has increasingly been co-opted by anti-democratic movements as a common enemy stereotype. These movements range from Putin sympathizers to radical anti-vaxxers and Christian fundamentalists. Critics argue that nonsensical claims often stem from deliberate ignorance, and terms like &quot;Putin sympathizer&quot; or &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; are used to defame legitimate criticism.

Political scientists like Markus Linden point out that Putin, in his speeches, argues against the so-called &quot;liberal-globalist American egocentrism&quot; and cancel culture, which parallels the agitation seen in alternative media. These discourses also occur on platforms like &quot;Nachdenkseiten&quot;, &quot;Rubikon&quot;, and &quot;Compact&quot;, where they are presented as analyses of the decline of Western democracy.

The propagandistic use of the term &quot;transhumanism&quot; aims to create a comprehensive counter-narrative that unites right-wing extremists, theocratic groups, and liberals. Transhumanism is portrayed as a threat to traditional values and human nature. These narratives can also be found among ideologues like Alexander Dugin, who condemns transhumanism as the work of the devil, and Christian fundamentalists who equate it with the denial of traditional values.

The use of the term &quot;transhumanism&quot; as an ideological rallying point for the &quot;Querfront&quot; is also evident in the fusion of right-wing, left-wing, and libertarian ideas that collectively oppose liberal democracies. This development emphasizes individual conceptions of humanity that are often incompatible with a pluralistic society. It requires a critical examination of the political implications of transhumanism and its instrumentalization by anti-democratic forces.

<text>The TARDIS (; acronym for &quot;Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space&quot;) is a fictional hybrid of a time machine and spacecraft that appears in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its various spin-offs. While a TARDIS is capable of disguising itself, the exterior appearance of the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS typically mimics a police box, an obsolete type of telephone kiosk that was once commonly seen on streets in Britain in the 1940s and 50s. Its interior is shown as being much larger than its exterior, commonly described as being &quot;bigger on the inside&quot;.

Due to the significance of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in popular British culture, the shape of the police box is now more strongly associated with the TARDIS than its real-world inspiration. The name and design of the TARDIS is a registered trademark of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), although the design was originally created by the Metropolitan Police Service.

==Name==
TARDIS is an acronym of &quot;Time And Relative Dimension in Space&quot;. The word &quot;Dimension&quot; is alternatively rendered in the plural. The first story, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), used the singular &quot;Dimension&quot;. The 1964 novelisation &quot;Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot; used &quot;Dimensions&quot; for the first time and the 1965 serial &quot;The Time Meddler&quot; introduced the plural in the television series – although the script had it as singular, actor Maureen O&#x27;Brien changed it to &quot;Dimensions&quot;. Both continued to be used during the classic series; in &quot;Rose&quot; (2005), the Ninth Doctor uses the singular (although this was a decision of actor Christopher Eccleston— the line was plural in the script for the episode). The acronym was explained in the first episode of the show, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), in which the Doctor&#x27;s granddaughter Susan claims to have made it up herself. Despite this, the term is used commonly by other Time Lords to refer to both the Doctor&#x27;s and their own time ships.

Generally, &quot;TARDIS&quot; is written in all uppercase letters, but may also be written in title case as &quot;Tardis&quot;. The word &quot;Tardis&quot; first appeared in print in the Christmas 1963 edition of &quot;Radio Times&quot;, which refers to &quot;the space-time ship &quot;Tardis&quot;&quot;.

==Description==
In the fictional universe of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television show, TARDISes are space- and time-travel vehicles of the Time Lords, an alien species from the planet Gallifrey. Although many TARDISes exist and are sometimes seen on-screen, the television show mainly features a single TARDIS used by the show&#x27;s protagonist, a Time Lord who goes by the name of the Doctor.

TARDISes are built with a &quot;chameleon circuit&quot;, a type of camouflage technology that changes the exterior form of the ship to blend into the environment of whatever time or place it lands in. The Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS always resembles a 1960s London police box, an object that was very common in Britain at the time of the show&#x27;s first broadcast, owing to a malfunction in the chameleon circuit before the events of the first episode of the show, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;. The Doctor has attempted to repair the chameleon circuit, unsuccessfully in &quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981) and with only temporary success in &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot; (1985). In &quot;Boom Town&quot;, the Doctor reveals that he has stopped trying to repair the circuit as he has become fond of its appearance. The other TARDISes that appear in the series have chameleon circuits that are fully functional.

The TARDIS is famously &quot;bigger on the inside&quot;. A much larger control room lies inside the police box, at the centre of which is a console for operating the TARDIS. In the middle of the console is a moving tubular device called a time rotor. The presence of a physically larger space contained within the police box is explained as &quot;dimensionally transcendental&quot;, with the interior being a whole separate dimension containing an infinite number of rooms, corridors and storage spaces, all of which can change their appearance and configuration.

The TARDIS also allows the Doctor and others to communicate with people who speak languages other than their own, as well as turn all written languages to English. The translation circuit has been explored in comparison with real-world machine translation, with researchers Mark Halley and Lynne Bowker concluding that &quot;when it comes to the science of translation technology, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; gets it wrong more often than it gets it right. However, perhaps we can forgive the artistic license if we recognise that, as in other science fiction works, the presentation of some type of ubiquitous translation tool is necessary to explain to the audience how people from other countries, time periods, and even other worlds, can understand each other and indeed appear to speak (mostly) flawless English.&quot; The TARDIS is also able to generate a &quot;perception filter&quot; that causes people to ignore it, thinking that it is normal.

==Conceptual history==
===Exterior design===

When &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was being developed in 1963 the production staff discussed what the Doctor&#x27;s time machine would look like. To keep the design within budget it was decided to make the outside resemble a police telephone box, a common piece of street furniture that had originally been designed in the 1920s by the Scottish architect Gilbert Mackenzie Trench. The idea for the police-box disguise came from a BBC staff writer, Anthony Coburn, who rewrote the programme&#x27;s first episode from a draft by C. E. Webber. While there is no known precedent for this notion, a November 1960 episode of the popular radio comedy show &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; included a sketch featuring a time machine described as &quot;a tall telephone box&quot;.

The concept of a cloaking mechanism (later referred to as the &quot;chameleon circuit&quot;) was devised to explain this. In the first episode, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963), the TARDIS is first seen hidden in a London scrapyard in 1963, and after travelling back in time (&quot;The Cave of Skulls&quot;) to the Paleolithic era, the police box exterior persists. In a subsequent story, &quot;The Time Meddler&quot; (1965), the First Doctor explains that the TARDIS should automatically adopt a disguise, such as a howdah (a carrier on the back of an Indian elephant in the Indian Mutiny) or a rock on a beach.

Accounts differ as to the origin of the police box prop. While the BBC asserts that it was constructed specially for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, it has been claimed that the box was a reused prop from the BBC television police dramas &quot;Z-Cars&quot; or &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (a claim repeated by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Steven Moffat).

The dimensions and colour of the TARDIS police box props used in the series have changed many times, as a result of damage and the requirements of the show, and none of the BBC props has been a faithful replica of the original MacKenzie Trench model. Numerous details have been altered over time, including the shape of the roof, the signage, the shade of blue paint, the presence of a St John Ambulance emblem and the overall height of the box. The original prop remained in use for around 13 years until it collapsed – reportedly on Elisabeth Sladen&#x27;s head. A new prop was introduced for &quot;The Masque of Mandragora&quot; in 1976, and there have been at least six versions in total. The evolution of the prop design was referenced on-screen in the episode &quot;Blink&quot; (2007), when the character Detective Inspector Shipton says the TARDIS &quot;isn&#x27;t a real [police box]. The phone&#x27;s just a dummy, and the windows are the wrong size.&quot;

===Interior design===
The TARDIS console room was designed for the first episode by set designer Peter Brachacki and was unusually large for a BBC production of this time. It was noted for its innovative, gleaming white &quot;futuristic&quot; appearance.

Like the police box prop, the set design of the TARDIS interior has evolved over the years. From the inception of the show in 1963 up until the end of the &quot;classic series&quot; in 1989, the design of the TARDIS console room remained largely unchanged from Brachacki&#x27;s original set, a brightly lit white chamber, lined with a pattern of roundels on the walls and with a central hexagonal console which contained a cylindrical &quot;time rotor&quot; that moved when the TARDIS was in transit. Numerous alterations were made to the central console and to the layout, but the overall concept remained constant. In Season 14 (1976–77), a dark wood-panelled &quot;Control Room Number 2&quot; was briefly used for a few episodes, but the white console room set was reinstated in Season 15, due to damage to the set. After the cancellation of the television show, a radically redesigned TARDIS set was used in the 1996 TV movie, heralding a move to a more steampunk-inspired set design, which later influenced the set design in the revived series from 2005 onwards.

===Depiction of time travel===

The production team conceived of the TARDIS travelling by dematerialising at one point and rematerialising elsewhere, although sometimes in the series it is shown also to be capable of conventional space travel. In the 2006 Christmas special, &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;, the Doctor remarks that for a spaceship, the TARDIS does remarkably little flying. The ability to travel simply by fading into and out of different locations became one of the trademarks of the show, allowing for a great deal of versatility in setting and storytelling without a large expense in special effects. The distinctive accompanying sound effect – a cyclic wheezing, groaning noise – was originally created in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop by sound technician Brian Hodgson by recording on tape the sound of his mother&#x27;s house key scraping up and down the strings of an old piano. Hodgson then re-recorded the sound by changing the tape speed up and down and splicing the altered sounds together. When employed in the series, the sound is usually synchronised with the flashing light on top of the police box, or the fade-in and fade-out effects of a TARDIS. Writer Patrick Ness has described the ship&#x27;s distinctive dematerialisation noise as &quot;a kind of haunted grinding sound&quot;, while the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strips traditionally use the onomatopoeic phrase &quot;vworp vworp vworp&quot;.

==Other appearances==

===Television spin-offs===
The sound of the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS featured in the final scene of the &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;End of Days&quot; (2007). As Torchwood Three&#x27;s hub is situated at a rift of temporal energy, the Doctor often appears on Roald Dahl Plass directly above it in order to recharge the TARDIS. In the episode, Jack Harkness hears the tell-tale sound of the engines, smiles and afterwards is nowhere to be found; the scene picks up in the cold open of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Utopia&quot; (2007) in which Jack runs to and holds onto the TARDIS just before it disappears.

Former companion Sarah Jane Smith has a diagram of the TARDIS in her attic, as shown in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot; (2007). In the two-part serial &quot;The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith&quot; (2008), Sarah Jane becomes trapped in 1951 and briefly mistakes an actual police public call box for the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS (the moment is even heralded by the Doctor&#x27;s musical cue, frequently used in the revived series). It makes a full appearance in &quot;The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith&quot; (2009), in which the Doctor briefly welcomes Sarah Jane&#x27;s three adolescent companions into the control room. It then serves as a backdrop for the farewell scene between Sarah Jane and the Tenth Doctor, which echoed nearly word-for-word her final exchange with the Fourth Doctor aboard the TARDIS in 1976. It reappears in &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; (2010), where it is stolen by the Shansheeth who try to use it as an immortality machine, and transports Sarah Jane, Jo Grant and their adolescent companions (Rani Chandra, Clyde Langer and Santiago Jones).

===Theatrical films===
The TARDIS appears in the two film productions, &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966). In both films the Doctor, played by Peter Cushing, is an eccentric scientist who invented the TARDIS himself.

==Cultural impact==

===Merchandising===
As one of the most recognisable images connected with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the TARDIS has appeared on numerous items of merchandise associated with the programme. TARDIS scale models of various sizes have been manufactured to accompany other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; dolls and action figures, some with sound effects included. Fan-built full-size models of the police box are also common. There have been TARDIS-shaped video games, play tents for children, toy boxes, cookie jars, book ends, key chains, and even a police-box-shaped bottle for a TARDIS bubble bath. The 1993 VHS release of &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; was contained in a special-edition tin shaped like the TARDIS.

With the 2005 series revival, a variety of TARDIS-shaped merchandise has been produced, including a TARDIS coin box, TARDIS figure toy set, a TARDIS that detects the ring signal from a mobile phone and flashes when an incoming call is detected, TARDIS-shaped wardrobes and DVD cabinets, and a USB hub in the shape of the TARDIS. The complete 2005 season DVD box set, released in November 2005, was issued in packaging that resembled the TARDIS.

One of the original-model TARDISes used in the television series&#x27; production in the 1970s was sold at auction in December 2005 for £10,800.

===BBC trademark===
In 1996 the BBC applied to the UK Intellectual Property Office to register the TARDIS as a trademark. This was challenged by the Metropolitan Police, who felt that they owned the rights to the police box image. However, the Patent Office found that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police – or any other police force – had ever registered the image as a trademark. In addition, the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police. The Patent Office issued a ruling in favour of the BBC in 2002.

The word TARDIS is listed in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

===Legacy police boxes===

A number of legacy police boxes are still standing on streets around the United Kingdom. Although now no longer used for their original function, many have been repurposed as coffee kiosks, and are often affectionately referred to as TARDISes. A police box in the Somerton area of Newport in South Wales is known as the Somerton TARDIS.

===In science and computing===
An asteroid discovered in 1984 by astronomer Brian A. Skiff was named 3325 TARDIS on account of its cuboid appearance. A number of geological features on Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto, have been named after mythological or fictional vessels, and one is named the Tardis Chasma.

A data storage manufacturer called tarDISK markets a flash memory drive for Apple MacBook which it claims is &quot;bigger on the inside&quot;. They also claim native integration with Apple&#x27;s Time Machine backup software.

The European Space Agency has sent 3,000 tardigrades (&quot;water bears&quot;) into orbit on the &quot;outside&quot; of a rocket; 32% survived. The experiment was named Tardigrades in Space, or Tardis.

===In popular culture===

Cultural references to the TARDIS are many and varied.

In music, The KLF (performing as &quot;The Timelords&quot;) released a novelty pop single in 1988 entitled &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot;. The record reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and had chart success worldwide. It was a reworking of several songs (principally Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot;, The Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Block Buster!&quot; and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music) with lyrics referencing &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, specifically the TARDIS. In 2007, the British rock band Radiohead included the song &quot;Up on the Ladder&quot; on their album &quot;In Rainbows&quot; which begins with the line &quot;I&#x27;m stuck in the TARDIS&quot;.

In 2001, Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger created a piece or artwork entitled &quot;Time and Relative Dimensions in Space&quot; that is structurally a police box shape faced with mirrors. The BBC website describes it as &quot;recent proof of [the TARDIS&#x27;] enduring legacy&quot;.

In July 2014, the Monty Python comedy troupe opened their reunion show, &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, with a trademark animation featuring the Tardis – dubbed the &quot;retardis&quot; – flying through space before the Pythons came on stage.

In film, the TARDIS makes a cameo appearance in a number of productions, including &quot;Iron Sky&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; (2019). The TARDIS has also featured within the gameplay of a number of popular video games, including &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

To promote the &quot;Barbie&quot; film released in July 2023, a pink TARDIS was unveiled next to Tower Bridge in London on 11 July, as Ncuti Gatwa would appear in both &quot;Barbie&quot; as a Ken and in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the Fifteenth Doctor.

Other references to the TARDIS have included a $2 silver commemorative coin depicting the TARDIS, issued on Niue Island in the South Pacific Ocean by the Perth Mint to mark the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television show; and Tardis Environmental, a British sewage company, in reference to the similarity of their portable toilets to a police box.

&quot;Tardis&quot; has also become a slang term used in the British real estate industry, to suggest that a house or apartment is actually substantally bigger on the inside that it looks on the outside.

The original series aired from September 1993 to May 2002 on Fox, spanning nine seasons, with 202 episodes. A tenth season of six episodes ran from January to February 2016. Following the ratings success of this revival, &quot;The X-Files&quot; returned for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which ran from January to March 2018. In addition to the television series, two feature films have been released: the 1998 film &quot;The X-Files&quot; and the stand-alone film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, released in 2008, six years after the original television run ended.

The series revolves around Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who investigate the eponymous &quot;X-Files&quot;: marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder is a skilled criminal profiler, an ardent supernaturalist, and a conspiracy theorist who believes in the existence of the paranormal, whereas Scully is a medical doctor and skeptic who has been assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder&#x27;s case files. Early in the series, both agents apparently become pawns in a much larger conflict and come to trust only each other and select others. The agents discover what appears to be a governmental agenda to hide evidence of extraterrestrial life. Mulder and Scully&#x27;s shared adventures initially lead them to develop a close platonic bond, which develops into a complex romantic relationship. Roughly one third of the series&#x27; episodes follow a complicated mythopoeia-driven story arc about a planned alien invasion, whereas the other two-thirds may be described as &quot;monster of the week&quot; episodes that focus on a singular villain, mutant, or monster.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; was inspired by earlier television series featuring elements of suspense, horror, and speculative science fiction, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and especially &quot;&quot;. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson relatively equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI Special Agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), among others. Mulder and Scully&#x27;s immediate superior, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), began to appear regularly. The first five seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot; were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, before production eventually moved to Los Angeles, apparently to accommodate Duchovny&#x27;s schedule. However, the series later returned to Vancouver with the filming of &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise that includes &quot;Millennium&quot; and &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; spin-offs, two theatrical films, and accompanying merchandise.

== Premise ==

=== General ===
&quot;The X-Files&quot; follows Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Special Agent Mulder is a talented profiler, conspiracy theorist, and an ardent supernaturalist. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life and its presence on Earth. These beliefs earn him the nickname &quot;Spooky Mulder&quot; and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, the X-Files. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed alien abduction of his sister Samantha Mulder when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain objectivity in his investigations.

Special Agent Scully is a foil for Mulder in this regard. As a medical doctor and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with detachment, even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity. She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder&#x27;s nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases&#x27; apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder&#x27;s deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically. After Mulder&#x27;s abduction at the hands of aliens in the seventh season finale &quot;Requiem&quot;, Scully becomes a &quot;reluctant believer&quot; who explains the paranormal with science.

Various episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically. Mulder and Scully are joined by John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted. Doggett replaces him as Scully&#x27;s partner and helps her search for him, later involving Reyes, of whom Doggett had professional knowledge. The initial run of &quot;The X-Files&quot; ends when Mulder is secretly subjected to a military tribunal for breaking into the top-secret Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center and viewing plans for alien invasion and colonization of Earth. He is found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes punishment with the help of the other agents, and he and Scully become fugitives.

=== Mythology ===

Key episodes called parts of the &quot;Mytharc&quot;, were recognized as the &quot;mythology&quot; of the series canon; these episodes carried the extraterrestrial/conspiracy storyline that evolved throughout the series. &quot;Monster of the week&quot;—often abbreviated as &quot;MOTW&quot; or &quot;MoW&quot;—came to denote the remainder of &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes. These episodes, forming the majority of the series, dealt with paranormal (and in certain cases, merely criminal) phenomena, including: serial killers (with or without supernatural powers), cryptids, ghosts, mutants, science fiction technology, horror monsters and religious phenomena. Some of the Monster-of-the-Week episodes featured satiric elements and comedic story lines. The main story arc involves the agents&#x27; efforts to uncover a government conspiracy that covers up the existence of extraterrestrials and their sinister collaboration with said government. Mysterious men constituting a shadow element within the U.S. government, known as &quot;The Syndicate&quot;, are the major villains in the series; late in the series it is revealed that The Syndicate acts as the only liaison between mankind and a group of extraterrestrials that intends to destroy humanity. They are usually represented by Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), a ruthless killer, masterful politician, negotiator, failed novelist, and the series&#x27; principal antagonist.

As the series goes along, Mulder and Scully learn about evidence of the alien invasion piece by piece. It is revealed that the extraterrestrials plan on using a sentient virus, known as the black oil (also known as &quot;Purity&quot;), to infect mankind and turn the population of the world into a slave race. The Syndicate—having made a deal to be spared by the aliens—have been working to develop an alien-human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil; this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of season five, as well as the 1998 film. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization. Eventually, in the season six episodes &quot;Two Fathers&quot;/&quot;One Son&quot;, the rebels manage to destroy the Syndicate. The colonists, now without human liaisons, dispatch the &quot;Super Soldiers&quot;: beings that resemble humans, but are biologically alien. In the latter parts of season eight, and the whole of season nine, the Super Soldiers manage to replace key individuals in the government, forcing Mulder and Scully to go into hiding.

== Cast and characters ==
=== Starring ===
* Fox Mulder is portrayed by David Duchovny:Mulder is an Oxford-educated FBI Special Agent, a conspiracy theorist, a talented criminal profiler, and an ardent supernaturalist who believes in the existence of extraterrestrials and a government conspiracy to hide the truth regarding them. He works in the X-Files division, which is concerned with cases marked as unsolvable; most involve supernatural/mysterious circumstances. Mulder considers the X-Files so important that he has made their study his life&#x27;s main purpose. After his abduction by aliens at the end of season seven, his role in the show diminishes and much of his work is taken on by Special Agent John Doggett. He appears in an episode of &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; and in both the 1998 film &quot;The X-Files&quot; and the 2008 film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;.
* Dana Scully is portrayed by Gillian Anderson:Scully is an FBI Special Agent, a medical doctor, and scientist who is Mulder&#x27;s partner. In contrast to his credulity, Scully is a skeptic, basing her beliefs on scientific explanations. However, despite her otherwise rigid skepticism, she is a Catholic, and her faith plays an important role in several episodes. As the series progresses, she becomes more open to the possibility of paranormal happenings. In the latter part of the eighth season, her position in the X-Files office is taken by Special Agent Monica Reyes, and Scully moves to Quantico to teach new FBI Special Agents. She appears in both &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature films.
* John Doggett is portrayed by Robert Patrick (seasons 8–9):Doggett is an FBI Special Agent who makes his first appearance in the season eight episode &quot;Within&quot;.

* Walter Skinner is portrayed by Mitch Pileggi (season 9–11; also starring seasons 3–8; recurring season 2; guest season 1):Skinner is an FBI Assistant Director who served in the United States Marine Corps in the Vietnam War. During this time, he shot and killed a young boy carrying explosives, an incident which scarred him for life. Skinner is originally Mulder and Scully&#x27;s direct supervisor. He later serves the same position for Doggett and Reyes. Although he is originally portrayed as somewhat antagonistic, he eventually becomes a close friend of Mulder and Scully. He appeared in an episode of &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; and in both &quot;The X-Files&quot; feature films.

Kersh is largely antagonistic to Mulder and Scully but in &quot;The Truth&quot; somewhat redeems himself by helping Mulder escape a death sentence.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===


California native Chris Carter was given the opportunity to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. Carter was tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures. A report that said 3.7 million Americans believed they may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal, and the 1970s horror series &quot;&quot; all contributed to trigger the idea for &quot;The X-Files&quot;. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992.

Carter&#x27;s initial pitch for &quot;The X-Files&quot; was rejected by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, whereupon they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; and the British television series &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;. Inspiration also came from Carter&#x27;s memories of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; as well as from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in &quot;Kolchak&quot;. Carter was determined to keep the relationship between the two leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in &quot;The Avengers&quot; series.

The early 1990s series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was a major influence on the show&#x27;s dark atmosphere and its often surreal blend of drama and irony. Duchovny had appeared as a transgender DEA agent in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and the Mulder character was seen as a parallel to that show&#x27;s FBI Agent Dale Cooper. The producers and writers cited &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, &quot;Rashomon&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;JFK&quot; as other influences. Episodes written by Darin Morgan often referred to or referenced other films.

=== Casting ===
Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles for three years prior to &quot;The X-Files&quot;, focusing on feature films. In 1993 his manager Melanie Green gave him the script for the pilot episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script so he auditioned for the lead. Duchovny&#x27;s audition was &quot;terrific&quot;, though he talked rather slowly. While the casting director of the show was very positive toward him, Carter thought that he was not particularly intelligent. He asked Duchovny if he could &quot;please&quot; imagine himself as an FBI agent in &quot;future&quot; episodes. Duchovny, however, turned out to be one of the best-read people that Carter knew.

Anderson auditioned for the part of Scully in 1993. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t put the script down&quot;, she recalled. For the role, the network wanted either a more established actress or one that was &quot;taller, leggier, blonder and breastier&quot; than the 24-year-old Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience. After auditions, Carter felt she was the only choice. Carter insisted that Anderson had the kind of &quot;no-nonsense integrity that the role required.&quot; For portraying Scully, Anderson won numerous major awards: the Screen Actors Guild Award in 1996 and 1997, an Emmy Award in 1997, and a Golden Globe Award 1997.

The character Walter Skinner was played by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for the roles of two or three other characters on &quot;The X-Files&quot; before getting the part. At first, being asked back to audition for the recurring role puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner&#x27;s character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role.

Before the seventh season aired, Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about $20 million, but the lawsuit put strain on Duchovny&#x27;s professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny&#x27;s departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder&#x27;s role.

More than 100 actors auditioned for the role of Doggett, but only about ten were seriously considered. Lou Diamond Phillips, Hart Bochner, and Bruce Campbell were among the ten. The producers chose Robert Patrick. Carter believed that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned in both seasons eight and nine to emphasize the new actors (along with Pileggi, who was finally listed as a main character). Doggett&#x27;s presence did not give the series the ratings boost the network executives were hoping for. The eighth-season episode &quot;This is Not Happening&quot; marked the first appearance of Monica Reyes, played by Gish, who became a main character in season nine. Her character was developed and introduced due to Anderson&#x27;s possible departure at the end of the eighth season. Although Anderson ultimately stayed through the ninth season, Gish became a series regular.

==== Minor recurring characters ====

Glen Morgan and James Wong&#x27;s early influence on &quot;The X-Files&quot; mythology led to their introduction of popular secondary characters who continued for years in episodes written by others: Scully&#x27;s father, William (Don S. Davis); her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken); and her sister, Melissa (Melinda McGraw). The conspiracy-inspired trio The Lone Gunmen were also secondary characters. The trio was introduced in the first-season episode &quot;E.B.E.&quot; as a way to make Mulder appear more credible. They were originally meant to appear in only that episode, but due to their popularity, they returned in the second-season episode &quot;Blood&quot; and became recurring characters. Cigarette Smoking Man, portrayed by William B. Davis, was initially cast as an extra in the pilot episode. His character, however, grew into the main antagonist.

=== Filming ===
During the early stages of production, Carter founded Ten Thirteen Productions and began to plan for filming the pilot in Los Angeles. However, unable to find suitable locations for many scenes, he decided to &quot;go where the good forests are&quot; and moved production to Vancouver. It was soon realized by the production crew that since so much of the first season would require filming on location, rather than on sound stages, a second location manager would be needed. The show remained in Vancouver for the first five seasons; production then shifted to Los Angeles beginning with the sixth season. Duchovny was unhappy over his geographical separation from his wife, Téa Leoni, although his discontent was popularly attributed to frustration with Vancouver&#x27;s persistent rain. Anderson also wanted to return to the United States, and Carter relented following the fifth season. The season ended in May 1998 with &quot;The End&quot;, the final episode shot in Vancouver and the final episode with the involvement of many of the original crew members, including director and producer R.W. Goodwin and his wife Sheila Larken, who played Margaret Scully and would later return briefly.

With the move to Los Angeles, many changes behind the scenes occurred, as much of the original &quot;The X-Files&quot; crew was gone. New production designer Corey Kaplan, editor Lynne Willingham, writer David Amann and director and producer Michael Watkins joined and stayed for several years. Bill Roe became the show&#x27;s new director of photography and episodes generally had a drier, brighter look due to California&#x27;s sunshine and climate, as compared with Vancouver&#x27;s rain, fog and temperate forests. Early in the sixth season, the producers took advantage of the new location, setting the show in new parts of the country. For example, Vince Gilligan&#x27;s &quot;Drive&quot;, about a man subject to an unexplained illness, was a frenetic action episode, unusual for &quot;The X-Files&quot; largely because it was set in Nevada&#x27;s stark desert roads. The &quot;Dreamland&quot; two-part episode was also set in Nevada, this time in Area 51. The episode was largely filmed at &quot;Club Ed&quot;, a movie ranch located on the outskirts of Lancaster, California.

Although the sixth through ninth seasons were filmed in Los Angeles, the series&#x27; second movie, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; (2008), was filmed in Vancouver, According to Spotnitz, the film&#x27;s script was written for the city and surrounding areas. The 2016 revival was also shot there.

=== Music ===

The music was composed by Mark Snow, who got involved with &quot;The X-Files&quot; through his friendship with executive producer Goodwin. Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff as to whether they wanted him. One day, however, Snow&#x27;s agent called him, talking about the &quot;pilot episode&quot; and hinting that he had got the job.

The theme, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, used more instrumental sections than most dramas. The theme song&#x27;s famous whistle effect was inspired by the track &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot; from the US edition of The Smiths&#x27; 1985 album &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rackmount sound module with a preset sound called &quot;Whistling Joe&quot;. After hearing this sound, Carter was &quot;taken aback&quot; and noted it was &quot;going to be good&quot;. According to the &quot;Behind the Truth&quot; segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter walked out of the room and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; Snow said, &quot;this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it.&quot; The second episode, &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, marked Snow&#x27;s debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

Snow was tasked with composing the score for both &quot;The X-Files&quot; films. The films marked the first appearance of real orchestral instruments; previous music had been crafted by Snow using digitally sampled instrument sounds. Snow&#x27;s soundtrack for the first film, &quot;The X-Files: Original Motion Picture Score&quot;, was released in 1998. For the second film, Snow recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City. UNKLE recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation of silly putty and dimes tucked into piano strings. Snow commented that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track &quot;Prospectors Quartet&quot; from the &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; soundtrack. The soundtrack score, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, was released in 2008.

=== Opening sequence ===

The opening sequence was made in 1993 for the first season, and remained unchanged until Duchovny left the show. Carter sought to make the title an &quot;impactful opening&quot; with &quot;supernatural images&quot;. These scenes notably include a split-screen image of a seed germinating and a &quot;terror-filled, warped face&quot;. The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect. The sequence was extremely popular and won the show its first Emmy Award, which was for Outstanding Graphic Design and Title Sequences. Producer Paul Rabwin was particularly pleased with the sequence, and felt that it was something that had &quot;never [been] seen on television before&quot;. In 2017, James Charisma of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the show&#x27;s opening sequence #8 on a list of &quot;The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time&quot;.

The premiere episode of season eight, &quot;Within&quot;, revealed the first major change to the opening credits. Along with Patrick, the sequence used new images and updated photos for Duchovny and Anderson, although Duchovny only appears in the opening credits when he appears in an episode. Carter and the production staff saw Duchovny&#x27;s departure as a chance to change things. The replacement shows various pictures of Scully&#x27;s pregnancy. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the sequence also features an &quot;abstract&quot; way of showing Mulder&#x27;s absence in the eighth season: he falls into an eye. Season nine featured an entirely new sequence. Since Anderson wanted to move on, the sequence featured Reyes and Skinner. Duchovny&#x27;s return to the show for the ninth-season finale, &quot;The Truth&quot; marked the largest number of cast members to be featured in the opening credits, with five. The revival seasons use the series&#x27; original opening credits sequence.

The sequence ends with the tagline &quot;The Truth Is Out There&quot;, which is used for the majority of the episodes. For certain episodes, the tagline was changed to be more thematically-relevant; a list of the episodes that received alternate taglines is as follows:
== Broadcast and release ==

=== Episodes ===
=== Nielsen ratings ===
The pilot premiered on September 10, 1993, and reached 12 million viewers. As the season progressed, ratings began to increase and the season finale garnered 14 million viewers. The first season ranked 105th out of 128 shows during the 199394 television season. The series&#x27; second season increased in ratings—a trend that would continue for the next three seasons—and finished 63rd out of 141 shows. These ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to receive the label &quot;cult hit&quot;, particularly by Fox standards. Most importantly, it made great gains among the 18-to-49 age demographic sought by advertisers. During its third year, the series ranked 55th and was viewed by an average of 15.40 million viewers, an increase of almost seven percent over the second season, making it Fox&#x27;s top-rated program in the 1849-year-old demographic. Although the first three episodes of the fourth season aired on Friday night, the fourth episode &quot;Unruhe&quot; aired on Sunday night. The show remained on Sunday until its end. The season hit a high with its twelfth episode, &quot;Leonard Betts&quot;, which was chosen as the lead-out program following Super Bowl XXXI. The episode was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, the series&#x27; highest-rated episode. The fifth season debuted with &quot;Redux I&quot; on November 2, 1997, and was viewed by 27.34 million people, making it the highest-rated non-special broadcast episode of the series. The season ranked as the eleventh-most watched series during the 199798 year, with an average of 19.8 million viewers. It was the series&#x27; highest-rated season as well as Fox&#x27; highest-rated program during the 199798 season.

The sixth season premiered with &quot;The Beginning&quot;, watched by 20.24 million viewers. The show ended season six with lower numbers than the previous season, beginning a decline that would continue for the show&#x27;s final three years. &quot;The X-Files&quot; was nevertheless Fox&#x27;s highest-rated show that year. The seventh season, originally intended as the show&#x27;s last, ranked as the 29th most-watched show for the 19992000 year, with 14.20 million viewers. This made it, at the time, the lowest-rated year of the show since the third season. The first episode of season eight, &quot;Within&quot;, was viewed by 15.87 million viewers. The episode marked an 11% decrease from the seventh season opener, &quot;The Sixth Extinction&quot;. The first part of the ninth season opener, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, only attracted 10.6 million viewers, the series&#x27; lowest-rated season premiere.

The original series finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;, attracted 13.25 million viewers, the series&#x27; lowest rated season finale. The ninth season was the 63rd most-watched show for the 200102 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that &quot;The X-Files&quot; was over. When talking about the beginning of the ninth season, Carter said, &quot;We lost our audience on the first episode. It&#x27;s like the audience had gone away and I didn&#x27;t know how to find them. I didn&#x27;t want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back.&quot; While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, &quot;The X-Files&quot; production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, &quot;The X-Files&quot; had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Smallville&quot; in 2011.

The debut episode of the 2016 revival, &quot;My Struggle&quot;, first aired on January 24, 2016, and was watched by 16.19 million viewers. In terms of viewers, this made it the highest-rated episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to air since the eighth-season episode &quot;This Is Not Happening&quot; in 2001, which was watched by 16.9 million viewers. When DVR and streaming are taken into account, &quot;My Struggle&quot; was seen by 21.4 million viewers, scoring a 7.1 Nielsen rating. The season ended with &quot;My Struggle II&quot;, which was viewed by 7.60 million viewers. In total, the season was viewed by an average of 13.6 million viewers; it ranked as the seventh most-watched television series of the 201516 year, making it the highest-ranked season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; to ever air. A few years later, the premiere episode of the eleventh season, &quot;My Struggle III&quot;, was watched by 5.15 million viewers. This was a decrease from the previous season&#x27;s debut; it was also the lowest-rated premiere for any season of the show. The season concluded with &quot;My Struggle IV&quot;, which was seen by 3.43 million viewers, which was also a decrease from the previous season. &quot;My Struggle IV&quot;, which became the de facto finale for the series, was also the show&#x27;s lowest-rated finale. In total, the season was viewed by an average of 5.34 million viewers, and it ranked as the 91st most-watched television series of the 2018–19 year.

==== SVOD viewership ====
According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, &quot;The X-Files&quot; was the ninth most streamed television series across all platforms in the United States, during the week ending November 7, 2021.

===Films===
After several successful seasons, Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately turned into a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story that would not require the viewer to be familiar with the broadcast series. The movie was filmed in the hiatus between the show&#x27;s fourth and fifth seasons and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show&#x27;s fifth season. Due to the demands on the actors&#x27; schedules, some episodes of the fifth season focused on just one of the two leads. On June 19, 1998, the eponymous &quot;The X-Files&quot;, also known as &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot; was released. The crew intended the movie to be a continuation of the season five finale &quot;The End&quot;, but it was also meant to stand on its own. The season six premiere, &quot;The Beginning&quot;, began where the film ended.

The film was written by Carter and Spotnitz and directed by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film. It also featured the last appearance of John Neville as the Well-Manicured Man. Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praise—characters who had been introduced in the fifth-season finale and/or were integral to the television series—do not appear in the film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical release—due in part to its large promotional budget—&quot;The X-Files&quot; film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached $189 million. The film&#x27;s production cost and ad budgets were each close to $66 million. Unlike in the series, Anderson and Duchovny received equal pay for the film.

In November 2001, Carter decided to pursue a second film adaptation. Production was slated to begin after the ninth season, with a projected release in December 2003. In April 2002, Carter reiterated his desire and the studio&#x27;s desire to do a sequel film. He planned to write the script over the summer and begin production in spring or summer 2003 for a 2004 release. Carter described the film as independent of the series, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re looking at the movies as stand-alones. They&#x27;re not necessarily going to have to deal with the mythology.&quot; Bowman, who had directed various episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in the past as well as the 1998 film, expressed an interest in the sequel, but Carter took the job. Spotnitz co-authored the script with Carter. &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; became the second film based on the series, after 1998&#x27;s &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;. Filming began in December 2007 in Vancouver and finished on March 11, 2008.

The film was released in the United States on July 25, 2008, grossing $4 million on its opening day. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film&#x27;s stars both claimed that the timing of the movie&#x27;s release, a week after the highly popular Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics&#x27; consensus, stating, &quot;The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live [sic] up to &quot;The X-Files&quot;″ televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we&#x27;re meant to believe in.&quot;

=== Revival ===

In several interviews around the release, Carter said that if the &quot;X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series&#x27; mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth-season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 &quot;X-Files&quot; movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third &quot;X-Files&quot; film is &quot;looking pretty good&quot;. As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 1013, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter were interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying, &quot;If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that&#x27;s what it would be.&quot;

On January 17, 2015, Fox confirmed that they were looking at the possibility of bringing &quot;The X-Files&quot; back, not as a movie, but as a limited run television season. Fox chairman Dana Walden told reporters that &quot;conversations so far have only been logistical and are in very early stages&quot;, and that the series would only go forward if Carter, Anderson, and Duchovny were all on board, and that it was a matter of ensuring all of their timetables are open. On March 24, 2015, it was confirmed the series would return with series creator Chris Carter and lead actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. It premiered on January 24, 2016. A year later, on April 20, 2017, Fox officially announced that &quot;The X-Files&quot; would be returning for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which premiered on January 3, 2018.

=== Future ===
In January 2018, Gillian Anderson confirmed that season 11 would be her final season of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The following month, Carter stated in an interview that he could see the show continuing without Anderson. In May 2018, Fox&#x27;s co-CEO Gary Newman commented that &quot;there are no plans to do another season at the moment.&quot;

In October 2020, Chris Carter said: &quot;I always thought there would be even more &quot;X-Files&quot;.&quot; He admitted that continuing the series at this point with Duchovny and Anderson is unlikely, but has plans to continue the franchise with an upcoming animated spinoff. &quot;Being that Gillian has decided to move on with her career, we certainly couldn&#x27;t do Mulder and Scully again. But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t another way to do &quot;The X-Files&quot;. And so right now I think the future is unwritten.&quot; The rights are now owned by Disney.

== Home media ==
On September 24, 1996, the first &quot;wave&quot; set of &quot;The X-Files&quot; VHS tapes were released. Wave sets were released covering the first through fourth seasons. Each &quot;wave&quot; was three VHS tapes, each containing two episodes, for a total of six episodes per wave and two waves per season. For example, the home video release of wave one drew from the first half of the first season: &quot;Pilot&quot;/&quot;Deep Throat&quot;, &quot;Conduit&quot;/&quot;Ice&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;/&quot;Eve&quot;. Each wave was also available in a boxed set. Unlike later DVD season releases, the tapes did not include every episode from the seasons. Ultimately twelve episodes—approximately half the total number aired—were selected by Carter to represent each season, including nearly all &quot;mythology arc&quot; episodes and selected standalone episodes. Carter briefly introduced each episode with an explanation of why the episode was chosen and anecdotes from the set. These clips were later included on the full season DVDs. Wave eight, covering the last part of the fourth season, was the last to be released. No Carter interviews appeared on DVDs for later seasons. Many of the waves had collectible cards for each episode.

All nine seasons were released on DVD along with the two films. Seasons 1 to 4 were in fullscreen and seasons 5 and onward were in widescreen with the top and bottom of the opening credits cropped off. It is not widely known how accurate this is to the original broadcasts. The entire series was re-released on DVD in early 2006, in a &quot;slimmer&quot; package. The first five slim case versions did not come with some bonus materials that were featured in the original fold-out versions. However, seasons six, seven, eight and nine all contained the bonus materials found in the original versions. Episodic DVDs have also been released in Region 2, such as &quot;Deadalive&quot;, &quot;Existence&quot;, &quot;Nothing Important Happened Today&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;The Truth&quot;. Various other episodes were released on DVD and VHS. In 2005, four DVD sets were released containing the main story arc episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The four being &quot;Volume 1 Abduction&quot;, &quot;Volume 2 Black Oil&quot;, &quot;Volume 3 Colonization&quot; and &quot;Volume 4 Super Soldiers&quot;. A boxed set containing all nine seasons and the first film was made available in 2007, which contains all of the special features from the initial releases. The set also includes an additional disc of new bonus features and various collectibles, including a poster for the first film, a comic book, a set of collector cards and a guide to all 202 episodes across all nine seasons and the first film. Due to the fact that the set was released in 2007, the second film, which was released in 2008, is not included.

Release of &quot;The X-Files&quot;″ seasons on Blu-ray, restored in high-definition, was rumored to begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first-season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high-definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in high definition, marking the first time that the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu-ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the wrong fonts for the title sequence and season 8 was affected by color balance issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes (an issue known as &quot;black crush&quot;). These issues led to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct color balance.

==Spin-offs==
===&quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;===
&quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot; is an American science fiction television series created by Carter and broadcast on Fox and was crafted as a more humorous spin-off of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The series starred the eponymous Lone Gunmen and was first broadcast in March 2001, during &quot;The X-Files&quot;″s month-long hiatus. Although the debut episode garnered 13.23 million viewers, its ratings began to steadily drop. The program was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The last episode was broadcast in June 2001 and ended on a cliffhanger which was partially resolved in a ninth-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; titled &quot;Jump the Shark&quot;, included in the DVD release of the series.

===Comic books===

&quot;The X-Files&quot; was converted into a comic book series published by Topps Comics during the show&#x27;s third and fourth seasons. The initial comic books were written solely by Stefan Petrucha. According to Petrucha, there were three types of stories: &quot;those that dealt with the characters, those that dealt with the conspiracy, and the monster-of-the-week sort of stuff&quot;. Petrucha cited the latter as the easiest to write. Petrucha saw Scully as a &quot;scientist [...] with real world faith&quot;, and that the difference between [Mulder and Scully] is not that Mulder believes and Scully doesn&#x27;t; it&#x27;s more a difference in procedure.&quot; In this manner, Mulder&#x27;s viewpoint was often written to be just as valid as Scully&#x27;s, and Scully&#x27;s science was often portrayed to be just as convincing as Mulder&#x27;s more outlandish ideas. Petrucha was eventually fired and various other authors took up the job. Topps published 41 regular issues of &quot;The X-Files&quot; from 199598.

A &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;/&quot;The X-Files&quot; cross-over graphic novel was published by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of murders that may be linked to vampires.

In 2013, it was announced that &quot;The X-Files&quot; would return to comic book form with &quot;Season 10&quot;, now published by IDW. The series, which follows Mulder and Scully after the events of &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, was released in June 2013. Joe Harris wrote the series, and Michael Walsh and Jordie Bellaire provided the artwork. It was later announced that Carter himself would be the executive producer for the series and would be &quot;providing feedback to the creative team regarding scripts and outlines to keep the new stories in line with existing and on-going canon.&quot; The series restarted the series&#x27; mythology, and the first arc of the story focused on &quot;seek[ing] to bring the mythology of the Alien Conspiracy back up to date in a more paranoid, post-terror, post-WikiLeaks society.&quot; In addition, sequels to popular Monster-of-the-Week episodes were made. &quot;The X-Files Season 10&quot; concluded on July 1, 2015, after 25 issues.

In August 2015, &quot;The X-Files Season 11&quot; comic book began, also published by IDW. The eight-issue series served as a continuation of the TV show. Chris Carter was the Executive Producer of the comic book series, while the issues were written by Joe Harris and illustrated by Matthew Dow Smith and Jordie Bellaire.
===Potential series===
In August 2020, Fox announced that an animated comedy-oriented reboot series was in development, under the working title &quot;The X-Files: Albuquerque&quot;. In March 2023, it was confirmed the series would not be moving forward. The same month, it was reported that Ryan Coogler is developing a new reboot of the series, per series creator Chris Carter. In February 2024, Carter confirmed he is not involved with its production.

== Critical reception ==

=== Overall ===
&quot;The X-Files&quot; received positive reviews from television critics, with many calling it one of the best series that aired on American television in the 1990s. Ian Burrell from the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; called the show &quot;one of the greatest cult shows in modern television&quot;. Richard Corliss from &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the show the &quot;cultural touchstone of&quot; the 1990s. Hal Boedeker from the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said in 1996 that the series had grown from a cult favorite to a television &quot;classic&quot;. The &quot;Evening Herald&quot; said the show had &quot;overwhelming influence&quot; on television, in front of such shows as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at #4 in the &quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years&quot;, describing it as &quot;a paean to oddballs, sci-fi fans, conspiracy theorists and Area 51 pilgrims everywhere. Ratings improved every year for the first five seasons, while Mulder and Scully&#x27;s believer-versus-skeptic dynamic created a TV template that&#x27;s still in heavy use today.&quot;

In 2004 and 2007, &quot;The X-Files&quot; ranked #2 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot;. In 2002, the show ranked as the 37th best television show of all time. In 1997, the episodes &quot;Clyde Bruckman&#x27;s Final Repose&quot; and &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; respectively ranked #10 and #72 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; included it in its list of the &quot;60 Greatest Dramas of All Time&quot; and ranked it as the #4 science fiction show and the #25 best series of all time. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; included it on a list of the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the fourth-best piece of science fiction media, the fourth best TV show in the last 25 years and in 2009, named it the fourth-best in their list of the &quot;20 Greatest Sci-fi TV Shows&quot; in history. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;The X-Files&quot; ninth best TV show in history, further claiming that the best episode was the third season entry &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s From Outer Space&quot;. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;The X-Files&quot; #26 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series. In 2015, on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s entertainment-industry ranked TV list &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s 100 Favorite TV Shows&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot; appeared at #3. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, MediaDNA research discovered that &quot;The X-Files&quot; was on top of the list of the most innovative TV brands. In 2009, it was announced that the show&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;The Truth Is Out There&quot; was among Britain&#x27;s top 60 best-known slogans and quotes.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; has been criticized for being unscientific and privileging paranormal and supernatural ideas (e.g. the hypotheses made by Mulder). For instance, in 1998, Richard Dawkins wrote that &quot;&quot;The X-Files&quot; systematically purveys an anti-rational view of the world which, by virtue of its recurrent persistence, is insidious.&quot;

=== First seven seasons ===
The pilot episode was generally well received by fans and critics. &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the episode for &quot;using reworked concepts&quot;, but praised the production and noted its potential. Of the acting, &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Duchovny&#x27;s delineation of a serious scientist with a sense of humor should win him partisans and Anderson&#x27;s wavering doubter connects well. They&#x27;re a solid team...&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised the writing and direction: &quot;Mandel&#x27;s cool direction of Carter&#x27;s ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci-fi a boost.&quot; The magazine concluded, &quot;Carter&#x27;s dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that Scully &quot;was set up as a scoffing skeptic&quot; in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of four episodes, the magazine called &quot;The X-Files&quot; &quot;the most paranoid, subversive show on TV&quot;, noting the &quot;marvelous tension between Anderson—who is dubious about these events—and Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer&quot;. &quot;Virgin Media&quot; said the most memorable &quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot; was Eugene Tooms from &quot;Squeeze&quot; and &quot;Tooms&quot;.

The following four seasons received similar praise. During the show&#x27;s second season, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;The X-Files&quot; the &quot;Program of the Year&quot; for 1994, stating &quot;no other show on television gives off the vibe that &quot;The X-Files&quot; does&quot;. &quot;The DVD Journal&quot; gave the second season four out of four stars, calling it a &quot;memorable season&quot;. The review highlighted &quot;The Host&quot;, &quot;Duane Barry&quot; and &quot;Ascension&quot;, the cliffhanger finale &quot;Anasazi&quot;, the &quot;unforgettable&quot; &quot;Humbug&quot; and meeting Mulder and Scully&#x27;s families in &quot;Colony&quot; and &quot;One Breath&quot;. IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had &quot;started to explore a little&quot; and the &quot;evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar&quot;. Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; argued that the third season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; was the show&#x27;s &quot;best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time&quot;, noting it was consistent and &quot;[swung] from strength to strength&quot; between mythology and stand-alone episodes. Michael Sauter of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the fifth season an &quot;A&quot;, writing that it &quot;proves the show was—even then—still at its creative peak (if only for another year or so) and full of surprises&quot;. He praised the new additions to the series&#x27; mythology and concluded that &quot;many stand-alone episodes now look like classics&quot;. Francis Dass, writing for the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, noted that the season was &quot;very interesting&quot; and included &quot;truly inspiring and hilarious&quot; episodes.

After the 1998 film, the show began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some longtime fans became alienated during the show&#x27;s sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the &quot;Monsters-of-the-Week&quot; style, they were often romantic or humorous or both, such as &quot;Arcadia&quot; or &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was &quot;making it all up as he goes along&quot;. As for the seventh season, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that while most of the first eight seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot; were &quot;good-to-great&quot;, the seventh season of the show was &quot;flagging&quot; and possessed &quot;significant problems&quot;. Despite this, seasons six and seven included several episodes that were lauded by critics, including the sixth season entries &quot;Triangle&quot; and &quot;The Unnatural&quot;, as well as the seventh season installment &quot;X-Cops&quot;.

=== Eighth and ninth seasons ===
The show&#x27;s eighth season received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted that the eighth season was &quot;revitalized by the new &#x27;search for Mulder&#x27; story-arc&quot;. Amy H. Sturgis commended the eighth season, praising Anderson&#x27;s performance as Scully as &quot;excellence&quot; and positively wrote that Doggett was &quot;non-Mulderish&quot;. Collin Polonowonski from &quot;DVD Times&quot; said that the season included &quot;more hits than misses overall&quot; but offered a negative word about the mythology episodes, claiming that they were the &quot;weakest&quot; episodes in the season. Jesse Hassenger from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, however, criticized the new season, claiming that Patrick was miscast and calling Duchovny&#x27;s appearances as Mulder shallow.

The ninth season received mixed to negative reviews by critics, and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, called the show &quot;a pale reflection of the show it once was&quot;. Elizabeth Weinbloom from &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded, &quot;shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship&quot;, between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a &quot;waning phenomenon&quot;. Another &quot;The New York Times&quot; review stated, &quot;The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; listed the ninth season and the 2008 film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; as the &quot;bad apple&quot; of &quot;The X-Files&quot; franchise, describing the ninth season as &quot;clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called &#x27;super soldiers&#x27;&quot;. Brian Linder from &quot;IGN&quot;, on the other hand, was more positive toward the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish&#x27;s characters.

=== Tenth and eleventh seasons ===
The 2016 revival of the show was met with mixed reviews; the first and last episodes were met with lukewarm to negative reviews from critics, whereas episodes two through five were generally well received. The third episode in particular, named &quot;Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster&quot;, was praised by critics, with Alex McCown of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; calling it an &quot;instant classic&quot;. Overall, the review aggregator Metacritic gave the season a score of 60 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Likewise, Rotten Tomatoes gave the revival a 64% approval rating with an average score of 6.5 out of 10 based on 180 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny&#x27;s chemistry remains intact, but overall, &quot;The X-Files&quot; revival lacks the creative spark necessary to sustain the initial rush of nostalgia.&quot;

The eleventh season received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the season a score of 67 out of 100 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a rating of 77%, with an average score of 6.65 out of 10 based on 170 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Although it may not make many new believers, &quot;The X-Files&quot; return to business as usual is a refreshing upgrade from the show&#x27;s underwhelming previous outing.&quot; Episodes &quot;The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat&quot;, &quot;Ghouli&quot;, &quot;Rm9sbG93ZXJz&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot; received a 100% approval rating on the website.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;The X-Files&quot; received prestigious awards over its nine-year run, totaling 62 Emmy nominations and 16 awards. Capping its successful first season, &quot;The X-Files&quot; crew members James Castle, Bruce Bryant and Carol Johnsen won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Graphic Design and Title Sequences in 1994. In 1995, the show was nominated for seven Emmy Awards with one win.

In 1999, it won one out of eight in the category for Outstanding Makeup for a Series. Season seven won three Emmys from six nominations. The following season would not be as successful, catching only two nominations and winning again in the Makeup category for &quot;Deadalive&quot;. The ninth season received one nomination in Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore).

The show was nominated for 12 Golden Globe Awards overall, winning five. The first nomination came in 1994, when the show won Best Series Drama. The following year, Anderson and Duchovny were nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Leading Role, respectively. In 1996, the series won three awards; Anderson and Duchovny for Best Actress and Actor and for Best Series Drama. In 1997 and 1998, the show received the same three nominations. In 1997, however, the series won Best Series Drama&quot;. In 1998, the series won no award and received no nominations thereafter.

The show was nominated for 14 SAG Awards overall, winning twice. In 1996 and 1997, Anderson won for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. In 1996, the show won a Peabody Award for being able &quot;to convey ideas that are both entertaining and thought-provoking&quot;.

As &quot;The X-Files&quot; saw its viewership expand from a &quot;small, but devoted&quot; group of fans to a worldwide mass cult audience, digital telecommunications were becoming mainstream. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;this may have been the first show to find its audience growth tied to the growth of the Internet&quot;. Fans of the show became commonly known as &quot;X-Philes&quot;, a term coined from the Greek root &quot;-phil-&quot; meaning love or obsession. X-Philes reviewed episodes on unofficial websites, formed communities with other fans through Usenet newsgroups and listservs, and wrote their own fan fiction.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; also &quot;caught on with viewers who wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily consider themselves sci-fi fans&quot;. While Carter argued that the show was plot-driven, many fans saw it as character-driven. Duchovny and Anderson were characterized as &quot;Internet sex symbols&quot;. As the show grew in popularity, subgroups of fans developed, such as &quot;shippers&quot;, hoping for a romantic or sexual partnership between Mulder and Scully, or those who already perceived one between the lines. The usage of the term &quot;ship&quot; in its relationship sense appears to have been originated by Internet fans of &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

Other groups arose to pay tribute to the stars or their characters, while others joined the subculture of &quot;slash&quot; fiction. In the summer of 1996, a journalist wrote, &quot;There are entire forums online devoted to the &#x27;M/S&#x27; [Mulder and Scully] relationship.&quot; In addition to &quot;MOTW&quot;, Internet fans invented acronyms such as &quot;UST&quot;, meaning &quot;unresolved sexual tension&quot;, and &quot;COTR&quot;, standing for &quot;conversation on the rock&quot;—referencing a popular scene in the third-season episode &quot;Quagmire&quot;—to aid in their discussions of the agents&#x27; relationship, which was itself identified as the &quot;MSR&quot;.

The producers did not endorse some fans&#x27; readings, according to a study on the subject: Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos [those against the idea of a Mulder/Scully romance] that theirs is the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show&#x27;s success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He can deny that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be. The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter&#x27;s 1999 episode &quot;Milagro&quot; was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point &quot;she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent&quot;. The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after them. For example, Leyla Harrison, played by Jolie Jenkins and introduced in the eighth-season episode &quot;Alone&quot;, was created and named in memory of an Internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001.

=== Merchandise ===
&quot;The X-Files&quot; spawned an industry of spin-off products. In 2004, U.S.-based Topps Comics, and most recently DC Comics imprint Wildstorm, launched a new series of licensed tie-in comics. During the series run, the Fox Broadcasting Company published the official &quot;The X-Files Magazine&quot;. &quot;The X-Files&quot; Collectible Card Game was released in 1996, and an expansion set was released in 1997. 

&quot;The X-Files&quot; has inspired four video games. In 1997, Fox Interactive released &quot;The X-Files: Unrestricted Access&quot;, a game-style database for Windows and Mac, which allowed users access to every case file. In 1998, &quot;The X-Files Game&quot; was released for the PC and Macintosh and a year later for the PlayStation. This game is set within the timeline of the second or third season and follows an Agent Craig Willmore in his search for the missing Mulder and Scully. In 2004, &quot;The X-Files: Resist or Serve&quot; was released. The survival-horror game for the PlayStation 2 is an original story set in the seventh season. It allows the player control of both Mulder and Scully. Both games feature acting and voice work from members of the series&#x27; cast. A mobile mystery investigation game &quot;The X-Files: Deep State&quot; was released in February 2018. The story of the game takes place between seasons 9 and 10 of the show and follows two FBI agents, Casey Winter and Garret Dale, as they investigate a conspiracy. A six-player pinball game, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, was produced by Sega in 1997.
=== Legacy ===
&quot;The X-Files&quot; directly inspired other TV series, including &quot;Strange World&quot;, &quot;The Burning Zone&quot;, &quot;Special Unit 2&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, &quot;The Visitor&quot;, &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, with key aspects carried over to more standard crime dramas, such as &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot;. The influence can be seen on other levels: television series such as &quot;Lost&quot; developed their own complex mythologies. In terms of characterization, the role of Dana Scully was seen as innovative, changing &quot;how women [on television] were not just perceived but behaved&quot; and perhaps influencing the portrayal of other &quot;strong women&quot; investigators. Russell T Davies said &quot;The X-Files&quot; had been an inspiration on his series &quot;Torchwood&quot;, describing it as &quot;dark, wild and sexy... &quot;The X-Files&quot; meets &quot;This Life&quot;&quot;. Other shows have been influenced by the tone and mood of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. For example, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; drew from the mood and coloring of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, as well as from its occasional blend of horror and humor; creator Joss Whedon described his show as &quot;a cross between &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;&quot;. It also inspired themes in video games &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;.

The show&#x27;s popularity led it to become a major aspect of popular culture. The show is parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season eight episode &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;, which aired on January 12, 1997. In it, Mulder and Scully—voiced by Duchovny and Anderson—are sent to Springfield to investigate an alien sighting by Homer Simpson, but end up finding no evidence other than Homer&#x27;s word and depart. Cigarette Smoking Man appears in the background when Homer is interviewed, and the show&#x27;s theme plays during one scene. Nathan Ditum from &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked Duchovny and Anderson&#x27;s performances as the fourth-best guest appearances in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; history. In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot;, Benjamin Sisko is interviewed by Federation Department of Temporal Investigations agents Dulmer and Lucsly, anagrams of Mulder and Scully, respectively. The pair were later expanded upon in Christopher L. Bennett&#x27;s book &quot;Watching the Clock&quot;. &quot;The X-Files&quot; has also been parodied or referenced in shows such as &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot; (which stars David Duchovny), &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. British music act Catatonia released the 1998 single &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot;, which became a top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart. American singer and songwriter Bree Sharp wrote a song in 1999 called &quot;David Duchovny&quot; about the actor that heavily references the show. Although never a mainstream hit, the song became popular underground and gained a cult following. Finnish band Sonata Arctica released, in 1999, &quot;Letter to Dana&quot;, in which the title character, Dana O&#x27;Hara, is named after Scully. The series has also been referenced in songs such as &quot;The Bad Touch&quot; by the Bloodhound Gang, &quot;A Change&quot; by Sheryl Crow, &quot;Year 2000&quot; by Xzibit, and &quot;One Week&quot; by Barenaked Ladies.

Carter, Duchovny and Anderson celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series at a July 18, 2013, panel at San Diego Comic-Con hosted by &quot;TV Guide&quot;. During the discussion, Anderson discussed Scully&#x27;s influence on female fans, relating that a number of women have informed her that they pursued physics careers because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an &quot;X-Files&quot; miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, &quot;You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again.&quot; On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History, including the original pilot script and the &quot;I Want to Believe&quot; poster from Mulder&#x27;s office.

In an interview with &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, series&#x27; writers Jim Wong and Glenn Morgan acknowledged that the show likely played a role in bringing conspiracy theories to a mainstream audience, helping to erode trust in public institutions. Similarly, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed, series creator Chris Carter wrote: The Truth Is Out There,&#x27; &#x27;Trust No One,&#x27; &#x27;Deny Everything&#x27; went the provocative catchphrases on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, but that was in the &#x27;90s, when we had a relatively shared reality. The slogans are now a fact of life.&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Jordan Hoffman later argued that Carter&#x27;s piece was imbued with &quot;a bit of a mea culpa vibe&quot;.

<doc id="30305" wikidata="Q180194" url="?curid=30305" title="Third World">
<text>The term Third World arose during the Cold War to define countries that remained non-aligned with either NATO or the Warsaw Pact. The United States, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Western European countries and other allies represented the &quot;First World&quot;, while the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and their allies represented the &quot;Second World&quot;. This terminology provided a way of broadly categorizing the nations of the Earth into three groups based on political divisions. Due to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition of the Third World. Strictly speaking, &quot;Third World&quot; was a political, rather than economic, grouping. 

Since most Third World countries were economically poor and non-industrialized, it became a stereotype to refer to developing countries as &quot;third-world countries&quot;. In political discourse, the term Third World was often associated with being underdeveloped. China was labeled &quot;Third World&quot; for several decades in the 20th century before its robust and phenomenal development of the 21st century. Some countries in the Eastern Bloc, such as Cuba, were often regarded as Third World. The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa, Latin America, Oceania, and Asia. It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the dependency theory of thinkers like Raúl Prebisch, Walter Rodney, Theotônio dos Santos, and others, the Third World has also been connected to the world-systemic economic division as &quot;periphery&quot; countries dominated by the countries comprising the economic &quot;core&quot;.

In the Cold War, some European democracies (Austria, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland) were neutral in the sense of not joining NATO, but were prosperous, never joined the Non-Aligned Movement, and seldom self-identified as part of the Third World.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the term &quot;Third World&quot; has decreased in use. It is being replaced with terms such as developing countries, least developed countries or the Global South.

==Etymology==

The demographer, anthropologist, and historian Alfred Sauvy, in an article published in the French magazine &quot;&quot;, August 14, 1952, coined the term &quot;third world&quot; (), referring to countries that were playing a small role in international trade and business. His usage was a reference to the Third Estate (), the commoners of France who, before and during the French Revolution, opposed the clergy and nobles, who composed the First Estate and Second Estate, respectively (hence the use of the older form &quot;tiers&quot; rather than the modern for &quot;third&quot;). Sauvy wrote, &quot;This third world ignored, exploited, despised like the third estate also wants to be something.&quot; In the context of the Cold War, he conveyed the concept of political non-alignment with either the capitalist or communist bloc. Simplistic interpretations quickly led to the term merely designating these unaligned countries.

=== Third World vs. Three Worlds ===

The &quot;Three Worlds Theory&quot; developed by Mao Zedong is different from the Western theory of the Three Worlds or Third World. For example, in the Western theory, China and India belong respectively to the second and third worlds, but in Mao&#x27;s theory both China and India are part of the Third World which he defined as consisting of exploited nations.

=== Third Worldism ===
Third Worldism is a political movement that argues for the unity of third-world nations against first-world influence and the principle of non-interference in other countries&#x27; domestic affairs. Groups most notable for expressing and exercising this idea are the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Group of 77 which provide a base for relations and diplomacy between not just the third-world countries, but between the third-world and the first and second worlds. The notion has been criticized as providing a fig leaf for human rights violations and political repression by dictatorships.

Since 1990, this term has been redefined to make it more correct politically. Initially, the term “third world” meant that a nation is “under-developed”. However, today it is replaced by the term “developing&quot;.

=== Great Divergence and Great Convergence ===

Many times there is a clear distinction between First and Third Worlds. When talking about the Global North and Global South, the majority of the time the two go hand in hand. People refer to the two as &quot;Third World/South&quot; and &quot;First World/North&quot; because the Global North is more affluent and developed, whereas the Global South is less developed and often poorer.

To counter this mode of thought, some scholars began proposing the idea of a change in world dynamics that began in the late 1980s, and termed it the Great Convergence. As Jack A. Goldstone and his colleagues put it, &quot;in the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s, then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s, it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries&quot;.

Others have observed a return to Cold War-era alignments (MacKinnon, 2007; Lucas, 2008), this time with substantial changes between 1990–2015 in geography, the world economy and relationship dynamics between current and emerging world powers; not necessarily redefining the classic meaning of &quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;, and &quot;Third World&quot; terms, but rather which countries belong to them by way of association to which world power or coalition of countries, such as the G7, the European Union, OECD; G20, OPEC, N-11, BRICS, ASEAN; the African Union, and the Eurasian Union.

== History ==
Most Third World countries are former colonies. Having gained independence, many of these countries, especially smaller ones, were faced with the challenges of nation- and institution-building on their own for the first time. Due to this common background, many of these nations were &quot;developing&quot; in economic terms for most of the 20th century, and many still are. This term, used today, generally denotes countries that have not developed to the same levels as OECD countries, and are thus in the process of &quot;developing&quot;.

In the 1980s, economist Peter Bauer offered a competing definition for the term &quot;Third World&quot;. He claimed that the attachment of Third World status to a particular country was not based on any stable economic or political criteria, and was a mostly arbitrary process. The large diversity of countries considered part of the Third World, from Indonesia to Afghanistan, ranged widely from economically primitive to economically advanced and from politically non-aligned to Soviet- or Western-leaning. An argument could also be made for how parts of the U.S. are more like the Third World.

The only characteristic that Bauer found common in all Third World countries was that their governments &quot;demand and receive Western aid,&quot; which he strongly opposed. The aggregate term &quot;Third World&quot; was challenged as misleading even during the Cold War period, because it had no consistent or collective identity among the countries it supposedly encompassed.

=== Development aid ===
During the Cold War, unaligned countries of the Third World were seen as potential allies by both the First and Second World. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union went to great lengths to establish connections in these countries by offering economic and military support to gain strategically located alliances (e.g., the United States in Vietnam or the Soviet Union in Cuba). By the end of the Cold War, many Third World countries had adopted capitalist or communist economic models and continued to receive support from the side they had chosen. Throughout the Cold War and beyond, the countries of the Third World have been the priority recipients of Western foreign aid and the focus of economic development through mainstream theories such as modernization theory and dependency theory.

By the end of the 1960s, the idea of the Third World came to represent countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that were considered underdeveloped by the West based on several characteristics: low economic development, low life expectancy, high rates of poverty and disease, and others. These countries became the targets for aid and support from governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals from wealthier nations. One popular model, known as Rostow&#x27;s stages of growth, argued that development took place in five stages: traditional society, pre-conditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and age of high mass consumption. W. W. Rostow argued that &quot;take-off&quot; was the critical stage with which the Third World was struggling, which some argued could be facilitated through foreign aid.

=== Perceived &quot;End of the Third World&quot; ===
Since 1990 the term &quot;Third World&quot; evolved to denote countries with less economic development. The term &quot;Third World&quot; is increasingly perceived to be politically incorrect or outdated, as it is a historical term that isn&#x27;t as relevant in modern day geopolitics. Around the early 1960s, the term &quot;underdeveloped countries&quot; was frequently used to refer to roughly the same group of countries. This term was in turn replaced by &#x27;developing&#x27; and &#x27;less-developed&#x27; countries, as politicians found that the earlier term contributed to stereotypes or disrespect of this group of countries. 

The general definition of the Third World can be traced back to the history that nations positioned as neutral and independent during the Cold War were considered as Third World Countries, and normally these countries are defined by high poverty rates, lack of resources, and unstable financial standing. However, based on the rapid development of modernization and globalization, some countries previously considered to be Third World countries, such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia, achieved large economic growth and are no longer considered poor nations in the 21st century. 

The differences among nations of the Third World are continually growing throughout time, and it will be hard to use the Third World to define and organize groups of nations based on their common political arrangements since most countries live under diverse creeds in this era, such as Mexico, El Salvador, and Singapore, which each have their distinct political systems. The Third World categorization becomes anachronistic since its political classification and economic system are distinct to be applied in today&#x27;s society. Based on the Third World standards, any region of the world can be categorized into any of the four types of relationships among state and society, and will eventually end in four outcomes: praetorianism, multi-authority, quasi-democratic and viable democracy.

<doc id="30307" wikidata="Q2085" url="?curid=30307" title="Twin Peaks">
<text>Twin Peaks is an American surrealist mystery-horror drama television series created by Mark Frost and David Lynch. It premiered on ABC on April 8, 1990, and ran for two seasons until its cancellation in 1991. The show returned in 2017 for a third season on Showtime.

Set in the fictional Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks, the series follows an investigation led by FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) into the murder of local teenager Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The show&#x27;s narrative draws on the characteristics of detective fiction, but its uncanny tone, supernatural elements, and campy, melodramatic portrayal of eccentric characters also draw from American soap opera and horror tropes. Like much of Lynch&#x27;s work, it is distinguished by surrealism, distinctive cinematography, and offbeat humor. The musical score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti with Lynch.

The original run was followed by the 1992 feature film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, which serves as a prequel to the series. The success of the series sparked a media franchise, leading to the release of several tie-in books, including &quot;The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer&quot;. Under Lynch&#x27;s direction, the show&#x27;s 2017 revival included much of the original cast.

In the years following the first two seasons, the show has gained a devoted cult following and been referenced in a wide variety of media. &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; is often listed among the greatest television series and has received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences as well as various accolades. It is considered a landmark turning point in television drama. The 2017 revival also received widespread critical acclaim.

==Plot and series overview==

===Season 1===

In 1989, local logger Pete Martell discovers a naked corpse wrapped in plastic on the bank of a river outside the town of Twin Peaks, Washington. When Sheriff Harry S. Truman, his deputies, and doctor Will Hayward arrive, the body is identified as high school senior and homecoming queen Laura Palmer. A second girl, Ronette Pulaski, is discovered as well, and is badly injured and dissociative just across the state border.

FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate. Cooper&#x27;s initial examination of Laura&#x27;s body reveals a tiny typed letter &quot;R&quot; inserted under her fingernail. At a town conference, Cooper informs the community that Laura&#x27;s death matches the signature of a killer who murdered another girl in southwestern Washington the previous year, and that the evidence potentially indicates the killer being from Twin Peaks.

Through Laura&#x27;s diaries, local law enforcement alongside Agent Cooper discover that she had been living a double life. She was cheating on her boyfriend, football captain Bobby Briggs, with biker James Hurley, and prostituting herself with the help of truck driver Leo Johnson and drug dealer Jacques Renault. Laura was also addicted to cocaine, which she obtained through coercing Bobby into doing business with Jacques.

Laura&#x27;s father, attorney Leland Palmer, suffers a nervous breakdown after her death. Her best friend Donna Hayward begins a relationship with James. With the help of Laura&#x27;s cousin Maddy Ferguson, Donna and James discover that Laura&#x27;s psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, was obsessed with her, but he is proven innocent of the murder.

Hotelier Ben Horne, the wealthiest man in Twin Peaks, plans to destroy the town&#x27;s lumber mill along with its owner, Josie Packard, and murder his lover, Josie&#x27;s sister-in-law and Pete&#x27;s wife Catherine Martell, so he can purchase the land at a reduced price and complete a development project called Ghostwood. Horne&#x27;s sultry, troubled daughter, Audrey, becomes infatuated with Agent Cooper and spies on her father for clues in an effort to win Agent Cooper&#x27;s affection.

Cooper has a dream in which he is approached by a one-armed otherworldly being who calls himself MIKE. MIKE says that Laura&#x27;s murderer is a similar entity, Killer BOB, a feral, denim-clad man with long gray hair. Cooper finds himself decades older with Laura and a dwarf in a red business suit, who engages in coded dialogue with Cooper. The next morning, Cooper tells Truman that if they can decipher the dream, they can find out who murdered Laura.

Cooper and the sheriff&#x27;s department find the one-armed man from Cooper&#x27;s dream, a traveling shoe salesman named Phillip Gerard. Gerard knows a Bob, the veterinarian who treats Renault&#x27;s pet bird. Cooper interprets these events to mean that Renault is the murderer, and with Truman&#x27;s help, tracks Renault to One-Eyed Jack&#x27;s, a brothel owned by Horne across the border in Canada. He lures Renault back onto U.S. soil to arrest him, but Renault is shot while trying to escape and is hospitalized.

Leland, learning that Renault has been arrested, sneaks into the hospital and smothers him to death. The same night, Horne orders Leo to burn down the lumber mill with Catherine trapped inside and has Leo gunned down by Hank Jennings to ensure Leo&#x27;s silence. Cooper returns to his room following Renault&#x27;s arrest and is shot by a masked gunman.

===Season 2===

Lying hurt in his hotel room, Cooper has a vision in which a giant appears and reveals three clues: &quot;There is a man in a smiling bag,&quot; &quot;the owls are not what they seem,&quot; and &quot;without chemicals, he points.&quot; He takes a gold ring off Cooper&#x27;s finger and explains that when Cooper understands the three premonitions, his ring will be returned.

Leo Johnson survives his shooting but is left brain-damaged. Catherine Martell disappears, presumed killed in the mill fire. Leland Palmer, whose hair has turned white overnight, returns to work but behaves erratically. Cooper deduces that the &quot;man in the smiling bag&quot; is the corpse of Jacques Renault in a body bag.

MIKE is inhabiting the body of Phillip Gerard. His personality surfaces when Gerard forgoes the use of a certain drug. MIKE reveals that he and BOB once collaborated in killing humans and that BOB is similarly inhabiting a man in the town. Cooper and the sheriff&#x27;s department use MIKE, in control of Gerard&#x27;s body, to help find BOB (&quot;without chemicals, he points&quot;).

Donna befriends an agoraphobic orchid grower named Harold Smith whom Laura entrusted with her second, secret diary. Harold catches Donna and Maddy attempting to steal the diary from him and hangs himself in despair. Cooper and the sheriff&#x27;s department take possession of Laura&#x27;s secret diary and learn that BOB, a friend of her father&#x27;s, had been sexually abusing her since childhood and she used drugs to cope. They initially suspect that the killer is Ben Horne and arrest him, but Leland Palmer is revealed to viewers to be BOB&#x27;s host when he kills Maddy.

Cooper begins to doubt Horne&#x27;s guilt, so he gathers all of his suspects in the belief that he will receive a sign to help him identify the killer. The Giant appears and confirms that Leland is BOB&#x27;s host and Laura&#x27;s and Maddy&#x27;s killer, giving Cooper back his ring. Cooper and Truman take Leland into custody. In control of Leland&#x27;s body, BOB admits to a string of murders, before forcing Leland to commit suicide. As Leland dies, he is freed of BOB&#x27;s influence and begs for forgiveness. BOB&#x27;s spirit disappears into the woods in the form of an owl and the lawmen wonder if he will reappear.

Cooper is set to leave Twin Peaks when he is framed for drug trafficking by Jean Renault and is suspended from the FBI. Renault holds Cooper responsible for the death of his brothers, Jacques and Bernard. Jean Renault is killed in a shootout with police, and Cooper is cleared of all charges.

Windom Earle, Cooper&#x27;s former mentor and FBI partner, escapes from a mental institution and comes to Twin Peaks. Cooper had previously been having an affair with Earle&#x27;s wife, Caroline, while she was under his protection as a witness to a federal crime. Earle murdered Caroline and wounded Cooper. He now engages Cooper in a twisted game of chess during which Earle murders someone whenever a piece is captured.

Investigating BOB&#x27;s origin and whereabouts with the help of Major Garland Briggs, Cooper learns of the existence of the White Lodge and the Black Lodge, two extra-dimensional realms whose entrances are somewhere in the woods surrounding Twin Peaks.

Catherine returns to town disguised as a Japanese businessman, having survived the mill fire, and manipulates Ben Horne into signing the Ghostwood project over to her. Andrew Packard, Josie&#x27;s husband, is revealed to be still alive while Josie Packard is revealed to be the person who shot Cooper at the end of the first season. Andrew forces Josie to confront his business rival and her tormentor from Hong Kong, the sinister Thomas Eckhardt. Josie kills Eckhardt, but she mysteriously dies when Truman and Cooper try to apprehend her.

Cooper falls in love with a new arrival in town, Annie Blackburn. Earle captures the brain-damaged Leo for use as a henchman and abandons his chess game with Cooper. When Annie wins the Miss Twin Peaks contest, Earle kidnaps her and takes her to the entrance to the Black Lodge, whose power he seeks to use for himself.

Through a series of clues Cooper discovers the entrance to the Black Lodge, which turns out to be the strange, red-curtained room from his dream. He is greeted by the Man From Another Place, the Giant, and Laura Palmer, who each give Cooper cryptic messages. Searching for Annie and Earle, Cooper encounters doppelgängers of various people, including Maddy Ferguson and Leland Palmer. Cooper finds Earle, who demands Cooper&#x27;s soul in exchange for Annie&#x27;s life. Cooper agrees but BOB appears and takes Earle&#x27;s soul for himself. BOB then turns to Cooper, who is chased through the lodge by a doppelgänger of himself.

Outside the lodge, Andrew Packard, Pete Martell and Audrey Horne are caught in an explosion at a bank vault, a trap laid by the dead Eckhardt.

Cooper and Annie reappear in the woods, both injured. Annie is taken to the hospital but Cooper recovers in his room at the Great Northern Hotel. It becomes clear that the &quot;Cooper&quot; who emerged from the Lodge is in fact his doppelgänger, under BOB&#x27;s control. He smashes his head into a bathroom mirror and laughs maniacally.

===Season 3===
25 years after the cliffhanger ending of season two, Cooper remains trapped in the Black Lodge and prepares his return to the world. Cooper&#x27;s doppelgänger lives in Cooper&#x27;s place and works to prevent his own imminent return to the Black Lodge with the help of various associates. Meanwhile, the mysterious murder of a librarian in Buckhorn, South Dakota attracts the attention of Cole and his colleagues, while a message from the Log Lady (Catherine Coulson) leads members of the Twin Peaks Sheriff&#x27;s Department to reopen investigations into the events surrounding the 1989 murder of Laura Palmer.

Season 3 of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was announced on October 6, 2014, as a limited series that would air on Showtime. David Lynch and Mark Frost wrote all the episodes, and Lynch directed. Frost emphasized that the new episodes were not a remake or reboot, but a continuation of the series and film, and the passage of 25 years is an important element of the plot. The third season is also known as &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks: A Limited Event Series&quot;.

Most of the original cast returns, including Kyle MacLachlan, Mädchen Amick, Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, and several others. Additions include Jeremy Davies, Laura Dern, Robert Forster, Tim Roth, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Amanda Seyfried, Matthew Lillard, and Naomi Watts.

==Production==

===Development===
In the 1980s, Mark Frost worked for three years as a writer for the television police drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981–1987), which featured a large cast and extended story lines. Following his success with &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), David Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film about the life of Marilyn Monroe named &quot;Venus Descending&quot;, based on the best-selling book &quot;Goddess&quot;. Lynch recalls being &quot;sort of interested. I loved the idea of this woman in trouble, but I didn&#x27;t know if I liked it being a real story.&quot; Lynch and Frost first worked together on the &quot;Goddess&quot; screenplay, and although the project was dropped by Warner Bros., they became good friends. They went on to work as writer and director for &quot;One Saliva Bubble&quot;, a film with Steve Martin attached to star, but it was never made either. Lynch&#x27;s agent, Tony Krantz, encouraged him to do a television show. Lynch said: &quot;Tony I don&#x27;t want to do a TV show.&quot; He took Lynch to Nibblers restaurant in Los Angeles and said: &quot;You should do a show about real life in America—your vision of America the same way you demonstrated it in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;.&quot; Lynch got an &quot;idea of a small-town thing&quot;, and though he and Frost were not keen on it, they decided to humor Krantz. Frost wanted to tell &quot;a sort of Dickensian story about multiple lives in a contained area that could sort of go perpetually&quot;. Originally, the show was to be titled &quot;North Dakota&quot; and set in the Plains region of North Dakota.

After Frost, Krantz, and Lynch rented a screening room in Beverly Hills and screened &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, they decided to develop the town before its inhabitants. Due to the lack of forests and mountains in North Dakota, the title was changed from &quot;North Dakota&quot; to &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (the title of the pilot episode), and the location to the Pacific Northwest, specifically Washington. They then drew a map and decided that there would be a lumber mill in the town. Then they came up with an image of a body washing up on the shore of a lake. Lynch remembers: &quot;We knew where everything was located and that helped us determine the prevailing atmosphere and what might happen there.&quot; Frost remembers that he and Lynch came up with the notion of the girl next door leading a &quot;desperate double life&quot; that would end in murder. The idea was inspired, in part, by the unsolved 1908 murder of Hazel Irene Drew in Sand Lake, New York.

Lynch and Frost pitched the idea to ABC during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike in a ten-minute meeting with the network&#x27;s drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera. ABC liked the idea and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. They had been talking about the project for three months and wrote the screenplay in 10 days. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like Benjamin Horne, while Lynch was responsible for Agent Cooper. According to the director, &quot;He says a lot of the things I say.&quot;

ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard ordered the two-hour pilot for a possible fall 1989 series. He left the position in March 1989 as Lynch went into production. They filmed the pilot for $4 million with an agreement with ABC that they would shoot an additional &quot;ending&quot; to it so that it could be sold directly to video in Europe as a feature film if the TV show was not picked up. ABC&#x27;s Bob Iger and his creative team took over, saw the dailies, and met with Frost and Lynch to get the arc of the stories and characters. Although Iger liked the pilot, he had difficulty persuading the rest of the network executives. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece. Some executives figured that the show would never get on the air or that it might run as a seven-hour mini-series, but Iger planned to schedule it for the spring. The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was on the air.

Each episode took a week to shoot, and after directing the second episode, Lynch went off to complete &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, while Frost wrote the remaining segments. Standards and Practices had an issue with a scene from the first season: an extreme close-up in the pilot of Cooper&#x27;s hand as he slid tweezers under Laura&#x27;s fingernail and removed a tiny &quot;R&quot;. They wanted the scene to be shorter because it made them uncomfortable, but Frost and Lynch refused, and the scene remained.

===Casting===

&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; features members of a loose ensemble of Lynch&#x27;s favorite character actors, including Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan, Grace Zabriskie, and Everett McGill. Isabella Rossellini, who had worked with Lynch on &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, was originally cast as Giovanna Packard, but she dropped out of the production before shooting began on the pilot episode. The character was then reconceived as Josie Packard, of Chinese ethnicity, and the role given to actress Joan Chen. The cast includes several actors who had risen to fame in the 1950s and 1960s, including 1950s film stars Richard Beymer, Piper Laurie, and Russ Tamblyn. Other veteran actors included British actor James Booth (&quot;Zulu&quot;), former &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; star Peggy Lipton, and Michael Ontkean, who co-starred in the 1970s crime drama &quot;The Rookies&quot;. Kyle MacLachlan was cast as Agent Dale Cooper. Stage actor Warren Frost was cast as Dr. Will Hayward.

Due to budget constraints, Lynch intended to cast a local girl from Seattle as Laura Palmer, reportedly &quot;just to play a dead girl&quot;. The local girl ended up being Sheryl Lee. Lynch stated: &quot;But no one—not Mark, me, anyone—had any idea that she could act, or that she was going to be so powerful just being dead.&quot; And then, while Lynch shot the home movie that James takes of Donna and Laura, he realized that Lee had something special. &quot;She did do another scene—the video with Donna on the picnic—and it was that scene that did it.&quot; As a result, Sheryl Lee became a semi-regular addition to the cast, appearing in flashbacks as Laura, and portraying another, recurring character: Maddy Ferguson, Laura&#x27;s similar-looking cousin.

The character of Phillip Gerard&#x27;s appearance in the pilot episode was originally intended to be only a &quot;kind of homage to &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. The only thing he was gonna do was be in this elevator and walk out&quot;, according to David Lynch. However, when Lynch wrote the &quot;Fire walk with me&quot; speech, he imagined Al Strobel, who played Gerard, reciting it in the basement of the Twin Peaks hospital—a scene that appeared in the European version of the pilot episode, and surfaced later in Agent Cooper&#x27;s dream sequence. Gerard&#x27;s full name, Phillip Michael Gerard, is also a reference to Lieutenant Phillip Gerard, a character in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

Lynch met Michael J. Anderson in 1987. After seeing him in a short film, Lynch wanted to cast the actor in the title role in &quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot;, but that project failed to get made.

Richard Beymer was cast as Ben Horne because he had known Johanna Ray, Lynch&#x27;s casting director. Lynch was familiar with Beymer&#x27;s work in the 1961 film &quot;West Side Story&quot; and was surprised that Beymer was available for the role.

Set dresser Frank Silva was cast as the mysterious &quot;Bob&quot;. Lynch himself recalls that the idea originated when he overheard Silva moving furniture around in the bedroom set, and then heard a woman warning Silva not to block himself in by moving furniture in front of the door. Lynch was struck with an image of Silva in the room. When he learned that Silva was an actor, he filmed two panning shots, one with Silva at the base of the bed, and one without; he did not yet know how he would use this material. Later that day, during the filming of Sarah Palmer having a vision, the camera operator told Lynch that the shot was ruined because &quot;Frank [Silva] was reflected in the mirror.&quot; Lynch comments: &quot;Things like this happen and make you start dreaming. And one thing leads to another, and if you let it, a whole other thing opens up.&quot; Lynch used the panning shot of Silva in the bedroom, and the shot featuring Silva&#x27;s reflection, in the closing scenes of the European version of the pilot episode. Silva&#x27;s reflection in the mirror can also be glimpsed during the scene of Sarah&#x27;s vision at the end of the original pilot, but it is less clear. A close-up of Silva in the bedroom later became a significant image in episodes of the TV series.

===Music===
The score for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; has received acclaim; &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that it &quot;still marks the summit of TV soundtracks&quot;. In fall 1989, composer Angelo Badalamenti and Lynch created the score for the show. In 20 minutes they produced the signature theme for the series. Badalamenti called it the &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;&quot;. Lynch told him: &quot;You just wrote 75% of the score. It&#x27;s the mood of the whole piece. It is &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.&quot; While creating the score, Lynch often described the moods or emotions he wanted the music to evoke, and Badalamenti began to play the piano. In the scenes dominated by young men, they are accompanied by music that Badalamenti called Cool Jazz. The characters&#x27; masculinity was enhanced by finger-snapping, &quot;cocktail-lounge electric piano, pulsing bass, and lightly brushed percussion.&quot; A handful of the motifs were borrowed from Julee Cruise&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;, which was written in large part by Badalamenti and Lynch and was released in 1989. This album also serves as the soundtrack to another Lynch project, &quot;Industrial Symphony No. 1&quot;, a live Cruise performance also featuring Michael J. Anderson.

An instrumental version of the song &quot;Falling&quot; became the theme to the show, and the songs &quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot;, &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, &quot;The World Spins&quot;, and &quot;Into the Night&quot; (found in their full versions on the album) were all, except the last, used as Cruise&#x27;s roadhouse performances during the show&#x27;s run. The lyrics for all five songs were written by Lynch. A second volume of the soundtrack was released on October 30, 2007, to coincide with the Definitive Gold Box DVD set.

In March 2011, Lynch began releasing &quot;The Twin Peaks Archive&quot; – a collection of previously unavailable tracks from the series and the film via his website. As of February 8, 2024, the site is no longer active and it appears there is no way to legally obtain the bundle of all files previously offered for sale.

===Filming locations===

Agent Cooper states, in the pilot episode, that Twin Peaks is &quot;five miles south of the Canadian border, and twelve miles west of the state line.&quot; This places it in the Salmo-Priest Wilderness. Lynch and Frost started their location search in Snoqualmie, Washington, on the recommendation of a friend of Frost. They found all of the locations that they had written into the pilot episode. The towns of Snoqualmie, North Bend and Fall City – which became the primary filming locations for stock &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; exterior footage – are about an hour&#x27;s drive from the town of Roslyn, Washington, the town used for the series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. Many exterior scenes were filmed in wooded areas of Malibu, California. Most of the interior scenes were shot on standing sets in a San Fernando Valley warehouse.

The soap opera show-within-the-show &quot;Invitation to Love&quot; was not shot on a studio set, but in the Ennis House, an architectural landmark designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles.

===Filming===
Mark Frost and David Lynch made use of repeating and sometimes mysterious motifs such as trees (especially fir and pines), coffee and doughnuts, cherry pie, owls, logs, ducks, water, fire — and numerous embedded references to other films and TV shows.

During the filming of the scene in which Cooper first examines Laura&#x27;s body, a malfunctioning fluorescent lamp above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created.

Cooper&#x27;s dream at the end of the third episode, which became a driving plot point in the series&#x27;s first season and ultimately held the key to the identity of Laura&#x27;s murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: &quot;I was leaning against a car—the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. &#x27;Little Mike&#x27; was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about the Red Room.&quot; The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the fourth episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer&#x27;s spirit.

==Response==
Before the one-and-a-half-hour pilot premiered on TV, a screening was held at the Museum of Broadcasting in Hollywood. Media analyst and advertising executive Paul Schulman said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it has a chance of succeeding. It is not commercial, it is radically different from what we as viewers are accustomed to seeing, there&#x27;s no one in the show to root for.&quot; The show&#x27;s Thursday night time slot had not been a good one for soap operas, as both &quot;Dynasty&quot; and its short-lived spin-off &quot;The Colbys&quot; did poorly. &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was also up against the hugely successful sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;.

Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. Tom Shales, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It&#x27;s a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John J. O&#x27;Connor wrote: &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; is not a send-up of the form. Mr. Lynch clearly savors the standard ingredients ... but then the director adds his own peculiar touches, small passing details that suddenly, and often hilariously, thrust the commonplace out of kilter.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the show an &quot;A+&quot; rating, and Ken Tucker wrote: &quot;Plot is irrelevant; moments are everything. Lynch and Frost have mastered a way to make a weekly series endlessly interesting.&quot; Richard Zoglin in &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that it &quot;may be the most hauntingly original work ever done for American TV&quot;.

The two-hour pilot was the highest-rated movie for the 1989–90 season with a 22 rating and was viewed by 33% of the audience. In its first broadcast as a regular one-hour drama series, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; scored ABC&#x27;s highest ratings in four years in its 9:00 pm Thursday time slot. The show also reduced NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cheers&quot;″s ratings. &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; had a 16.2 rating, with each point equaling 921,000 homes with TVs. The episode also added new viewers because of what ABC&#x27;s senior vice-president of research, Alan Wurtzel, called &quot;the water cooler syndrome&quot;, in which people talk about the series the next day at work.

But the show&#x27;s third episode lost 14% of the audience that had tuned in a week before. That audience had dropped 30% from the show&#x27;s first appearance on Thursday night. This was a result of competing against &quot;Cheers&quot;, which appealed to the same demographic that watched &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. A production executive from the show spoke of being frustrated with the network&#x27;s scheduling of the show. &quot;The show is being banged around on Thursday night. If ABC had put it on Wednesday night it could have built on its initial success. ABC has put the show at risk.&quot;

In response, the network aired the first-season finale on a Wednesday night at 10:00 pm instead of its usual 9:00 pm Thursday slot. The show achieved its best ratings since its third week on the air with a 12.6 and a 22 share of the audience. On May 22, 1990, it was announced that &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; would be renewed for a second season.

During the first and second season, the search for Laura Palmer&#x27;s killer served as the engine for the plot and captured the public&#x27;s imagination, although the creators admitted that this was largely a MacGuffin; each episode was really about the interactions between the townsfolk. The unique (and often bizarre) personalities of each citizen formed a web of minutiae that ran contrary to the town&#x27;s quaint appearance. Adding to the surreal atmosphere was the recurrence of Dale Cooper&#x27;s dreams, in which the FBI agent is given clues to Laura&#x27;s murder in a supernatural realm that may or may not be of his imagination. The first season contained only eight episodes (including the two-hour pilot episode). It was considered technically and artistically revolutionary for television at the time and geared toward reaching the standards of film.

Critics have noted that &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; began the trend of accomplished cinematography now commonplace in today&#x27;s television dramas. Lynch and Frost maintained tight control over the first season and served as showrunners, handpicking all of the directors, including some whom Lynch had known from his days at the American Film Institute (e.g., Caleb Deschanel and Tim Hunter) and some referred to him by those he knew personally. Lynch and Frost&#x27;s control lessened in the second season as the two became less involved with the series, corresponding with what is generally regarded as a decrease in the show&#x27;s quality once the identity of Laura Palmer&#x27;s murderer was revealed. While Frost and Lynch technically remained showrunners after &quot;Episode 14&quot;, the episode in which the killer&#x27;s identity was revealed, Lynch had little creative control over the direction of the series from that point forward other than the season finale; Frost became less involved after &quot;Episode 16&quot; and became more involved again with &quot;Episode 26&quot; onwards. After &quot;Episode 14&quot;, series producers Harley Peyton and Robert Engels served as additional showrunners along with Frost and Lynch.

The aforementioned &quot;water cooler effect&quot; put pressure on the show&#x27;s creators to solve the mystery. Although they claimed to have known from the series&#x27; inception the identity of Laura&#x27;s murderer, Lynch never wanted to solve the murder, while Frost felt that they had an obligation to the audience to solve it. This created tension between the two men.

Its ambitious style, paranormal undertones, and engaging murder mystery made &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; an unexpected hit. Its characters, particularly MacLachlan&#x27;s Dale Cooper, were unorthodox for a supposed crime drama, as was Cooper&#x27;s method of interpreting his dreams to solve the crime. During its first season, the show&#x27;s popularity reached its zenith, and elements of the program seeped into mainstream popular culture, prompting parodies, including one in the 16th-season premiere of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by MacLachlan.

===Critical acclaim===


For its first season, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; received fourteen nominations at the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Kyle MacLachlan), Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (Piper Laurie), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Sherilyn Fenn), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (David Lynch), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (David Lynch and Mark Frost), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Harley Peyton),

On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season received a 91 percent approval rating with an average score of 8.95 out of 10 based on 118 reviews, with a critics consensus of: &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; plays with TV conventions to deliver a beguiling – and unsettling – blend of seemingly disparate genres, adding up to an offbeat drama with a distinctly unique appeal.&quot; Metacritic scored the season 96 out of 100 based on 17 reviews.

For its second season, it received four nominations at the 43rd Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Kyle MacLachlan), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Piper Laurie), Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season received a 65 percent approval rating with an average score of 7.65 out of 10 based on 175 reviews, with a critics consensus of: &quot;&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; answers its central question with diminishing returns while struggling to establish worthy new mysteries, but there are enough mesmeric flourishes to keep devotees dreaming of what lies in the Red Room.&quot;

At the 48th Golden Globe Awards, it won for Best Television Series – Drama, Kyle MacLachlan won for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series – Drama, Piper Laurie won for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV; while Sherilyn Fenn was nominated in the same category as Laurie.

The pilot episode was ranked 25th on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 1997 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. It placed 49th on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list. In 2004 and 2007, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was ranked 20th and 24th on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever, and in 2002, it was ranked 45th of the &quot;Top 50 Television Programs of All Time&quot; by the same guide. In 2007, UK broadcaster Channel 4 ranked &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; 9th on their list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Dramas&quot;. Also that year, &quot;Time&quot; included the show on their list of the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; listed &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as the 24th best TV show in their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot;.

In 2012, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at no. 12 in the &quot;25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years&quot;, saying: &quot;The show itself was only fitfully brilliant and ultimately unfulfilling, but the cult lives, fueled by nostalgia for the extraordinary pop phenomenon it inspired, for its significance to the medium (behold the big bang of auteur TV!), and for a sensuous strangeness that possesses you and never lets you go.&quot; The series has been nominated for the TCA Heritage Award six consecutive years since 2010, winning the award in 2024. It was ranked 20th on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s list of Hollywood&#x27;s 100 Favorite TV Shows.

===Declining ratings===
With the resolution of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;″ main drawing point (Laura Palmer&#x27;s murder) in the middle of the second season, and with subsequent story lines becoming more obscure and drawn out, public interest began to wane. This discontent, coupled with ABC changing its timeslot on a number of occasions, led to a huge drop in the show&#x27;s ratings after being one of the most watched television programs in the United States in 1990. Due to the Gulf War, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was moved from its usual time slot &quot;for six weeks out of eight&quot; in early 1991, according to Frost, preventing the show from maintaining audience interest. A week after the season&#x27;s 15th episode placed 85th in the ratings out of 89 shows, ABC put &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; on indefinite hiatus, a move that usually leads to cancellation.

An organized letter-writing campaign, dubbed COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of &quot;Peaks&quot;), attempted to save the show from cancellation. The campaign was partly successful, as the season returned to airing on Thursday nights for four weeks from late March. The series then went on another hiatus, before the final two episodes of the season aired back-to-back on June 10.

According to Frost, the main storyline after the resolution of Laura Palmer&#x27;s murder was planned to be the second strongest element from the first season that audiences responded to: the relationship between Agent Cooper and Audrey Horne. Frost explained that Lara Flynn Boyle, who was romantically involved with Kyle MacLachlan at the time, had effectively vetoed the Audrey–Cooper relationship, forcing the writers to come up with alternative storylines to fill the gap. Sherilyn Fenn corroborated this claim in a 2014 interview, stating: &quot;[Boyle] was mad that my character was getting more attention, so then Kyle started saying that his character shouldn&#x27;t be with my character because it doesn&#x27;t look good, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m too young... I was not happy about it. It was stupid.&quot; This meant the artificial extension of secondary storylines, such as James Hurley and Evelyn Marsh, to fill in the space. After ratings began to decline, Agent Cooper was given a new love interest, Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), to replace the writers&#x27; intended romance between him and Audrey Horne. Despite ending on a deliberate audience-baiting cliffhanger, the series finale did not sufficiently boost interest, and the show was not renewed for a third season, leaving the cliffhanger unresolved.

Lynch expressed his regret at having resolved the Laura Palmer murder, saying that he and Frost had never intended for the series to answer the question until the very end of the series, after many seasons, and that doing so &quot;killed the goose that laid the golden egg.&quot; Lynch blamed network pressure for the decision to resolve the Palmer storyline prematurely. Frost agreed, noting that people at the network had wanted the killer to be revealed by the end of season one. Their statements were further corroborated by former ABC executive Bob Iger in his 2019 memoir, &quot;The Ride of a Lifetime&quot;, where he wrote that after ABC pushed for the killer to be revealed prematurely, there was an immediate decrease in the show&#x27;s quality.

Looking back, Frost has admitted that he wished he and Lynch had &quot;worked out a smoother transition&quot; between storylines and that the Laura Palmer story was a &quot;tough act to follow&quot;. Regarding the second season, Frost felt that &quot;perhaps the storytelling wasn&#x27;t quite as taut or as fraught with emotion.&quot;

===Prequel film===

The 1992 film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; serves as a prequel to the television series. It tells of the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. David Lynch and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Donna Hayward and was replaced by Moira Kelly, and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Kyle MacLachlan returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting at the time. As a result, his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes. The cut footage, which included scenes with characters from the show&#x27;s original run who were not in the film, was arranged into a 2014 compilation film, &quot;Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces&quot;.

&quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; polarized critics upon its release, especially in comparison to the widespread acclaim of the series. However, the film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. It grossed a total of US$1.8 million in 691 theaters in its opening weekend and went on to gross a total of $4.2 million in North America. The film has developed a cult following over time and been positively reevaluated in the 21st century, and it is now widely regarded as one of Lynch&#x27;s major works and one of the greatest films of the 1990s.

The release of the third season in 2017, which made many references to the film, led to additional renewed critical and scholarly interest.

==Influence==

While the series is not usually described as science fiction, it has been noted to have been influential on that genre.

In 2018, the mayors of Snoqualmie and North Bend, which were both used for filming the series, declared Twin Peaks Day to be held on February 24. That was in recognition of the date mentioned in the first episode of the series.

=== Television industry ===
Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2016, Mike Mariani wrote that &quot;It would be tough to look at the roster of television shows any given season without finding several that owe a creative debt to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;,&quot; stating that &quot;Lynch&#x27;s manipulation of the uncanny, his surreal non-sequiturs, his black humor, and his trademark ominous tracking shots can be felt in a variety of contemporary hit shows.&quot; 

&quot;The X-Files&quot; notably takes major inspiration from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, especially in execution of atmosphere and attempts to blend comedic moments and horror. David Duchovny appeared as Denise Bryson in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; prior to his role as Fox Mulder on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. In an interview celebrating the third season, David Chase, the creator of &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; stated that &quot;Anybody making one-hour drama[s] today who says he wasn&#x27;t influenced by David Lynch is lying.&quot; In 2010, the television series &quot;Psych&quot; paid tribute to the series by reuniting some of the cast in the fifth-season episode &quot;Dual Spires&quot;. Carlton Cuse, the co-creator of &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, cited &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as a key inspiration for his series, stating, &quot;We pretty much ripped off &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;&quot; Cuse and Damon Lindelof, who both co-produced &quot;Lost&quot;, cited both &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and David Lynch as a major influence on their work. Lindelof stated &quot;There is no show in television history that had more impact on me than &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;&quot; Noah Hawley, creator of &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot;, cited &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as a major inspiration on his work, particularly &quot;Fargo&quot;. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the creator of &quot;Riverdale&quot;, remarked that &quot;all roads on &quot;Riverdale&quot; lead back to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; given its thematic similarities. 

The TV series &quot;Atlanta&quot; has been cited by its creator, Donald Glover, as being inspired by the show, labeling it as &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; with rappers.&quot; Additionally, the animated series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; repeatedly referenced the Black Lodge along with other elements of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; throughout its run. Critics have also noted similarities and borrowed elements from Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in Veena Sud&#x27;s American adaptation of &quot;The Killing&quot;.

=== Music ===
The show&#x27;s score, helmed by Angelo Badalamenti, Julee Cruise, and David Lynch, was a notable influence for many genres of music, specifically dream pop. Cruise&#x27;s compositions inspired the likes of Lana Del Rey and the score of the show was a direct inspiration for dream pop duo Beach House, who have a history of paying homage to the show. The show&#x27;s legacy of honoring dream pop and indie rock compositions is observed in the third season, with its inclusion of performances from contemporaries such as Sharon Van Etten, Nine Inch Nails, and the Veils.

Bands like Bastille have penned songs in honor of the show like &quot;Laura Palmer&quot;, which was influenced by the &quot;slightly weird, eerie&quot; atmosphere of the show. Xiu Xiu completed and released a 2017 tribute album titled &quot;Plays the Music of Twin Peaks&quot;, where they performed several tracks from the show&#x27;s main soundtrack and leaned into a more experimental sound.

=== Video games ===
The show has also influenced a number of survival horror and psychological thriller video games, most notably games produced by Sam Lake at Remedy Entertainment, such as the &quot;Remedy Connected Universe&quot; of games, which includes the &quot;Alan Wake&quot; series, and the game &quot;Control.&quot; For &quot;Alan Wake II&quot;, the developers took heavy inspiration specifically from the third season of &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot; The Remedy-produced &quot;Max Payne&quot; series also takes inspiration. Other games of the genre that take heavy inspiration include &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot;, and the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series. 

&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; also served as an inspiration for the 1993 video game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, with director Takashi Tezuka citing the series as the main factor for the creation of the &quot;suspicious&quot; characters that populate the game, as well as the mystery elements of the story. The 1998 open world adventure video game &quot;Mizzurna Falls&quot; was highly reminiscent and an homage to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. 

The Velvet Room featured in the &quot;Persona&quot; video game series is inspired by the Black Lodge, and is also a reference to a previous Lynch film, &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot; Other games and video game series influenced by &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; include the &quot;Life Is Strange&quot; series, and the indie games &quot;Disco Elysium&quot;, &quot;Virginia&quot;, &quot;Kentucky Route Zero&quot;, &quot;Thimbleweed Park&quot;, and &quot;Puzzle Agent&quot;.

== Representation ==

Denise Bryson (David Duchovny) is a transgender FBI agent who is introduced in season two. When she is reintroduced to audiences in the third season, she has a conversation where Gordon Cole (David Lynch) informs Bryson that he told her transphobic colleagues to &quot;fix their hearts or die.&quot; Over the years, this quote has been adopted by the LGBTQ+ community, particularly those in the trans community, with Bryson becoming a cult icon for transgender women.

Through the run of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, there is a limited cast of characters of color. Frank Guan of &quot;Vulture&quot; stated that &quot;Lynch&#x27;s focus on archetypes and myths necessarily ties him to stereotype,&quot; specifically referring to the treatment of Black and Asian characters within Lynch&#x27;s collected work. Yellowface is also present in season two with Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) masquerading as a Japanese businessman named Mr. Tojamura for several episodes. The secret of Laurie&#x27;s true &quot;identity&quot; of being Mr. Tojamura was a closely kept secret between her and Lynch on set. Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) is a Native American deputy who functioned to be a &quot;generic Native American tasked with ameliorating settler guilt&quot; through cryptic dialogue.

==Merchandise==

===Home media===
The series was released on VHS in a six-tape collection on April 16, 1995; however, it did not include the original pilot episode. The series was also released on LaserDisc in a sixteen-disc set in 1991 in Japan. The same set was later released in the United States across four different volumes from 1993 to 1994; neither release contained the original pilot nor &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot;.

On December 18, 2001, the first season (episodes 1–7, minus the pilot) of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was released on DVD in Region 1 by Artisan Entertainment. The box set featured digitally remastered video and was noted for being the first TV series to have its audio track redone in DTS.

The second-season release was postponed several times, and the release was originally canceled in 2003 by Artisan due to low sales figures for the season 1 DVD. The second season was finally released in the United States and Canada on April 3, 2007, via Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment/CBS DVD.

On October 30, 2007, the broadcast version of the pilot finally received a legitimate U.S. release as part of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; &quot;Definitive Gold Box Edition&quot;. This set includes both U.S. original network broadcast and international versions of the pilot. The set also includes all episodes from both seasons, deleted scenes for both seasons, and a feature-length retrospective documentary. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the box set a &quot;B+&quot; rating and wrote: &quot;There are numerous fascinatingly frank mini-docs here, including interviews with many &quot;Peaks&quot; participants; together, they offer one of the best available portraits of how a TV hit can go off the rails.&quot;

It was announced in May 2014 that the Blu-ray box set containing the complete series of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, the film &quot;Fire Walk With Me&quot;, and &quot;The Missing Pieces&quot; (90 minutes of deleted scenes from the film), would be released on July 29, 2014. &quot;Twin Peaks: From Z to A&quot;, a 21-disc limited edition Blu-ray box set, which includes all the television episodes, &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot;, &quot;The Missing Pieces&quot;, previously released special features, six hours of new behind-the-scenes content, and 4K versions of the original pilot and &quot;Part 8&quot; of season 3, was released on December 10, 2019. Additionally, &quot;Twin Peaks: The Television Collection&quot;, a Blu-ray and DVD collection of every season, and all previously released special features, was released on October 15, 2019.

===Books, audio and virtual reality===
During the show&#x27;s second season, Pocket Books released three official tie-in books, each authored by the show&#x27;s creators (or their family), which offer a wealth of backstory. &quot;The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer&quot;, written by Lynch&#x27;s daughter Jennifer Lynch, is the diary as seen in the series and written by Laura, chronicling her thoughts from her twelfth birthday to the days leading up to her death. Frost&#x27;s brother Scott wrote &quot;The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes&quot;. Kyle MacLachlan also recorded &quot;Diane: The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper&quot;, which combined audio tracks from various episodes of the series with newly recorded monologues.

&quot;Twin Peaks: Visual Soundtrack&quot; is a LaserDisc that plays like an elaborate music video. The show&#x27;s entire soundtrack album is played over silent video footage shot by a Japanese TV crew visiting the Snoqualmie, Washington, locations where the series was shot.

Published in 2016, &quot;The Secret History of Twin Peaks&quot;, a novel by series co-creator Mark Frost, &quot;places the unexplained phenomena that unfolded in Twin Peaks in a layered, wide-ranging history, beginning with the journals of Lewis and Clark and ending with the shocking events that closed the finale&quot;. It was published on October 18, 2016. &quot;Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier&quot; was released October 31, 2017. A follow-up to &quot;The Secret History of Twin Peaks&quot;, it was also written by Frost. The novel fills in details of the 25 years between the second and third seasons, and expands on some of the mysteries raised in the new episodes.

&quot;Twin Peaks VR&quot;, a virtual reality game developed by Collider Games and Showtime in collaboration with David Lynch, was released on December 13, 2019. Players can explore familiar locations while solving puzzles to help Special Agent Cooper and Gordon Cole. The game is available on Oculus Rift, Vive and Valve Index.

==Future==
Since the third season ended in 2017, Lynch and Frost had expressed interest in making another season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Lynch had been asked in several interviews if he would continue, once saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I have a box of ideas, and I&#x27;m working with producer Sabrina S. Sutherland, kind of trying to go through and see if there&#x27;s any gold in those boxes.&quot;

Lynch also said one more story was &quot;calling to him&quot; involving the character of Carrie Page. In a Reddit AMA on June 22, 2020, star Kyle MacLachlan said Cooper was his &quot;favorite role of all time&quot; and that he would &quot;absolutely&quot; return to another season &quot;without even seeing the script.&quot; Lynch died in January 2025, making the production of any future episodes or any sort of revival of the series unlikely.

<doc id="30309" wikidata="Q932" url="?curid=30309" title="Thallium">
<text>Thalliumis a chemical element; it has symbol Tl and atomic number 81. It is a silvery-white post-transition metal that is not found free in nature. When isolated, thallium resembles tin, but discolors when exposed to air. Chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently, in 1861, in residues of sulfuric acid production. Both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy, in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line. Thallium, from Greek , , meaning &quot;green shoot&quot; or &quot;twig&quot;, was named by Crookes. It was isolated by both Lamy and Crookes in 1862, Lamy by electrolysis and Crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder. Crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at the International Exhibition, which opened on 1 May that year.

Thallium tends to form the +3 and +1 oxidation states. The +3 state resembles that of the other elements in group 13 (boron, aluminium, gallium, indium). However, the +1 state, which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it, recalls the chemistry of alkali metals and thallium(I) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores and (when ingested) are handled in many ways like potassium ions (K+) by ion pumps in living cells.

Commercially, thallium is produced not from potassium ores, but as a byproduct from refining of heavy-metal sulfide ores. Approximately 65% of thallium production is used in the electronics industry and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.

Soluble thallium salts (many of which are nearly tasteless) are highly toxic and they were historically used in rat poisons and insecticides. Because of their nonselective toxicity, use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries. Thallium poisoning usually results in hair loss. Because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon, thallium has gained notoriety as &quot;the poisoner&#x27;s poison&quot; and &quot;inheritance powder&quot; (alongside arsenic).

==Characteristics==
A thallium atom has 81 electrons, arranged in the electron configuration [Xe]4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons in the sixth shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it is more difficult to get these involved in chemical bonding than it is for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead. Thallium, then, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point, of 304 °C.

A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reaction under study, are reported for thallium, reflecting the greatly decreased stability of the +3 oxidation state:
Thallium is the first element in group 13 where the reduction of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, with thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.

Thallium is malleable and sectile enough to be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by immersion in oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acids dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.

===Isotopes===

Thallium has 41 isotopes which have atomic masses that range from 176 to 216. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. The five short-lived isotopes 206Tl through 210Tl inclusive occur in nature, as they are part of the natural decay chains of heavier elements. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80 keV), and photons of 135 and 167 keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without an excessive patient-radiation dose. It is the most popular isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.

==Compounds==
===Thallium(III)===
Thallium(III) compounds resemble the corresponding aluminium(III) compounds. They are moderately strong oxidizing agents and are usually unstable, as illustrated by the positive reduction potential for the Tl3+/Tl couple. Some mixed-valence compounds are also known, such as Tl4O3 and TlCl2, which contain both thallium(I) and thallium(III). Thallium(III) oxide, Tl2O3, is a black solid which decomposes above 800 °C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.

The simplest possible thallium compound, thallane (TlH3), is too unstable to exist in bulk, both due to the instability of the +3 oxidation state as well as poor overlap of the valence 6s and 6p orbitals of thallium with the 1s orbital of hydrogen. The trihalides are more stable, although they are chemically distinct from those of the lighter group 13 elements and are still the least stable in the whole group. For instance, thallium(III) fluoride, TlF3, has the β-BiF3 structure rather than that of the lighter group 13 trifluorides, and does not form the complex anion in aqueous solution. The trichloride and tribromide disproportionate just above room temperature to give the monohalides, and thallium triiodide contains the linear triiodide anion () and is actually a thallium(I) compound. Thallium(III) sesquichalcogenides do not exist.

===Thallium(I)===
The thallium(I) halides are stable. In keeping with the large size of the Tl+ cation, the chloride and bromide have the caesium chloride structure, while the fluoride and iodide have distorted sodium chloride structures. Like the analogous silver compounds, TlCl, TlBr, and TlI are photosensitive and display poor solubility in water. The stability of thallium(I) compounds demonstrates its differences from the rest of the group: a stable oxide, hydroxide, and carbonate are known, as are many chalcogenides.

The double salt has been shown to have hydroxyl-centred triangles of thallium, , as a recurring motif throughout its solid structure.

The metalorganic compound thallium ethoxide (TlOEt, TlOC2H5) is a heavy liquid (ρ , m.p. −3 °C), often used as a basic and soluble thallium source in organic and organometallic chemistry.

===Organothallium compounds===
Organothallium compounds tend to be thermally unstable, in concordance with the trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13. The chemical reactivity of the Tl–C bond is also the lowest in the group, especially for ionic compounds of the type R2TlX. Thallium forms the stable [Tl(CH3)2]+ ion in aqueous solution; like the isoelectronic Hg(CH3)2 and [Pb(CH3)2]2+, it is linear. Trimethylthallium and triethylthallium are, like the corresponding gallium and indium compounds, flammable liquids with low melting points. Like indium, thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium(I), in contrast to gallium(III).

==History==
Thallium (Greek , , meaning &quot;a green shoot or twig&quot;) was discovered by William Crookes and Claude Auguste Lamy, working independently, both using flame spectroscopy (Crookes was first to publish his findings, on March 30, 1861). The name comes from thallium&#x27;s bright green spectral emission lines derived from the Greek &#x27;thallos&#x27;, meaning a green twig.

After the publication of the improved method of flame spectroscopy by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff and the discovery of caesium and rubidium in the years 1859 to 1860, flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine the composition of minerals and chemical products. Crookes and Lamy both started to use the new method. Crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in the lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near Tilkerode in the Harz mountains. He had obtained the samples for his research on selenium cyanide from August Hofmann years earlier. By 1862, Crookes was able to isolate small quantities of the new element and determine the properties of a few compounds. Claude-Auguste Lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to Crookes&#x27; to determine the composition of a selenium-containing substance which was deposited during the production of sulfuric acid from pyrite. He also noticed the new green line in the spectra and concluded that a new element was present. Lamy had received this material from the sulfuric acid plant of his friend Frédéric Kuhlmann and this by-product was available in large quantities. Lamy started to isolate the new element from that source. The fact that Lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine the properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts.

As both scientists discovered thallium independently and a large part of the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his own priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: &quot;For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium&quot; and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: &quot;thallium, for the discovery of the new element.&quot; The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.
The dominant use of thallium was the use as poison for rodents. After several accidents the use as poison was banned in the United States by Presidential Executive Order 11643 in February 1972. In subsequent years several other countries also banned its use.

==Occurrence and production==
Thallium concentration in the Earth&#x27;s crust is estimated to be 0.7 mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.
Thallium is found in the minerals crookesite TlCu7Se4, hutchinsonite TlPbAs5S9, and lorándite TlAsS2. Thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite, and thallium is extracted as a by-product of roasting this mineral for the production of sulfuric acid.

Thallium can also be obtained from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and silver. These minerals are rare, and have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern North Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500 tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that the annual worldwide production of thallium is 10 metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected at the end of the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of an alkali or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15 metric tonnes to about 10 tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.

==Applications==

===Historic uses===
The odorless and tasteless thallium sulfate was once widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example. Thallium salts were used in the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index, and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.

===Optics===
Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide crystals have been used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 Celsius°. These glasses have room-temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.

===Electronics===

Thallium(I) sulfide&#x27;s electrical conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light, making this compound useful in photoresistors. Thallium selenide has been used in bolometers for infrared detection. Doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance, thus it is used in trace amounts in selenium rectifiers. Another application of thallium doping is the sodium iodide and cesium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices. In these, the sodium iodide crystals are doped with a small amount of thallium to improve their efficiency as scintillation generators. Some of the electrodes in dissolved oxygen analyzers contain thallium.

===High-temperature superconductivity===
Research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop high-temperature superconducting materials for such applications as magnetic resonance imaging, storage of magnetic energy, magnetic propulsion, and electric power generation and transmission. The research in applications started after the discovery of the first thallium barium calcium copper oxide superconductor in 1988. Thallium cuprate superconductors have been discovered that have transition temperatures above 120 K. Some mercury-doped thallium-cuprate superconductors have transition temperatures above 130 K at ambient pressure, nearly as high as the world-record-holding mercury cuprates.

===Nuclear medicine===
Before the widespread application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, was the main substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator, which is similar to the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours), which decays by electron capture to thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.

====Thallium stress test====
A thallium stress test is a form of scintigraphy in which the amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply. Viable cardiac cells have normal Na+/K+ ion-exchange pumps. The Tl+ cation binds the K+ pumps and is transported into the cells. Exercise or dipyridamole induces widening (vasodilation) of arteries in the body. This produces coronary steal by areas where arteries are maximally dilated. Areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain &quot;cold&quot;. Pre- and post-stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial revascularization. Redistribution indicates the existence of coronary steal and the presence of ischemic coronary artery disease.

===Other uses===
A mercury–thallium alloy, which forms a eutectic at 8.5% thallium, is reported to freeze at −60 °C, some 20 °C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths to increase the speed of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.

A saturated solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(HCO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water is known as Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colorless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25 g/cm3 at 20 °C, Clerici solution is one of the heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.
Thallium iodide is frequently used as an additive in metal-halide lamps, often together with one or two halides of other metals. It allows optimization of the lamp temperature and color rendering, and shifts the spectral output to the green region, which is useful for underwater lighting.

==Toxicity==
Thallium and its compounds are extremely toxic, with numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium poisoning. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for thallium exposure in the workplace as 0.1 mg/m2 skin exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 mg/m2 skin exposure over an eight-hour workday. At levels of 15 mg/m2, thallium is immediately dangerous to life and health.

Contact with skin is dangerous, and adequate ventilation is necessary when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin, and care should be taken to avoid this route of exposure, as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the permissible exposure limit (PEL). Exposure by inhalation cannot safely exceed 0.1 mg/m2 in an eight-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states, &quot;Thallium is not classifiable as a carcinogen, and it is not suspected to be a carcinogen. It is unknown whether chronic or repeated exposure to thallium increases the risk of reproductive toxicity or developmental toxicity. Chronic high level exposure to thallium through inhalation has been reported to cause nervous system effects, such as numbness of fingers and toes.&quot; For a long time, thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This, and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless, led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.

One of the main methods of removing thallium, both radioactive and stable, from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20 grams per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the patient, and it passes through the patient’s digestive system and comes out in the patient’s stool. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stages of the treatment, additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissues.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), artificially-made sources of thallium pollution include gaseous emission of cement factories, coal-burning power plants, and metal sewers. The main source of elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations.

<text>A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. An example of such program is &quot;notepad&quot; software (e.g. Windows Notepad). Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.

==Plain text and rich text==
There are important differences between plain text (created and edited by text editors) and rich text (such as that created by word processors or desktop publishing software). 

Plain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a fixed-length sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in accordance to specific character encoding conventions, such as ASCII, ISO/IEC 2022, Shift JIS, UTF-8, or UTF-16. These conventions define many printable characters, but also non-printing characters that control the flow of the text, such as space, line break, and page break. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in text files, although text files do not exclusively store plain text. Since the early days of computers, plain text was (once by necessity and now by convention) generally displayed using a monospace font, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using whitespace characters.

Rich text, on the other hand, may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. typeface, size, weight and style), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in binary format (e.g. DOC), text files adhering to a markup language (e.g. RTF or HTML), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. Office Open XML).

Text editors are intended to open and save text files containing either plain text or anything that can be interpreted as plain text, including the markup for rich text or the markup for something else (e.g. SVG).

==History==

Before text editors existed, computer text was punched into cards with keypunch machines. Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card reader. Magnetic tape, drum and disk card image files created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80- or 90-character records. An alternative to cards was Punched tape. It could be created by some teleprinters (such as the Teletype), which used special characters to indicate ends of records. Some early operating systems included batch text editors, either integrated with language processors or as separate utility programs; one early example was the ability to edit SQUOZE source files for SCAT in the SHARE Operating System.

The first interactive text editors were &quot;line editors&quot; oriented to teleprinter- or typewriter-style terminals without displays. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called the &quot;cursor&quot;. Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small section of the file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text strings (context) for which to search, and eventually regular expressions. Line editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors could be used by keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common line editors supported a &quot;verify&quot; mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.

When computer terminals with video screens became available, screen-based text editors (sometimes called just &quot;screen editors&quot;) became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was O26, which was written for the operator console of the CDC 6000 series computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was vi. Written in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor on Unix and Linux operating systems. Also written in the 1970s was the UCSD Pascal Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code and general text. Emacs, one of the first free and open-source software projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ported to many systems. The 1977 Commodore PET was the first mass-market computer to feature a full-screen editor. A full-screen editor&#x27;s ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.

The core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) or list of records that represents the current state of the file being edited.
While the former could be stored in a single long consecutive array of characters,
the desire for text editors that could more quickly insert text, delete text, and undo/redo previous edits led to the development of more complicated sequence data structures.
A typical text editor uses a gap buffer, a linked list of lines (as in PaperClip), a piece table, or a rope, as its sequence data structure.

==Types of text editors==
Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. For example, Unix and Unix-like operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant), but many also include the vi and Emacs editors. Microsoft Windows systems come with the simple Notepad, though many people—especially programmers—prefer other editors with more features. Under Apple Macintosh&#x27;s classic Mac OS there was the native TeachText later replaced by SimpleText in 1994, which was replaced in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the file type. 

Most word processors can read and write files in plain text format, allowing them to open files saved from text editors. Saving these files from a word processor, however, requires ensuring the file is written in plain text format, and that any text encoding or BOM settings will not obscure the file for its intended use. Non-WYSIWYG word processors, such as WordStar, are more easily pressed into service as text editors, and in fact were commonly used as such during the 1980s. The default file format of these word processors often resembles a markup language, with the basic format being plain text and visual formatting achieved using non-printing control characters or escape sequences. Later word processors like Microsoft Word store their files in a binary format and are almost never used to edit plain text files.

Some text editors can edit unusually large files such as log files or an entire database placed in a single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer&#x27;s main memory. With larger files, this may be a slow process, and the entire file may not fit. Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this read-in is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. Specialized editors have optimizations such as only storing the visible portion of large files in memory, improving editing performance.

Some editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses. With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor. One common motive for customizing is to make a text editor use the commands of another text editor with which the user is more familiar, or to duplicate missing functionality the user has come to depend on. Software developers often use editor customizations tailored to the programming language or development environment they are working in. The programmability of some text editors is limited to enhancing the core editing functionality of the program, but Emacs can be extended far beyond editing text files—for web browsing, reading email, online chat, managing files or playing games and is often thought of as a Lisp execution environment with a Text User Interface. Emacs can even be programmed to emulate Vi, its rival in the traditional editor wars of Unix culture.

An important group of programmable editors uses REXX as a scripting language. These &quot;orthodox editors&quot; contain a &quot;command line&quot; into which commands and macros can be typed and text lines into which line commands and macros can be typed. Most such editors are derivatives of ISPF/PDF EDIT or of XEDIT, IBM&#x27;s flagship editor for VM/SP through z/VM. Among them are THE, KEDIT, X2, Uni-edit, and SEDIT.

A text editor written or customized for a specific use can determine what the user is editing and assist the user, often by completing programming terms and showing tooltips with relevant documentation. Many text editors for software developers include source code syntax highlighting and automatic indentation to make programs easier to read and write. Programming editors often let the user select the name of an include file, function or variable, then jump to its definition. Some also allow for easy navigation back to the original section of code by storing the initial cursor location or by displaying the requested definition in a popup window or temporary buffer. Some editors implement this ability themselves, but often an auxiliary utility like ctags is used to locate the definitions.

==Typical features==
* Find and replace – Text editors provide extensive facilities for searching and replacing strings of text, either individually, or groups of files in opened tabs or a selected folder. Advanced editors can use regular expressions to search and edit text or code. Additional features may include optional case sensitivity, a history of search terms for quick recall and autocompletion, and listing multiple results in one place.
* Cut, copy, and paste – most text editors provide methods to duplicate and move text within the file, or between files.
* Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text.
* Text formatting – Text editors often provide basic visual formatting features like line wrap, auto-indentation, bullet list formatting using ASCII characters, comment formatting, syntax highlighting and so on. These are typically only for display and do not insert formatting codes into the file itself.
* Undo and redo – As with word processors, text editors provide a way to undo and redo the last edit, or more. Often—especially with older text editors—there is only one level of edit history remembered and successively issuing the undo command will only &quot;toggle&quot; the last change. Modern or more complex editors usually provide a multiple-level history such that issuing the undo command repeatedly will revert the document to successively older edits. A separate redo command will cycle the edits &quot;forward&quot; toward the most recent changes. The number of changes remembered depends upon the editor and is often configurable by the user.
* Ability to jump to a specified line number.

==Advanced features==
* Macro or procedure definition: to define new commands or features as combinations of prior commands or other macros, perhaps with passed parameters, or with nesting of macros.
* Profiles to retain options set by the user between editing session.
* Profile macros with names specified in, e.g., environment, profile, executed automatically at the beginning of an edit session or when opening a new file.
* Multi-file editing: the ability to edit multiple files during an edit-session, perhaps remembering the current-line cursor of each file, to insert repeated text into each file, copy or move text among files, compare files side-by-side (perhaps with a tiled multiple-document interface), etc.
* Multi-view editors: the ability to display multiple views of the same file, with independent cursor tracking, synchronizing changes among the windows but providing the same facilities as are available for independent files.
* Collapse/expand, also called folding: the ability to temporarily exclude sections of the text from view. This may either be based on a range of line numbers or on some syntactic element, e.g., excluding everything between a BEGIN; and the matching END;.
* Column-based editing; the ability to alter or insert data at a particular column, or to shift data to specific columns.
* Data transformation – Reading or merging the contents of another text file into the file currently being edited. Some text editors provide a way to insert the output of a command issued to the operating system&#x27;s shell. Also, a case-shifting feature could translate to lowercase or uppercase.
* Filtering – Some advanced text editors allow the editor to send all or sections of the file being edited to another utility and read the result back into the file in place of the lines being &quot;filtered&quot;. This, for example, is useful for sorting a series of lines alphabetically or numerically, doing mathematical computations, indenting source code, and so on.
* Syntax highlighting – contextually highlights source code, markup languages, config files and other text that appears in an organized or predictable format. Editors generally allow users to customize the colors or styles used for each language element. Some text editors also allow users to install and use themes to change the look and feel of the editor&#x27;s entire user interface.
* Syntax-oriented editors - some editors have support for the syntax of one or more languages, and allow operations in terms of syntactical unit, e.g., insert a new WHEN clause in a SELECT statement.
* Extensibility - a text editor intended for use by programmers must provide some plugin mechanism, or be scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with features needed to manage individual software projects, customize functionality or key bindings for specific programming languages or version control systems, or conform to specific coding styles.
* Cursor navigation may vary across text editors. For example, pressing End twice may navigate to the end of a wrapped line after one press navigated to the end of an on-screen row of text. Block-oriented terminals typically have dedicated cursor movement keys, as do keyboards on personal computers.
* Command line - some editors, e.g., ISPF, XEDIT, have a dedicated field on the screen for entering commands as opposed to text. Depending on the editor, the user may have to use cursor keys to switch between the command and text fields or the editor may interpret, e.g., specific function keys , as requests to switch.
* Line commands, also known as prefix commands or sequence commands - Some editors treat a file as an array of text lines with associated line numbers or sequence numbers, and have a distinct line number field for each text field. A line command is a string that the user types into a line number field and that the editor recognizes as a command operating on that specific line or block of lines, e.g., LC to translate a line to lower case, ))3 to shift a block right three columns. Some editors also support line macros, also known as prefix macros or sequence macros. Despite the name &quot;prefix command&quot;, some editors allow the sequence field to appear after the text field.
* Text editors, especially source-code editors, often default to using a monospace font that clearly distinguishes between similar characters (homoglyphs) such as the colon and the semicolon.

==Specialized editors==
Some editors include special features and extra functions, for instance,

* Source code editors are text editors with additional functionality to facilitate the production of source code. These often feature user-programmable syntax highlighting and code navigation functions as well as coding tools or keyboard macros similar to an HTML editor.
* Folding editors. This subclass includes so-called &quot;orthodox editors&quot; that are derivatives of Xedit. Editors that implement folding without programing-specific features are usually called outliners (see below). 
* Outliners. Also called tree-based editors, because they combine a hierarchical outline tree view with a text editor. Folding (see above) can be considered a specialized form of outlining.
* IDEs (integrated development environments) are designed to manage and streamline large programming projects. They are usually only used for programming as they contain many features unnecessary for simple text editing.
* World Wide Web authors are offered a variety of HTML editors dedicated to the task of creating web pages. These include: Dreamweaver, KompoZer and E Text Editor. Many offer the option of viewing a work in progress on a built-in HTML rendering engine or standard web browser. However, most web development is done in a dynamic programming language such as Ruby or PHP using a source code editor or IDE. The HTML delivered by all but the simplest static web sites is stored as individual template files that are assembled by the software controlling the site and do not compose a complete HTML document.
* Mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists often produce articles and books using TeX or LaTeX in plain text files. Such documents are often produced by a standard text editor, but some people use specialized TeX editors.
* Collaborative editors allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously from remote locations over a network. The changes made by individual users are tracked and merged into the document automatically to eliminate the possibility of conflicting edits. These editors also typically include an online chat component for discussion among editors.
* Distraction-free editors provide a minimalistic interface with the purpose of isolating the writer from the rest of the applications and operating system, thus being able to focus on the writing without distractions from interface elements like a toolbar or notification area.

Programmable editors can usually be enhanced to perform any or all of these functions, but simpler editors focus on just one, or, like gPHPedit, are targeted at a single programming language.

<text>A tennis court is the venue where the sport of tennis is played. It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the centre. The same surface can be used to play both doubles and singles matches. A variety of surfaces can be used to create a tennis court, each with its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game.

==Dimensions==

The dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) governing body and are written down in the annual &#x27;Rules of Tennis&#x27; document. The court is long. Its width is for singles matches and for doubles matches. The service line is from the net. Additional clear space around the court is needed in order for players to reach overrun balls for a total of wide and long. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is high at the posts, and high in the center. The net posts are outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, outside the singles court on each side.

Based on the standard rules of tennis, the size of the court is measured to the &quot;outside&quot; of the respective baselines and sidelines. The &quot;service&quot; lines (&quot;T&quot; and the &quot;service&quot; line) are centered. The ball must completely miss the line to be considered &quot;out&quot;. This also means that the width of the line (except for the center service line) is irrelevant to play. The center service line is , the other lines are between wide, whereas the baseline may be up to wide.

===Smaller courts===
The ITF&#x27;s Play and Stay campaign promotes playing on smaller courts with slower red, orange, and green balls for younger children. This gives children more time and control so they can serve, rally, and score from the first lesson on courts that are sized to fit their bodies. The ITF has mandated that official competition for children aged 10 years and under should be played on &quot;Orange&quot; courts long by wide. Competition for children under 8 years is played on &quot;Red&quot; courts that are long and wide. The net is always 0.8 m high in the center.

==Surfaces==

Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: clay courts, hard courts, grass courts and carpet courts. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:

* Category 1 (slow)
* Category 2 (medium-slow)
* Category 3 (medium)
* Category 4 (medium-fast)
* Category 5 (fast)

Of the current four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian and US Open use hard courts, the French Open is played on clay, and Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam to have always been played on the same surface, is played on grass. The Australian Open switched from grass to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only major to have been played on three surfaces; it was played on grass from its inception until 1974, green clay from 1975 until 1977 and hard courts since it moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the National Tennis Center in 1978.

ITF uses the following classification for tennis court surface types:

===Clay courts===
Clay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick. The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament still played on clay; the courts there are made from crushed red brick (known commonly as &quot;European clay&quot; or &quot;terre battue&quot; in France). 
Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce in comparison to grass or hard courts, taking away many of the advantages of big serves. For this reason, the clay court heavily favors baseline players, as it is hard for attacking serve-and-volley players to dominate on the surface. Clay courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay&#x27;s water content must be balanced; green clay courts (see below) are generally required to be sloped to allow water run-off.

Clay courts are more common in Europe and Latin America than in North America. The clay courts that do exist in the United States tend to be made of green clay, which consists of crushed basalt; they are usually known by their brand name, HarTru. A &quot;maroon&quot; form of clay, advertized as &quot;American red clay&quot;, is also used at the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas. Clay courts with a top dressing of burnt shale – which makes the surface grittier and allows for faster play – can be found in Britain, especially in northern England and Scotland (where they are known as &quot;blaes&quot; courts). More esoteric clay-like surfaces, meanwhile, still exist in rural Australia (&#x27;antbed&#x27; courts, made out of compacted termite mounds and/or loam), India (animal dung) and the Philippines (crushed sea-shells).

Historically for the Grand Slams clay courts have been used at the French Open since 1891 and the US Open from 1975 to 1977 (on green clay).

===Grass courts===
Grass courts are the fastest type of courts in common use. They consist of grass grown on very hard-packed soil, which adds additional variables: bounces depend on how healthy the grass is, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. Points are usually very quick where fast, low bounces keep rallies short, and the serve plays a more important role than on other surfaces. Grass courts thus tend to favour serve-and-volley tennis players.

Grass courts were once among the most common tennis surfaces, but are now rare due to high maintenance costs, as they must be watered and mown often, and take a longer time to dry after rain than hard courts.

Historically for the Grand Slams grass courts have been used at Wimbledon since 1877, the US Open from 1881 to 1974, and the Australian Open from 1905 to 1987.

===Hard courts===
Hard courts are made of uniform rigid material, often covered with an acrylic surface layer to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces. Hard courts can vary in speed, though they are faster than clay but not as fast as grass courts. The quantity of sand added to the paint can greatly affect the rate at which the ball slows down. As well as acrylic, asphalt and concrete are also examples of hard court surfaces.

The US Open is played on Laykold while the Australian Open is played on GreenSet, both acrylic-topped hard court surfaces.

Historically for the Grand Slams hard courts have been used at the US Open since 1978 and the Australian Open since 1988.

===Carpet courts===
&quot;Carpet&quot; in tennis means any removable court covering. Indoor arenas store rolls of rubber-backed court surfacing and install it temporarily for tennis events, but they are not in use any more for professional events. A short piled form of artificial turf infilled with sand is used for some outdoor courts, particularly in Asia. Carpet is generally a fast surface, faster than hardcourt, with low bounce.

Notable tennis tournaments previously held on carpet courts were the WCT Finals, Paris Masters, U.S. Pro Indoor and Kremlin Cup. Since 2009, their use has been discontinued on the top tier of the ATP. ATP Challenger Tour tournaments such as the Trofeo Città di Brescia still use carpet courts. The WTA Tour&#x27;s last carpet court event, the International-level Tournoi de Québec, was discontinued after 2018.

==Indoor courts==
Some tennis courts are indoors, which allows play regardless of weather conditions and is more comfortable for spectators.

Different court surfaces have been used indoors. Hard courts are most common indoors, as they are the easiest to install and maintain. If the installation is permanent, they are constructed on an asphalt or concrete base, as with outdoor courts. Temporary indoor hard courts are typically constructed using wooden floor panels topped with acrylic which are installed over the venue&#x27;s standard floor. This is the system used for modern indoor professional events such as the ATP Finals.

Clay courts can be installed indoors with subsurface watering systems to keep the clay from drying out, and have been used for Davis Cup matches.

Carpet courts were once the most prominent of indoor surfaces, especially in temporary venues, but have largely been replaced by removable hard courts. They were used on both the ATP World Tour and World Championship Tennis circuits, though no events currently use them.

Historically, other surfaces have been used indoors such as wood courts at the defunct World Covered Court Championships and London Indoor Professional Championships.

The conclusion of the Wimbledon Championships, in 2012, was played on the lawn of Centre Court under the closed roof and artificial lights; the Halle Open has also seen a number of matches played on its grass court in the Gerry Weber Stadion with the roof closed. These, however, are outdoor venues with retractable roofs.

==Terminology==
Common tennis court terms:

* &quot;Advantage service box&quot; or &quot;ad court&quot;: The receiver&#x27;s left side service box, or the opponent&#x27;s right for the server; significant as the receiving side for an advantage point.
* &quot;Alley&quot; or &quot;Tramlines&quot;: The lanes on each side of the singles court. These are only used when playing doubles.
* &quot;Back court&quot;: The area between the baseline and the service line.
* &quot;Baseline&quot;: The rearmost line of the court, furthest from and parallel to the net.
* &quot;Center service line&quot;: The line dividing the two service boxes on each side.
* &quot;Center mark&quot;: The 4-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the two halves (and service boxes) of a tennis court.
* &quot;Deuce service box&quot; or &quot;deuce court&quot;: The receiver&#x27;s right side service box, or the opponent&#x27;s left for the server, significant as the receiving side for a deuce point.

<doc id="30312" wikidata="Q40591" url="?curid=30312" title="The Communist Manifesto">
<text>The Communist Manifesto (), originally the Manifesto of the Communist Party (), is a political pamphlet written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, commissioned by the Communist League and originally published in London in 1848. The text is the first and most systematic attempt by Marx and Engels to codify for wide consumption the historical materialist idea that &quot;the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&quot;, in which social classes are defined by the relationship of people to the means of production. Published amid the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, the manifesto remains one of the world&#x27;s most influential political documents.

Marx and Engels combine philosophical materialism with the Hegelian dialectical method in order to analyze the development of European society through its modes of production, including primitive communism, antiquity, feudalism, and capitalism, noting the emergence of a new, dominant class at each stage. The text outlines the relationship between the means of production, relations of production, forces of production, and the mode of production, and posits that changes in society&#x27;s economic &quot;base&quot; affect changes in its &quot;superstructure&quot;. Marx and Engels assert that capitalism is marked by the exploitation of the proletariat (working class of wage labourers) by the ruling bourgeoisie, which is &quot;constantly revolutionising the instruments [and] relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society&quot;. They argue that capital&#x27;s need for a flexible labour force dissolves the old relations, and that its global expansion in search of new markets creates &quot;a world after its own image&quot;.

The &quot;Manifesto&quot; concludes that capitalism does not offer humanity the possibility of self-realization, instead ensuring that humans are perpetually stunted and alienated. It theorizes that capitalism will bring about its own destruction by polarizing and unifying the proletariat, and predicts that a revolution will lead to the emergence of communism, a classless society in which &quot;the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all&quot;. Marx and Engels propose the following transitional policies: the abolition of private property in land and inheritance; introduction of a progressive income tax; confiscation of rebels&#x27; property; nationalisation of credit, communication, and transport; expansion and integration of industry and agriculture; enforcement of universal obligation of labour; and provision of universal education and abolition of child labour. The text ends with three decisive sentences, reworked and popularized into the famous call for solidarity, the slogan &quot;Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; is divided into a preamble and four sections. The introduction begins: &quot;A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism.&quot; Pointing out that it was widespread for politicians—both those in government and those in the opposition—to label their opponents as communists, the authors infer that those in power acknowledge communism to be a power in itself. Subsequently, the introduction exhorts communists to openly publish their views and aims, which is the very function of the manifesto.

The first section of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, &quot;Bourgeois and Proletarians&quot;, outlines historical materialism, and states that &quot;the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&quot;. According to the authors, all societies in history had taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited by an oppressive minority. In Marx and Engels&#x27; time, they say that under capitalism, the industrial working class, or &#x27;proletariat&#x27;, engages in class struggle against the owners of the means of production, the &#x27;bourgeoisie&#x27;. The bourgeoisie, through the &quot;constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions&quot; have emerged as the supreme class in society, displacing all the old powers of feudalism. The bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for its labour power, creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. In doing so, however, Marx and Engels describe the bourgeoisie as serving as &quot;its own grave-diggers&quot;; as they believe the proletariat will inevitably become conscious of their own potential and rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.

&quot;Proletarians and Communists&quot;, the second section, starts by stating the relationship of &#x27;conscious communists&#x27; (i.e., those who identify as communists) to the rest of the working class. The communists&#x27; party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike them, it will express the general will and defend the common interests of the world&#x27;s proletariat as a whole, independent of all nationalities. The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, including claims that it advocates communal prostitution or disincentivises people from working. The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands—among them a progressive income tax; abolition of inheritances and private property; abolition of child labour; free public education; nationalisation of the means of transport and communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned land, etc.—the implementation of which is argued would result in the precursor to a stateless and classless society.

The third section, &quot;Socialist and Communist Literature&quot;, distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time—these being broadly categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism; and Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. While the degree of reproach toward rival perspectives varies, all are dismissed for advocating reformism and failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary role of the working class.

&quot;Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties&quot;, the concluding section of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth century such as in France, Switzerland, Poland, and lastly Germany, which is said to be &quot;on the eve of a bourgeois revolution&quot; and predicts that a world revolution will soon follow. It ends by declaring an alliance with the democratic socialists, boldly supporting other communist revolutions and calling for united international proletarian action—&quot;Working Men of All Countries, Unite!&quot;

==Writing==

In spring 1847, Marx and Engels joined the League of the Just, who were quickly convinced by the duo&#x27;s ideas of &quot;critical communism&quot;. At its First Congress in 2–9 June, the League tasked Engels with drafting a &quot;profession of faith&quot;, but such a document was later deemed inappropriate for an open, non-confrontational organisation. Engels nevertheless wrote the &quot;Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith&quot;, detailing the League&#x27;s programme. A few months later, in October, Engels arrived at the League&#x27;s Paris branch to find that Moses Hess had written an inadequate manifesto for the group, now called the League of Communists. In Hess&#x27;s absence, Engels severely criticised this manifesto, and convinced the rest of the League to entrust him with drafting a new one. This became the draft &quot;Principles of Communism&quot;, described as &quot;less of a credo and more of an exam paper&quot;.

On 23 November, just before the Communist League&#x27;s Second Congress (29 November – 8 December 1847), Engels wrote to Marx, expressing his desire to eschew the catechism format in favour of the manifesto, because he felt it &quot;must contain some history.&quot; On the 28th, Marx and Engels met at Ostend in Belgium, and a few days later, gathered at the Soho, London headquarters of the German Workers&#x27; Education Association to attend the Congress. Over the next ten days, intense debate raged between League functionaries; Marx eventually dominated the others and, overcoming &quot;stiff and prolonged opposition&quot;, in Harold Laski&#x27;s words, secured a majority for his programme. The League thus unanimously adopted a far more combative resolution than that at the First Congress in June. Marx (especially) and Engels were subsequently commissioned to draw up a manifesto for the League.

Upon returning to Brussels, Marx engaged in &quot;ceaseless procrastination&quot;, according to his biographer Francis Wheen. Working only intermittently on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, he spent much of his time delivering lectures on political economy at the German Workers&#x27; Education Association, writing articles for the &quot;&quot;, and giving a long speech on free trade. Following this, he even spent a week (17–26 January 1848) in Ghent to establish a branch of the Democratic Association there. Subsequently, having not heard from Marx for nearly two months, the Central Committee of the Communist League sent him an ultimatum on 24 or 26 January, demanding he submit the completed manuscript by 1 February. This imposition spurred Marx on, who struggled to work without a deadline, and he seems to have rushed to finish the job in time. For evidence of this, historian Eric Hobsbawm points to the absence of rough drafts, only one page of which survives.

In all, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was written over 6–7 weeks. Although Engels is credited as co-writer, the final draft was penned exclusively by Marx. From the 26 January letter, Laski infers that even the Communist League considered Marx to be the sole draftsman and that he was merely their agent, imminently replaceable. Further, Engels himself wrote in 1883: &quot;The basic thought running through the &quot;Manifesto&quot; [...] belongs solely and exclusively to Marx&quot;. Although Laski does not disagree, he suggests that Engels underplays his own contribution with characteristic modesty and points out the &quot;close resemblance between its substance and that of the [&quot;Principles of Communism&quot;]&quot;. Laski argues that while writing the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, Marx drew from the &quot;joint stock of ideas&quot; he developed with Engels &quot;a kind of intellectual bank account upon which either could draw freely&quot;.

==Publication==
===Initial publication and obscurity, 1848–1872===

In late February 1848, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was anonymously published by the Workers&#x27; Educational Association (&quot;Kommunistischer Arbeiterbildungsverein&quot;), based at 46 Liverpool Street, in the Bishopsgate Without area of the City of London. Written in German, the 23-page pamphlet was titled &quot;Manifest der kommunistischen Partei&quot; and had a dark-green cover. It was reprinted three times and serialised in the &quot;Deutsche Londoner Zeitung&quot;, a newspaper for German &quot;émigré&quot;s. On 4 March, one day after the serialisation in the &quot;Zeitung&quot; began, Marx was expelled by Belgian police. Two weeks later, around 20 March, a thousand copies of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; reached Paris, and from there to Germany in early April. In April–May the text was corrected for printing and punctuation mistakes; Marx and Engels would use this 30-page version as the basis for future editions of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;.

Although the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s prelude announced that it was &quot;to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages&quot;, the initial printings were only in German. Polish and Danish translations soon followed the German original in London, and by the end of 1848, a Swedish translation was published with a new title—&quot;The Voice of Communism: Declaration of the Communist Party&quot;. In November 1850 the &quot;Manifesto of the Communist Party&quot; was published in English for the first time when George Julian Harney serialised Helen Macfarlane&#x27;s translation in his Chartist newspaper &quot;The Red Republican&quot;. Her version begins: &quot;A frightful hobgoblin stalks throughout Europe. We are haunted by a ghost, the ghost of Communism&quot;. For her translation, the Lancashire-based Macfarlane probably consulted Engels, who had abandoned his own English translation half way. Harney&#x27;s introduction revealed the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s hitherto-anonymous authors&#x27; identities for the first time.
A French translation of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was published just before the working-class June Days Uprising was crushed. Its influence in the Europe-wide Revolutions of 1848 was restricted to Germany, where the Cologne-based Communist League and its newspaper &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot;, edited by Marx, played an important role. Within a year of its establishment, in May 1849, the &quot;Zeitung&quot; was suppressed; Marx was expelled from Germany and had to seek lifelong refuge in London. In 1851, members of the Communist League&#x27;s central board were arrested by the Prussian Secret Police. At their trial in Cologne 18 months later in late 1852 they were sentenced to 3–6 years&#x27; imprisonment. For Engels, the revolution was &quot;forced into the background by the reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated &#x27;by law&#x27; in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852&quot;.

After the defeat of the 1848 revolutions the &quot;Manifesto&quot; fell into obscurity, where it remained throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Hobsbawm says that by November 1850 the &quot;Manifesto&quot; &quot;had become sufficiently scarce for Marx to think it worth reprinting section III [...] in the last issue of his [short-lived] London magazine&quot;. Over the next two decades only a few new editions were published; these include an (unauthorised and occasionally inaccurate) 1869 Russian translation by Mikhail Bakunin in Geneva and an 1866 edition in Berlin—the first time the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was published in Germany. According to Hobsbawm: &quot;By the middle 1860s virtually nothing that Marx had written in the past was any longer in print&quot;. However, John Cowell-Stepney did publish an abridged version in the &quot;Social Economist&quot; in August/September 1869, in time for the Basle Congress.

===Rise, 1872–1917===
In the early 1870s, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; and its authors experienced a revival in fortunes. Hobsbawm identifies three reasons for this. The first is the leadership role Marx played in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (aka the First International). Secondly, Marx also came into much prominence among socialists—and equal notoriety among the authorities—for his support of the Paris Commune of 1871, elucidated in &quot;The Civil War in France&quot;. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly in the popularisation of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, was the treason trial of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (SDAP) leaders. During the trial prosecutors read the &quot;Manifesto&quot; out loud as evidence; this meant that the pamphlet could legally be published in Germany. Thus in 1872 Marx and Engels rushed out a new German-language edition, writing a preface that identified that several portions that became outdated in the quarter century since its original publication. This edition was also the first time the title was shortened to &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (&quot;Das Kommunistische Manifest&quot;), and it became the version the authors based future editions upon. Between 1871 and 1873, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; was published in over nine editions in six languages; on 30 December 1871 it was published in the United States for the first time in &quot;Woodhull &amp; Claflin&#x27;s Weekly&quot; of New York City. However, by the mid 1870s the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; remained Marx and Engels&#x27; only work to be even moderately well-known.

Over the next forty years, as social-democratic parties rose across Europe and parts of the world, so did the publication of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; alongside them, in hundreds of editions in thirty languages. Marx and Engels wrote a new preface for the 1882 Russian edition, translated by Georgi Plekhanov in Geneva. In it they wondered if Russia could directly become a communist society, or if she would become capitalist first like other European countries. After Marx&#x27;s death in 1883, Engels provided the prefaces for five editions between 1888 and 1893. Among these is the 1888 English edition, translated by Samuel Moore and approved by Engels, who also provided notes throughout the text. It has been the standard English-language edition ever since.

The principal region of its influence, in terms of editions published, was in the &quot;central belt of Europe&quot;, from Russia in the east to France in the west. In comparison, the pamphlet had little impact on politics in southwest and southeast Europe, and moderate presence in the north. Outside Europe, Chinese and Japanese translations were published, as were Spanish editions in Latin America. The first Chinese edition of the book was translated by Zhu Zhixin after the 1905 Russian Revolution in a Tongmenghui newspaper along with articles on socialist movements in Europe, North America, and Japan. This uneven geographical spread in the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s popularity reflected the development of socialist movements in a particular region as well as the popularity of Marxist variety of socialism there. There was not always a strong correlation between a social-democratic party&#x27;s strength and the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s popularity in that country. For instance, the German SPD printed only a few thousand copies of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; every year, but a few hundred thousand copies of the &quot;Erfurt Programme&quot;. Further, the mass-based social-democratic parties of the Second International did not require their rank and file to be well-versed in theory; Marxist works such as the &quot;Manifesto&quot; or were read primarily by party theoreticians. On the other hand, small, dedicated militant parties and Marxist sects in the West took pride in knowing the theory; Hobsbawm says: &quot;This was the milieu in which &#x27;the clearness of a comrade could be gauged invariably from the number of earmarks on his Manifesto.

===Ubiquity, 1917–present===

Following the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Vladimir Lenin-led Bolsheviks to power in Russia, the world&#x27;s first socialist state was founded explicitly along Marxist lines. The Soviet Union, which Bolshevik Russia would become a part of, was a one-party state under the rule of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Unlike their mass-based counterparts of the Second International, the CPSU and other Leninist parties like it in the Third International expected their members to know the classic works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Further, party leaders were expected to base their policy decisions on Marxist–Leninist ideology. Therefore works such as the &quot;Manifesto&quot; were required reading for the party rank-and-file.

Therefore the widespread dissemination of Marx and Engels&#x27; works became an important policy objective; backed by a sovereign state, the CPSU had relatively inexhaustible resources for this purpose. Works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin were published on a very large scale, and cheap editions of their works were available in several languages across the world. These publications were either shorter writings or they were compendia such as the various editions of Marx and Engels&#x27; &quot;Selected Works&quot;, or their &quot;Collected Works&quot;. This affected the destiny of the &quot;Manifesto&quot; in several ways. Firstly, in terms of circulation; in 1932 the American and British Communist Parties printed several hundred thousand copies of a cheap edition for &quot;probably the largest mass edition ever issued in English&quot;. Secondly the work entered political-science syllabuses in universities, which would only expand after the Second World War. For its centenary in 1948, its publication was no longer the exclusive domain of Marxists and academicians; general publishers too printed the &quot;Manifesto&quot; in large numbers. &quot;In short, it was no longer only a classic Marxist document&quot;, Hobsbawm noted, &quot;it had become a political classic tout court&quot;.

Total sales have been estimated at 500 million, and one of the four best-selling books of all time.

Even after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the 1990s, the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; remains ubiquitous; Hobsbawm says that &quot;In states without censorship, almost certainly anyone within reach of a good bookshop, and certainly anyone within reach of a good library, not to mention the internet, can have access to it&quot;. The 150th anniversary once again brought a deluge of attention in the press and the academia, as well as new editions of the book fronted by introductions to the text by academics. One of these, &quot;The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition&quot; by Verso, was touted by a critic in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; as being a &quot;stylish red-ribboned edition of the work. It is designed as a sweet keepsake, an exquisite collector&#x27;s item. In Manhattan, a prominent Fifth Avenue store put copies of this choice new edition in the hands of shop-window mannequins, displayed in come-hither poses and fashionable décolletage&quot;.

==Legacy==

A number of late-20th- and 21st-century writers have commented on the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;″s continuing relevance. In a special issue of the &quot;Socialist Register&quot; commemorating the &quot;Manifesto&quot;″s 150th anniversary, Peter Osborne argued that it was &quot;the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century&quot;. Academic John Raines in 2002 noted: &quot;In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx foresaw it all&quot;. In 2003, English Marxist Chris Harman stated: &quot;There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where it&#x27;s going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today&#x27;s world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and &#x27;overproduction&#x27; on the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation&quot;. Alex Callinicos, editor of &quot;International Socialism&quot;, stated in 2010: &quot;This is indeed a manifesto for the 21st century&quot;. Writing in &quot;The London Evening Standard&quot;, Andrew Neather cited Verso Books&#x27; 2012 re-edition of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm as part of a resurgence of left-wing-themed ideas which includes the publication of Owen Jones&#x27; book &quot;&quot; and Jason Barker&#x27;s documentary &quot;Marx Reloaded&quot;.
In contrast, critics such as revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Eduard Bernstein distinguished between &quot;immature&quot; early Marxism—as exemplified by &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; written by Marx and Engels in their youth—that he opposed for its violent Blanquist tendencies and later &quot;mature&quot; Marxism that he supported. This latter form refers to Marx in his later life seemingly claiming that socialism, under certain circumstances, could be achieved through peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies. Bernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working-class claimed in the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Marx himself, later in his life, acknowledged that the Petite bourgeoisie was not disappearing in his work &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; (1863). The obscurity of the later work means that Marx&#x27;s acknowledgement of this error is not well known. George Boyer described the &quot;Manifesto&quot; as &quot;very much a period piece, a document of what was called the &#x27;hungry&#x27; 1840s&quot;.

Hal Draper rejected Bernstein&#x27;s arguments about the middle class, stating that the &quot;Manifesto&quot; actually notes that, although individual members of this class are being constantly proletarianized, the class &#x27;limps on, in a more and more ruined state&#x27;.

Many have drawn attention to the passage in the &quot;Manifesto&quot; that seems to sneer at the stupidity of the rustic: &quot;The bourgeoisie [...] draws all nations [...] into civilisation[.] [...] It has created enormous cities [...] and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic] of rural life&quot;. However, as Eric Hobsbawm noted: In 2013, &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; was registered to UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Programme along with Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital, VolumeI&quot;.

==Influences==
Marx and Engels&#x27; political influences were wide-ranging, reacting to and taking inspiration from German idealist philosophy, French socialism, and English and Scottish political economy. &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; also takes influence from literature. In Jacques Derrida&#x27;s work, &quot;Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International&quot;, he uses William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; to frame a discussion of the history of the International, showing in the process the influence that Shakespeare&#x27;s work had on Marx and Engels&#x27; writing. In his essay, &quot;Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx&quot;, Christopher N. Warren makes the case that English poet John Milton also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engels&#x27; work. Historians of 19th-century reading habits have confirmed that Marx and Engels would have read these authors and it is known that Marx loved Shakespeare in particular. Milton, Warren argues, also shows a notable influence on &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, saying: &quot;Looking back on Milton’s era, Marx saw a historical dialectic founded on inspiration in which freedom of the press, republicanism, and revolution were closely joined&quot;. Milton’s republicanism, Warren continues, served as &quot;a useful, if unlikely, bridge&quot; as Marx and Engels sought to forge a revolutionary international coalition. The &quot;Manifesto&quot; also makes reference to the &quot;revolutionary&quot; antibourgeois social criticism of Thomas Carlyle, whom Engels had read as early as May 1843.

<text>Trier ( , ; ), formerly and traditionally known in English as Trèves ( , ) and Triers (see also names in other languages), is a city on the banks of the Moselle in Germany. It lies in a valley between low vine-covered hills of red sandstone in the west of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, near the border with Luxembourg and within the important Moselle wine region.

Founded by the Romans in the late 1st century BC as &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot; (&quot;The City of Augustus among the Treveri&quot;), Trier is considered Germany&#x27;s oldest city. It is also the oldest seat of a bishop north of the Alps. Trier was one of the four capitals of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy period in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. In the Middle Ages, the archbishop-elector of Trier was an important prince of the Church who controlled land from the French border to the Rhine. The archbishop-elector of Trier also had great significance as one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire. Because of its significance during the Roman and Holy Roman empires, several monuments and cathedrals within Trier are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

With an approximate population of 110,000, Trier is the fourth-largest city in its state, after Mainz, Ludwigshafen, and Koblenz. The nearest major cities are Luxembourg City ( to the southwest), Saarbrücken ( southeast), and Koblenz ( northeast).

The University of Trier, the administration of the Trier-Saarburg district and the seat of the ADD (&quot;Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion&quot;), which until 1999 was the borough authority of Trier, and the Academy of European Law (ERA) are all based in Trier. It is one of the five &quot;central places&quot; of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Along with Luxembourg, Metz and Saarbrücken, fellow constituent members of the union of cities, it is central to the greater region encompassing Saar-Lor-Lux (Saarland, Lorraine and Luxembourg), Rhineland-Palatinate, and Wallonia.

== History ==

The first traces of human settlement in the area of the city show evidence of linear pottery settlements dating from the early Neolithic period. Since the last pre-Christian centuries, members of the Celtic tribe of the Treveri settled in the area of today&#x27;s Trier. The city of Trier derives its name from the later Latin locative &quot;in Trēverīs&quot; for earlier &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot;. According to the Archbishops of Trier, in the &quot;Gesta Treverorum&quot;, the founder of the city of the Trevians is Trebeta. German historian Johannes Aventinus also credited Trebeta with building settlements at Metz, Mainz, Basel, Strasbourg, Speyer and Worms.

The historical record describes the Roman Empire subduing the Treveri in the and establishing Augusta Treverorum about 16 BC. The name distinguished it from the empire&#x27;s many other cities honoring the first Roman emperor, Augustus. The city later became the capital of the province of Belgic Gaul; after the Diocletian Reforms, it became the capital of the prefecture of the Gauls, overseeing much of the Western Roman Empire. In the 4th century, Trier was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire with a population around 75,000 and perhaps as much as 100,000. The Porta Nigra (&quot;Black Gate&quot;) dates from this era. A residence of the Western Roman emperor, Roman Trier was the birthplace of Saint Ambrose. Sometime between 395 and 418, probably in 407 the Roman administration moved the staff of the Praetorian Prefecture from Trier to Arles. The city continued to be inhabited but was not as prosperous as before. However, it remained the seat of a governor and had state factories for the production of ballistae and armor and woolen uniforms for the troops, clothing for the civil service, and high-quality garments for the Court. Northern Gaul was held by the Romans along a line (&quot;līmes&quot;) from north of Cologne to the coast at Boulogne through what is today southern Belgium until 460. South of this line, Roman control was firm, as evidenced by the continuing operation of the imperial arms factory at Amiens.

The Franks seized Trier from Roman administration in 459. In 870, it became part of Eastern Francia, which developed into the Holy Roman Empire. Relics of Saint Matthias brought to the city initiated widespread pilgrimages. The bishops of the city grew increasingly powerful and the Archbishopric of Trier was recognized as an electorate of the empire, one of the most powerful states of Germany. The University of Trier was founded in the city in 1473. In the 17th century, the Archbishops and Prince-Electors of Trier relocated their residence to Philippsburg Castle in Ehrenbreitstein, near Koblenz. A session of the Reichstag was held in Trier in 1512, during which the demarcation of the Imperial Circles was definitively established.

In the years from 1581 to 1593, the Trier witch trials were held. It was one of the four largest witch trials in Germany alongside the Fulda witch trials, the Würzburg witch trial, and the Bamberg witch trials, perhaps even the largest one in European history. The persecutions started in the diocese of Trier in 1581 and reached the city itself in 1587, where it was to lead to the death of about 368 people, and was as such perhaps the biggest mass execution in Europe in peacetime. This counts only those executed within the city itself. The exact number of people executed in all the witch hunts within the diocese has never been established; a total of 1,000 has been suggested but not confirmed.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the French-Habsburg rivalry brought war to Trier. Spain and France fought over the city during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The bishop was imprisoned by Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor for his support for France between 1635 and 1645. In later wars between the Empire and France, French troops occupied the city during the Nine Years&#x27; War, the War of the Spanish Succession, and the War of the Polish Succession. After conquering Trier again in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, France annexed the city and the electoral archbishopric was dissolved. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Trier passed to the Kingdom of Prussia. Karl Marx, the German philosopher and one of the founders of Marxism, was born in the city in 1818.

As part of the Prussian Rhineland, Trier developed economically during the 19th century. The city rose in revolt during the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, although the rebels were forced to concede. It became part of the German Empire in 1871.

The synagogue on Zuckerbergstrasse was looted during the November 1938 Kristallnacht and later completely destroyed in a bomb attack in 1944. Multiple Stolperstein have been installed in Trier to commemorate those murdered and exiled during the Shoah.

In June 1940 during World War II over 60,000 British prisoners of war, captured at Dunkirk and Northern France, were marched to Trier, which became a staging post for British soldiers headed for German prisoner-of-war camps. Trier was heavily bombed and bombarded in 1944. The city became part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate after the war. The university, dissolved in 1797, was restarted in the 1970s, while the Cathedral of Trier was reopened in 1974 after undergoing substantial and long-lasting renovations. Trier officially celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1984. On 1 December 2020, 5 people were killed by an allegedly drunk driver during a vehicle-ramming attack. 
The Ehrang/Quint district of Trier was heavily damaged and flooded during the 16 July 2021 floods of Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Trier sits in a hollow midway along the Moselle valley, with the most significant portion of the city on the east bank of the river. Wooded and vineyard-covered slopes stretch up to the Hunsrück plateau in the south and the Eifel in the north. The border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is some away.

== Neighbouring municipalities ==
&quot;Listed in clockwise order, beginning with the northernmost; all municipalities belong to the Trier-Saarburg district&quot;

Schweich, Kenn and Longuich (all part of the Verbandsgemeinde Schweich an der Römischen Weinstraße), Mertesdorf, Kasel, Waldrach, Morscheid, Korlingen and Gusterath (all in the Verbandsgemeinde Ruwer), Hockweiler, Franzenheim (both part of the Verbandsgemeinde Trier-Land), Konz and Wasserliesch (both part of the Verbandsgemeinde Konz), Igel, Trierweiler, Aach, Newel, Kordel, Zemmer (all in the Verbandsgemeinde Trier-Land).

== Organization of city districts ==

The Trier urban area is divided into 19 city districts. For each district there is an &quot;Ortsbeirat&quot; (local council) of between 9 and 15 members, as well as an &quot;Ortsvorsteher&quot; (local representative). The local councils are charged with hearing the important issues that affect the district, although the final decision on any issue rests with the city council. The local councils nevertheless have the freedom to undertake limited measures within the bounds of their districts and their budgets.

<doc id="30318" wikidata="Q11247037" url="?curid=30318" title="Ton">
<text>Ton is any of several units of measure of mass, volume or force. It has a long history and has acquired several meanings and uses.

As a unit of mass, &quot;ton&quot; can mean:
* the &quot;long ton&quot;, which is 
* the &quot;tonne&quot;, also called the &quot;metric ton&quot;, which is ) or 1 megagram.
* the &quot;short ton&quot;, which is 

Its original use as a unit of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in units such as the &quot;freight ton&quot; and a number of other units, ranging from in size. Recent specialized uses include the ton as a means of truck classification. It can also be used as a unit of energy, or in refrigeration as a unit of power, sometimes called a &quot;ton of refrigeration&quot;.

Because the ton (of any system of measuring weight) is usually the heaviest unit named in colloquial speech, its name also has figurative uses, singular and plural, informally meaning a large amount or quantity, or to a great degree, as in &quot;There&#x27;s a ton of bees in this hive,&quot; &quot;We have tons of homework,&quot; and &quot;I love you a ton.&quot;

==History==
The ton is derived from the &quot;tun&quot;, the term applied to a cask of the largest capacity. This could contain a volume between , which could weigh around and occupy some of space.

==Units of mass/weight==
There are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton:

The difference between the short ton and the other common forms (&quot;long&quot; and &quot;metric&quot;) is about 10%, while the metric and long tons differ by less than 2%.

The metric tonne is usually distinguished by its spelling when written, but in the United States and United Kingdom, it is pronounced the same as ton, hence is often spoken as &quot;metric ton&quot; when it is necessary to make the distinction. In the United Kingdom the final &quot;e&quot; of &quot;tonne&quot; can also be pronounced (). In Australia, it is pronounced .

In Ireland and most members of the Commonwealth of Nations, a ton is defined as .

In the United States and Canada, a ton is defined as .

===Other units of mass/weight===
*Deadweight ton (abbreviation &#x27;DWT&#x27; or &#x27;dwt&#x27;) is a measure of a ship&#x27;s carrying capacity, including bunker oil, fresh water, ballast water, crew, and provisions. It is expressed in tonnes () or long tons (). This measurement is also used in the U.S. tonnage of naval ships.
* Increasingly, tonnes are being used rather than long tons in measuring the displacement of ships.
*Harbour ton, used in South Africa in the 20th century, was equivalent to () or 1 short ton.
Assay ton (abbreviation &#x27;AT&#x27;) is not a unit of measurement but a standard quantity used in assaying ores of precious metals. A short assay ton is approximately and a long assay ton is approximately . These amounts bear the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a troy ounce. Therefore, the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample weighing one assay ton gives the number of troy ounces of metal contained in a ton of ore.

In documents that predate 1960 the word &quot;ton&quot; is sometimes spelled &quot;tonne&quot;, but in more recent documents &quot;tonne&quot; refers exclusively to the metric ton.

In nuclear power plants tHM and MTHM mean tonnes of heavy metals, and MTU means tonnes of uranium. In the steel industry, the abbreviation THM means &#x27;tons/tonnes hot metal&#x27;, which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced, particularly in the context of blast furnace production or specific consumption.

===Subdivisions===
Both the UK definition of long ton and US definition of short ton have similar underlying bases. Each is equivalent to 20 hundredweight; however, they are long or short hundredweight , respectively.

Before the 20th century there were several definitions. Prior to the 15th century in England, the ton was 20 hundredweight, each of 108 lb, giving a ton of . In the 19th century in different parts of Britain, definitions of 2,240, or 2,352, or 2,400 lb were used, with 2,000 lb for explosives; the legal ton was usually 2,240 lb.

In the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other areas that had used the imperial system, the tonne is the form of ton legal in trade.

==Units of volume==

The displacement, essentially the weight, of a ship is traditionally expressed in long tons. To simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the volume, rather than weight, of water displaced, and calculating the weight from the volume and density.
For practical purposes the displacement ton (DT) is a unit of volume, , the approximate volume occupied by one ton of seawater (the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature). It is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons (1.018 m3) of the water ton (based on distilled water).

One measurement ton or freight ton is equal to , but historically it has had several different definitions. It is used to determine the amount of money to be charged in loading, unloading, or carrying different sorts of cargo. In general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual weight is used. If it is lighter than salt water, e.g. feathers, freight is calculated in measurement tons of 40 cubic feet.

Gross tonnage and net tonnage are volumetric measures of the cargo-carrying capacity of a ship.

The Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) is based on net tonnage, modified for Panama Canal billing purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel&#x27;s total volume; a PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.

The water ton is used chiefly in Great Britain, in statistics dealing with petroleum products, and is defined as , the volume occupied by of water under the conditions that define the imperial gallon.

==Units of energy and power==

===Ton of TNT===
*A ton of TNT or &quot;tonne of TNT&quot; is a unit of energy equal to 109 (thermochemical) calories, also known as a gigacalorie (Gcal), equal to 4.184 gigajoules (GJ).
*A kiloton of TNT or &quot;kilotonne of TNT&quot; is a unit of energy equal to 1012 calories, also known as a teracalorie (Tcal), equal to 4.184 terajoules (TJ).
*A megaton of TNT (1,000,000 tonnes) or &quot;megatonne of TNT&quot; is a unit of energy equal to 1015 calories, also known (infrequently) as a petacalorie (Pcal), equal to 4.184 petajoules (PJ).

These are small calories (cal). The large or dietary calorie (Cal) is equal to one kilocalorie (kcal), and is gradually being replaced by the latter correct term.

Early values for the explosive energy released by trinitrotoluene (TNT) ranged from 900 to 1100 calories per gram. In order to standardise the use of the term &quot;TNT&quot; as a unit of energy, an arbitrary value was assigned based on 1,000 calories () per gram. Thus there is no longer a direct connection to the chemical TNT itself. It is now merely a unit of energy that happens to be expressed using words normally associated with mass (e.g., kilogram, tonne, pound). The definition applies for both spellings: &quot;ton of TNT&quot; and &quot;tonne of TNT&quot;.

Measurements in tons of TNT have been used primarily to express nuclear weapon yields, though they have also been used since in seismology as well.

=== Tonne of oil equivalent===
A tonne of oil equivalent (toe), sometimes &quot;ton of oil equivalent&quot;, is a conventional value, based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil. The unit is used, for example, by the International Energy Agency (IEA), for the reported world energy consumption as TPES in millions of toe (Mtoe).

Other sources convert 1 toe into 1.28 tonne of coal equivalent (tce). 1 toe is also standardized as 7.33 barrel of oil equivalent (boe).

=== Tonne of coal equivalent===
A tonne of coal equivalent (tce), sometimes &quot;ton of coal equivalent&quot;, is a conventional value, based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of coal. Plural name is &quot;tonnes of coal equivalent&quot;.
* Per the World Coal Association: 1 tonne of coal equivalent (tce) corresponds to 0.697 tonne of oil equivalent (toe)
* Per the International Energy Agency 1 tonne of coal equivalent (tce) corresponds to 0.700 tonne of oil equivalent (toe)
=== Refrigeration ===

The unit &quot;ton&quot; is used in refrigeration and air conditioning to measure the rate of heat absorption. Prior to the introduction of mechanical refrigeration, cooling was accomplished by delivering ice. Installing one ton of mechanical refrigeration capacity replaced the daily delivery of one ton of ice.

* In North America, a standard ton of refrigeration is . &quot;The heat absorption per day is approximately the heat of fusion of 1 &quot;ton&quot; of ice at .&quot; This is approximately the power required to melt one short ton () of ice at in 24 hours, thus representing the delivery of of ice per day.
* A less common usage is the power required to cool 1 long ton ( = ) of water by every 10 minutes = .

The refrigeration ton is commonly abbreviated as RT.

==Colloquial English==
*Ton is also used informally, often as slang, to mean a large amount of something.
*In Britain, a ton is colloquially used to refer to 100 of a given unit. Ton can thus refer to a speed of 100 miles per hour, and is prefixed by an indefinite article, e.g. &quot;Lee was doing a ton down the motorway&quot;; to money e.g. &quot;How much did you pay for that?&quot; &quot;A ton&quot; (£100); to 100 points in a game e.g. &quot;Eric just threw a ton in our darts game&quot; (in some games, e.g. cricket, more commonly called a century); or to a hundred of any other countable figure.

<text>codice_1 is a Unix text chat program, originally allowing messaging only between the users logged on to one multi-user computer—but later extended to allow chat to users on other systems.

Although largely superseded by IRC and other modern systems, it is still included with most Unix-like systems today, including Linux, BSD systems and macOS.

==History==
Similar facilities existed on earlier system such as Multics, CTSS, PLATO, and NLS. Early versions of talk did not separate text from each user. Thus, if each user were to type simultaneously, characters from each user were intermingled. Since slow teleprinter keyboards were used at the time (11 characters per second maximum), users often could not wait for each other to finish. It was common etiquette for a long typing user to stop when intermingling occurred to see the listener&#x27;s interrupting response. This is much the same as interrupting a long monologue when speaking in person. More modern versions use curses to break the terminal into multiple zones for each user, thus avoiding intermingling text.

In 1983, a new version of talk was introduced as a Unix command with 4.2BSD, and would also accommodate electronic conversations between users on different machines. Follow-ons to talk included codice_2, Britt Yenne&#x27;s codice_3 and Roger Espel Llima&#x27;s codice_4. ytalk was the first of these to allow conversations between more than two users, and was written in part to allow communication between users on computers with different endianness. utalk uses a special protocol over UDP (instead of TCP used by the rest) that is more efficient and allows edition of the entire screen. All of these programs split the interface into different sections for each participant. The interfaces did not convey the order in which statements typed by different participants would be reassembled into a log of the conversation. Also, all three programs are real-time text, where they transmit each character as it was typed. This leads to a more immediate feel to the discussion than recent instant messaging clients or IRC. Users more familiar with other forms of instant text communication would sometimes find themselves in embarrassing situations by typing something and deciding to withdraw the statement, unaware that other participants of the conversation had seen every keystroke happen in real time.

A similar program exists on VMS systems called codice_5.

==Security==
A popular program called &quot;flash&quot;, which sent malformed information via the talk protocol, was frequently used by pranksters to corrupt the terminal output of the unlucky target in the early 1990s. It did this by including terminal commands in the field normally designated for providing the name of the person making the request. When the victim would receive the talk request, the name of the person sending the request would be displayed on their screen. This would cause the terminal commands to execute, rendering the person&#x27;s display unreadable until they reset it. Later versions of talk blocked flash attempts and alerted the user that one had taken place. Later it became clear that, by sending different terminal commands, it is even possible to have the user execute commands. As it has proven impossible to fix all programs that output untrusted data to the terminal, modern terminal emulators have been rewritten to block this attack, though some may still be vulnerable.

<text>The Sex Pistols are an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they became culturally influential in popular music. The band initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspired many later punk, post-punk and alternative rock musicians, while their clothing and hairstyles were a significant influence on the early punk image.

The Sex Pistols&#x27; first line-up consisted of vocalist Johnny Rotten (born John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock, with Matlock replaced by Sid Vicious (born John Richie) in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band gained widespread attention from British press after swearing live on-air during a December 1976 television interview. Their May 1977 single &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which described the monarchy as a &quot;fascist regime&quot;, was released to coincide with national celebrations for the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. The song was promptly banned from being played by the BBC and by nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it the most censored record in British history.

Their sole studio album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; (1977) was a UK number one and is regarded as seminal in the development of punk rock. In January 1978, at the final gig of a difficult and media-hyped tour of the US, Rotten announced the band&#x27;s break-up live on stage. Over the next few months, the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren&#x27;s film of the Sex Pistols&#x27; story, &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock later reunited for a successful tour in 1996. Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade. In 2024, Jones, Cook, Matlock, and guest vocalist Frank Carter, reformed the Sex Pistols to play a series of shows that year, with further dates scheduled for 2025.

The Sex Pistols have been recognised as a highly influential band. In 2006, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame although, true to their image, they refused to attend the ceremony, with Rotten referring to the museum as &quot;a piss stain&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
The Sex Pistols evolved from the Strand (sometimes known as the Swankers), formed in London in 1972 by teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments he had stolen. The band regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King&#x27;s Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor&#x27;s Acme Attractions and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die. McLaren&#x27;s and Westwood&#x27;s shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the &#x27;50s rocker look. The shop then became a focal point of the early London punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart. Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with &quot;pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look&quot;.

In late 1974, Jones asked McLaren to take over the band&#x27;s management. Glen Matlock, an art student who occasionally worked at McLaren&#x27;s and Westwood&#x27;s shop, joined as bassist. McLaren and Westwood conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex, it changed its focus away from retro 1950s couture to S&amp;M-inspired &quot;anti-fashion&quot;. After managing and promoting the New York Dolls, McLaren returned to London in May 1975 and began to take more of an interest in the Strand.

The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by Bernard Rhodes (who would later go on to manage the Clash) and performing live. Soon after McLaren&#x27;s return, Nightingale was dismissed and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar. McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls&#x27; Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group. When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As described by Matlock, &quot;Everyone had long hair back then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer&quot;. For instance, Midge Ure, the later front man of Rich Kids (with Matlock) and Ultravox, claims to have been approached, but refused the offer. With the search for a lead singer proving fruitless, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who also turned down the invitation.

===Lydon joins===

Describing the social context in which the band formed, John Lydon said that mid-seventies Britain was &quot;a very depressing place... completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment, just about everybody was on strike... if you came from the wrong side of the tracks... then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all.&quot;

In August 1975, Rhodes spotted Lydon, then 19 years old, wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words &#x27;I Hate&#x27; handwritten above the band&#x27;s name and holes scratched through the Floyd members&#x27; eyes. Soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to audition. During the session, Lydon improvised to Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Eighteen&quot; on the Sex jukebox. According to Jones, &quot;he came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had the &#x27;I Hate Pink Floyd&#x27; T-shirt on...held together with safety pins... he was a real arsehole—but smart.&quot; Jones renamed Lydon as &quot;Johnny Rotten&quot; as a joke, apparently because of his particularly bad teeth.

Cook had a full-time job and was threatening to quit the band. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; journalist Nick Kent occasionally played second guitar with the band but left acrimoniously when Lydon joined. An advertisement was placed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; looking for a &quot;whizz kid guitarist ... not older than 20 ... not worse looking than Johnny Thunders.&quot; As Steve New was the most talented guitarist to audition, he was asked to join. However, Jones&#x27; playing had greatly improved, and New left a month after joining the band.
After considering band name options such as Le Bomb, Subterraneans, the Damned, Beyond, Teenage Novel, Kid Gladlove, and Crème de la Crème, they decided on Sex Pistols. Matlock said the band decided on the name while McLaren was in the United States before Rotten joined. Jon Savage says the name was not firmly settled on until just before their first show in November 1975. McLaren later said the name derived &quot;from the idea of a pistol, a pin-up, a young thing, a better-looking assassin&quot;. Not given to modesty, false or otherwise, he added: &quot;[I] launched the idea in the form of a band of kids who could be perceived as being bad.&quot; The group began writing original material: Rotten was the lyricist and Matlock the primary melody writer (though their first collaboration, &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;, had all lyrics by Matlock, which Rotten tweaked a bit); official credit was shared equally among the four.

Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, then studying at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art. The band played at the school in November 1975, supporting the pub rock group Bazooka Joe. They performed several covers including the Who&#x27;s &quot;Substitute&quot;, the Small Faces&#x27; &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do About It&quot;, and the Monkees&#x27; &quot;(I&#x27;m Not Your) Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;.

=== Early following ===
The Saint Martins gig was followed by performances at colleges around London. The band&#x27;s core early followers—including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and Billy Idol, Jordan, and Soo Catwoman—came to be known as the Bromley Contingent, after the suburban south-east London borough that several of them were from. Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by Sex, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted. McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture. They were influenced by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists. These interests were shared with Jamie Reid, a friend of McLaren who took over the design of the band&#x27;s visual imagery in the spring of 1976. His cut-up lettering—based on notes left by kidnappers or terrorists—were used to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band, although they were actually introduced by McLaren&#x27;s friend Helen Wellington-Lloyd. Reid has said that he used &quot;to talk to John [Lydon] a lot about the Situationists... the Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren&#x27;t getting the message from left-wing politics&quot;. McLaren was also arranging for the band&#x27;s first photo sessions. According to the writer Jon Savage, Lydon &quot;with his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look...[Lydon] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell&quot;.

Their first gig to attract attention was as a supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee in February 1976. The band&#x27;s first review appeared in the &quot;NME&quot;, accompanied by a brief interview in which Jones declared, &quot;Actually we&#x27;re not into music. We&#x27;re into chaos.&quot; Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London in search of the Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at Sex, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, &quot;My life changed the moment that I saw the Sex Pistols.&quot;

The Pistols soon played other important venues, notably playing at Oxford Street&#x27;s 100 Club for the first time on 30 March. On 3 April, they played for the first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group&#x27;s lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols for the first time that night—and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April highlighted the band&#x27;s growing musical competence. However Westwood started a fight with another audience member which also dragged in McLaren and Rotten. Cook later said, the &quot;fight at the Nashville: that&#x27;s when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in... I think everybody was ready to go and we were the catalyst.&quot;

The leading New York punk band, the Ramones, released their debut album on 23 April 1976. Although regarded as seminal to the growth of English punk rock, and Cook and Jones being fans of the album, Lydon has repeatedly rejected that it influenced the Sex Pistols, claiming that they &quot;were all long-haired and of no interest to me. I didn&#x27;t like their image, what they stood for, or anything about them&quot;.
 Cook also denied being influenced by their music, stating, &quot;the Ramones and the Pistols were different animals, with a different flavour. They were more basic, three-chord rock’n’roll&quot;, but added that the release of the album made the Pistols think, &quot;We’d better crack on here.” 

On 11 May, the Pistols began a four-week Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club. They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols&#x27; 4 June performance at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.

On 4 and 6 July, respectively, two newly formed London punk rock acts—the Clash, with Strummer as lead vocalist, and the Damned—made their live debuts opening for the Sex Pistols. On their off-night on the 5th, the Pistols attended a Ramones gig at Dingwalls, like virtually everyone else at the centre of the early London punk scene. During a return Manchester gig on 20 July, the Pistols premiered a new song, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed. According to Savage, &quot;there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric&quot;.

&quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; was among the seven original songs recorded in a demo session overseen by the band&#x27;s sound engineer, Dave Goodman. McLaren organised a major event for 29 August at The Screen on the Green in London&#x27;s Islington district, with the Buzzcocks and the Clash opening for the Pistols. Three days later, the band were in Manchester to tape their first television appearance, for Tony Wilson&#x27;s &quot;So It Goes&quot;. The Pistols played their first gig outside Britain on 3 September, at the opening of the Chalet du Lac disco in Paris. The Bromley Contingent were in attendance and Siouxsie was harassed by locals due to her outfit with bare breasts. The following day, the &quot;So It Goes&quot; performance aired. On 13 September, the Pistols began a tour of Britain. A week later, back in London, they headlined the opening night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Organised by McLaren (for whom the word &quot;festival&quot; had too much of a hippie connotation), the event was &quot;considered the moment that was the catalyst for the years to come&quot;. Belying the common perception that punk bands couldn&#x27;t play their instruments, contemporary music press reviews, later critical assessments of concert recordings, and testimonials by fellow musicians indicate that the Pistols had developed into a tight, ferocious live band. As Rotten tested out wild vocalisation styles, the instrumentalists experimented &quot;with overload, feedback and distortion... pushing their equipment to the limit&quot;.

=== Mainstream fame ===

The record label EMI signed the band on a two-year contract on 8 October 1976. The Pistols were soon in a studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman. According to Matlock, &quot;The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance. We were pressurized to make it faster and faster.&quot; The results were rejected by the band. Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, was brought in to produce. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, was released on 26 November 1976. The musician and journalist John Robb later described the record&#x27;s impact: &quot;From Steve Jones&#x27; opening... descending chords, to Johnny Rotten&#x27;s... sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement... a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics.&quot; Colin Newman of the early post-punk band Wire, described it as &quot;the clarion call of a generation&quot;.

The lyrics of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; linked punk to a newly politicised and nihilistic attitude, typified by phrases such as &quot;I am an anti-Christ&quot; and &quot;Destroy!&quot;. The single&#x27;s packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the idea of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve. The primary image associated with the single was Reid&#x27;s &quot;anarchy flag&quot; poster: a ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together Union Flag, with the song and band names clipped across the middle. These and other of Reid&#x27;s images for the band quickly became punk iconography.
The Pistols&#x27; behaviour as much as their music attracted national media attention. On 1 December 1976, the band, accompanied by members of the Bromley Contingent, repeatedly swore during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, hosted by Bill Grundy. Appearing as last-minute replacements for Queen, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, encouraged by Grundy, Jones said the band had &quot;fucking spent&quot; its label advance, and Rotten used the word &quot;shit&quot;. Grundy—who later claimed to have been drunk—then attempted to flirt with Siouxsie Sioux, who replied that she had &quot;always wanted to meet&quot; him. Grundy responded, &quot;Did you really? We&#x27;ll meet afterwards, shall we?&quot;, prompting Jones to repeatedly swear.
Although the programme was only broadcast in the London region, the ensuing media coverage occupied the tabloid newspapers for days. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; famously ran the headline &quot;The Filth and the Fury!&quot;, and asked &quot;Who are these punks?&quot;; other papers such as the &quot;Daily Express&quot; (&quot;Fury at Filthy TV Chat&quot;) and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (&quot;4-Letter Words Rock TV&quot;) followed suit. Thames Television suspended Grundy and the interview effectively ended his career. Steve Jones reflected; Grundy was the big dividing line in the Sex Pistols&#x27; story. Before it, we were all about the music, but from then on it was all about the media. In some ways it was our finest moment, but in others it was the beginning of the end... In terms of the Sex Pistols having any kind of long-term future, this sudden acceleration was the worst thing that could possibly have happened.

The interview made the band a household name overnight in Britain and brought punk into the mainstream. They launched the UK Anarchy Tour, supported by the Clash and Johnny Thunders&#x27; band the Heartbreakers, over from New York. The Damned were briefly part of the tour, before McLaren kicked them off. Media coverage was intense, and many of the concerts were cancelled by organisers or local authorities; of approximately twenty scheduled gigs, only about seven actually took place. Following a campaign in the south Wales press, a crowd including carol singers and a Pentecostal preacher, protested against the group outside a show in Caerphilly. Packers at the EMI plant refused to handle the band&#x27;s single. London Conservative councillor Bernard Brook Partridge said, &quot;Most of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death. The worst of the punk rock groups I suppose currently are the Sex Pistols. They are unbelievably nauseating... the antithesis of humankind. I would like to see somebody dig a very, very large, exceedingly deep hole and drop the whole bloody lot down it.&quot;

Three concerts were arranged in the Netherlands for January 1977. The band, hungover, boarded a plane at London Heathrow Airport early on 4 January; a few hours later, the &quot;Evening News&quot; was reporting that the band had &quot;vomited and spat their way&quot; to the flight. Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract. In one journalist&#x27;s later description, the Pistols had &quot;stoked a moral panic... precipitating the cancellation of gigs, the band&#x27;s expulsion from their EMI record deal and lurid tabloid tales of punk&#x27;s &#x27;shock cult. As McLaren fielded offers from other labels, the band went into the studio for a round of recordings with Goodman, their last with either him or Matlock.

On 28 February 1977 McLaren announced Matlock was leaving the band because Matlock &quot;went on too long about Paul McCartney.&quot; Although Matlock says he left voluntarily, Jones claimed in a contemporary interview that he was sacked because he &quot;liked the Beatles&quot;. In 2005, Jones admitted that although Matlock was a good songwriter, he &quot;didn&#x27;t look like a Sex Pistol&quot;. In 1990, Matlock described the reason as his bitter relationship with Rotten, exacerbated—in Matlock&#x27;s account—by Rotten&#x27;s attitude &quot;once he&#x27;d had his name in the papers&quot;. Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.

Matlock was replaced by Rotten&#x27;s friend Sid Vicious, previously the drummer of two inner circle punk bands, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Flowers of Romance. According to Matlock, Rotten wanted Vicious in the band because of him against Steve and Paul, it would become him and Sid against Steve and Paul. He always thought of it in terms of opposing camps.&quot; According to Jones, &quot;to Cookie [Paul Cook] and me, it just didn&#x27;t make any sense to have someone who couldn&#x27;t play a note trying to fill Glen&#x27;s shoes, but it was never about the music for McLaren... from the minute Sid joined the band, nothing was ever normal again.&quot;

Julien Temple, then a film student McLaren had employed to create a comprehensive audiovisual record of the band, agrees: &quot;Sid was John&#x27;s protégé in the group, really. The other two just thought he was crazy.&quot; McLaren later stated that, much earlier in the band&#x27;s career, Westwood had told him he should &quot;get the guy called John [Sid Vicious] who came to the store a couple of times&quot; to be the singer. When Lydon was recruited, Westwood said McLaren had recruited &quot;the wrong John&quot;.
Vicious was arrested after hurling a glass that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye at a Damned gig at the 100 Club Punk Special. He served time in a remand centre and the incident contributed to the 100 Club banning punk bands. He assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain during a gig at the 100 Club. According to McLaren, &quot;when Sid joined he couldn&#x27;t play guitar but his craziness fitted into the structure of the band.&quot; &quot;Everyone agreed he had the look,&quot; Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. &quot;The first rehearsals... with Sid were hellish&quot;. Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, &quot;After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story&quot;.

Being in the Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon observed, &quot;Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration.&quot; Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen introduced Vicious to heroin, and their emotional codependency alienated him from the other band members. Lydon later wrote, &quot;we did everything to get rid of Nancy... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission... She wanted to take Sid with her.&quot;

====A&amp;M, Virgin, and Jubilee week====
The Pistols signed to A&amp;M Records at a March 1977 press ceremony held outside Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, intoxicated, they went to the A&amp;M offices where Vicious reportedly broke a toilet bowl and Rotten verbally abused members of the label&#x27;s staff. A couple of days later, the Pistols got into a fight with another band at a club; one of Rotten&#x27;s friends threatened a friend of A&amp;M&#x27;s English director; A&amp;M broke their contract with the Pistols on 16 March. Although 25,000 copies of the &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; single had already been pressed, nearly all were destroyed. 

Vicious first performed with the Pistols at London&#x27;s Notre Dame Hall on 28 March. That May, the Pistols signed with Virgin Records, their third label in little more than half a year. During Virgin&#x27;s release campaign for &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, workers at the pressing plant laid down tools in protest at the song&#x27;s lyrics and Reid&#x27;s cover art of Queen Elizabeth II with her face obscured by cutout letters forming the song title and the band name. The single was eventually released on 27 May. Its lyrics–&quot;God save the queen / the fascist regime..She ain&#x27;t no human being / and there&#x27;s no future / in England&#x27;s dreaming&quot;–lead to widespread outcry from the British tabloids, leading to several major chains withdrawing it from sale. It was banned by BBC radio and television and every independent radio station, making it, according to the music critic Alexis Petridis, the &quot;most heavily censored record in British history&quot;. The song&#x27;s social impact has been described by the musician and journalist Sean O&#x27;Hagan as &quot;punk&#x27;s crowning glory&quot;.

The single was timed to coincide with the height of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, a week and a half after the record&#x27;s release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies. On 7 June, McLaren chartered a boat to have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event was conceived as a mockery of the Queen&#x27;s river procession planned for two days later, but ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band&#x27;s entourage were arrested. 
&quot;God Save the Queen&quot; opened at number 2 on the official UK record chart for Jubilee week, behind Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot;. McLaren claimed that CBS Records, who distributed both singles, told him that the Pistols were outselling Stewart two to one. There is evidence that exceptional measures were taken by the British Phonographic Institute, which oversaw the compilation of the UK chart, to exclude sales from Virgin&#x27;s shops.

Attacks on punk fans rose and in mid-June, Rotten was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington&#x27;s Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Reid and Cook were beaten up in other incidents; three days after the Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again. According to Cook, after the &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; single and the Grundy incident, the Pistols were public enemy number one, and there was a rivalry between gangs of rockabillies, Teddy Boys and punks, which often led to violence. By that August the band were unable to publicise UK dates, forcing them to tour pseudonymously as the SPOTS (Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly) to avoid cancellation.

McLaren had long wanted to make a movie featuring the Sex Pistols. Temple&#x27;s first task was to assemble &quot;Sex Pistols Number 1&quot;, a 25-minute mosaic of footage from various sources, much of it refilmed from television screens. &quot;Number 1&quot; was often screened at concert venues before the band took stage. Using media footage from the Thames incident, Temple created another short, &quot;Jubilee Riverboat&quot; (aka &quot;Sex Pistols Number 2&quot;).

==== Never Mind the Bollocks ====
Beginning in early 1977, Lydon, Jones and Cook began to record tracks for their debut album with producer Chris Thomas. Initially titled &quot;God Save Sex Pistols&quot;, it became known during the summer as &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;. Vicious&#x27;s lack of musical ability became apparent soon after he joined the sessions; according to Jones they &quot;tried as hard as possible not to let [Vicious] anywhere near the studio&quot;. Although Matlock was asked to return as a session musician, Jones ultimately played most of the bass parts. Vicious&#x27;s bass is reportedly present on &quot;Bodies&quot;: According to Jones, &quot;we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid&#x27;s down low.&quot; Jones says that Vicious showed up for the &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; session, while Lydon remembers him being there during the recording of an unused version of &quot;Submission&quot;. Two further singles were released from the Thomas sessions; &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; on 1 July and &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot; on 14 October. Each was a top-ten hit.

The album was released on 28 October 1977. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;the most exciting rock &amp; roll record of the Seventies&quot;. Some critics were disappointed that the album contained all four previously released singles, and dismissed it as little more than a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation.

Containing the track &quot;Bodies&quot;—in which Rotten says &quot;fuck&quot; six times—and &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and featuring the word &quot;bollocks&quot; in its title, the album was banned by Boots, W. H. Smith and Woolworths. The Conservative shadow minister for education condemned it as &quot;a symptom of the way society is declining&quot;, and both the Independent Television Companies Association and Association of Independent Radio Contractors banned its advertisements. Nonetheless, advance sales were sufficient to make it number one on the album chart.

The album title led to a high-profile legal case after a Nottingham Virgin Records store was threatened with prosecution for displaying &quot;indecent printed matter&quot;. The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that &quot;bollocks&quot; was an Old English term for a small ball, that the word appeared in place names without causing local communities erotic disturbance, and that in the nineteenth century &quot;bollocks&quot; had been used as a nickname for clergymen: &quot;Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense.&quot; In the context of the album title, the term does in fact primarily signify &quot;nonsense&quot;. Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. An exasperated Jones said, &quot;Oh, fuck it, never mind the bollocks of it all.&quot;

After dates in the Netherlands, the band set out on a Never Mind the Bans tour of Britain in December 1977. Of eight scheduled dates, four were cancelled due to illness or political pressure. On Christmas Day, the Pistols played two shows at Ivanhoe&#x27;s in Huddersfield, the first show being for the children of striking firemen. These were the band&#x27;s final UK performances for more than eighteen years.

The Pistols January 1978 US tour was initially scheduled for nine dates, but due to Vicious&#x27;s drug use and the breakdown in the relationship between Lydon and McLaren was cut short after seven shows. It was delayed due to American authorities&#x27; reluctance to issue a visa to Jones, given his criminal record, leading to the cancellation of several dates in the Northeast. Although the tour had been highly anticipated in the US, it was plagued by in-fighting and poor planning, leading to frustrated and belligerent audiences.

Early in the tour, Vicious was arrested while trying to buy heroin in Memphis and beaten by the security team hired by Warner Bros., the band&#x27;s American label. He subsequently appeared with the words &quot;Gimme a fix&quot; scarred on his chest. During a concert in San Antonio, Vicious called the crowd &quot;a bunch of faggots&quot; before hitting an audience member on the head with his bass guitar. Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, he spat blood at a woman who climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a photographer, attacked a security guard, and challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight.
Rotten was suffering flu and coughing up blood, and he felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones and disgusted by Vicious. Jones later said that he and Cook &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand being around Johnny and Sid anymore. You couldn&#x27;t turn round for a minute without Sid starting a fight... Then on top of that you had Rotten, who was on his own trip and basically thought he was God by that stage.&quot;

On 14 January 1978, during the tour&#x27;s final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band&#x27;s encore saying, &quot;You&#x27;ll get one number and one number only &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a lazy bastard.&quot; That one number was a Stooges cover, &quot;No Fun&quot;. At the end of the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, &quot;This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun.&quot; As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—&quot;Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you&#x27;ve been cheated? Good night&quot;—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, &quot;I felt cheated, and I wasn&#x27;t going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point... [Malcolm] wouldn&#x27;t speak to me... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn&#x27;t agree to anything.&quot;

On 17 January the band travelled separately to Los Angeles. Vicious, in increasingly bad shape, was brought by a friend who then took him to New York; Vicious took a mixture of valium and methadone (later excused as &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot;) and was hospitalised on arrival. Rotten flew to New York to visit Vicious, and announced the band&#x27;s break-up on 18 January. Virtually broke, he telephoned the head of Virgin Records, Richard Branson, who agreed to pay for his flight back to London.

==== Post-Lydon phase and breakup====
Cook, Jones and Vicious did not play live together again after Rotten&#x27;s departure. Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; they and others stepped in as lead vocalists on later tracks. On 30 June, a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released: on one side, notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang &quot;No One Is Innocent&quot; accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic &quot;My Way&quot;, over both a Jones–Cook backing track and a string orchestra. The single charted at number seven.

Vicious moved to New York, where he attempted to launch a career as a solo artist with Spungen as his manager. In September 1978, backed by members of the New York Dolls, Vicious recorded songs eventually released on his posthumous 1979 live album &quot;Sid Sings&quot;. On 12 October 1978, Spungen was found dead aged 20 in the Hotel Chelsea room she was sharing with Vicious, from a stab wound to her stomach. Police recovered drug paraphernalia from the scene and Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder. While on bail, Vicious was arrested for smashing a beer mug in the face of Patti Smith&#x27;s brother Todd Smith. Vicious was taken into custody on 9 December 1978 and spent the next 54 days in Rikers Island jail, where he underwent enforced cold turkey detox. He was released on bail on 1 February 1979. Later that night, following a small party to celebrate his release, he died of a heroin overdose, aged 21.

Cook and Jones continued to work together, with two new tracks they&#x27;d recorded, &quot;Black Leather&quot; and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;, appearing on the Japanese compilation &quot;The Very Best Of Sex Pistols And We Don&#x27;t Care&quot; in December 1979, Other new songs appeared on &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, a soundtrack album for a then-uncompleted film about the Sex Pistols. The album was released by Virgin Records in February 1979, and consisted mostly of cover songs and new tracks sung by Jones, Vicious, Cook, Biggs, McLaren and Edward Tudor-Pole. Several tracks feature Rotten&#x27;s vocals from early unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded music by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band&#x27;s final concert in San Francisco. The album also contains tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols songs. Four songs from &quot;Swindle&quot; became top ten singles, one more than from &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;. The 1978 &quot;No One Is Innocent&quot;/&quot;My Way&quot; single was followed in 1979 by the Vicious-sung cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Something Else&quot; (number three, and the biggest-selling single under the Sex Pistols name); Jones singing an original, &quot;Silly Thing&quot; (number six); and Vicious&#x27;s second Cochran cover, &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot; (number three). Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Sex Pistols name, with Tudor-Pole and others singing &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, and &quot;(I&#x27;m Not Your) Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;, which featured a Rotten vocal from 1976, ; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty.

Meanwhile, Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Pistols&#x27; management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title &quot;Johnny Rotten&quot;, unfair contractual obligations and damages for &quot;all the criminal activities that took place&quot;. Hearings began on 7 February 1979, five days after Vicious&#x27;s death. Cook and Jones allied with McLaren, but as evidence mounted that their manager had spent virtually all of the band&#x27;s revenue on his film project, they switched sides. On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership—no longer under McLaren&#x27;s control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members&#x27; financial claims. McLaren was left with substantial personal debts and legal fees.

==== Aftermath ====
After leaving the Pistols, Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon and formed the influential post-punk band Public Image Ltd with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble. The band scored a UK top-ten hit with their debut single, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Public Image&quot;. 

Following their fall out with McLaren, Cook and Jones formed the Professionals, which lasted from 1979-1982. Jones went on to play with the bands Chequered Past and Neurotic Outsiders. He also recorded two solo albums, &quot;Mercy&quot; and &quot;Fire and Gasoline&quot;. As of 2017, Jones lives in Los Angeles, where he has hosted a daily radio programme, &quot;Jonesy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, since 2015. Since the Rich Kids&#x27; break-up in 1979, Matlock has played with various bands, including recording and touring with Iggy Pop in 1980.

McLaren went on to carry out a one-month consultancy for Adam and the Ants and manage their offshoot Bow Wow Wow. In the mid-1980s he released a series of successful and influential records as a solo artist.

&quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; film was eventually completed by Julian Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Released in 1980, it heavily reflects McLaren&#x27;s vision. It is a fictionalised and partially animated retelling of the band&#x27;s history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of &quot;My Way&quot;) and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; and &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple&#x27;s description, he and McLaren conceived it as a &quot;very stylized... polemic&quot;. They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the &quot;poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans.&quot; In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren&#x27;s teaching a series of &quot;lessons&quot; to be learned from &quot;an invention of mine they called the punk rock&quot;.

The 1979 court ruling left many issues between Lydon and McLaren unresolved. Five years later, Lydon filed another action. Finally, on 16 January 1986, Lydon, Jones, Cook and the estate of Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band&#x27;s heritage, including the rights to &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; and all the footage shot for it—more than 250 hours. That same year, the fictionalised film of Vicious&#x27;s relationship with Spungen was released: &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, directed by Alex Cox. In his autobiography, Lydon attacked the film, saying that it &quot;celebrates heroin addiction&quot;, goes out of its way to &quot;humiliate [Vicious&#x27;s] life&quot; and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols&#x27; part in the London punk scene.

In May 2022 FX released the miniseries &quot;Pistol&quot; about the band.

==== Reunions ====

The original band members reunited in 1996 for the six-month Filthy Lucre tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan. Their access to the archives associated with &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; facilitated the production of the 2000 documentary &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;. The film was also directed by Temple and formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band&#x27;s point of view, in contrast to &quot;Swindle&quot;″s focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002 the band reunited to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. They undertook a short tour of North America in 2003.

In March 2006, the band sold the rights to their back catalogue to Universal Music Group. In November 2006, the Sex Pistols were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but the band rejected the honour. According to Jones, &quot;once you want to be put into a museum, Rock &amp; Roll&#x27;s over; it&#x27;s not voted by fans, it&#x27;s voted by people who induct you ... people who are already in it.&quot;

The Pistols reunited for seven performances in the UK in November 2007. In 2008, they undertook a series of European festival appearances, titled the Combine Harvester Tour. That same year, they released the DVD &quot;There&#x27;ll Always Be An England&quot;, recorded at their Brixton Academy appearance on 10 November 2007. The band signed with Universal in 2012 to re-release &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;.

On 3 June 2024, Cook, Jones, and Matlock announced two reunion shows at the Bush Hall in Shepherds Bush billed as &quot;Frank Carter and Sex Pistols&quot;. Carter, of Frank Carter &amp; The Rattlesnakes and Gallows, provided lead vocals in the absence of Lydon. They played the sole Sex Pistols studio album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; in its entirety. On August the 25th, they headlined along with Editors, the 2024 AMA Music Festival. A UK tour was later announced for September 2024, which was officially billed as &quot;Frank Carter and Paul Cook, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols do Never Mind the Bollocks&quot;. On September the 20th, they played the Rock City venue in Nottingham, the next day the Birmingham o2 Academy and on September the 26th, the played in London, Kentish Town. On 12 November 2024, they were announced as part of the 2025 Download Festival lineup. In January 2025, they announced their first Australian tour since 1996, set for April 2025.

==Musical style==
The Sex Pistols were a punk rock band. According to Mark Deming of AllMusic, 

== Legacy ==
=== Influence ===
The Sex Pistols are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in popular music history. Their &quot;Trouser Press Record Guide&quot; entry claims that &quot;their importance—both to the direction of contemporary music and more generally to pop culture—can hardly be overstated&quot;. The music critic Dave Marsh called them &quot;unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies&quot;. Although not the first punk band, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; is regularly cited as one of the all-time great albums: in 2006, it was voted No. 28 in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums Ever&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it at No. 2 in its 1987 &quot;Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years&quot;. It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history. According to AllMusic, the album is &quot;one of the greatest, most inspiring rock records of all time&quot;.

They directly inspired the style of many punk and post-punk bands, including the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Adverts, Subway Sect and the Slits. Their June 1976 concert at Manchester&#x27;s Lesser Free Trade Hall became one of the most mythologised events in rock history. Many among the audience of about forty became leading figures in the punk and post-punk movements, including Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, who organised the gig, Bernard Sumner, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Mark E. Smith, John Cooper Clarke, Morrissey and Anthony H. Wilson. Among the many later musicians who have acknowledged their debt to the Pistols are members of the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Stone Roses, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Nirvana, Green Day and Oasis. Calling the band &quot;immensely influential&quot;, a London College of Music study notes that &quot;many styles of popular music, such as grunge, indie, thrash metal and even rap owe their foundations to the legacy of ground breaking punk bands—of which the Sex Pistols was the most prominent.&quot;
According to the music journalist Ira Robbin, &quot;the Pistols and ... McLaren challenged every aspect and precept of modern music-making, thereby inspiring countless groups to follow their cue onto stages around the world.&quot; Critic Toby Creswell locates the primary source of inspiration somewhat differently. Noting that &quot;[i]mage to the contrary, the Pistols were very serious about music&quot;, Creswell wrote that &quot;essentially, the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the &#x27;60s had demonstrated—you don&#x27;t need technique to make rock &amp; roll. In a time when music had been increasingly complicated and defanged, the Sex Pistols&#x27; generational shift caused a real revolution.&quot;

Their cultural influence is evident in other media. Reid&#x27;s work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still influences the field in the 21st century. Aged twenty-one, Vicious was already a &quot;t-shirt-selling icon&quot;. While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk&#x27;s social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth. British punk fashion, still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his bricolage approach to personal style: he would wear a ted style velvet collared drape jacket, large pin-stripe pegs, a pin-collar Wemblex customised into an Anarchy shirt and brothel creepers. Christopher Nolan, director of the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, has said that Rotten inspired his characterisation of The Joker.

=== Conceptual basis ===
The Sex Pistols were defined by ambitions that went beyond the musical—indeed, McLaren was at times openly contemptuous of the band&#x27;s music and punk rock generally. &quot;Christ, if people bought the records for the music, this thing would have died a death long ago&quot;, he said in 1977. He claimed that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: &quot;I decided to use people, just the way a sculptor uses clay.&quot; According to McLaren, they were something with which &quot;to sell trousers&quot; and a &quot;carefully planned exercise to embezzle as much money as possible out of the music industry&quot;. Jon Savage characterises McLaren&#x27;s core theme in &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; as an attempt to extract &quot;cash from chaos&quot;.

Lydon dismissed McLaren&#x27;s influence: &quot;We made our own scandal just by being ourselves. Maybe it was that he knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being associated with punk is bollocks. It&#x27;s nonsense!&quot; Cook agreed and said that &quot;Situationism had nothing to do with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of.&quot; According to Lydon, &quot;If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time.&quot;

Toby Creswell argues that the Pistols message was &quot;inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to rebellion that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny.&quot; Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called &quot;stupid&quot; the claim that the Sex Pistols &quot;had any political significance... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn&#x27;t inspire the working classes.&quot; While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols &quot;wasn&#x27;t your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was over the edge of the precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale.&quot; Within a year of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country—groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.

In 1980, critic Greil Marcus reflected on McLaren&#x27;s contradictory posture:


Critic Bill Wyman writes that Lydon&#x27;s &quot;fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma&quot; were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band&#x27;s real meaning lies in McLaren&#x27;s provocative media manipulations. While some of the Sex Pistols&#x27; public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the &quot;pivotal moment that changed everything&quot;, the clash on the Bill Grundy &quot;Today&quot; show. According to Cook, McLaren &quot;didn&#x27;t instigate [situations]; that was always our own doing.&quot; Matlock said that at the point when he left the band, it was clear to him that McLaren &quot;was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets... However, I&#x27;ve since found out that even Malcolm wasn&#x27;t as aware of what he was up to as he has since made out.&quot; By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band&#x27;s creativity: the band only wrote two songs in the eleven months between his departure and their break-up.

<text>In mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic: that is, not the root of a non-zero polynomial with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are and . The quality of a number being transcendental is called transcendence.

Though only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known, partly because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given number is transcendental, transcendental numbers are not rare: indeed, almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental, since the algebraic numbers form a countable set, while the set of real numbers and the set of complex numbers are both uncountable sets, and therefore larger than any countable set.

All transcendental real numbers (also known as real transcendental numbers or transcendental irrational numbers) are irrational numbers, since all rational numbers are algebraic. The converse is not true: Not all irrational numbers are transcendental. Hence, the set of real numbers consists of non-overlapping sets of rational, algebraic irrational, and transcendental real numbers. For example, the square root of 2 is an irrational number, but it is not a transcendental number as it is a root of the polynomial equation . The golden ratio (denoted formula_1 or formula_2) is another irrational number that is not transcendental, as it is a root of the polynomial equation .

==History==
The name &quot;transcendental&quot; comes , and was first used for the mathematical concept in Leibniz&#x27;s 1682 paper in which he proved that is not an algebraic function of . Euler, in the eighteenth century, was probably the first person to define transcendental &quot;numbers&quot; in the modern sense.

Johann Heinrich Lambert conjectured that and  were both transcendental numbers in his 1768 paper proving the number is irrational, and proposed a tentative sketch proof that is transcendental.

Joseph Liouville first proved the existence of transcendental numbers in 1844, and in 1851 gave the first decimal examples such as the Liouville constant 

formula_3

in which the th digit after the decimal point is if = ( factorial) for some and otherwise. In other words, the th digit of this number is 1 only if is one of , etc. Liouville showed that this number belongs to a class of transcendental numbers that can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than can any irrational algebraic number, and this class of numbers is called the Liouville numbers. Liouville showed that all Liouville numbers are transcendental.

The first number to be proven transcendental without having been specifically constructed for the purpose of proving transcendental numbers&#x27; existence was , by Charles Hermite in 1873.

In 1874 Georg Cantor proved that the algebraic numbers are countable and the real numbers are uncountable. He also gave a new method for constructing transcendental numbers. Although this was already implied by his proof of the countability of the algebraic numbers, Cantor also published a construction that proves there are as many transcendental numbers as there are real numbers.
Cantor&#x27;s work established the ubiquity of transcendental numbers.

In 1882 Ferdinand von Lindemann published the first complete proof that is transcendental. He first proved that is transcendental if is a non-zero algebraic number. Then, since is algebraic (see Euler&#x27;s identity), must be transcendental. But since is algebraic, must therefore be transcendental. This approach was generalized by Karl Weierstrass to what is now known as the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. The transcendence of implies that geometric constructions involving compass and straightedge only cannot produce certain results, for example squaring the circle.

In 1900 David Hilbert posed a question about transcendental numbers, Hilbert&#x27;s seventh problem: If is an algebraic number that is not 0 or 1, and is an irrational algebraic number, is necessarily transcendental? The affirmative answer was provided in 1934 by the Gelfond–Schneider theorem. This work was extended by Alan Baker in the 1960s in his work on lower bounds for linear forms in any number of logarithms (of algebraic numbers).

==Properties==
A transcendental number is a (possibly complex) number that is not the root of any integer polynomial. Every real transcendental number must also be irrational, since a rational number is the root of an integer polynomial of degree one. The set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are countable, and since each such polynomial has a finite number of zeroes, the algebraic numbers must also be countable. However, Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, it is impossible for both subsets to be countable. This makes the transcendental numbers uncountable.

No rational number is transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational. The irrational numbers contain all the real transcendental numbers and a subset of the algebraic numbers, including the quadratic irrationals and other forms of algebraic irrationals.

Applying any non-constant single-variable algebraic function to a transcendental argument yields a transcendental value. For example, from knowing that is transcendental, it can be immediately deduced that numbers such as formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 are transcendental as well.

However, an algebraic function of several variables may yield an algebraic number when applied to transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, and are both transcendental, but is obviously not. It is unknown whether , for example, is transcendental, though at least one of and must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers and , at least one of and must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial  . If and were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, and , must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case that at least one of the coefficients is transcendental.

The non-computable numbers are a strict subset of the transcendental numbers.

All Liouville numbers are transcendental, but not vice versa. Any Liouville number must have unbounded partial quotients in its simple continued fraction expansion. Using a counting argument one can show that there exist transcendental numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not Liouville numbers.

Using the explicit continued fraction expansion of , one can show that is not a Liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). Kurt Mahler showed in 1953 that is also not a Liouville number. It is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded terms, that have a &quot;simple&quot; structure, and that are not eventually periodic are transcendental (in other words, algebraic irrational roots of at least third degree polynomials do not have apparent pattern in their continued fraction expansions, since eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals, see Hermite&#x27;s problem).

==Proofs for specific numbers==
===A proof that is transcendental===
The first proof that the base of the natural logarithms,, is transcendental dates from 1873. We will now follow the strategy of David Hilbert (1862–1943) who gave a simplification of the original proof of Charles Hermite. The idea is the following:

Assume, for purpose of finding a contradiction, that is algebraic. Then there exists a finite set of integer coefficients satisfying the equation:
formula_54
It is difficult to make use of the integer status of these coefficients when multiplied by a power of the irrational , but we can absorb those powers into an integral which “mostly” will assume integer values. For a positive integer , define the polynomial
formula_55
and multiply both sides of the above equation by
formula_56
to arrive at the equation:
formula_57

By splitting respective domains of integration, this equation can be written in the form
formula_58
where
formula_59
Here will turn out to be an integer, but more importantly it grows quickly with .

====Lemma 1====
&quot;There are arbitrarily large such that formula_60 is a non-zero integer.&quot;

Proof. Recall the standard integral (case of the Gamma function)
formula_61
valid for any natural number formula_62. More generally,

: if formula_63 then formula_64.

This would allow us to compute formula_65 exactly, because any term of formula_65 can be rewritten as
formula_67
through a change of variables. Hence
formula_68
That latter sum is a polynomial in formula_69 with integer coefficients, i.e., it is a linear combination of powers formula_70 with integer coefficients. Hence the number formula_65 is a linear combination (with those same integer coefficients) of factorials formula_72; in particular formula_65 is an integer.

Smaller factorials divide larger factorials, so the smallest formula_72 occurring in that linear combination will also divide the whole of formula_65. We get that formula_72 from the lowest power formula_70 term appearing with a nonzero coefficient in formula_78, but this smallest exponent formula_62 is also the multiplicity of formula_80 as a root of this polynomial. formula_81 is chosen to have multiplicity formula_82 of the root formula_83 and multiplicity formula_84 of the roots formula_85 for formula_86, so that smallest exponent is formula_87 for formula_88 and formula_89 for formula_90 with formula_91. Therefore formula_92 divides formula_65.

To establish the last claim in the lemma, that formula_65 is nonzero, it is sufficient to prove that formula_84 does not divide formula_65. To that end, let formula_84 be any prime larger than formula_33 and formula_99. We know from the above that formula_100 divides each of formula_101 for formula_102, so in particular all of those &quot;are&quot; divisible by formula_84. It comes down to the first term formula_104. We have (see falling and rising factorials)
formula_105
and those higher degree terms all give rise to factorials formula_100 or larger. Hence
formula_107
That right hand side is a product of nonzero integer factors less than the prime formula_84, therefore that product is not divisible by formula_84, and the same holds for formula_65; in particular formula_65 cannot be zero.

====Lemma 2====
&quot;For sufficiently large , formula_112.&quot;

Proof. Note that

formula_113

where are continuous functions of for all , so are bounded on the interval . That is, there are constants such that

formula_114

So each of those integrals composing is bounded, the worst case being

formula_115

It is now possible to bound the sum as well:

formula_116

where is a constant not depending on . It follows that

formula_117

finishing the proof of this lemma.

====Conclusion====

Choosing a value of that satisfies both lemmas leads to a non-zero integer formula_118 added to a vanishingly small quantity formula_119 being equal to zero: an impossibility. It follows that the original assumption, that can satisfy a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, is also impossible; that is, is transcendental.

===The transcendence of ===
A similar strategy, different from Lindemann&#x27;s original approach, can be used to show that the number is transcendental. Besides the gamma-function and some estimates as in the proof for , facts about symmetric polynomials play a vital role in the proof.
