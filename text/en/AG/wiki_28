<text>TeX (, see below), stylized within the system as , is a typesetting program which was designed and written by computer scientist and Stanford University professor Donald Knuth and first released in 1978. The term now refers to the system of extensions – which includes software programs called TeX &quot;engines&quot;, sets of TeX macros, and packages which provide extra typesetting functionality – built around the original TeX language. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.

TeX is widely used in academia, especially in mathematics, computer science, economics, political science, engineering, linguistics, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology. It has long since displaced Unix troff, the previously favoured formatting system, in most Unix installations. It is also used for many other typesetting tasks, especially in the form of LaTeX, ConTeXt, and other macro packages.

TeX was designed with two main goals in mind: to allow anybody to produce high-quality books with minimal effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, at any point in time (together with the Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern family of typefaces). TeX is free software, which made it accessible to a wide range of users.

==History==

When the first paper volume of Knuth&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot; was published in 1968, it was typeset using hot metal typesetting on a Monotype machine. This method, dating back to the 19th century, produced a &quot;classic style&quot; appreciated by Knuth. When the second edition was published, in 1976, the whole book had to be typeset again because the Monotype technology had been largely replaced by phototypesetting, and the original fonts were no longer available. When Knuth received the galley proofs of the new book on 30 March 1977, he found them inferior. Disappointed, Knuth set out to design his own typesetting system.

Knuth saw for the first time the output of a high-quality digital typesetting system, and became interested in digital typography. On 13 May 1977, he wrote a memo to himself describing the basic features of TeX. He planned to finish it on his sabbatical in 1978, but as it happened, the language was not &quot;frozen&quot; (ready to use) until 1989, more than ten years later. Guy Steele happened to be at Stanford during the summer of 1978, when Knuth was developing his first version of TeX. When Steele returned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that autumn, he rewrote TeX&#x27;s input/output (I/O) to run under the Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) operating system. The first version of TeX, called TeX78, was written in the SAIL programming language to run on a PDP-10 under Stanford&#x27;s WAITS operating system.

=== WEB and literate programming ===
For later versions of TeX, Knuth invented the concept of literate programming, a way of producing compilable source code and cross-linked documentation typeset in TeX from the same original file. The language used is called WEB and produces programs in DEC PDP-10 Pascal.

=== TeX82 ===
TeX82, a new version of TeX rewritten from scratch, was published in 1982. Among other changes, the original hyphenation algorithm was replaced by a new algorithm written by Frank Liang. TeX82 also uses fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point, to ensure reproducibility of the results across different computer hardware, and includes a real, Turing-complete programming language, following intense lobbying by Guy Steele. In 1989, Donald Knuth released new versions of TeX and Metafont. Despite his desire to keep the program stable, Knuth realized that 128 different characters for the text input were not enough to accommodate foreign languages; the main change in version 3.0 of TeX is thus the ability to work with 8-bit inputs, allowing 256 different characters in the text input. TeX3.0 was released on March 15, 1990.

Since version 3, TeX has used an idiosyncratic version numbering system, where updates have been indicated by adding an extra digit at the end of the decimal, so that the version number asymptotically approaches . This is a reflection of the fact that TeX is now very stable, and only minor updates are anticipated. The current version of TeX is 3.141592653; it was last updated in 2021. The design was frozen after version 3.0, and no new feature or fundamental change will be added, so all newer versions will contain only bug fixes. Even though Donald Knuth himself has suggested a few areas in which TeX could have been improved, he indicated that he firmly believes that having an unchanged system that will produce the same output now and in the future is more important than introducing new features. For this reason, he has stated that the &quot;absolutely final change (to be made after my death)&quot; will be to change the version number to , at which point all remaining bugs will become features. Likewise, versions of Metafont after 2.0 asymptotically approach (currently at 2.7182818), and a similar change will be applied after Knuth&#x27;s death.

=== Public domain ===
Since the source code of TeX is essentially in the public domain (see below), other programmers are allowed (and explicitly encouraged) to improve the system, but are required to use another name to distribute the modified TeX, meaning that the source code can still evolve. For example, the Omega project was developed after 1991, primarily to enhance TeX&#x27;s multilingual typesetting abilities. Knuth created &quot;unofficial&quot; modified versions, such as TeX-XeT, which allows a user to mix texts written in left-to-right and right-to-left writing systems in the same document.

==Use of TeX==
In several technical fields such as computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics, TeX has become a de facto standard. Many thousands of books have been published using TeX, including books published by Addison-Wesley, Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Oxford University Press, and Springer. Numerous journals in these fields are produced using TeX or LaTeX, allowing authors to submit their raw manuscript written in TeX. While many publications in other fields, including dictionaries and legal publications, have been produced using TeX, it has not been as successful as in the more technical fields, as TeX was primarily designed to typeset mathematics.

When he designed TeX, Donald Knuth did not believe that a single typesetting system would fit everyone&#x27;s needs; instead, he designed many hooks inside the program so that it would be possible to write extensions, and released the source code, hoping that the publishers would design versions tailoring to their own needs. While such extensions have been created (including some by Knuth himself), most people have extended TeX only using macros and it has remained a system associated with technical typesetting.

==Typesetting system==
TeX commands commonly start with a backslash and are grouped with curly braces. Almost all of TeX&#x27;s syntactic properties can be changed on the fly, which makes TeX input hard to parse by anything but TeX itself. TeX is a macro- and token-based language: many commands, including most user-defined ones, are expanded on the fly until only unexpandable tokens remain, which are then executed. Expansion itself is practically free from side effects. Tail recursion of macros takes no memory, and if-then-else constructs are available. This makes TeX a Turing-complete language even at the expansion level. The system can be divided into four levels: in the first, characters are read from the input file and assigned a category code (sometimes called &quot;catcode&quot;, for short). Combinations of a backslash (actually, any character of category zero) followed by letters (characters of category 11) or a single other character are replaced by a control-sequence token. In this sense, this stage is like lexical analysis, although it does not form numbers from digits. In the next stage, expandable control sequences (such as conditionals or defined macros) are replaced by their replacement text. The input for the third stage is then a stream of characters (including the ones with special meaning) and unexpandable control sequences (typically assignments and visual commands). Here, the characters get assembled into a paragraph, and TeX&#x27;s paragraph breaking algorithm works by optimizing breakpoints over the whole paragraph. The fourth stage breaks the vertical list of lines and other material into pages.

The TeX system has precise knowledge of the sizes of all characters and symbols, and using this information, it computes the optimal arrangement of letters per line and lines per page. It then produces a DVI file (&quot;DeVice Independent&quot;) containing the final locations of all characters. This DVI file can then be printed directly given an appropriate printer driver, or it can be converted to other formats. Nowadays, pdfTeX is often used, which bypasses DVI generation altogether. The base TeX system understands about 300 commands, called &quot;primitives&quot;. These low-level commands are rarely used directly by users, and most functionality is provided by format files (predumped memory images of TeX after large macro collections have been loaded). Knuth&#x27;s original default format, which adds about 600 commands, is Plain TeX. The most widely used format is LaTeX, originally developed by Leslie Lamport, which incorporates document styles for books, letters, slides, etc., and adds support for referencing and automatic numbering of sections and equations. Another widely used format, AMS-TeX, is produced by the American Mathematical Society and provides many more user-friendly commands, which can be altered by journals to fit with their house style. Most of the features of AMS-TeX can be used in LaTeX by using the &quot;AMS packages&quot; (e.g., codice_1, codice_2) and the &quot;AMS document classes&quot; (e.g., codice_3, codice_4). This is then referred to as AMS-LaTeX. Other formats include ConTeXt, used primarily for desktop publishing and written mostly by Hans Hagen at Pragma.

===How it is run===

A sample Hello world program in plain TeX is:
Hello, World
\bye % marks the end of the file; not shown in the final output
This might be in a file &quot;myfile.tex&quot;, as &quot;.tex&quot; is a common file extension for plain TeX files. By default, everything that follows a percent sign on a line is a comment, ignored by TeX. Running TeX on this file (for example, by typing tex myfile.tex in a command-line interpreter, or by calling it from a graphical user interface) will create an output file called &quot;myfile.dvi&quot;, representing the content of the page in a device independent format (DVI). A DVI file could then be either viewed on screen or converted to a suitable format for any of the various printers for which a device driver existed (printer support was generally not an operating system feature at the time that TeX was created). Knuth has said that there is nothing inherent in TeX that requires DVI as the output format, and later versions of TeX, notably pdfTeX, XeTeX, and LuaTeX, all support output directly to PDF.

===Mathematical example===
TeX provides a different text syntax specifically for mathematical formulas. For example, the quadratic formula (which is the solution of the quadratic equation) appears as:

The formula is printed in a way a person would write by hand, or typeset the equation. In a document, entering &quot;mathematics mode&quot; is done by starting with a $ symbol, then entering a formula in TeX syntax, and closing again with another of the same symbol. Knuth explained in jest that he chose the dollar sign to indicate the beginning and end of mathematical mode in plain TeX because typesetting mathematics was traditionally supposed to be expensive. &quot;Display mathematics&quot; (mathematics presented centred on a new line) is similar but uses $$ instead of a single $ symbol. For example, the above with the quadratic formula in display math:

(The examples here are not actually rendered with TeX; spacing, character sizes, and all else may differ.)

==Aspects==
The TeX software incorporates several aspects that were not available, or were of lower quality, in other typesetting programs at the time when TeX was released. Some of the innovations are based on interesting algorithms, and have led to several theses for Knuth&#x27;s students. While some of these discoveries have now been incorporated into other typesetting programs, others, such as the rules for mathematical spacing, are still unique.

===Mathematical spacing===
Since the primary goal of the TeX language is high-quality typesetting for publishers of books, Knuth gave a lot of attention to the spacing rules for mathematical formulae. He took three bodies of work that he considered to be standards of excellence for mathematical typography: the books typeset by the Addison-Wesley Publishing house (the publisher of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;) under the supervision of Hans Wolf; editions of the mathematical journal &quot;Acta Mathematica&quot; dating from around 1910; and a copy of &quot;Indagationes Mathematicae&quot;, a Dutch mathematics journal. Knuth looked closely at these printed papers to sort out and look for a set of rules for spacing. While TeX provides some basic rules and the tools needed to specify proper spacing, the exact parameters depend on the font used to typeset the formula. For example, the spacing for Knuth&#x27;s Computer Modern fonts has been precisely fine-tuned over the years and is now set; but when other fonts, such as AMS Euler, were used by Knuth for the first time, new spacing parameters had to be defined.

The typesetting of math in TeX is not without criticism, particularly with respect to technical details of the font metrics, which were designed in an era when significant attention was paid to storage requirements. This resulted in some &quot;hacks&quot; overloading some fields, which in turn required other &quot;hacks&quot;. On an aesthetics level, the rendering of radicals has also been criticized. The OpenType math font specification largely borrows from TeX, but has some new features/enhancements.

===Hyphenation and justification===
In comparison with manual typesetting, the problem of justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX, which, provided that good points for line breaking have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words to fill in the line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many line-breaking algorithms use a &quot;first-fit&quot; approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it will have on the following lines. In comparison, the &quot;total-fit&quot; line-breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers &quot;all&quot; the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.

Formally, the algorithm defines a value called &quot;badness&quot; associated with each possible line break; the badness is increased if the spaces on the line must stretch or shrink too much to make the line the correct width. Penalties are added if a breakpoint is particularly undesirable: for example, if a word must be hyphenated, if two lines in a row are hyphenated, or if a very loose line is immediately followed by a very tight line. The algorithm will then find the breakpoints that will minimize the sum of squares of the badness (including penalties) of the resulting lines. If the paragraph contains formula_1 possible breakpoints, the number of situations that must be evaluated naively is formula_2. However, by using the method of dynamic programming, the complexity of the algorithm can be brought down to formula_3 (see Big O notation). Further simplifications (for example, not testing extremely unlikely breakpoints such as a hyphenation in the first word of a paragraph, or very overfull lines) lead to an efficient algorithm whose running time is formula_4, where formula_5 is the width of a line. A similar algorithm is used to determine the best way to break paragraphs across two pages, in order to avoid widows or orphans (lines that appear alone on a page while the rest of the paragraph is on the following or preceding page). However, in general, a thesis by Michael Plass shows how the page-breaking problem can be NP-complete because of the added complication of placing figures. TeX&#x27;s line-breaking algorithm has been adopted by several other programs, such as Adobe InDesign (a desktop publishing application) and the GNU fmt Unix command line utility.

If no suitable line break can be found for a line, the system will try to hyphenate a word. The original version of TeX used a hyphenation algorithm based on a set of rules for the removal of prefixes and suffixes of words, and for deciding if it should insert a break between the two consonants in a pattern of the form vowel–consonant–consonant–vowel (which is possible most of the time). TeX82 introduced a new hyphenation algorithm, designed by Frank Liang in 1983, to assign priorities to breakpoints in letter groups. A list of hyphenation patterns is first generated automatically from a corpus of hyphenated words (a list of 50,000 words). If TeX must find the acceptable hyphenation positions in the word &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, for example, it will consider all the subwords of the extended word &quot;.encyclopedia.&quot;, where &quot;.&quot; is a special marker to indicate the beginning or end of the word. The list of subwords includes all the subwords of length 1 (&quot;.&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, etc.), of length 2 (&quot;.e&quot;, &quot;en&quot;, &quot;nc&quot;, etc.), etc., up to the subword of length 14, which is the word itself, including the markers. TeX will then look into its list of hyphenation patterns, and find subwords for which it has calculated the desirability of hyphenation at each position. In the case of our word, 11 such patterns can be matched, namely 1c4l4, 1cy, 1d4i3a, 4edi, e3dia, 2i1a, ope5d, 2p2ed, 3pedi, pedia4, y1c. For each position in the word, TeX will calculate the &quot;maximum value&quot; obtained among all matching patterns, yielding en1cy1c4l4o3p4e5d4i3a4. Finally, the acceptable positions are those indicated by an odd number, yielding the acceptable hyphenations &quot;en-cy-clo-pe-di-a&quot;. This system based on subwords allows the definition of very general patterns (such as 2i1a), with low indicative numbers (either odd or even), which can then be superseded by more specific patterns (such as 1d4i3a) if necessary. These patterns find about 90% of the hyphens in the original dictionary; more importantly, they do not insert any spurious hyphen. In addition, a list of exceptions (words for which the patterns do not predict the correct hyphenation) are included with the Plain TeX format; additional ones can be specified by the user.

===Metafont===
Metafont, not strictly part of TeX, is a font description system which allows the designer to describe characters algorithmically. It uses Bézier curves in a fairly standard way to generate the actual characters to be displayed, but Knuth devotes substantial attention to the rasterizing problem on bitmapped displays. Another thesis, by John Hobby, further explores this problem of digitizing &quot;brush trajectories&quot;. This term derives from the fact that Metafont describes characters as having been drawn by abstract brushes (and erasers). It is commonly believed that TeX is based on bitmap fonts but, in fact, these programs &quot;know&quot; nothing about the fonts that they are using other than their dimensions. It is the responsibility of the device driver to appropriately handle fonts of other types, including PostScript Type 1 and TrueType. Computer Modern (commonly known as &quot;the TeX font&quot;) is freely available in Type 1 format, as are the AMS math fonts. Users of TeX systems that output directly to PDF, such as pdfTeX, XeTeX, or LuaTeX, generally never use Metafont output at all.

===Macro language===

TeX documents are written and programmed using an unusual macro language. Broadly speaking, the running of this macro language involves expansion and execution stages which do not interact directly. Expansion includes both literal expansion of macro definitions as well as conditional branching, and execution involves such tasks as setting variables/registers and the actual typesetting process of adding glyphs to boxes.

The definition of a macro not only includes a list of commands but also the syntax of the call. It differs with most widely used lexical preprocessors like M4, in that the body of a macro gets tokenized at definition time.

The TeX macro language has been used to write larger document production systems, most notably including LaTeX and ConTeXt.

==Development==
The original source code for the current TeX software is written in WEB, a mixture of documentation written in TeX and a Pascal subset in order to ensure readability and portability. For example, TeX does all of its dynamic allocation itself from fixed-size arrays and uses only fixed-point arithmetic for its internal calculations. As a result, TeX has been ported to almost all operating systems, usually by using the web2c program to convert the source code into C instead of directly compiling the Pascal code. Knuth has kept a very detailed log of all the bugs he has corrected and changes he has made in the program since 1982; , the list contains 440 entries, not including the version modification that should be done after his death as the final change in TeX. Knuth offers monetary awards to people who find and report a bug in TeX. The award per bug started at US$2.56 (one &quot;hexadecimal dollar&quot;) and doubled every year until it was frozen at its current value of $327.68. Knuth has lost relatively little money as there have been very few bugs claimed. In addition, recipients have been known to frame their check as proof that they found a bug in TeX rather than cashing it.

Due to scammers finding scanned copies of his checks on the internet and using them to try to drain his bank account, Knuth no longer sends out real checks, but those who submit bug reports can get credit at The Bank of San Serriffe instead.

==Distributions and extensions==
TeX is usually provided in the form of an easy-to-install bundle of TeX itself along with Metafont and all the necessary fonts, documents formats, and utilities needed to use the typesetting system. On UNIX-compatible systems, including Linux and Apple macOS, TeX is distributed as part of the larger TeX Live distribution. (Prior to TeX Live, the teTeX distribution was the de facto standard on UNIX-compatible systems.) On Microsoft Windows, there is the MiKTeX distribution (enhanced by proTeXt) and the Microsoft Windows version of TeX Live.

Several document processing systems are based on TeX, notably jadeTeX, which uses TeX as a backend for printing from James Clark&#x27;s DSSSL Engine, the Arbortext publishing system, and Texinfo, the GNU documentation processing system. TeX has been the official typesetting package for the GNU operating system since 1984.

Numerous extensions and companion programs for TeX exist, among them BibTeX for bibliographies (distributed with LaTeX); pdfTeX, a TeX-compatible engine which can directly produce PDF output (as well as continuing to support the original DVI output); XeTeX, a TeX-compatible engine that supports Unicode and OpenType; and LuaTeX, a Unicode-aware extension to TeX that includes a Lua runtime with extensive hooks into the underlying TeX routines and algorithms. Most TeX extensions are available for free from CTAN, the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network.

===Editors===
There are a variety of editors designed to work with TeX:

# The TeXmacs text editor is a WYSIWYG-WYSIWYM scientific text editor, inspired by both TeX and Emacs. It uses Knuth&#x27;s fonts and can generate TeX output.
#Overleaf is a partial-WYSIWYG, online editor that provides a cloud-based solution to TeX along with additional features in real-time collaborative editing.
# LyX is a WYSIWYM document processor which runs on a variety of platforms including: 
## Linux, 
## Microsoft Windows (newer versions require Windows 2000 or later) 
## Apple macOS (using a non-native Qt front-end). 
# TeXShop (for macOS), TeXworks (for Linux, macOS and Windows) and WinShell (for Windows) are similar tools and provide an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with LaTeX or TeX. For KDE/Qt, Kile provides such an IDE. 
# Texmaker is the Pure Qt equivalent of Kile, with a user interface that is nearly the same as Kile&#x27;s.
# TeXstudio is an open-source fork (2009) of Texmaker that offers a different approach to configurability and features. Free downloadable binaries are provided for Windows, Linux, macOS, OS/2, and FreeBSD.
# GNU Emacs has various built-in and third-party packages with support for TeX, the major one being AUCTeX. 
# Visual Studio Code. A notable extension is LaTeX Workshop
# For Vim, possible plugins include Vim-LaTeX Suite, Automatic TeX, and TeX-9. 
# For Apache OpenOffice and LibreOffice, iMath and TexMaths extensions can provide mathematical TeX typesetting.
# For MediaWiki, the provides mathematical TeX typesetting, but the code needs to be surrounded by codice_5 tag.

===Licence===
Donald Knuth has indicated several times that the source code of TeX has been placed into the &quot;public domain&quot;, and he strongly encourages modifications or experimentations with this source code. However, since Knuth highly values the reproducibility of the output of all versions of TeX, any changed version must not be called TeX, or anything confusingly similar. To enforce this rule, any implementation of the system must pass a test suite called the TRIP test before being allowed to be called TeX. The question of licence is somewhat confused by the statements included at the beginning of the TeX source code, which indicate that &quot;all rights are reserved. Copying of this file is authorized only if ... you make absolutely no changes to your copy&quot;. This restriction should be interpreted as a prohibition to change the source code &quot;as long as the file is called tex.web&quot;. The copyright note at the beginning of tex.web (and mf.web) was changed in 2021 to explicitly state this. This interpretation is confirmed later in the source code when the TRIP test is mentioned (&quot;If this program is changed, the resulting system should not be called &#x27;TeX). The American Mathematical Society tried in the early 1980s to claim a trademark for TeX. This was rejected because at the time &quot;TEX&quot; (all caps) was registered by Honeywell for the &quot;Text EXecutive&quot; text processing system.

=== XML publication ===
It is possible to use TeX for automatic generation of sophisticated layout for XML data. The differences in syntax between the two description languages can be overcome with the help of TeXML. In the context of XML publication, TeX can thus be considered an alternative to XSL-FO. TeX allowed scientific papers in mathematical disciplines to be reduced to relatively small files that could be rendered client-side, allowing fully typeset scientific papers to be exchanged over the early Internet and emerging World Wide Web, even when sending large files was difficult. This paved the way for the creation of repositories of scientific papers such as arXiv, through which papers could be &#x27;published&#x27; without an intermediary publisher.

==Pronunciation and spelling==
The name TeX is intended by its developer to be pronounced , with the final consonant of &quot;loch.&quot; The letters of the name are meant to represent the capital Greek letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as TeX is an abbreviation of τέχνη ( ), Greek for both &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;, which is also the root word of &quot;technical&quot;. English speakers often pronounce it , like the first syllable of &quot;technical&quot;. Knuth instructs that it be typeset with the &quot;E&quot; below the baseline and reduced spacing between the letters. This is done, as Knuth mentions in his &quot;TeXbook&quot;, to distinguish TeX from other system names such as TEX, the Text EXecutive processor (developed by Honeywell Information Systems). Fans like to proliferate names from the word &quot;TeX&quot;—such as &quot;TeXnician&quot; (user of TeX software), &quot;TeXhacker&quot; (TeX programmer), &quot;TeXmaster&quot; (competent TeX programmer), &quot;TeXhax&quot;, and &quot;TeXnique&quot;.

==Community==
Notable entities in the TeX community include the TeX Users Group (TUG), which currently publishes &quot;TUGboat&quot; and formerly published &quot;The PracTeX Journal&quot;, covering a wide range of topics in digital typography relevant to TeX. The Deutschsprachige Anwendervereinigung TeX (DANTE) is a large user group in Germany. The TeX Users Group was founded in 1980 for educational and scientific purposes, provides an organization for those who have an interest in typography and font design, and are users of the TeX typesetting system invented by Knuth. The TeX Users Group represents the interests of TeX users worldwide. The TeX Users Group publishes the journal &quot;TUGboat&quot; three times per year; DANTE publishes &quot;&quot; four times per year. Other user groups include DK-TUG in Denmark, in France, GuIT in Italy, NTG in the Netherlands and UK-TUG in the United Kingdom; the user groups jointly maintain a complete list.

<text>A tradition is a system of beliefs or behaviors (folk custom) passed down within a group of people or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past. A component of cultural expressions and folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers&#x27; wigs or military officers&#x27; spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social media norms and behaviors such as greeting someone, etc. Traditions can persist Neli and evolve for thousands of years— the word &quot;tradition&quot; itself derives from the Latin language word &quot;tradere&quot; literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is reportedly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether it be political or spiritual or educational cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.

The phrase &quot;according to tradition&quot; or &quot;by tradition&quot; usually means that the information that follows is known through oral tradition, and is supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, artefacts, or other reliable evidence. &quot;Tradition&quot; refers to the quality or origin of the information being discussed. For example, &quot;According to academic tradition, we know the facts were born on Chios, and Who is the professional, and so on. This academic tradition may in usually proven. In another hands there&#x27;s people on the websites who tried to confusing and used other people methods without the knowledge and without permission and this is our era problem.

Traditions are subject of study in several academic fields of learning, especially in the humanities and social sciences, such as anthropology, Neli, history, and sociology.
The conceptualization of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer&#x27;s own preferences. A host of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts and initiatives have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.

==Definition==

The English word &quot;tradition&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;traditio&quot; via French, the noun from the verb &quot;tradere&quot; (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in Roman law to refer to the concept of legal transfers and inheritance. According to Anthony Giddens and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the Enlightenment period, in opposition to modernity and progress.

As with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition. The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the other, and are performed or believed in the present.

Tradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are Prehistoric, with lost or origins, existing from &quot;time immemorial&quot;. Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a writing system. Tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme, epic stories and alliteration. The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an oral tradition. Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been &quot;invented&quot; by humans) at some point. Traditions are often presumed to be ancient, unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less &quot;natural&quot; than is presumed. It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional. Some traditions were deliberately introduced for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution or truth. Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition. Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the other being seen as significant. Thus, those carrying out the traditions will not be consciously aware of the change, and even if a tradition undergoes major changes over many generations, it will be seen as unchanged.

There are various origins and fields of tradition; they can refer to:
# the forms of artistic heritage of a particular culture.
# beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments, such as national anthems and national holidays, such as Federal holidays in the United States.
# beliefs or customs maintained by religious denominations and Church bodies that share history, customs, culture, and, to some extent, body of teachings. For example, one can speak of Islam&#x27;s tradition or Christianity&#x27;s tradition.

Many objects, beliefs and customs can be traditional. Rituals of social interaction can be traditional, with phrases and gestures such as saying &quot;thank you&quot;, sending birth announcements, greeting cards, etc. Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups (family traditions at Christmas), organizations (company&#x27;s picnic) or societies, such as the practice of national and public holidays. Some of the oldest traditions include monotheism (three millennia) and citizenship (two millennia). It can also include material objects, such as buildings, works of art or tools.

Tradition is often used as an adjective, in contexts such as traditional music, traditional medicine, traditional values and others. In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations.

==Invention of tradition==

The term &quot;invention of tradition&quot;, introduced by E. J. Hobsbawm, refers to situations when a new practice or object is introduced in a manner that implies a connection with the past that is not necessarily present. A tradition may be deliberately created and promulgated for personal, commercial, political, or national self-interest, as was done in colonial Africa; or it may be adopted rapidly based on a single highly publicized event, rather than developing and spreading organically in a population, as in the case of the white wedding dress, which only became popular after Queen Victoria wore a white gown at her wedding to Albert of Saxe-Coburg.

An example of an invention of tradition is the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster (location of the British Parliament) in the Gothic style. Similarly, most of the traditions associated with monarchy of the United Kingdom, seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century. Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces. Requiring legitimacy, the colonial power would often invent a &quot;tradition&quot; which they could use to legitimize their own position. For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.

Invented traditions are central components of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism. Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see national dish). Expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.

==In scholarly discourse==
In science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author&#x27;s thoughts to that of his or her field. In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a &quot;rational theory of tradition&quot; applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it. Unlike myth, which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper. For Thomas Kuhn, who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.

Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in social sciences—chiefly anthropology, archaeology, and biology—with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, psychology and sociology. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, Edward Shils explored the concept in detail. Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, &quot;tradition&quot; has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.

Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.

===Anthropology===
Tradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of &quot;tradition in traditional societies&quot;. There is however no &quot;theory of tradition&quot;, as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical). There are however dissenting views; scholars such as Pascal Boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.

===Archaeology===
In archaeology, the term &quot;tradition&quot; is a set of cultures or industries which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of American archaeology.

===Biology===
Biologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as &quot;a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners&quot;, and has been called a precursor to &quot;culture&quot; in the anthropological sense.

Behavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.

===Musicology and ethnomusicology===

In the field of musicology and ethnomusicology tradition refers to the belief systems, repertoire, techniques, style and culture that is passed down through subsequent generations. Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns. Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time.
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being &#x27;the scholarly study of music&#x27; they differ in their methodology and subject of research. &#x27;Tradition, or traditions, can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective.&#x27;

===Sociology===
The concept of tradition, in early sociological research (around the turn of the 19th and 20th century), referred to that of the traditional society, as contrasted by the more modern industrial society. This approach was most notably portrayed in Max Weber&#x27;s concepts of traditional authority and modern rational-legal authority. In more modern works, One hundred years later, sociology sees tradition as a social construct used to contrast past with the present and as a form of rationality used to justify certain course of action.

Traditional society is characterized by lack of distinction between family and business, division of labor influenced primarily by age, gender, and status, high position of custom in the system of values, self-sufficiency, preference to saving and accumulation of capital instead of productive investment, relative autarky. Early theories positing the simple, unilineal evolution of societies from traditional to industrial model are now seen as too simplistic.

In 1981, Edward Shils in his book &quot;Tradition&quot; put forward a definition of tradition that became universally accepted. According to Shils, tradition is anything which is transmitted or handed down from the past to the present.

Another important sociological aspect of tradition is the one that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book &quot;Action&quot;. In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as &quot;it has always been that way&quot;. This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or &quot;argumentum ad antiquitatem&quot;), which takes the form &quot;this is right because we&#x27;ve always done it this way.&quot; In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the &quot;tradition&quot; being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.

===Philosophy===

The idea of tradition is important in philosophy. Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an &#x27;analytic&#x27; tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a &#x27;continental&#x27; tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following Martin Heidegger, call &#x27;the tradition&#x27;, which began with Plato and Aristotle. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of Aristotelianism. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by Alasdair MacIntyre. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of &#x27;the tradition&#x27;, instead posing Aristotelianism as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.

==In political and religious discourse==

The concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values. Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition, although &quot;tradition&quot; or its plural can also refer simply to the core teaching of religious group: thus Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:2 refers to &quot;the traditions, even as I delivered them to you&quot;.

The term &quot;traditionalist Catholic&quot; refers to those, such as Archbishop Lefebvre, who want the worship and practices of the Church to be as they were before the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65. Likewise, Sunni Muslims are referred to as &quot;Ahl el-Sunnah wa Al-Jamā‘ah&quot; (), literally &quot;people of the tradition [of Muhammad] and the community&quot;, emphasizing their attachment to religious and cultural tradition.

More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum, with right-wing parties having a stronger affinity to certain ways of the past than left-wing ones. Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply &quot;traditionalism&quot;), which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, hierarchy and organic unity, agrarianism, classicism and high culture, and the intersecting spheres of loyalty. Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, but promote cultural and educational renewal, and revive interest in the Church, the family, the State and local community. This view has been criticised for including in its notion of tradition practices which are no longer considered to be desirable, for example, stereotypical views of the place of women in domestic affairs.

In other societies, especially ones experiencing rapid social change, the idea of what is &quot;traditional&quot; may be widely contested, with different groups striving to establish their own values as the legitimate traditional ones. Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be the means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another.

==In artistic discourse==

In artistic contexts, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer&#x27;s preferences. It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional. For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to &quot;creativity&quot;, with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to fine art, which is valued for being original and unique. More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression.

==Relationship to other concepts==
In the social sciences, &quot;tradition&quot; is often contrasted with &quot;modernity&quot;, particularly in terms of whole societies. This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern. Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing filial piety, harmony and group welfare, stability, and interdependence, while a society exhibiting modernity would value &quot;individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress.&quot; Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition. Gusfield and others, though, criticize this dichotomy as oversimplified, arguing that tradition is dynamic, heterogeneous, and coexists successfully with modernity even within individuals.

Tradition should be differentiated from &quot;customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules&quot; and similar concepts. Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change. Whereas justification for tradition is ideological, the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical. Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose. For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional.

==Preservation==

The legal protection of tradition includes a number of international agreements and national laws. In addition to the fundamental protection of cultural property, there is also cooperation between the United Nations, UNESCO and Blue Shield International in the protection or recording of traditions and customs. The protection of culture and traditions is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally.

In many countries, concerted attempts are being made to preserve traditions that are at risk of being lost. A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups. Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved. Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as Cornish under the auspices of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Specifically, the charter holds that these languages &quot;contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe&#x27;s cultural wealth and traditions&quot;. The Charter goes on to call for &quot;the use or adoption... of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages&quot;. Similarly, UNESCO includes both &quot;oral tradition&quot; and &quot;traditional manifestations&quot; in its definition of a country&#x27;s cultural properties and heritage. So therefore it works to preserve tradition in countries such as Brazil.

In Japan, certain artworks, structures, craft techniques and performing arts are considered by the Japanese government to be a precious legacy of the Japanese people, and are protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. This law also identifies people skilled at traditional arts as &quot;National Living Treasures&quot;, and encourages the preservation of their craft.

For native peoples like the Māori in New Zealand, there is conflict between the fluid identity assumed as part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.

==Traditional cultural expressions==

The phrase &quot;traditional cultural expressions&quot; is used by the World Intellectual Property Organization to refer to &quot;any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance.&quot;

<text>The Boston Globe, also known locally as the Globe, is an American daily newspaper founded and based in Boston, Massachusetts. The newspaper has won a total of 27 Pulitzer Prizes. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; is the oldest and largest daily newspaper in Boston and tenth-largest newspaper by print circulation in the nation as of 2023.

Founded in 1872, the paper was mainly controlled by Irish Catholic interests before being sold to Charles H. Taylor and his family. After being privately held until 1973, it was sold to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1993 for $1.1billion, making it one of the most expensive print purchases in United States history. The newspaper was purchased in 2013 by Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry for $70million from The New York Times Company, having lost over 90% of its value in 20 years. The chief print rival of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; is the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, whose circulation is smaller and is shrinking faster.

The newspaper is &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s most prestigious papers&quot;. In 1967, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; became the first major paper in the U.S. to oppose the Vietnam War. The paper&#x27;s 2002 coverage of the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal received international media attention and served as the basis for the 2015 American drama film &quot;Spotlight&quot;. Since February 2023, the editor has been Nancy Barnes.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was founded in 1872 by six Boston businessmen who jointly invested $150,000 (). The founders included Eben Dyer Jordan of the Jordan Marsh department store, and Cyrus Wakefield of the Wakefield Rattan Company and namesake of the town of Wakefield, Massachusetts. The first issue was published on March 4, 1872, and sold for four cents (). In August 1873, Jordan hired Charles H. Taylor as temporary business manager; in December, Taylor signed a contract to be general manager of the paper for two years. He would serve as the first publisher of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; until his death in 1921, and was succeeded by four of his descendants until 1999.

Originally a morning daily, the &quot;Globe&quot; began its Sunday edition in 1877. A weekly edition called The Boston Weekly Globe, catering to mail subscribers outside the city, was published from 1873 until it was absorbed by the Sunday edition in 1892. In 1878, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; started an afternoon edition called The Boston Evening Globe, which ceased publication in 1979. By the 1890s, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; had become a stronghold, with an editorial staff dominated by Irish American Catholics.

===20th century===

In 1912, the &quot;Globe&quot; was one of a cooperative of four newspapers, including the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, &quot;The New York Globe&quot;, and the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;, to form the Associated Newspapers syndicate.

In the early 1900&#x27;s Charles H. Taylor was responsible for making the Globe the most used Newspaper in New England. He went into greater details regarding social movements such as the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement. While other competitors such as &quot;The Boston Post&quot; did not shine as much light on these social movements.

In the 1940 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, the &quot;Globe&quot; correctly projected the re-election of Republican incumbent Leverett Saltonstall, using methods first established by Taylor; rival &quot;The Boston Post&quot; called the race incorrectly for Democrat Paul A. Dever.

In 1955, Laurence L. Winship was named editor, ending a 75-year period of the role being held by the paper&#x27;s publishers. In the next decade, the &quot;Globe&quot; rose from third to first in the competitive field of what was then eight Boston newspapers.

In 1958, the &quot;Globe&quot; moved from its original location on Washington Street in downtown Boston to Morrissey Boulevard in the Dorchester neighborhood.

In 1965, Thomas Winship succeeded his father as editor. The younger Winship transformed the &quot;Globe&quot; from a mediocre local paper into a regional paper of national distinction. He served as editor until 1984, during which time the paper won a dozen Pulitzer Prizes, the first in the paper&#x27;s history.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was a private company until 1973 when it went public under the name Affiliated Publications. It continued to be managed by the descendants of Charles Taylor. In 1993, The New York Times Company purchased Affiliated Publications for US$1.1billion, making &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; a wholly owned subsidiary of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ parent. The Jordan and Taylor families received substantial The New York Times Company stock, but by 1999 the last Taylor family members had left management.

Boston.com, the online edition of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, was launched on the World Wide Web in 1995. Consistently ranked among the top ten newspaper websites in America, it has won numerous national awards and took two regional Emmy Awards in 2009 for its video work.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; has consistently been ranked in the forefront of American journalism. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed it as one of the ten best US daily newspapers in 1974 and 1984, and the &quot;Globe&quot; tied for sixth in a national survey of top editors who chose &quot;America&#x27;s Best Newspapers&quot; in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; in 1999.

===21st century===
Under two editors, Martin Baron and then Brian McGrory, the &quot;Globe&quot; shifted away from coverage of international news in favor of Boston-area news. 

&quot;Globe&quot; reporters Michael Rezendes, Matt Carroll, Sacha Pfeiffer and Walter Robinson, and editor Ben Bradlee Jr. were instrumental in uncovering the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal in 2001–2003, especially in relation to Massachusetts churches. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for their work and the work of other staff, one of several the paper has received for its investigative journalism, and their work was dramatized in the 2015 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Spotlight&quot;, named after the paper&#x27;s in-depth investigative division.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; was the paper that allowed Peter Gammons to start his &quot;Notes&quot; section on baseball, which has become a mainstay in many major newspapers nationwide. In 2004, Gammons became the 56th recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing, given by the BBWAA; he was honored at the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 31, 2005.

In 2007, Charlie Savage, whose reports on President Bush&#x27;s use of signing statements made national news, won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.

On April 2, 2009, The New York Times Company threatened to close the paper if its unions did not agree to $20 million of cost savings. Some of the cost savings include reducing union employees&#x27; pay by 5%, ending pension contributions, ending certain employees&#x27; tenures. 

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; eliminated the equivalent of 50 full-time jobs; among buy-outs and layoffs, it swept out most of the part-time employees in the editorial sections. However, early on the morning of May 5, 2009, The New York Times Company announced it had reached a tentative deal with the Boston Newspaper Guild, which represents most of the &quot;Globe&quot; editorial staff, that allowed it to get the concessions it demanded. The paper&#x27;s other three major unions had agreed to concessions on May 3, 2009, after The New York Times Company threatened to give the government 60 days&#x27; notice that it intended to close the paper. Despite the cuts helping to &quot;significantly [improve]&quot; its financial performance by October of that year, the &quot;Globe&quot; parent company indicated that it was considering strategic alternatives for the paper, but did not plan to sell it.

As of 2010, the &quot;Globe&quot; hosted 28 blogs covering a variety of topics, including Boston sports, local politics, and a blog made up of posts from the paper&#x27;s opinion writers.

In September 2011, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; launched a dedicated, subscription-based website at bostonglobe.com.

Starting in 2012, the &quot;Globe&quot; provided a printing and circulating service for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, and by 2013, was handling its rival&#x27;s entire press run. This arrangement remained in place until 2018, ending after the acquisition of the &quot;Herald&quot; by Digital First Media.

In February 2013, The New York Times Company announced that it would sell its New England Media Group, which encompasses the &quot;Globe&quot;; bids were received by six parties, including John Gormally, then-owner of WGGB-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts, another group included members of former &quot;Globe&quot; publishers, the Taylor family, and Boston Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry, who bid for the paper through the New England Sports Network, which was majority owned by Fenway Sports Group and the Boston Bruins. However, after the NESN group dropped out of the running to buy the paper, Henry made his separate bid to purchase the &quot;Globe&quot; in July 2013. 

On October 24, 2013, he took ownership of the &quot;Globe&quot;, at a $70million purchase price, and renamed the venture Boston Globe Media. 

On January 30, 2014, Henry named himself publisher and named Mike Sheehan, a prominent former Boston ad executive, to be CEO. , Doug Franklin replaced Mike Sheehan as CEO, then Franklin resigned after six months in the position, in July 2017, as a result of strategic conflicts with owner Henry.

In July 2016, the 815,000-square-foot headquarters in Dorchester was sold to an unknown buyer for an undisclosed price. The &quot;Globe&quot; moved its printing operations in June 2017 to Myles Standish Industrial Park in Taunton, Massachusetts. Also in June 2017, the &quot;Globe&quot; moved its headquarters to Exchange Place in Boston&#x27;s Financial District.

In July 2022, James Dao, a senior editor with 30 years of experience at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was named the editorial page editor, succeeding Bina Venkataraman.

In November 2022, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; announced that NPR news chief Nancy Barnes would replace Brian McGrory as editor.

From September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2023, &quot;the Globe&quot;″s combined print and digital circulation for weekdays increased by 2.7%, to 346,944, and for Sundays it rose by 1.3%, to 408,974. There are more than 245,000 digital-only subscriptions, an increase of about 10,000 since February 2022.

==Editorial pages==

Starting with the Sunday edition in 1891, and expanded to weekday editions in 1913, each lead editorial in the &quot;Globe&quot; was signed &quot;Uncle Dudley&quot;, a practice ended by editor Thomas Winship in 1966.

In March 1980, the &quot;Globe&quot; published an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter, which included the accidental headline &quot;Mush from the Wimp&quot; during part of the press run, drawing national attention.

Since 1981, the editorial pages of the &quot;Globe&quot; have been separate from the news operation, as is frequently customary in the news industry. Editorials represent the official view of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as a community institution. The publisher reserves the right to veto an editorial and usually determines political endorsements for high office.

The &quot;Globe&quot; made its first political endorsement in 1967, supporting Kevin White in that year&#x27;s Boston mayoral election. The &quot;Globe&quot; has consistently endorsed Democratic presidential candidates, such as Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, but has sometimes endorsed Republicans in state and local elections, such as Charlie Baker for governor.

Describing the political position of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; editorial page in 2001, former editorial page editor Renée Loth told the Boston University alumni magazine:

The &quot;Globe&quot; has a long tradition of being a progressive institution, and especially on social issues. We support woman&#x27;s rights; We are pro-choice; we&#x27;re against the death penalty; we&#x27;re for gay rights. But if people read us carefully, they will find that on a whole series of other issues, we are not knee-jerk. We&#x27;re for charter schools; we&#x27;re for any number of business-backed tax breaks. We are a lot more nuanced and subtle than that liberal stereotype does justice to.

James Dao became the editorial page editor in 2022.

===August 2018 campaign===
In August 2018, the editorial board launched a coordinated campaign for newspapers nationwide to respond to President Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;enemy of the people&quot; attacks and &quot;fake news&quot; rants against the media by publishing locally produced editorial responses on Thursday, August 16. Within a couple of days, an estimated 100+ newspapers had pledged to join the campaign, jumping to roughly 200 a few days later.

On August 13, the Radio Television Digital News Association and its Voice of the First Amendment Task Force encouraged its 1,200 member organizations to join the campaign, while other media organizations also helped spread the call to action. Even as some right-leaning outlets portrayed the &quot;Globe&quot;″s campaign as an attack on the president, rather than his rhetorical attacks on the Fourth Estate, some newspapers got a head start, releasing content on August 15, while 350 newspapers participated in the event on August 16.

From August 10 to 22, approximately 14 threatening phone calls were made to &quot;Boston Globe&quot; offices. The caller stated that the &quot;Globe&quot; was the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; and threatened to kill newspaper employees. On August 30, California resident Robert Chain was arrested by an FBI SWAT team and charged with a single count of making a threatening communication in interstate commerce. In May 2019, Chain pleaded guilty in a US federal court to seven counts of making threatening communications in interstate commerce.

===Editors===
The &quot;Globe&quot; uses &quot;editor&quot; as the highest title; other newspapers may call this role editor-in-chief. The role of editor was held by three people in the earliest years of the paper, then from 1880 to 1955 by the publishers. The extended period of a publisher-editor ended in 1955, when Laurence L. Winship was named editor by publisher William Davis Taylor. Winship became the paper&#x27;s top editor following the death of James Morgan, longtime &quot;de facto&quot; executive editor. Morgan had joined the &quot;Globe&quot; in January 1884, hired by Charles H. Taylor.

==Incidents of fabrication and plagiarism==
In 1998, columnist Patricia Smith was forced to resign after it was discovered that she had fabricated people and quotations in several of her columns. In August of that year, columnist Mike Barnicle was discovered to have copied material for a column from a George Carlin book, &quot;Brain Droppings&quot;. He was suspended for this offense, and his past columns were reviewed. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; editors found that Barnicle had fabricated a story about two cancer patients, and Barnicle was forced to resign. Columnist Jeff Jacoby was suspended by the &quot;Globe&quot; in 2000 for failing to credit non-original content used in his column.

In 2004, the &quot;Globe&quot; apologized for printing graphic photographs that the article represented as showing U.S. soldiers raping Iraqi women during the Iraq War from a city councilor&#x27;s presentation before they were verified. The photos had already been found by other news organizations to be from an internet pornography site.

In the spring of 2005, the &quot;Globe&quot; retracted a story describing the events of a seal hunt near Halifax, Nova Scotia, that took place on April 12, 2005. Written by freelancer Barbara Stewart, a former &quot;New York Times&quot; staffer, the article described the specific number of boats involved in the hunt and graphically described the killing of seals and the protests that accompanied it. In reality, weather had delayed the hunt, which had not yet begun the day the story had been filed, proving that the details were fabricated.

Columnist Kevin Cullen was suspended by the &quot;Globe&quot; in 2018 for embellishing claims he made on radio and in public appearances related to the Boston Marathon bombing.

==Websites==
&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; maintains two distinct major websites: BostonGlobe.com is a subscriber-supported site with a paywall and content from the printed paper; and Boston.com, one of the first regional news portals, is supported by advertising. Between September 2011 and March 2014, the &quot;Globe&quot; gradually withdrew stories written by &quot;Globe&quot; journalists from Boston.com, making the sites more and more separated. BostonGlobe.com was designed to emphasize a premium experience focusing on content and emulating the visual appearance of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; newspaper; the site was one of the first major websites to use a responsive design that automatically adapts its layout to a device&#x27;s screen size. Boston.com followed suit in 2014. The two sites are aimed towards different readers; while Boston.com became targeted towards &quot;casual&quot; readers and local content, the new &quot;Boston Globe&quot; website is targeted towards the audience of the paper itself.

In 2012, the Society for News Design selected BostonGlobe.com as the world&#x27;s best-designed news website.

=== Digital subscriptions ===

The &quot;Globe&quot; had 226,000 digital subscribers as of December 2021, among the highest of any metro newspapers in the country.

Boston Globe Media Partners, which owns the &quot;Globe&quot;, operates a number of websites covering certain niche subjects. The sites share many resources, like office space, with the &quot;Globe&quot;, but are often branded separately from the newspaper:
*Boston.com is a regional website that offers news and information about the Boston, Massachusetts area.
*Loveletters.boston.com is a love advice column run by Meredith Goldstein, an advice columnist and entertainment reporter for &quot;The Boston Globe.&quot;
*Realestate.boston.com is a regional website that offers advice on buying, selling, home improvement, and design with expert advice, insider neighborhood knowledge, the latest listings to buy or rent, and a window into the world of luxury living.

===Crux===

&quot;Crux&quot; was launched by the &quot;Globe&quot; in September 2014 to focus on news related to the Catholic Church. At the end of March 2016, &quot;The Globe&quot; ended its association with &quot;Crux&quot;, transferring ownership of the website to the &quot;Crux&quot; staff. With John L. Allen Jr. as the new editor, &quot;Crux&quot; received sponsorship from the Knights of Columbus and several Catholic dioceses.

===Stat===

&quot;Stat&quot;, launched in 2015, covers health, medicine and life sciences, with a particular focus on the biotechnology industry based in and around Boston. &quot;Stat&quot; employs journalists in Boston, Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco.

===The Emancipator===

&quot;The Emancipator&quot;, launched in 2022 in partnership with Boston University, covers racial justice. The &quot;Globe&quot;″s involvement ended in March 2023.

<text>T, or t, is the twentieth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is &quot;tee&quot; (pronounced ), plural &quot;tees&quot;.

It is derived from the Semitic Taw 𐤕 of the Phoenician and Paleo-Hebrew script (Aramaic and Hebrew Taw ת/𐡕/, Syriac Taw ܬ, and Arabic ت Tāʼ) via the Greek letter τ (tau). In English, it is most commonly used to represent the voiceless alveolar plosive, a sound it also denotes in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It is the most commonly used consonant and the second-most commonly used letter in English-language texts.

==History==

&quot;Taw&quot; was the last letter of the Western Semitic and Hebrew alphabets. The sound value of Semitic &quot;Taw&quot;, the Greek alphabet Tαυ (&quot;Tau&quot;), Old Italic and Latin T has remained fairly constant, representing in each of these, and it has also kept its original basic shape in most of these alphabets.

==Use in writing systems==
===English===
In English, usually denotes the voiceless alveolar plosive ( and X-SAMPA: ), as in &quot;tart&quot;, &quot;tee&quot;, or &quot;ties&quot;, often with aspiration at the beginnings of words or before stressed vowels. The letter corresponds to the affricate in some words as a result of yod-coalescence (for example, in words ending in -&quot;ture&quot;, such as &quot;future&quot;).

A common digraph is , which usually represents a dental fricative, but occasionally represents (as in &quot;Thomas&quot; and &quot;thyme&quot;). The digraph often corresponds to the sound (a voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant) word-medially when followed by a vowel, as in &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;ratio&quot;, &quot;negotiation&quot;, and &quot;Croatia&quot;.

In a few words of modern French origin, the letter T is silent at the end of a word; these include &quot;croquet&quot; and &quot;debut&quot;.

===Other languages===
In the orthographies of other languages, is often used for , the voiceless dental plosive , or similar sounds.

===Other systems===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, denotes the voiceless alveolar plosive.

<doc id="30072" wikidata="Q36303" url="?curid=30072" title="Thales of Miletus">
<text>Thales of Miletus ( ; ; ) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from Miletus in Ionia, Asia Minor. Thales was one of the Seven Sages, founding figures of Ancient Greece.

Beginning in eighteenth-century historiography, many came to regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, breaking from the prior use of mythology to explain the world and instead using natural philosophy. He is thus otherwise referred to as the first to have engaged in mathematics, science, and deductive reasoning.

Thales&#x27; view that all of nature is based on the existence of a single ultimate substance, which he theorized to be water, was widely influential among the philosophers of his time. Thales thought the Earth floated on water.

In mathematics, Thales is the namesake of Thales&#x27;s theorem, and the intercept theorem can also be known as Thales&#x27;s theorem. Thales was said to have calculated the heights of the pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. In science, Thales was an astronomer who reportedly predicted the weather and a solar eclipse. The discovery of the position of the constellation Ursa Major is also attributed to Thales, as well as the timings of the solstices and equinoxes. He was also an engineer, known for having diverted the Halys River. Plutarch wrote that &quot;at that time, Thales alone had raised philosophy from mere practice to speculation.&quot;

==Life==
The main source concerning the details of Thales&#x27;s life and career is the doxographer Diogenes Laërtius, in his third-century-AD work &quot;Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers&quot;. While it is all we have, Diogenes wrote some eight centuries after Thales&#x27;s death and his sources often contained &quot;unreliable or even fabricated information&quot;. It is known Thales was from Miletus, a mercantile city settled at the mouth of the Maeander river, near modern Didim, Turkey.

The dates of Thales&#x27;s life are not exactly known, but are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources. According to the historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC. Assuming one&#x27;s (or ) occurred at the age of 40, the chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens, written during the 2nd century BC, therefore placed Thales&#x27;s birth about the year 625 BC.

=== Ancestry and family ===
While the probability is that Thales was as Greek as most Milesians, Herodotus described Thales as &quot;a Phoenician by remote descent&quot;. Diogenes Laërtius references Herodotus, Duris, and Democritus, who all agree &quot;that Thales was the son of Examyas and Cleobulina, and belonged to the Thelidae who are Phoenicians and amongst the noblest descendants of Cadmus and Agenor&quot; who had been banished from Phoenicia and that Thales was enrolled as a citizen in Miletus along with Neleus.

However, Friedrich Nietzsche and others interpret this quote as meaning only that his ancestors were seafaring Cadmeians from Boeotia. It is also possible that he was of mixed ancestry, given his father had a Carian name and his mother had a Greek name. Diogenes Laërtius seems to also reference an alternative account: &quot;Most writers, however, represent him as a genuine Milesian and of a distinguished family&quot;. &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; (1952) concluded that Thales was most likely a native Milesian of noble birth and that he was certainly a Greek.

Diogenes continues, by delivering more conflicting reports: one that Thales married and either fathered a son (Cybisthus or Cybisthon) or adopted his nephew of the same name; the second that he never married, telling his mother as a young man that it was too early to marry, and as an older man that it was too late. Plutarch had earlier told this version: Solon visited Thales and asked him why he remained single; Thales answered that he did not like the idea of having to worry about children. Nevertheless, several years later, anxious for family, he adopted his nephew Cybisthus.

The culture of Archaic Greece was heavily influenced by those of the Levant and Mesopotamia. It is said Thales was engaged in trade and visited either Egypt or Babylonia. However, there is no strong evidence that Thales ever visited countries in the Near East, and the issue is disputed among scholars. Visits to such places were a commonplace attribution to various philosophers by later writers, especially when these writers tried to explain the origin of their mathematical knowledge, such as with Thales or Pythagoras or Eudoxus.

====Egypt====
Several ancient authors assume that Thales, at one point in his life, visited Egypt, where he learned about geometry. It is considered possible that Thales visited Egypt, since Miletus had a permanent colony there (namely Naucratis). It is also said Thales had close contacts with the priests of Thebes who instructed him, or even that he instructed &quot;them&quot; in geometry. It is also possible Thales knew about Egypt from accounts of others, without actually visiting it.

====Babylon====
Aside from Egypt, the other mathematically advanced, ancient civilization before the Greeks was Babylonia, another commonplace attribution of travel for a mathematically-minded philosopher. At least one ancient historian, Josephus, claims Thales visited Babylonia.

Historians Roger L. Cooke and B.L. Van der Waerden come down on the side of Babylonian mathematics influencing the Greeks, citing the use of e. g. the sexagesimal system (or base 60). Cooke notes &quot;This relation, however, is controversial.&quot; Others historians, such as D. R. Dicks, take issue with the idea of Babylonian influence on Greek mathematics. For until around the time of Hipparchus (c. 190–120 BC) their sexagesimal system was unknown.

Herodotus wrote the Greeks learnt the &quot;gnomon&quot; from the Babylonians. Thales&#x27;s follower Anaximander is credited with introducing the &quot;gnomon&quot; to the Greeks. Herodotus also wrote that the practice of dividing the day into 12 parts, and the &quot;polos&quot;, came to the Greeks from the Babylonians. Yet this too is disputed, for example by historian L. Zhmud, who points out the &quot;gnomon&quot; was known to both Egyptians and Babylonians, the division of the day into twelve parts (and by analogy the year) was known to the Egyptians already in the 2nd millennium BC, and the idea of the &quot;polos&quot; was not used outside of Greece at this time.

===Sagacity===
Thales is recognized as one of the Seven Sages of Greece, semi-legendary wise statesmen and founding figures of Ancient Greece. While which seven one chooses may change, the seven has a canonical four which includes Thales, Solon of Athens, Pittacus of Mytilene, and Bias of Priene. Diogenes Laërtius tells us that the Seven Sages were created in the archonship of Damasius at Athens about 582 BC and that Thales was the first sage.

The sages were associated with the Delphic maxims, a quote or maxim attributed to each one inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Thales has arguably the most famous of all, &quot;gnothi seauton&quot; or know thyself. According to the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the &quot;Suda&quot;, the proverb is both &quot;applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are&quot; and &quot;a warning to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude.&quot;

==== Golden tripod ====
Diogenes Laërtius relates several stories of an expensive, gold tripod or bowl that is to go to the most wise. In one version (that Laërtius credits to Callimachus in his &quot;Iambics&quot;) Bathycles of Arcadia states in his will that an expensive bowl should be given to him who had done most good by his wisdom.&#x27; So it was given to Thales, went the round of all the sages, and came back to Thales again. And he sent it to Apollo at Didyma, with this dedication...&#x27;Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this] to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from all the Greeks.

==== Diplomacy ====
According to Diogenes Laërtius, Thales gained fame as a counselor when he advised the Milesians not to engage in a symmachia, a &quot;fighting together&quot;, with the Lydians. This has sometimes been interpreted as an alliance.

Croesus was defeated before the city of Sardis by Cyrus the Great, who subsequently spared Miletus because it had taken no action. Cyrus was so impressed by Croesus’ wisdom and his connection with the sages that he spared him and took his advice on various matters. The Ionian cities should be demoi, or &quot;districts&quot;.

Miletus, however, received favorable terms from Cyrus. The others remained in an Ionian League of twelve cities (excluding Miletus), and were subjugated by the Persians.

== Theories and studies ==

Early Greeks, and other civilizations before them, often invoked idiosyncratic explanations of natural phenomena with reference to the will of anthropomorphic gods and heroes. Instead, Thales aimed to explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that referenced natural processes themselves— &quot;Logos&quot; rather than &quot;mythos&quot;. 

Aristotle advocated the view that Thales was the first natural philosopher (&quot;physiologoi&quot;), although this position was typically not adopted among other writers, even those within Aristotle&#x27;s Peripatetic school, until the view became more prominent among eighteenth-century historians. Also, while the other Seven Sages were strictly law-givers and statesmen and not speculative philosophers, Plutarch noted &quot;it would seem that Thales was the only wise man of the time who carried his speculations beyond the realm of the practical.&quot;

=== Water as the &quot;arche&quot; ===

Thales&#x27;s most famous idea was his philosophical and cosmological thesis that all is water, which comes down to us through a passage from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. In the work, Aristotle reported Thales&#x27;s theory that the &quot;arche&quot; or originating principle of nature was a single material substance: water. Aristotle then proceeded to proffer a number of conjectures based on his own observations to lend some credence to why Thales may have advanced this idea (though Aristotle did not hold it himself).

While Aristotle&#x27;s conjecture on why Thales held water as the originating principle of matter is his own thinking, his statement that Thales held it as water is generally accepted as genuinely originating with Thales. Writing centuries later, Diogenes Laërtius also states that Thales taught &quot;Water constituted (, &#x27;stood under&#x27;) the principle of all things.&quot;

According to Aristotle:

Aristotle further adds:

The 1870 book &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; noted:

Most agree that Thales&#x27;s stamp on thought is the unity of substance. Not merely the empirical claim that all is water, but the deeper philosophical claim that all is one. For example, Friedrich Nietzsche, in his &quot;Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks&quot;, wrote:
=== Mathematics ===
Thales was known for introducing the theoretical and practical use of geometry to Greece, and has been described as the first person in the Western world to apply deductive reasoning to geometry, making him the West&#x27;s &quot;first mathematician.&quot; He is also credited with the West&#x27;s oldest definition of number: a &quot;collection of units&quot;, &quot;following the Egyptian view&quot;.

The evidence for the primacy of Thales comes to us from a book by Proclus, who lived a thousand years afterward but is believed to have had a copy of Eudemus&#x27;s lost book &quot;History of Geometry&quot; (4th century BC). Proclus wrote that Thales was the first to visit Egypt and bring the Egyptian study of mathematics to Greece, and that Thales &quot;himself discovered many propositions and disclosed the underlying principles of many others to his successors, in some case his method being more general, in others more empirical.&quot; In addition to Proclus, Hieronymus of Rhodes (3rd century BC) also cites Thales as the first Greek mathematician.

Proclus attributes to Thales the discovery that a circle is bisected by its diameter, that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and that vertical angles are equal. Two fundamental theorems of elementary geometry are customarily called &quot;Thales&#x27;s theorem&quot;: one of them has to do with a triangle inscribed in a circle and having the circle&#x27;s diameter as one side; the other, also called the intercept theorem, is about an angle intercepted by two parallel lines, forming a pair of similar triangles.

Modern scholars are skeptical that anyone in Thales&#x27;s time was producing mathematical proofs to the standard of later Greek mathematics, though not enough direct evidence remains to draw firm conclusions. While Thales may have discovered some basic geometric relations and provided some justification for them, attribution to him of formal proofs is now thought to represent speculative rationalization and reconstruction by later authors, rather than concrete accomplishments of Thales himself or his contemporaries.

==== Vertical angles ====
According to one author, while visiting Egypt, Thales observed that when the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.

==== Right triangle inscribed in a circle ====
Pamphila says that, having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, Thales was the first to inscribe in a circle a right-angled triangle, whereupon he sacrificed an ox. This is sometimes cited as history&#x27;s first mathematical discovery. Due to the variations among testimonies, such as the story of the ox sacrifice being accredited to Pythagoras upon discovery of the Pythagorean theorem rather than Thales, some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) question whether such anecdotes have any historical worth whatsoever.

It is believed the Babylonians knew the theorem for special cases.
The theorem is mentioned and proved as part of the 31st proposition in the third book of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. Dante&#x27;s &quot;Paradiso&quot; refers to Thales&#x27;s theorem in the course of a speech.

==== Similar triangles ====

The story is told in Diogenes Laërtius, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, sourced from Hieronymus of Rhodes, that when Thales visited Egypt, he measured the height of the pyramids by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height. According to Plutarch, it pleased the pharoah Amasis. More practically, Thales was said to have the ability to measure the distances of ships at sea.

These stories indicate familiarity with the intercept theorem, and for this reason the 26th proposition in the first book of Euclid&#x27;s Elements was attributed to Thales. They also indicate that he was familiar with the Egyptian &quot;seked&quot;, or &quot;seqed&quot;, the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope (cotangent). According to Kirk &amp; Raven, all you need for this feat is three straight sticks pinned at one end and knowledge of your altitude. One stick goes vertically into the ground. A second is made level. With the third you sight the ship and calculate the &quot;seked&quot; from the height of the stick and its distance from the point of insertion to the line of sight.

=== Astronomy ===

Thales was also a noted astronomer, acknowledged in antiquity for describing the position of Ursa Minor, and he thought the constellation might be useful as a guide for navigation at sea. He calculated the duration of the year and the timings of the equinoxes and solstices. He is additionally attributed with calculating the position of the Pleiades.

Plutarch indicates that in his day (c. AD 100) there was an extant work, the &quot;Astronomy&quot;, composed in verse and attributed to Thales. While some say he left no writings, others say that he wrote &quot;On the Solstice&quot; and &quot;On the Equinox&quot;. The &quot;Nautical Star-guide&quot; has also been attributed to him, but this was disputed even in ancient times. No writing attributed to him has survived. Lobon of Argus asserted that the writings of Thales amounted to two hundred lines.

==== Cosmological model ====
Thales thought the Earth must be a flat disk or mound of land and dirt which is floating in an expanse of water. Heraclitus Homericus states that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into air, slime and earth. It seems likely that Thales viewed the land as coming from the water on which it floated and the oceans that surround it, perhaps inspired by observing silt deposits.

He thought the stars were balls of dirt on fire. He seemed to correctly gather that the moon reflects the Sun&#x27;s light. A crater on the Moon is named in his honor.

==== Meteorology ====
Rather than assuming that earthquakes were the result of supernatural whims, Thales explained them by theorizing that the Earth floats on water and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves. He is attributed with the first observation of the Hyades, supposed by the ancients to indicate the approach of rain when they rose with the Sun. According to Seneca, Thales explained the flooding of the Nile as due to the river being beaten back by the etesian wind.

===== Olive presses =====
A story, with different versions, recounts how Thales achieved riches from an olive harvest by prediction of the weather. In one version, he bought all the olive presses in Miletus after predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another version of the story has Aristotle explain that Thales had reserved presses in advance, at a discount, and could rent them out at a high price when demand peaked, following his prediction of a particularly good harvest. This first version of the story would constitute the first historically known creation and use of futures, whereas the second version would be the first historically known creation and use of options.

Aristotle explains that Thales&#x27;s objective in doing this was not to enrich himself but to prove to his fellow Milesians that philosophy could be useful, contrary to what they thought, or alternatively, Thales had made his foray into enterprise because of a personal challenge put to him by an individual who had asked why, if Thales was an intelligent famous philosopher, he had yet to attain wealth.

==== Prediction of solar eclipse ====

As mentioned above, according to Herodotus, Thales predicted a solar eclipse which occurred during a battle between the Lydians and the Medes. Among eclipses of the era, only the eclipse of 28 May 585 BC reached totality in Anatolia where the war took place. American writer Isaac Asimov described this battle as the earliest historical event whose date is known with precision to the day, and called the prediction &quot;the birth of science&quot;.

Herodotus writes that in the sixth year of the war, the Lydians under King Alyattes and the Medes under Cyaxares were engaged in an indecisive battle when suddenly day turned into night, leading to both parties halting the fighting and negotiating a peace agreement. Herodotus also mentions that the loss of daylight had been predicted by Thales. He does not, however, mention the location of the battle.

However, based on the list of Median kings and the duration of their reign reported elsewhere by Herodotus, Cyaxares died 10 years before the eclipse.

D. R. Dicks joins other historians (F. Martini, J. L. E. Dreyer, O. Neugebauer) in rejecting the historicity of the eclipse story. Dicks links the story of Thales discovering the cause for a solar eclipse with Herodotus&#x27; claim that Thales discovered the cycle of the sun with relation to the solstices, and concludes &quot;he could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians nor his immediate successors possessed.&quot;

==== Falling into a well ====

Plato, Diogenes Laertius, and Hippolytus all relay the story that Thales was so intent upon watching the stars that he failed to watch where he was walking, and fell into a well.

&quot;Thales was studying the stars and gazing into the sky, when he fell into a well, and a jolly and witty Thracian servant girl made fun of him, saying that he was crazy to know about what was up in the heavens while he could not see what was in front of him beneath his feet.&quot;
=== Engineering ===

In addition to astronomy, Thales involved himself in other practical applications of mathematics, including engineering. Another story by Herodotus is that Croesus sent his army to the Persian territory. He was stopped by the river Halys, then unbridged. Thales then got the army across the river by digging a diversion upstream so as to reduce the flow, making it possible to cross the river. While Herodotus reported that most of his fellow Greeks believe that Thales did divert the river Halys to assist King Croesus&#x27; military endeavors, he himself finds it doubtful. Plato praises Thales along with Anacharsis, who is credited as the originator of the potter&#x27;s wheel and the anchor.

===Divinity===

According to Aristotle, Thales thought &quot;all things are full of gods&quot;, i. e. lodestones had souls, because iron is attracted to them (by the force of magnetism). The same applied to amber for its capacity to generate static electricity. The reasoning for such hylozoism or organicism seems to be if something moved, then it was alive, and if it was alive, then it must have a soul.

As well as gods seen in the movement caused by what came to be known as magnetism and electricity, it seems Thales also had a supreme God which structured the universe:

According to Henry Fielding (1775), Diogenes Laërtius (1.35) affirmed that Thales posed &quot;the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating &quot;that God was the oldest of all beings, for he existed without a previous cause even in the way of generation; that the world was the most beautiful of all things; for it was created by God.&quot;

Nicholas Molinari has recently argued that Thales was influenced by the archaic water deity Acheloios, who was equated with water and worshipped in Miletus during Thales&#x27;s life. For evidence, he points to the fact that &quot;hydor&quot; meant specifically &quot;fresh water&quot;, and also that Acheloios was seen as a shape-shifter in myth and art, so able to become anything. He also points out that the rivers of the world were seen as the &quot;sinews of Acheloios&quot; in antiquity, and this multiplicity of deities is reflected in Thales&#x27;s idea that &quot;all things are full of gods.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Diogenes Laërtius quotes Apollodorus as saying that Thales died at the age of 78 during the 58th Olympiad (548–545 BC) and attributes his death to heat stroke and thirst while watching the games.

=== Influence ===
Thales had a profound influence on other Greek thinkers and therefore on Western history. However, due to the scarcity of sources concerning Thales and the discrepancies between the accounts given in the sources that have survived, there is a scholarly debate over the extent of the influence Thales had and on which of the Greek philosophers and mathematicians that came after him.

The first three philosophers in the Western tradition were all cosmologists from Miletus, and Thales was the very first, followed by Anaximander, who was followed in turn by Anaximenes. They have been dubbed the Milesian school. According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Thales had been the &quot;teacher and kinsman&quot; of Anaximander. Rather than water, Anaximander held all was made of &quot;apeiron&quot; or the unlimited; while Anaximenes, the successor of Anaximander, perhaps more like Thales with water, held that everything was composed of air.

John Burnet (1892) noted

As two of the first Greek mathematicians, Thales is also considered an influence on Pythagoras. According to Iamblichus, Pythagoras &quot;had benefited by the instruction of Thales in many respects, but his greatest lesson had been to learn the value of saving time.&quot; Early sources report that Pythagoras, in this story a pupil of Anaximander, visited Thales as a young man, and that Thales advised him to travel to Egypt to further his philosophical and mathematical studies.

Thales was also considered the teacher of the astronomer Mandrolytus of Priene. It is possible he was also the teacher of Cleostratus of Tenedos.

<text>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

Throughout the tiger&#x27;s range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother&#x27;s home range and establish their own.

Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger&#x27;s range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is planned.

The tiger is among the most popular of the world&#x27;s charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.

== Etymology ==
The Old English &quot;tigras&quot; derives from Old French , from Latin , which was a borrowing from ().
Since ancient times, the word has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for &#x27;arrow&#x27;, which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris. However, today, the names are thought to be homonyms, and the connection between the tiger and the river is doubted.

== Taxonomy ==
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and gave it the scientific name &quot;Felis tigris&quot;, as the genus &quot;Felis&quot; was being used for all cats at the time. His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi. In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; using the scientific name &quot;Panthera tigris&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===

Nine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries, namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers. The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections that are not necessarily representative for the entire population. It was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; in mainland Asia and the smaller &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot; in the Greater Sunda Islands.

This two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 through a comprehensive analysis of morphological, ecological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) traits of all putative tiger subspecies.
In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the 2015 two-subspecies proposal and recognised only &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; and &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot;. Results of a 2018 whole-genome sequencing study of 32 samples from the six living putative subspecies—the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and Sumatran tiger—found them to be distinct and separate clades. These results were corroborated in 2021 and 2023. The Cat Specialist Group states that &quot;Given the varied interpretations of data, the [subspecific] taxonomy of this species is currently under review by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group.&quot;

The following tables are based on the classification of the tiger as of 2005, and also reflect the classification recognised by the Cat Classification Task Force in 2017.


=== Evolution ===

The tiger shares the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Results of genetic analyses indicate that the tiger and snow leopard are sister species whose lineages split from each other between 2.70 and 3.70 million years ago. The tiger&#x27;s whole genome sequencing shows repeated sequences that parallel those in other cat genomes.

The fossil species &quot;Panthera palaeosinensis&quot; of early Pleistocene northern China was described as a possible tiger ancestor when it was discovered in 1924, but modern cladistics places it as basal to modern &quot;Panthera&quot;. &quot;Panthera zdanskyi&quot; lived around the same time and place, and was suggested to be a sister species of the modern tiger when it was examined in 2014. However, as of 2023, at least two subsequent studies considered &quot;P. zdanskyi&quot; likely to be a synonym of &quot;P. palaeosinensis&quot;, noting that its proposed differences from that species fell within the range of individual variation. The earliest appearance of the modern tiger species in the fossil record are jaw fragments from Lantion in China that are dated to the early Pleistocene.

Middle- to late-Pleistocene tiger fossils have been found throughout China, Sumatra and Java. Prehistoric subspecies include &quot;Panthera tigris trinilensis&quot; and &quot;P. t. soloensis&quot; of Java and Sumatra and &quot;P. t. acutidens&quot; of China; late Pleistocene and early Holocene fossils of tigers have also been found in Borneo and Palawan, Philippines. Fossil specimens of tigers have also been reported from the Middle-Late Pleistocene of Japan. Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers have a common ancestor that lived between 108,000 and 72,000 years ago. Genetic studies suggest that the tiger population contracted around 115,000 years ago due to glaciation. Modern tiger populations originated from a refugium in Indochina and spread across Asia after the Last Glacial Maximum. As they colonised northeastern China, the ancestors of the South China tiger intermixed with a relict tiger population.

=== Hybrids ===

Tigers can interbreed with other &quot;Panthera&quot; cats and have done so in captivity. The liger is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion and the tigon the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion. The lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, so that ligers grow far larger than either parent species. By contrast, the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene while the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene; hence, tigons are around the same size as their parents. Since they often develop life-threatening birth defects and can easily become obese, breeding these hybrids is regarded as unethical.

== Characteristics ==

The tiger has a typical felid morphology, with a muscular body, shortened legs, strong forelimbs with wide front paws, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body. It has five digits, including a dewclaw, on the front feet and four on the back, all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved, and can reach long. The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil. The snout ends in a triangular, pink tip with small black dots, the number of which increase with age. The tiger&#x27;s skull is robust, with a constricted front region, proportionally small, elliptical orbits, long nasal bones and a lengthened cranium with a large sagittal crest. It resembles a lion&#x27;s skull, but differs from it in the concave or flattened underside of the lower jaw and in its longer nasals. The tiger has 30 fairly robust teeth and its somewhat curved canines are the longest in the cat family at .

The tiger has a head-body length of with a tail and stands at the shoulder. The Siberian and Bengal tigers are the largest. Male Bengal tigers weigh , and females weigh ; island tigers are the smallest, likely due to insular dwarfism. Male Sumatran tigers weigh , and females weigh . The tiger is popularly thought to be the largest living felid species; but since tigers of the different subspecies and populations vary greatly in size and weight, the tiger&#x27;s average size may be less than the lion&#x27;s, while the largest tigers are bigger than their lion counterparts.

===Coat===

The tiger&#x27;s coat usually has short hairs, reaching up to , though the hairs of the northern-living Siberian tiger can reach . Belly hairs tend to be longer than back hairs. The density of their fur is usually thin, though the Siberian tiger develops a particularly thick winter coat. The tiger has lines of fur around the face and long whiskers, especially in males. It has an orange colouration that varies from yellowish to reddish. White fur covers the underside, from head to tail, along with the inner surface of the legs and parts of the face. On the back of the ears, it has a prominent white spot, which is surrounded by black. The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes, which are uniquely patterned in each individual. The stripes are mostly vertical, but those on the limbs and forehead are horizontal. They are more concentrated towards the backside and those on the trunk may reach under the belly. The tips of stripes are generally sharp and some may split up or split and fuse again. Tail stripes are thick bands and a black tip marks the end.

The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species. Stripes are advantageous for camouflage in vegetation with vertical patterns of light and shade, such as trees, reeds and tall grass. This is supported by a Fourier analysis study showing that the striping patterns line up with their environment.
The orange colour may also aid in concealment, as the tiger&#x27;s prey is colour blind and possibly perceives the tiger as green and blended in with the vegetation.

==== Colour variations ====

The three colour variants of Bengal tigers – nearly stripeless snow-white, white and golden – are now virtually non-existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations but continue in captive populations. The white tiger has a white background colour with sepia-brown stripes. The golden tiger is pale golden with reddish-brown stripes. The snow-white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale sepia-brown ringed tail. White and golden morphs are the result of an autosomal recessive trait with a white locus and a wideband locus, respectively. The snow-white variation is caused by polygenes with both white and wideband loci. The breeding of white tigers is controversial, as they have no use for conservation. Only 0.001% of wild tigers have the genes for this colour morph and the overrepresentation of white tigers in captivity is the result of inbreeding. Hence, their continued breeding will risk both inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability in captive tigers.

Pseudo-melanistic tigers with thick, merged stripes have been recorded in Simlipal National Park and three Indian zoos; a population genetic analysis of Indian tiger samples revealed that this phenotype is caused by a mutation of a transmembrane aminopeptidase gene. Around 37% of the Simlipal tiger population has this feature, which has been linked to genetic isolation.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java and Bali. As of 2022, it inhabits less than 7% of its historical distribution and has a scattered range in the Indian subcontinent, the Indochinese Peninsula, Sumatra, northeastern China and the Russian Far East. As of 2020, India had the largest extent of global tiger habitat with , followed by Russia with .

The tiger mainly lives in forest habitats and is highly adaptable. Records in Central Asia indicate that it primarily inhabited Tugay riverine forests and hilly and lowland forests in the Caucasus. In the Amur-Ussuri region of Russia and China, it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests; riparian forests serve as dispersal corridors, providing food and water for both tigers and ungulates. On the Indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, tropical moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, alluvial plains and the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. In the Eastern Himalayas, it was documented in temperate forest up to an elevation of in Bhutan, of in the Mishmi Hills and of in Mêdog County, southeastern Tibet. In Thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests. In Sumatra, it inhabits lowland peat swamp forests and rugged montane forests.

=== Population density ===
Camera trapping during 2010–2015 in the deciduous and subtropical pine forest of Jim Corbett National Park, northern India revealed a stable tiger population density of 12–17 individuals per in an area of .
In northern Myanmar, the population density in a sampled area of roughly in a mosaic of tropical broadleaf forest and grassland was estimated to be 0.21–0.44 tigers per as of 2009.
Population density in mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forests of Thailand&#x27;s Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at 2.01 tigers per ; during the 1970s and 1980s, logging and poaching had occurred in the adjacent Mae Wong and Khlong Lan National Parks, where population density was much lower, estimated at only 0.359 tigers per as of 2016.
Population density in dipterocarp and montane forests in northern Malaysia was estimated at 1.47–2.43 adult tigers per in Royal Belum State Park, but 0.3–0.92 adult tigers per in the unprotected selectively logged Temengor Forest Reserve.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Camera trap data show that tigers in Chitwan National Park avoided locations frequented by people and were more active at night than during day.
In Sundarbans National Park, six radio-collared tigers were most active from dawn to early morning and reached their zenith around 7:00 o&#x27;clock in the morning.
A three-year-long camera trap survey in Shuklaphanta National Park revealed that tigers were most active from dusk until midnight.
In northeastern China, tigers were crepuscular and active at night with activity peaking at dawn and dusk; they were largely active at the same time as their prey.

The tiger is a powerful swimmer and easily transverses rivers as wide as ; it immerses in water, particularly on hot days. In general, it is less capable of climbing trees than many other cats due to its size, but cubs under 16 months old may routinely do so. An adult was recorded climbing up a smooth pipal tree.

===Social spacing===
Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives within home ranges or territories, the size of which mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual. Males and females defend their home ranges from those of the same sex and the home range of a male encompasses that of multiple females. Two females in the Sundarbans had home ranges of .
In Panna Tiger Reserve, the home ranges of five reintroduced females varied from in winter to in summer and to during the monsoon; three males had large home ranges in winter, in summer and during monsoon seasons.
In Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, 14 females had home ranges and five resident males of that overlapped with those of up to five females. When tigresses in the same reserve had cubs of up to four months of age, they reduced their home ranges to stay near their young and steadily enlarged them until their offspring were 13–18 months old.

The tiger is a long-ranging species and individuals disperse over distances of up to to reach tiger populations in other areas. Young tigresses establish their first home ranges close to their mothers&#x27; while males migrate further than their female counterparts. Four radio-collared females in Chitwan dispersed between and 10 males between . A subadult male lives as a transient in another male&#x27;s home range until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Tigers mark their home ranges by spraying urine on vegetation and rocks, clawing or scent rubbing trees and marking trails with faeces, anal gland secretions and ground scrapings. Scent markings also allow an individual to pick up information on another&#x27;s identity. Unclaimed home ranges, particularly those that belonged to a deceased individual, can be taken over in days or weeks.

Male tigers are generally less tolerant of other males within their home ranges than females are of other females. Disputes are usually solved by intimidation rather than fighting. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not come near him. The most serious disputes tend to occur between two males competing for a female in oestrus. Though tigers mostly live alone, relationships between individuals can be complex. Tigers are particularly social at kills and a male tiger will sometimes share a carcass with the females and cubs within this home range and unlike male lions, will allow them to feed on the kill before he is finished with it. However, a female is more tense when encountering another female at a kill.

===Communication===

During friendly encounters and bonding, tigers rub against each other&#x27;s bodies. Facial expressions include the &quot;defence threat&quot;, which involves a wrinkled face, bared teeth, pulled-back ears and widened pupils. Both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic curled-lip grimace, when smelling urine markings. Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. Tigers will move their ears around to display the white spots, particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs. They also use their tails to signal their mood. To show cordiality, the tail sticks up and sways slowly, while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side-to-side. When calm, the tail hangs low.

Tigers are normally silent but can produce numerous vocalisations. They roar to signal their presence to other individuals over long distances. This vocalisation is forced through an open mouth as it closes and can be heard away. They roar multiple times in a row and others respond in kind. Tigers also roar during mating and a mother will roar to call her cubs to her. When tense, tigers moan, a sound similar to a roar but softer and made when the mouth is at least partially closed. Moaning can be heard away. Aggressive encounters involve growling, snarling and hissing. An explosive &quot;coughing roar&quot; or &quot;coughing snarl&quot; is emitted through an open mouth and exposed teeth. In friendlier situations, tigers prusten, a soft, low-frequency snorting sound similar to purring in smaller cats. Tiger mothers communicate with their cubs by grunting, while cubs call back with miaows. When startled, they &quot;woof&quot;. They produce a deer-like &quot;pok&quot; sound for unknown reasons, but most often at kills.

=== Hunting and diet ===

The tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on large and medium-sized ungulates, with a preference for sambar deer, Manchurian wapiti, barasingha, gaur and wild boar.
Abundance and body weight of prey species are assumed to be the main criteria for the tiger&#x27;s prey selection, both inside and outside protected areas.
It also preys opportunistically on smaller species like monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, porcupines and fish. Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceroses have also been reported.
More often, tigers take the more vulnerable calves.
They sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements. Tigers occasionally consume vegetation, fruit and minerals for dietary fibre and supplements.

Tigers learn to hunt from their mothers, though the ability to hunt may be partially inborn. Depending on the size of the prey, they typically kill weekly though mothers must kill more often. Families hunt together when cubs are old enough. They search for prey using vision and hearing. A tiger will also wait at a watering hole for prey to come by, particularly during hot summer days. It is an ambush predator and when approaching potential prey, it crouches with the head lowered and hides in foliage. It switches between creeping forward and staying still. A tiger may even doze off and can stay in the same spot for as long as a day, waiting for prey and launch an attack when the prey is close enough, usually within . If the prey spots it before then, the cat does not pursue further. A tiger can sprint and leap ; it is not a long-distance runner and gives up a chase if prey outpaces it over a certain distance.
The tiger attacks from behind or at the sides and tries to knock the target off balance. It latches onto prey with its forelimbs, twisting and turning during the struggle and tries to pull it to the ground. The tiger generally applies a bite to the throat until its victim dies of strangulation. It has an average bite force at the canine tips of 1234.3 newtons. Holding onto the throat puts the cat out of reach of horns, antlers, tusks and hooves. Tigers are adaptable killers and may use other methods, including ripping the throat or breaking the neck. Large prey may be disabled by a bite to the back of the hock, severing the tendon. Swipes from the large paws are capable of stunning or breaking the skull of a water buffalo. They kill small prey with a bite to the back of the neck or head. Estimates of the success rate for hunting tigers range from a low of 5% to a high of 50%. They are sometimes killed or injured by large or dangerous prey like gaur, buffalo and boar.

Tigers typically move kills to a private, usually vegetated spot no further than , though they have been recorded dragging them . They are strong enough to drag the carcass of a fully grown buffalo for some distance. They rest for a while before eating and can consume as much as of meat in one session, but feed on a carcass for several days, leaving little for scavengers.

=== Competitors ===

In much of their range, tigers share habitat with leopards and dholes. They typically dominate both of them, though with dholes it depends on their pack size. Interactions between the three predators involve chasing, stealing kills and direct killing. Large dhole packs may kill tigers. Tigers, leopards and dholes coexist by hunting different sized prey. In Nagarhole National Park, the average weight for tiger kills was found to be , compared to for leopards and for dholes. In Kui Buri National Park, following a reduction in prey numbers, tigers continued to kill favoured prey while leopards and dholes increased their consumption of small prey.

Both leopards and dholes can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover. Otherwise, they appear to be less common where tigers are numerous. The recovery of the tiger population in Rajaji National Park during the 2000s led to a reduction in leopard population densities. Similarly, at two sites in central India the size of dhole packs was negatively correlated with tiger densities. Leopard and dhole distribution in Kui Buri correlated with both prey access and tiger scarcity. In Jigme Dorji National Park, tigers were found to inhabit the deeper parts of forests while the smaller predators were pushed closer to the fringes.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===


The tiger generally mates all year round, particularly between November and April. A tigress is in oestrus for three to six days at a time, separated by three to nine week intervals. A resident male mates with all the females within his home range, who signal their receptiveness by roaring and marking. Younger, transient males are also attracted, leading to a fight in which the more dominant, resident male drives the usurper off. During courtship, the male is cautious with the female as he waits for her to show signs she is ready to mate. She signals to him by positioning herself in lordosis with her tail to the side. Copulation typically lasts no more than 20 seconds, with the male biting the female by the scruff of her neck. After it is finished, the male quickly pulls away as the female may turn and slap him. Tiger pairs may stay together for up to four days and mate multiple times. Gestation lasts around or over three months.

A tigress gives birth in a secluded location, be it in dense vegetation, in a cave or under a rocky shelter. Litters consist of as many as seven cubs, but two or three are more typical. Newborn cubs weigh and are blind and altricial. The mother licks and cleans her cubs, suckles them and viciously defends them from any potential threat. Cubs open their eyes at the age of three to 14 days and their vision becomes clear after a few more weeks. They can leave the denning site after two months and around the same time they start eating meat. The mother only leaves them alone to hunt and even then she does not travel far. When she suspects an area is no longer safe, she moves her cubs to a new spot, transporting them one by one by grabbing them by the scruff of the neck with her mouth.
A tigress in Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve maximised the time spent with her cubs by reducing her home range, killing larger prey and returning to her den more rapidly than without cubs; when the cubs started to eat meat, she took them to kill sites, thereby optimising their protection and access to food.
In the same reserve, one of 21 cubs died in over eight years of monitoring and mortality did not differ between male and female juveniles.
Tiger monitoring over six years in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve indicated an average annual survival rate of around 85 percent for 74 male and female cubs; survival rate increased to 97 percent for both males and female juveniles of one to two years of age.
Causes of cub mortality include predators, floods, fires, death of the mother and fatal injuries.
After around two months, the cubs are able to follow their mother. They still hide in vegetation when she goes hunting. Young bond through play fighting and practice stalking. A hierarchy develops in the litter, with the biggest cub, often a male, being the most dominant and the first to eat its fill at a kill. Around the age of six months, cubs are fully weaned and have more freedom to explore their environment. Between eight and ten months, they accompany their mother on hunts. A cub can make a kill as early as 11 months and reach independence as a juvenile of 18 to 24 months of age; males become independent earlier than females. Radio-collared tigers in Chitwan started leaving their natal areas at the age of 19 months. Young females are sexually mature at three to four years, whereas males are at four to five years. Generation length of the tiger is about 7–10 years.
Wild Bengal tigers live 12–15 years. Data from the International Tiger Studbook 1938–2018 indicate that captive tigers lived up to 19 years.

The father does not play a role in raising the young, but he encounters and interacts with them. The resident male appears to visit the female–cub families within his home range. They socialise and even share kills. One male was recorded looking after cubs whose mother had died. By defending his home range, the male protects the females and cubs from other males. When a new male takes over, dependent cubs are at risk of infanticide as the male attempts to sire his own young with the females. A seven-year long study in Chitwan National Park revealed that 12 of 56 detected cubs and juveniles were killed by new males taking over home ranges.

=== Health and diseases ===
Tigers are recorded as hosts for various parasites including tapeworms like &quot;Diphyllobothrium erinacei&quot;, &quot;Taenia pisiformis&quot; in India and nematodes like &quot;Toxocara&quot; species in India and &quot;Physaloptera preputialis&quot;, &quot;Dirofilaria ursi&quot; and &quot;Uiteinarta&quot; species in Siberia. Canine distemper is known to occur in Siberian tigers. A morbillivirus infection was the likely cause of death of a tigress in the Russian Far East that was also tested positive for feline panleukopenia and feline coronavirus.
Blood samples from 11 adult tigers in Nepal showed antibodies for canine parvovirus-2, feline herpesvirus, feline coronavirus, leptospirosis and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;.

== Threats ==
The tiger has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986 and the global tiger population is thought to have continuously declined from an estimated population of 5,000–8,262 tigers in the late 1990s to 3,726–5,578 individuals estimated as of 2022. During 2001–2020, landscapes where tigers live declined from to . Habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts are the major threats that contributed to the decrease of tiger populations in all range countries.

Protected areas in central India are highly fragmented due to linear infrastructure like roads, railway lines, transmission lines, irrigation channels and mining activities in their vicinity.
In the Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar, deforestation coupled with mining activities and high hunting pressure threatens the tiger population.
In Thailand, nine of 15 protected areas hosting tigers are isolated and fragmented, offering a low probability for dispersal between them; four of these have not harboured tigers since about 2013.
In Peninsular Malaysia, of tiger habitat was cleared during 1988–2012, most of it for industrial plantations.
Large-scale land acquisitions of about for commercial agriculture and timber extraction in Cambodia contributed to the fragmentation of potential tiger habitat, especially in the Eastern Plains.
Inbreeding depression coupled with habitat destruction, insufficient prey resources and poaching is a threat to the small and isolated tiger population in the Changbai Mountains along the China–Russia border.
In China, tigers became the target of large-scale &#x27;anti-pest&#x27; campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species. Though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in South China since 2001.

Tiger populations in India have been targeted by poachers since the 1990s and were extirpated in two tiger reserves in 2005 and 2009.
Between March 2017 and January 2020, 630 activities of hunters using snares, drift nets, hunting platforms and hunting dogs were discovered in a reserve forest of about in southern Myanmar. Nam Et-Phou Louey National Park was considered the last important site for the tiger in Laos, but it has not been recorded there at least since 2013; this population likely fell victim to indiscriminate snaring. Anti-poaching units in Sumatra&#x27;s Kerinci Seblat landscape removed 362 tiger snare traps and seized 91 tiger skins during 2005–2016; annual poaching rates increased with rising skin prices.
Poaching is also the main threat to the tiger population in far eastern Russia, where logging roads facilitate access for poachers and people harvesting forest products that are important for prey species to survive in winter.

Body parts of 207 tigers were detected during 21 surveys in 1991–2014 in two wildlife markets in Myanmar catering to customers in Thailand and China.
During the years 2000–2022, at least 3,377 tigers were confiscated in 2,205 seizures in 28 countries; seizures encompassed 665 live and 654 dead individuals, 1,313 whole tiger skins, 16,214 body parts like bones, teeth, paws, claws, whiskers and of meat; 759 seizures in India encompassed body parts of 893 tigers; and 403 seizures in Thailand involved mostly captive-bred tigers. Seizures in Nepal between January 2011 and December 2015 obtained 585 pieces of tiger body parts and two whole carcasses in 19 districts. Seizure data from India during 2001–2021 indicate that tiger skins were the most often traded body parts, followed by claws, bones and teeth; trafficking routes mainly passed through the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Assam.
A total of 292 illegal tiger parts were confiscated at US ports of entry from personal baggage, air cargo and mail between 2003 and 2012.

Demand for tiger parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations.
Interviews with local people in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans revealed that they kill tigers for local consumption and trade of skins, bones and meat, in retaliation for attacks by tigers and for excitement.
Tiger body parts like skins, bones, teeth and hair are consumed locally by wealthy Bangladeshis and are illegally trafficked from Bangladesh to 15 countries including India, China, Malaysia, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan and the United Kingdom via land borders, airports and seaports.
Tiger bone glue is the prevailing tiger product purchased for medicinal purposes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. &quot;Tiger farm&quot; facilities in China and Southeast Asia breed tigers for their parts, but these appear to make the threat to wild populations worse by increasing the demand for tiger products.

Local people killing tigers in retaliation for attacking and preying on livestock is a threat in several tiger range countries, as this consequence of human–wildlife conflict also contributes to the decline of the population.

== Conservation ==

Internationally, the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I, banning trade of live tigers and their body parts.
In Russia, hunting the tiger has been banned since 1952.
In Bhutan, it has been protected since 1969 and enlisted as totally protected since 1995. Since 1972, it has been afforded the highest protection level under India&#x27;s Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
In Nepal and Bangladesh, it has been protected since 1973.
Since 1976, it has been totally protected under Malaysia&#x27;s Protection of Wild Life Act, and the country&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Act enacted in 2010 increased punishments for wildlife-related crimes.
In Indonesia, it has been protected since 1990.
In China, the trade in tiger body parts was banned in 1993.
The Thai Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act was enacted in 2019 to combat poaching and trading of body parts.

In 1973, the National Tiger Conservation Authority and Project Tiger were founded in India to gain public support for tiger conservation. Since then, 53 tiger reserves covering an area of have been established in the country up to 2022. These efforts contributed to the recovery of India&#x27;s tiger population between 2006 and 2018 so that it occurs in an area of about .

Myanmar&#x27;s national tiger conservation strategy developed in 2003 comprises management tasks such as restoration of degraded habitats, increasing the extent of protected areas and wildlife corridors, protecting tiger prey species, thwarting tiger killing and illegal trade of its body parts and promoting public awareness through wildlife education programmes.
Bhutan&#x27;s first Tiger Action Plan implemented during 2006–2015 revolved around habitat conservation, human–wildlife conflict management, education and awareness; the second Action Plan aimed at increasing the country&#x27;s tiger population by 20% until 2023 compared to 2015.
In 2009, the Bangladesh Tiger Action Plan was initiated to stabilise the country&#x27;s tiger population, maintain habitat and a sufficient prey base, improve law enforcement and foster cooperation between governmental agencies responsible for tiger conservation.
The Thailand Tiger Action Plan ratified in 2010 envisioned increasing the country&#x27;s tiger populations by 50% in the Western Forest Complex and Dong Phayayen–Khao Yai Forest Complex and reestablish populations in three potential landscapes until 2022.
The Indonesian National Tiger Recovery Program ratified in 2010 aimed at increasing the Sumatran tiger population by 2022. The third strategic and action plan for the conservation of the Sumatran tiger for the years 2020–2030 revolves around strengthening management of small tiger population units of less than 20 mature individuals and connectivity between 13 forest patches in North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces.
Increases in anti-poaching patrol efforts in four Russian protected areas during 2011–2014 contributed to reducing poaching, stabilising the tiger population and improving protection of ungulate populations. Poaching and trafficking were declared to be moderate and serious crimes in 2019.
Anti-poaching operations were also established in Nepal in 2010, with increased cooperation and intelligence sharing between agencies. These policies have led to many years of &quot;zero poaching&quot; and the country&#x27;s tiger population has doubled in a decade.
Anti-poaching patrols in the large core area of Taman Negara lead to a decrease of poaching frequency from 34 detected incidents in 2015–2016 to 20 incidents during 2018–2019; the arrest of seven poaching teams and removal of snares facilitated the survival of three resident female tigers and at least 11 cubs.
Army and police officers are deployed for patrolling together with staff of protected areas in Malaysia.

Wildlife corridors are important conservation measures as they facilitate tiger populations to connect between protected areas; tigers use at least nine corridors that were established in the Terai Arc Landscape and Sivalik Hills in both Nepal and India.
Corridors in forested areas with low human encroachment are highly suitable.
In West Sumatra, 12 wildlife corridors were identified as high priority for mitigating human–wildlife conflicts.
In 2019, China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding for transboundary cooperation between two protected areas, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park and Land of the Leopard National Park, that includes the creation of wildlife corridors and bilateral monitoring and patrolling along the Sino-Russian border.

Rescued and rehabilitated problem tigers and orphaned tiger cubs have been released into the wild and monitored in India, Sumatra and Russia.
In Kazakhstan, habitat restoration and reintroduction of prey species in Ile-Balkash Nature Reserve have progressed and tiger reintroduction is planned for 2025.
Reintroduction of tigers is considered possible in eastern Cambodia, once management of protected areas is improved and forest loss stabilized. South China tigers are kept and bred in Chinese zoos, with plans to reintroduce their offspring into remote protected areas. Coordinated breeding programs among zoos have led to enough genetic diversity in tigers to act as &quot;insurance against extinction in the wild&quot;.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Hunting ===
Tigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is dated to 5,000–6,000 years ago. They were hunted throughout their range in Asia, chased on horseback, elephant-back or even with sled dogs and killed with spears and later firearms. Such hunts were conducted both by Asian governments and empires like the Mughal Empire, as well as European colonists. Tigers were often hunted as trophies and because of their perceived danger. An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925.

===Attacks===

In most areas, tigers avoid humans, but attacks are a risk wherever people coexist with them. Dangerous encounters are more likely to occur in edge habitats between wild and agricultural areas. Most attacks on humans are defensive, including protection of young; however, tigers do sometimes see people as prey. Man-eating tigers tend to be old and disabled. Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man-eating.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the Champawat Tiger was responsible for over 430 human deaths in Nepal and India before she was shot by Jim Corbett. This tigress suffered from broken teeth and was unable to kill normal prey. Modern authors speculate that sustaining on meagre human flesh forced the cat to kill more and more. Tiger attacks were particularly high in Singapore during the mid-19th century, when plantations expanded into the tiger&#x27;s habitat. In the 1840s, the number of deaths in the area ranged from 200 to 300 annually. Tiger attacks in the Sundarbans caused 1,396 human deaths in the period 1935–2006 according to official records of the Bangladesh Forest Department. Victims of these attacks are local villagers who enter the tiger&#x27;s domain to collect resources like wood and honey. Fishermen have been particularly common targets. Methods to counter tiger attacks have included face masks worn backwards, protective clothes, sticks and carefully stationed electric dummies.

===Captivity===
Tigers have been kept in captivity since ancient times. In ancient Rome, tigers were displayed in amphitheatres; they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals. The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the 13th century. Starting in the Middle Ages, tigers were being kept in European menageries. Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the 19th century onward, they were exhibited more to the public. Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared. In 2020, there were over 8,000 captive tigers in Asia, over 5,000 in the US and no less than 850 in Europe. There are more tigers in captivity than in the wild. Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity. Modern zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures. Enrichment items are also important for the cat&#x27;s welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours.

Tigers have played prominent roles in circuses and other live performances. Ringling Bros included many tiger tamers in the 20th century including Mabel Stark, who became a big draw and had a long career. She was well known for being able to control the tigers despite being a small woman; using &quot;manly&quot; tools like whips and guns. Another trainer was Clyde Beatty, who used chairs, whips and guns to provoke tigers and other beasts into acting fierce and allowed him to appear courageous. He would perform with as many as 40 tigers and lions in one act. From the 1960s onward, trainers like Gunther Gebel-Williams would use gentler methods to control their animals. Sara Houcke was dubbed &quot;the Tiger Whisperer&quot; as she trained the cats to obey her by whispering to them. Siegfried &amp; Roy became famous for performing with white tigers in Las Vegas. The act ended in 2003 when a tiger attacked Roy during a performance. In 2009, tigers were the most traded circus animals. The use of tigers and other animals in shows eventually declined in many countries due to pressure from animal rights groups and greater desires from the public to see them in more natural settings. Several countries restrict or ban such acts.

Tigers have become popular in the exotic pet trade, particularly in the United States where only 6% of the captive tiger population in 2020 were being housed in zoos and other facilities approved by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Private collectors are thought to be ill-equipped to provide proper care for tigers, which compromises their welfare. They can also threaten public safety by allowing people to interact with them. The keeping of tigers and other big cats by private people was banned in the US in 2022. Most countries in the European Union have banned breeding and keeping tigers outside of licensed zoos and rescue centres, but some still allow private holdings.

===Cultural significance===


The tiger is among the most famous of the charismatic megafauna. Kailash Sankhala has called it &quot;a rare combination of courage, ferocity and brilliant colour&quot;, while Candy d&#x27;Sa calls it &quot;fierce and commanding on the outside, but noble and discerning on the inside&quot;. In a 2004 online poll involving more than 50,000 people from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world&#x27;s favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog. Similarly, a 2018 study found the tiger to be the most popular wild animal based on surveys, as well as appearances on websites of major zoos and posters of some animated movies.

While the lion represented royalty and power in Western culture, the tiger played such a role in various Asian cultures. In ancient China, the tiger was seen as the &quot;king of the forest&quot; and symbolised the power of the emperor. In Chinese astrology, the tiger is the third out of 12 symbols in the Chinese zodiac and controls the period between 15:00 and 17:00 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. The Year of the Tiger is thought to bring &quot;dramatic and extreme events&quot;. The White Tiger is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations, representing the west along with the yin and the season of autumn. It is the counterpart to the Azure Dragon, which conversely symbolises the east, yang and springtime. The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The big cat was depicted on seals and coins during the Chola dynasty of southern India, as it was the official emblem.

Tigers have had religious and folkloric significance. In Buddhism, the tiger, monkey and deer are the Three Senseless Creatures, with the tiger symbolising anger. In Hinduism, the tiger is the vehicle of Durga, the goddess of feminine power and peace, whom the gods created to fight demons. Similarly, in the Greco-Roman world, the tiger was depicted being ridden by the god Dionysus. In Korean mythology, tigers are messengers of the Mountain Gods. In both Chinese and Korean culture, tigers are seen as protectors against evil spirits and their image was used to decorate homes, tombs and articles of clothing. In the folklore of Malaysia and Indonesia, &quot;tiger shamans&quot; heal the sick by invoking the big cat. People turning into tigers and the inverse has also been widespread; in particular weretigers are people who could change into tigers and back again. The Mnong people of Indochina believed that tigers could shapeshift into humans. Among some indigenous peoples of Siberia, it was believed that men would seduce women by transforming into tigers.

William Blake&#x27;s 1794 poem &quot;The Tyger&quot; portrays the animal as the duality of beauty and ferocity. It is the sister poem to &quot;The Lamb&quot; in Blake&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; and he ponders how God could create such different creatures. The tiger is featured in the mediaeval Chinese novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;, where the cat battles and is slain by the bandit Wu Song, while the tiger Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894) is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist Mowgli. Friendly tame tigers have also existed in culture, notably Tigger, the Winnie-the-Pooh character and Tony the Tiger, the Kellogg&#x27;s cereal mascot.

<text>Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues and consisting entirely or almost entirely of original spoken word content rather than outside music. They may feature monologues, dialogues between the hosts, interviews with guests, and/or listener participation which may be live conversations between the host and listeners who &quot;call in&quot; (usually via telephone) or via voice mail. Listener contributions are usually screened by a show&#x27;s producers to maximize audience interest and, in the case of commercial talk radio, to attract advertisers.

Talk shows on commercial stations are organized into segments, each separated by a pause for advertisements; however, in public or non-commercial radio, music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments.

Variations of talk radio include conservative talk, hot talk, liberal talk (increasingly known as progressive talk), and sports talk.

Talk radio has historically been associated with broadcast radio; however, starting around 2005, the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost-effective in the form of live internet website streaming and podcasts. Now, an individual can use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station. Also, TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, and Fox is now often available expanding the world of talk radio further. Talk radio listening is enjoyed not only on radios but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes, station directories such as TuneIn, show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher, and time-shifting services like DAR.fm.

==Africa==
SW Radio Africa was a pro-democracy station that broadcast out of London from 2001 to 2014.

==Australia==
In Australia, talk radio is known as &quot;talkback radio&quot;.

The most popular talkback radio station historically was Sydney&#x27;s 2UE, whose populist programs like &quot;The John Laws Morning Show&quot;, were widely syndicated across the continent. In recent years though, 2UE has been eclipsed by its Sydney rival 2GB after the defection of 2UE most popular talkback host, Alan Jones.

As a result, 2UE and owned by the same company as 2GB) abandoned most of its rigid political and hot topic-driven talkback programming in 2016, moving to a less-serious lifestyle and branded content format, although still maintaining a talkback element.

Melbourne, 3AW is the highest rating talkback radio station and has also been the highest rating Melbourne radio station for several decades in a row.

6PR personality Garry Meadows was the first announcer to use talkback radio in early 1967. &#x27;Talkback&#x27; radio, using a seven-second time-lapse mechanism, began in Australia in April 1967, simultaneously on 2SM, Sydney (with Mike Walsh) and 3DB, Melbourne (with Barry Jones). 

Female radio personality, &#x27;Andrea&#x27;, also began talk-back radio, in 1967, on 2GB in Sydney.

In the 1990s and 2000s, &quot;talkback&quot; on FM was attempted. &quot;The Spoonman&quot; was a program hosted by Brian Carlton on the triple m network in the late 1990s and returned in 2005 for three and a half years, the show wrapping up in 2008. It was a show that covered many topics, but the &quot;hot talk&quot; format in the U.S. would probably be the best way to describe the program.

Talkback radio has historically been an important political forum in Australia and functions much like the cable news televisions in the United States, with live and &quot;saturated&quot; coverage of political issues.

==Brazil==
The most important talk radios in Brazil are CBN, Band News and Jovem Pan, which has also sports and news broadcasts.

==Canada==

In contrast to talk radio stations in the United States, where syndicated programs tend to make up a significant part of most schedules, privately owned Canadian talk radio stations tend to be predominantly local in programming and focus. There is no Canadian content requirement for talk radio, or &quot;spoken word&quot;, programming unless the individual station&#x27;s license expressly stipulates such a requirement; most do not. (In Canada, prospective radio stations may propose certain restrictions on their license to gain favor with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and have an easier time obtaining a license.)

The most recent nationally syndicated, politically oriented weekday talk radio show in Canada was &quot;Charles Adler Tonight&quot;, hosted by Charles Adler and heard on eleven stations across the country. After 5 years, the show ended in August 2021. Until 2006, Peter Warren&#x27;s &quot;Warren on the Weekend&quot; was heard Saturdays and Sundays. Both programs are or were distributed by the Corus Radio Network and, coincidentally, both hosts had hosted different morning call-in programs in the same time slot on Winnipeg, Manitoba&#x27;s CJOB 680 before they became nationally syndicated (Adler&#x27;s show originated from CJOB and retained its original title, while Warren was based in Victoria, British Columbia.) before &quot;Charles Adler Tonight&quot;, Corus had syndicated &quot;Rutherford&quot;, hosted by conservative Dave Rutherford and originating from its Calgary station, CHQR. &quot;Rutherford&quot; is no longer syndicated nationally but continues to air in Calgary, Edmonton, and London.

Other Canadian talk radio programs which have been syndicated to different markets include:
* &quot;The George Stroumboulopoulos Show&quot; airs on Sunday nights on stations in Toronto and Montreal.
* &quot;The Home Discovery Show&quot;, a call-in home renovation program hosted by Shell Busey.
* &quot;Love and Romance&quot;, a relationship advice program hosted by Sue McGarvie.
* &quot;Prime Time Sports&quot;, a sports talk program hosted by Bob McCown. A three-hour program originating from CJCL, usually only the third hour is broadcast nationally.
* &quot;Renovations Cross Canada&quot;, a weekend program about home renovations hosted by Ren Molnar. It is the most widely distributed talk radio program in Canada.
* &quot;The Roy Green Show&quot;, a political and entertainment-based show hosted by Roy Green that airs on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, primarily on the Corus Radio Network.
* &quot;The &#x27;X&#x27; Zone&quot;, a nightly show about paranormal topics hosted by Rob McConnell. It is also syndicated throughout the United States.

Privately owned talk radio syndication networks in Canada are generally formed to share programs across a group of stations with common ownership, although some are formed to distribute their one or two talk radio programs to several stations regardless of ownership. The largest of these is the Corus Radio Network. TSN Radio, the successor to the long-defunct the Team, is one of the newest national networks in Canada, with operations in several major markets.

Syndicated programs from the United States which air on Canadian radio stations are typically non-political shows such as &quot;The Kim Komando Show&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, as well as sports radio shows from the 24-hour networks in the U.S. Traditionally, politically driven talk radio from the United States does not air on Canadian stations, with a few scattered exceptions (e.g. the now-defunct CFBN, which carried political programming such as the &quot;Glenn Beck Program&quot; and Dennis Miller, and the also-discontinued talk format of CHAM, which carried Miller). Top political programs such as &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; are never broadcast on Canadian stations, mainly due to high rights fees compared to their relevance to non-American audiences. American stations near the Canadian border can provide many Canadians with access to American talk programs (the signals of Limbaugh affiliates WJR, WBEN, and WHAM, for example, cover almost all of Southern Ontario).

Local talk radio plays a significant role in the politics of Newfoundland and Labrador. Political parties have systematically coordinated call-ins by Members of the House of Assembly when public opinion pollsters are known to be in the field. The provincial government routinely purchases transcripts of calls.

==Finland==
A state-owned public channel called YLE Puhe. is broadcast throughout the whole country in the Finnish language. The programs include sports and news broadcasts. Its weekly listenership is about 550,000. Finland&#x27;s first commercial talk station, Radio Rapu, started operations on March 1, 2014.

==France==
Talk radio is a popular form of radio entertainment in France, exemplified by Europe 1, RTL, and RMC, plus state-owned France Inter. A premier English language talk radio in France is the Gascony Show. Launched in early 2011, this show is broadcast weekly to the Gascony region of the southwest of France, as well as to the rest of France via Internet streaming.

== Germany ==

Radio talk shows are popular in Germany and have a long tradition. The first talk show on public radio was Werner Höfer&#x27;s , a political talk begun in 1952. The talk show on wheels Hallo Ü-Wagen ran from 1974 to 2010, begun by Carmen Thomas for WDR.

==Italy==
Talk radio in Italy is popular. Radio 24, part of the group Il Sole 24 Ore privately owned by Confindustria, is the most important commercial &quot;news/talk&quot; talk radio station in the country. Its focus is mainly on independent news about the Italian and European economy, finance, culture, and politics, but it also hosts programs focusing on sports, personal finance, music, health, science, technology, and crowdsourced storytelling. State-owned Rai Radio 3 is mainly dedicated to literature, the arts, classical music, and general cultural issues. Several regional stations use a format combining that of all-news and talk radio.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, the talk radio format is popularly known as talkback radio. The major radio networks broadcasting in the talk radio format are Newstalk ZB and Radio Live. Their sports sister networks, Radio Sport and TAB Trackside also largely broadcast in a talk format. Other stations such as Radio New Zealand National have a large component of talk-based content but do not have talk-back (i.e. listener phone-ins).

Newstalk ZB is the New Zealand market leader, but Radio Live is continuing to try to establish itself with a greater presence in the talk radio market since its inception in 2005.

==Philippines==
Almost all AM radio stations are talk stations. A few stations from Radio Mindanao Network and Bombo Radyo are on FM. Radyo 5 News FM (now True FM) is the first talk radio station in the Philippines.

==Poland==
There is two talk radio station in Poland, called TOK FM, which is owned by Agora SA, a Polish media company. Its programmes are broadcast in 10 large cities including Warsaw, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań, and Katowice. The programme is also available via the Internet and transmitted by the Hot Bird constellation. It was founded in 1998 as &quot;Inforadio&quot;

Second talk radio station called Radio Wnet, which is owned by Radio Wnet sp. z o.o., a Polish media company. Its programmes are broadcast in two large cities including Warsaw (87.8 MHz), Kraków (95,2 MHz). The programme is available via Internet. It was founded on 25 May 2009 by Krzysztof Skowroński, Grzegorz Wasowski, Katarzyna Adamiak-Sroczyńska and Monika Makowska-Wasowska, Wojciech Cejrowski and Jerzy Jachowicz.

==Spain==
Talk radio in Spain is very popular, where the most important radio stations are exclusively dedicated to talk shows, such as Cadena Ser, Cadena Cope, Onda Cero, Radio Nacional, or Punto Radio. There is a very wide variety of topics, such as politics, sport, comedy, and culture.

Sport talk shows are particularly relevant, since football attracts a massive interest in Spain, with a special focus on FC Barcelona and Real Madrid CF, and the men&#x27;s national football team. Typically the programming of main talk radio stations is modified whenever there is a major football event, such as a La Liga or a national team match. Daily late-night sport (football) talk shows are also very relevant, with a very intense competition of the radio stations in this time slot which typically starts around midnight.

Comedy morning talk shows are also very popular in music radio stations (40 principales, M80 radio, Europa FM, and others), where there is strong competition since it is also a very important time slot, when typically people going to the workplace listen to the radio in their cars early in the morning (around 7am to 8am).

As Spain has large English-speaking communities from many different countries, it is a natural place for English language talk radio broadcasting.

The first Talk radio station in English was Coastline Radio broadcasting from Nerja, Costa del Sol. It is now a music station. A group of English expats set up OCI International in the early 1990s. Based in Marbella on the Costa del Sol, it was owned by the ONCE National Spanish Network. It provided a link for the English-speaking expats living on the coast, as well as some content for Scandinavian expats. OCI was closed down in 2007 to make way for Radio Europa music. In 2004 REM FM began broadcasting, with shows mostly fronted by former OCI presenters. The station closed in 2008.

In 2008, Talk Radio Europe began broadcasting. It offers a 24-hour schedule of news, interviews, discussion, and debate and is a World Media Partner with BBC World Service and is affiliated to IRN/SKY News. Talk Radio Europe broadcasts in FM on the Costa del Sol, Costa Almeria, Costa Blanca, and across the island of Mallorca in English. It is available on the Internet and all smartphone platforms.

==United Kingdom==
Talk radio in the United Kingdom is popular, though not as much as music radio. Nationwide talk stations include BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 4 Extra, Talkradio, Talksport and Times Radio. Regional stations include BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio Wales. Many BBC Local Radio stations and some commercial stations offer a talk format, for example, BBC Radio London, the BBC&#x27;s flagship local station. Other notable commercial talk stations include London&#x27;s LBC which pioneered the newstalk format in Europe. LBC currently operates two services – LBC, a newstalk station on FM (London) and via several digital platforms nationally including DAB and Freeview; and LBC News, a rolling news station on AM in London and DAB+ nationally. There are many specialised talk services such as Bloomberg, a financial news station, and Asian Radio Live.

Talk radio expanded dramatically when the BBC&#x27;s monopoly on radio broadcasting was ended in the 1970s with the launch of Independent Local Radio.

Some notable British talk radio presenters include Jenni Murray, John Humphrys, Martha Kearney, Jonathan Dimbleby, Libby Purves, Laurie Taylor, Pam Ayres, Melvyn Bragg, Tommy Boyd, James Whale, Steve Allen, Nick Abbot, Iain Lee, James Stannage, George Galloway, Julia Hartley-Brewer, Ian Collins, John Nicoll, Brian Hayes, Scottie McClue, James O&#x27;Brien, Nicky Campbell, and Simon Mayo. Pete Price on CityTalk is also known as the DJ who rushed to the aid of a regular caller who died live on air during a call. Previously, he had kept a teenager talking for 45 minutes before meeting him to convince him not to commit suicide.

==United States==
Talk radio is most popular on the AM band. &quot;Non-commercial&quot;, usually referred to as &quot;public radio&quot;, which is mainly located in a reserved spectrum of the FM band, also broadcasts talk programs. Commercial all-talk stations can also be found on the FM band in many cities across the US. These shows often rely less on political discussion and analysis than their AM counterparts and often employ the use of pranks and &quot;bits&quot; for entertainment purposes. In the United States and Canada, satellite radio services offer uncensored &quot;free-wheeling&quot; original programming. ABC News &amp; Talk is an example of &quot;repackaging&quot; for the digital airwaves shows featured on their terrestrial radio stations.

===History===
Expressing and debating political opinions has been a staple of radio since the medium&#x27;s infancy. Aimee Semple McPherson began her radio broadcasts in the early 1920s and even purchased her station, KFSG which went on the air in February 1924; by the mid-1930s, controversial radio priest Father Charles Coughlin&#x27;s radio broadcasts were reaching millions per week. There was also a national current events forum called America&#x27;s Town Meeting of the Air which broadcast once a week starting in 1935. It featured panel discussions from some of the biggest newsmakers and was among the first shows to allow audience participation: members of the studio audience could question the guests or even heckle them.

Talk radio as a listener-participation format has existed since the 1930s. John J. Anthony (1902–1970) was an announcer and DJ on New York&#x27;s WMRJ. It was located in the Merrick Radio Store at 12 New York Boulevard in Jamaica, Long Island. After some marital troubles, refusing to pay alimony and child support, he sought professional help and began his radio series where listeners would call in with their problems in 1930. Radio historians consider this the first instance of talk radio.

While working for New York&#x27;s WMCA in 1945, Barry Gray was bored with playing music and put a telephone receiver up to his microphone to talk with bandleader Woody Herman. This was soon followed by listener call-ins and Gray is often billed as &quot;the hot mama of talk radio&quot;. Herb Jepko was another pioneer.

Author Bill Cherry proposed George Roy Clough as the first to invite listeners to argue politics on a call-in radio show at KLUF, his station in Galveston, Texas, as a way to bring his political views into listeners&#x27; homes. (He later became Mayor of Galveston). Cherry gives no specific date, but the context of events and history of the station would seem to place it also in the 1940s, perhaps earlier. The format was the classic mode in which the announcer gave the topic for that day, and listeners called in to debate the issue.

In 1948, Alan Courtney – New York disk jockey and co-composer of the popular song &quot;Joltin&#x27; Joe DiMaggio&quot; – began a call-in program for the Storer station in Miami, Florida (WGBS) and then on Miami&#x27;s WQAM, WINZ and WCKR. The &quot;Alan Courtney Open Phone Forum&quot; flourished as an avowedly conservative and anti-communist political forum with a coverage area over the Southeastern U.S. and Cuba.

Joe Pyne, John Nebel, Jean Shepherd, and Jerry Williams (WMEX-Boston) were among the first to explore the medium in the 1950s.

A breakthrough in talk radio occurred in 1960 at KLAC in Los Angeles. Alan Henry, a broadcaster in his early thirties, had been hired by John Kluge, president of Metromedia in 1963. Henry had previously worked in such diverse markets as Miami, Florida; Waterloo, Iowa; Hartford, Connecticut; and St. Louis, Missouri. KLAC was dead last in the ratings but Kluge wanted a big Metromedia presence in Los Angeles. He sent Henry from New York to Los Angeles to turn KLAC into a success. The first thing that Henry did was hire the legendary morning team of Lohman and Barkley. Henry had built a strong relationship with programmer Jim Lightfoot, who had joined Henry in Miami. A unique opportunity presented itself when Joe Pyne, who had begun his career as a radio talk personality in Pennsylvania, was fired by KABC in Los Angeles. The speculation was that Pyne was too controversial and confrontational for the ABC corporate culture. Henry hired Pyne on the spot and paid him $25,000 a year, which was then a huge salary for a radio personality. Pyne was given the night show on KLAC. Part of the agreement with Pyne was that Henry and Lightfoot would give him broad control of his program content.

The show was an immediate success. Henry encouraged the confrontation with listeners and guests for which Pyne became famous. Pyne coined the line &quot;Go gargle with razor blades,&quot; for guests with whom he disagreed. The Pyne show was the beginning of the confrontational talk format that later spread across the radio spectrum. At one point in the 1960s, the Joe Pyne show was syndicated on over 250 radio stations in the United States.

In an odd turn of events, Pyne&#x27;s radio show led him to television. Henry suggested to John Kluge that Joe Pyne should be put on Metromedia&#x27;s newly acquired TV station in Los Angeles, KTTV-TV. Kluge told Henry to speak to KTTV-TV general manager Al Kriven, but Henry had already done that, and Kriven had adamantly refused. Kluge telephoned Kriven, and Pyne soon became the nation&#x27;s first controversial late-night talk television host. &quot;The Joe Pyne Show&quot; on KTTV-TV quickly shot to the top of the ratings. The format later proliferated on cable television with a variety of new hosts, many of them taking on a similar persona to Joe Pyne. Joe Pyne and Alan Henry were major factors in establishing a new trend in radio and television programming. Alan Henry elaborates on the launching of Joe Pyne on KLAC radio and KTTV-TV in his memoir &quot;A Man and His Medium&quot;.

Two radio stations – KMOX, 1120 AM in St. Louis, Missouri, and KABC, 790 AM in Los Angeles – adopted an all-talk show format in 1960, and both claim to be the first to have done so. KABC station manager Ben Hoberman and KMOX station manager Robert Hyland independently developed the all-talk format. KTKK, 630 AM in Salt Lake City, then known as KSXX, adopted a full-time talk schedule in 1965 and is the third station in the country to have done so. KSXX started with all local talent, and KTKK, which now airs on 1640 AM, has a larger portion of its schedule featuring local talent than most other stations that run a full schedule of talk.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, as many listeners abandoned AM music formats for the high fidelity sound of FM radio, the talk radio format began to catch on in more large cities. Former music stations such as KLIF (Dallas, Texas), WLW (Cincinnati, Ohio), WHAS (Louisville, Kentucky), WHAM (Rochester, New York), WLS (Chicago, Illinois), KFI (Los Angeles, California), WRKO (Boston, Massachusetts), WKBW (Buffalo, New York), and WABC (New York, New York) made the switch to all-talk as their ratings slumped due to listener migration to the FM band. Since the turn of the 21st century, with many music listeners now migrating to digital platforms such as Pandora Radio, Sirius XM Radio, and the numerous variations of the iPod, talk radio has been expanding on the FM side of the dial as well.

===Shock===
Hot talk, also called FM talk or shock talk, is a talk radio format geared predominantly to a male demographic between the ages of 18 and 49. It generally consists of pop culture subjects on FM radio rather than the political talk found on AM radio. Hosts of hot talk shows are usually known as &quot;shock jocks&quot;.

Clear Channel Communications (which became iHeartMedia in 2015) has a select few hot talk stations under the moniker &quot;Real Radio&quot;, while CBS Radio once had a larger chain of hot talkers known as Free FM, though the brand was abandoned after a post-Howard Stern attempt to network the format failed within a year. It is usually found on FM radio active rock, classic rock, and country stations in morning drive, as the actual hot talk formatted stations have only achieved mediocre success as a whole compared to AM or conservative talk radio, or even FM music radio. It is also effectively a format that is unviable during an average workday in North America, due to the format&#x27;s tendency to discuss topics wholly inappropriate for a workplace setting, and outside of discussions of attractiveness, largely repels women as regular listeners.

In March 2018, CBS Radio&#x27;s corporate successor Entercom (now Audacy, Inc.) attempted a hot talk format in San Diego with KEGY &quot;97.3 The Machine&quot;. It featured a weekday lineup devoted to hot talk programs, blocks of classic rock interspersed with comedy bits during off-peak hours, and coverage of San Diego Padres baseball. However, the station attracted controversy later that month, when an advertisement for the station&#x27;s forthcoming morning show &quot;Kevin Klein Live&quot; (which invited listeners to &quot;jump ... to a new morning show&quot;, accompanied by a picture of the Coronado Bridge) was criticized for glorifying suicide by bridge jumping. The ensuing controversy prompted the Padres to scrutinize KEGY&#x27;s direction; executive Ron Fowler voiced concerns over the team being associated with KEGY&#x27;s &quot;shock jock&quot; content, threatening to possibly cut ties with the station and Entercom. Kevin Klein&#x27;s program never premiered, and the hot talk format was ultimately dropped on April 12, 2018, in favor of a conventional sports format as &quot;97.3 The Fan&quot;.

In 2019, JVC Media began to establish a hot talk network in Florida branded as &quot;Florida Man Radio&quot; (in reference to the &quot;Florida Man&quot; internet meme), beginning with WDYZ in Orlando. The network has picked up personalities such as Shannon Burke and Ed Tyll, with the syndicated &quot;Bubba the Love Sponge&quot; serving as its morning show. In 2022, after receiving the station in a trade from Audacy, Beasley Broadcast Group&#x27;s KXTE in Las Vegas shifted to a hot talk format for its weekday lineup, which consists primarily of syndicated morning shows (including &quot;Dave and Mahoney&quot;, for which it is the flagship station, as well as &quot;Free Beer and Hot Wings&quot;, and &quot;Dave &amp; Chuck the Freak&quot; from sister WRIF in Detroit).

The genre has also shown up on satellite radio and in podcasting, which typically have more creative freedom due to the lack of indecency rules and lower reliance on corporate advertising.

Other U.S. hosts specialize in talk radio comedy, such as Phil Hendrie, who voices his fictional guests and occasionally does parodies of other programs.

===Political===

The United States saw dramatic growth in the popularity of talk radio during the 1990s due to the repeal of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s post-war Fairness Doctrine of 1949, in 1987. The mandate of the Fairness Doctrine was to require that audiences were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints.

It had required the holders of broadcast licenses to &quot;present controversial issues of public importance&quot; and to do so in a manner that was, in the commission&#x27;s view, &quot;honest, equitable and balanced&quot;. Its repeal provided an opportunity for a kind of partisan political programming with commercial appeal that had not previously existed.

The most successful pioneer in the early 1990s&#x27; talk radio movement in the US was the politically conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh&#x27;s success demonstrated that there was a nationwide market for a passionately delivered conservative polemic on contemporary news, events, and social trends, and changed the face of how the talk radio business was conducted. Unrestrained (by the Fairness Doctrine), cheering for one&#x27;s political party, and especially against the other, had become popular entertainment which rapidly changed the way politics nationally was discussed, perceived, and conducted.

Other radio talk show hosts (who describe themselves as either conservative or libertarian) have also had success as nationally syndicated hosts, including Hugh Hewitt, Sean Hannity, Jon Arthur, Glenn Beck, Michael Medved, Laura Ingraham, Neal Boortz, Michael Savage, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Larry Gaiters, and Mark Levin.

The Salem Radio Network syndicates a group of religiously oriented Republican activists, including evangelical Christian Hugh Hewitt and Jewish conservatives Dennis Prager and Michael Medved; these are mostly distributed in a 24-hour network format among Salem&#x27;s stations, and they generally earn ratings much less than their syndicated counterparts.

In the summer of 2007, conservative talk show hosts mobilized public opposition to the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform bill, which eventually failed. Conservative hosts Limbaugh, Ingraham, Bennett, Prager, Hannity, Beck, Levin, and Hewitt coalesced around endorsing former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for president at the end of January 2008 (after Fred Thompson, the described favorite of some of the hosts, dropped out), to oppose the nomination of Senator John McCain; however, Romney suspended his campaign in February of the same year and endorsed McCain. During the primaries, Limbaugh in particular had endorsed a plan to do whatever it took to prolong the Democrats&#x27; nomination by encouraging political conservatives to cross over to the Democrats and voting for the trailing candidate, a plan he called &quot;Operation Chaos&quot;.

Conservative talk show hosts also lent their unified support for congressional candidate Doug Hoffman, a conservative third-party candidate who was running in New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district special election, 2009, against a liberal Republican (Dierdre Scozzafava) and a mainstream Democrat (Bill Owens). The unified support from the conservative base helped propel Hoffman to frontrunner status and effectively killed Scozzafava&#x27;s campaign, forcing her to drop out of the race several days before the election. This effort backfired on the conservative hosts, as the Democratic candidate Owens won in part thanks to Scozzafava&#x27;s endorsement of Owens. Local hosts, such as Los Angeles&#x27;s John and Ken, have also proven effective in influencing the political landscape.

Libertarians such as Dennis Miller (based in Los Angeles), Jon Arthur, host of &quot;Jon Arthur Live!&quot; (based in Florida), Patti Brooks KGMI (based in the Pacific Northwest), Free Talk Live (based in New Hampshire), Penn Jillette (based in Las Vegas), Jay Severin (based in Boston, Massachusetts), and Mark Davis (based in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas) have also achieved some success. Many of these hosts also publish books, write newspaper columns, appear on television, and give public lectures.

Politically liberal talk radio aimed at a national audience also emerged in the mid-2000s. Air America, a network featuring &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot;, was founded in 2004. It billed itself as a &quot;progressive alternative&quot; to the conservative talk radio shows.

Some prominent examples of liberal talk radio shows either previously or currently in national syndication include: Dial Global talk show hosts Ed Schultz (who moved on to hosting on MSNBC and later on RT America), Stephanie Miller, Thom Hartmann, and Bill Press; Norman Goldman (not with Dial Global and is a self-described independent) is still included on syndication stations – see WCPT (AM). Goldman began as the high-rating fill-in host and &quot;Senior Legal Analyst&quot; for Ed Schultz before launching his show; The Young Turks; Fox former co-host of Hannity and Colmes, Alan Colmes, First Amendment Radio Network libertarian host Jon Arthur, and Mike Malloy, progressive radio WFTE FM&#x27;s Dorothy And Dick, and Premiere&#x27;s Randi Rhodes (not on radio 2015).

In some markets, local liberal hosts have existed for years, such as the British talk host Michael Jackson (who was on the air at KABC in Los Angeles beginning in 1968 and is currently at KMZT); Bernie Ward in San Francisco; Jack Ellery in New Jersey and Tampa; Dave Ross in Seattle, and Marc Germain in Los Angeles. A few earlier syndicated programs were hosted by prominent Democrats who were not experienced broadcasters, such as Jim Hightower, Jerry Brown, Mario Cuomo, and Alan Dershowitz; these met with limited success, and Air America has been faced with various legal and financial problems.

Air America was sold to a new owner in March 2007, hired well-known programmer David Bernstein, and began its &quot;re-birth.&quot; Bernstein subsequently left in early 2008, but the struggling network remained on the air with a revamped line-up.

On January 21, 2010, Air America radio ceased live programming citing a difficulty with the current economic environment and announced that it would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy production and liquidate itself. The network ended operations on January 25, 2010.

Clear Channel/iHeartMedia, with nearly 1,300 radio stations under its ownership – along with other owners – has in recent years added more liberal talk stations to their portfolio. These have primarily come from the conversion of AM facilities, most of which formerly had adult standards formats. Many complaints (all radio stations are required by the FCC to maintain, in their public files, copies of all correspondence from the public relating to station operations – for a period of three years from receipt) have been received from fans of this musical genre (Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, big band music,&quot; etc.) – but the left-leaning talk programming leans toward a much younger demographic, a group that advertisers covet. More recently, however, Clear Channel has been dropping liberal formats in favor of their own Fox Sports Radio network. By 2014, most liberal talk stations had abandoned the format, forcing hosts to find other ways to distribute their programming.

Liberal opinion radio has long existed on the Pacifica network, though only available in a small number of major cities, and in formats that more often act as a volunteer-run community forum than as a platform for charismatic hosts who would be likely to attract a large audience. The one major host to become popular on the network is Amy Goodman, whose &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; interview and journalism program is broadcast nationwide.

Conservative critics have long complained that the long-format news programming on National Public Radio (NPR) shows a liberal bias, although this was disputed once in 2004 by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a &quot;progressive&quot; media criticism organization, which found that, for example, &quot;representatives of think tanks to the right of center outnumbered those to the left of center by more than four to one: 62 appearances to 15.&quot;
National Public Radio itself denies any partisan agenda. Politically oriented talk programs on the network are in the mold of &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, which was designed to be a soundboard for the varied opinions of listeners.

While politically oriented talk is still heard on the AM dial (mostly the conservative format), it has seen some expanding onto the FM dial. One notable example was WPGB in Pittsburgh, which switched to a talk format in 2004 after years of having several different music formats, branding itself as &quot;FM News Talk 104.7&quot; due to the relative uncommonness of politically oriented talk on the FM side of the dial even in 2013 while FM talk, in general, has expanded. Owned by Clear Channel and stylized as one of Clear Channel&#x27;s typical conservative-leaning AM talk stations, WPGB&#x27;s ratings were steadily high during its time as a talk station, whereas the station&#x27;s numerous music formats were among the lowest in the Pittsburgh market before switching. Clear Channel, which owns WPGB, has shifted some of their talk stations from full-power FM signals to lower-range translator stations which use AM or HD Radio subchannel stations to originate those broadcasts; WPGB fired its morning show in December 2013 and switched back to music in August 2014, selling the format rights to AM station WJAS.

===Insults, advice and mystery===
There had been some precursors for talk radio show stars, such as the Los Angeles-area controversialist Joe Pyne, who would attack callers on his program in the early 1960s – one of his famous insults was &quot;gargle with razor blades&quot;; the similar Bob Grant in New York City; and Wally George in Southern California.

Talk radio also included personal relationship consultants such as Laura Schlessinger and Barbara De Angelis both heard on KFI AM in Los Angeles. Host Larry Elder on KABC (AM) was a lawyer before entering the talk radio market. Leo Laporte offers consumers computer advice. Business and real estate advice shows, paid health supplement presentations and religious programs are widely available.

Paranormal radio shows have had a place on radio for several decades; while the format has never been successful on a full-time basis, it has proven popular in the overnight graveyard slot. Long John Nebel&#x27;s program was one of the first to devote itself to the concept before it was further fleshed out by Art Bell, whose &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; went on to have comparable popularity to daytime talk hosts of his era. Bell had a long-running, on-and-off relationship with the show he founded, often leaving the show and returning on an erratic basis, also starting up new shows such as &quot;Dreamland&quot;, &quot;Art Bell&#x27;s Dark Matter,&quot; and &quot;Midnight in the Desert&quot; only to quit them a few weeks into their run; Bell died in 2018. &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; continues with George Noory as the permanent lead host, with a rotating host on weekends. Clyde Lewis and Jason Hawes also host nationally syndicated paranormal shows.

===Sports===
Sports talk radio can be found locally and nationally in the US; as of 2013, five national full-time sports talk networks exist. The oldest existing network, dating to 1991, is SportsMap (although it has only been branded as such since 2020 and has rebranded frequently over the years). Market leader ESPN Radio followed shortly thereafter in 1992, followed by Fox Sports Radio c. 2000 and the near-concurrent entries of CBS Sports Radio (now Infinity Sports Network) and NBC Sports Radio in late 2012 and early 2013. Most of these, however, air on weak, low-budget AM stations; the most successful sports talk stations operate primarily with local programs and supplement their programming with the broadcasting of sports events, usually involving the local teams in the major professional sports leagues. This adds significant expenses to the station&#x27;s operations, and must be balanced carefully with the regular talk schedule, as an incendiary view about the team by a host can lead to that team pulling their broadcasts from the station.

Local stations may also hire personalities with polarizing opinions about sports topics and athletes to make some kind of national impact that might turn off listeners, and in large markets, sports talk stations may be made up of personalities who pay stations for their show time and their advertising, disallowing any natural flow between each program, along with in-station competitions about whose show has the most impact.

===Ratings===
Pew researchers found in 2004 that 17% of the public regularly listens to talk radio. This audience is mostly male, middle-aged, and conservative. Among those who regularly listen to talk radio, 41% are Republican and 28% are Democrats. Furthermore, 45% describe themselves as conservatives, compared with 18% who say they are progressive/liberals. In 2011, the Arbitron portable people meter ratings system, compiled data suggesting that out of 11 nationally rated radio formats, talk radio had lost nearly the most market share and ratings continue to slide. In 2013, Arbitron&#x27;s executive summary noted that &quot; 92% of consumers aged 12 years and older listen to the radio each week&quot; and &quot;news-talk-information and talk-personality remained number one in PPM markets and number two in the rest of the U.S.&quot;

Some of the most-listened-to radio programs in the United States are talk radio shows or have talk radio elements like &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

<text>The thyroid, or thyroid gland, is an endocrine gland in vertebrates. In humans, it is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck below the Adam&#x27;s apple. It consists of two connected lobes. The lower two thirds of the lobes are connected by a thin band of tissue called the isthmus (: isthmi). Microscopically, the functional unit of the thyroid gland is the spherical thyroid follicle, lined with follicular cells (thyrocytes), and occasional parafollicular cells that surround a lumen containing colloid. 

The thyroid gland secretes three hormones: the two thyroid hormonestriiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)and a peptide hormone, calcitonin. The thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis and growth and development in children. Calcitonin plays a role in calcium homeostasis. 

Secretion of the two thyroid hormones is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland. TSH is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is produced by the hypothalamus.

Thyroid disorders include hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid inflammation (thyroiditis), thyroid enlargement (goitre), thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is the autoimmune disorder Graves&#x27; disease. Hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficient secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is iodine deficiency. In iodine-deficient regions, hypothyroidism (due to iodine deficiency) is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in children. In iodine-sufficient regions, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis. 
== Structure ==
===Features===
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ composed of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow tissue band, called an &quot;isthmus&quot;. It weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 2 cm thick and the isthmus about 1.25 cm in height and width. The gland is usually larger in women than in men, and increases in size during pregnancy.

The thyroid is near the front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam&#x27;s apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The infrahyoid muscles lie in front of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, larynx, lower pharynx and esophagus all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament. Typically, four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the thyroid capsule, at the back of the thyroid lobes.

The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septa that divide the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland, also known as Berry&#x27;s ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with the movement of these cartilages when swallowing occurs.

===Blood, lymph and nerve supply===
The thyroid is supplied with arterial blood from the superior thyroid artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.

Lymphatic drainage frequently passes the prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located just above the isthmus) and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. The gland receives parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

===Variation===

There are many variants in the size and shape of the thyroid gland, and in the position of the embedded parathyroid glands.

Sometimes there is a third lobe present called the &quot;pyramidal lobe&quot;. When present, this lobe often stretches up to the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette&#x27;s pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct, which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland&#x27;s descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn at the back of the thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl&#x27;s tubercle.

Other variants include a levator muscle of thyroid gland, connecting the isthmus to the body of the hyoid bone, and the presence of the small thyroid ima artery.

===Microanatomy===
At the microscopic level, there are three primary features of the thyroid—thyroid follicles, thyroid follicular cells, and parafollicular cells, first discovered by Geoffery Websterson in 1664.

;Follicles
Thyroid follicles are small spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in diameter that play the main role in thyroid function. They consist of a rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein.

;Follicular cells
The core of a follicle is surrounded by a single layer of follicular cells. When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.

;Follicular lumen
The &quot;follicular lumen&quot; is the fluid-filled space within a follicle of the thyroid gland. There are hundreds of follicles within the thyroid gland. A follicle is formed by a spherical arrangement of follicular cells. The follicular lumen is filled with &quot;colloid&quot;, a concentrated solution of thyroglobulin and is the site of synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).

;Parafollicular cells
Scattered among follicular cells and in spaces between the spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell, parafollicular cells. These cells secrete calcitonin and so are also called C cells.

==Development==

In the development of the embryo, at 3–4 weeks gestational age, the thyroid gland appears as an epithelial proliferation in the floor of the pharynx at the base of the tongue between the &quot;tuberculum impar&quot; and the &quot;copula linguae&quot;. The copula soon becomes covered over by the hypopharyngeal eminence at a point later indicated by the foramen cecum. The thyroid then descends in front of the pharyngeal gut as a bilobed diverticulum through the thyroglossal duct. Over the next few weeks, it migrates to the base of the neck, passing in front of the hyoid bone. During migration, the thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal, the thyroglossal duct. At the end of the fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over the following two weeks the detached thyroid migrates to its final position.

The fetal hypothalamus and pituitary start to secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, the production of thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15 ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50 ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.

The neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, also known as C cells, responsible for the production of calcitonin, are derived from foregut endoderm. This part of the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during its descent to its final location.

Aberrations in prenatal development can result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism, and if untreated this can lead to cretinism.

== Function ==
===Thyroid hormones===

The primary function of the thyroid is the production of the iodine-containing thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine or tetraiodothyronine (T4) and the peptide hormone calcitonin. The thyroid hormones are created from iodine and tyrosine. T3 is so named because it contains three atoms of iodine per molecule and T4 contains four atoms of iodine per molecule. The thyroid hormones have a wide range of effects on the human body. These include:

* Metabolic. The thyroid hormones increase the basal metabolic rate and have effects on almost all body tissues. Appetite, the absorption of substances, and gut motility are all influenced by thyroid hormones. They increase the absorption in the gut, generation, uptake by cells, and breakdown of glucose. They stimulate the breakdown of fats, and increase the number of free fatty acids. Despite increasing free fatty acids, thyroid hormones decrease cholesterol levels, perhaps by increasing the rate of secretion of cholesterol in bile. 
* Cardiovascular. The hormones increase the rate and strength of the heartbeat. They increase the rate of breathing, intake and consumption of oxygen, and increase the activity of mitochondria. Combined, these factors increase blood flow and the body&#x27;s temperature. 
* Developmental. Thyroid hormones are important for normal development. They increase the growth rate of young people, and cells of the developing brain are a major target for the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Thyroid hormones play a particularly crucial role in brain maturation during fetal development and first few years of postnatal life
* The thyroid hormones also play a role in maintaining normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns. Increased levels are associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased focus. Sexual function, including libido and the maintenance of a normal menstrual cycle, are influenced by thyroid hormones.

After secretion, only a very small proportion of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely have hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.

Thyroid hormones act by crossing the cell membrane and binding to intracellular nuclear thyroid hormone receptors TR-α1, TR-α2, TR-β1, and TR-β2, which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate DNA transcription. In addition to these actions on DNA, the thyroid hormones also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes, including calcium ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.

===Hormone production===
The thyroid hormones are created from thyroglobulin. This is a protein within the colloid in the follicular lumen that is originally created within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular lumen. Thyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the follicular lumen.

Iodine is essential for the production of the thyroid hormones. Iodine (I0) travels in the blood as iodide (I−), which is taken up into the follicular cells by a sodium-iodide symporter. This is an ion channel on the cell membrane which in the same action transports two sodium ions and an iodide ion into the cell. Iodide then travels from within the cell into the lumen, through the action of pendrin, an iodide-chloride antiporter. In the follicular lumen, the iodide is then oxidized to iodine. This makes it more reactive, and the iodine is attached to the active tyrosine units in thyroglobulin by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. This forms the precursors of thyroid hormones monoiodotyrosine (MIT), and diiodotyrosine (DIT).

When the follicular cells are stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, the follicular cells reabsorb thyroglobulin from the follicular lumen. The iodinated tyrosines are cleaved, forming the thyroid hormones T4, T3, DIT, MIT, and traces of reverse triiodothyronine. T3 and T4 are released into the blood. The hormones secreted from the gland are about 80–90% T4 and about 10–20% T3. Deiodinase enzymes in peripheral tissues remove the iodine from MIT and DIT and convert T4 to T3 and RT3. This is a major source of both RT3 (95%) and T3 (87%) in peripheral tissues.

===Regulation===

The production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.

TRH is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure in order to stimulate thermogenesis. In addition to being suppressed by the presence of thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids.

===Calcitonin===

The thyroid gland also produces the hormone calcitonin, which helps regulate blood calcium levels. Parafollicular cells produce calcitonin in response to high blood calcium. Calcitonin decreases the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts, cells which break down bone. Bone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of calcium into bone. The effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. However, calcitonin seems far less essential than PTH, since calcium metabolism remains clinically normal after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.

== Gene and protein expression ==

About 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells: 70% of these genes are expressed in thyroid cells. Two-hundred and fifty of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid, and about 20 genes are highly thyroid specific. In the follicular cells, the proteins synthesized by these genes direct thyroid hormone synthesis—thyroglobulin, TPO, and IYD; while in the parafollicular c-cells, they direct calcitonin synthesis—CALCA, and CALCB.

== Clinical significance ==
General practitioners, and internal medicine specialists play a role in identifying and monitoring the treatment of thyroid disease. Endocrinologists and thyroidologists are thyroid specialists. Thyroid surgeons or otolaryngologists are responsible for the surgical management of thyroid disease.

=== Functional disorders ===

====Hyperthyroidism====
Excessive production of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism. Causes include Graves&#x27; disease, toxic multinodular goitre, solitary thyroid adenoma, inflammation, and a pituitary adenoma which secretes excess TSH. Another cause is excess iodine availability, either from excess ingestion, induced by the drug amiodarone, or following iodinated contrast imaging.

Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.

Long-term management of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Alternatively, radioactive iodine-131 can be used to destroy thyroid tissue: radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by thyroid cells, which over time destroys them. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which innervates the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will inevitably result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.

====Hypothyroidism====
An underactive thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical symptoms are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is the most common cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.

Hypothyroidism is managed with replacement of the thyroid hormones. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take a few weeks to become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.

===Diseases===
====Graves&#x27; disease====

Graves&#x27; disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves&#x27; disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves&#x27; disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves&#x27; disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.

====Nodules====
Thyroid nodules are often found on the gland, with a prevalence of 4–7%. The majority of nodules do not cause any symptoms, thyroid hormone secretion is normal, and they are non-cancerous. Non-cancerous cases include simple cysts, colloid nodules, and thyroid adenomas. Malignant nodules, which only occur in about 5% of nodules, include follicular, papillary, medullary carcinomas and metastasis from other sites. Nodules are more likely in females, those who are exposed to radiation, and in those who are iodine deficient.

When a nodule is present, thyroid function tests determine whether the nodule is secreting excess thyroid hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound is often used to investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.

The presence of multiple nodules is called a multinodular goitre; and if it is associated with hyperthyroidism, it is called a toxic multinodular goitre.

====Goitre====
An enlarged thyroid gland is called a goitre. Goitres are present in some form in about 5% of people, and are the result of a large number of causes, including iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease (both Graves&#x27; disease and Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis), infection, inflammation, and infiltrative disease such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Sometimes no cause can be found, a state called &quot;simple goitre&quot;.

Some forms of goitre are associated with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres may be associated with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.

====Inflammation====

Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis, and may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types of thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel&#x27;s thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.

Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder in which the thyroid gland is infiltrated by the lymphocytes B cell and T cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto&#x27;s is more common in females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis are Type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison&#x27;s disease vitiligo.

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs sometimes following childbirth. After delivery, the thyroid becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and, usually, a return to normal function. The course of the illness takes place over several months, and is characterised by a painless goitre. Antibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing. The inflammation usually resolves without treatment, although thyroid hormone replacement may be needed during the period of hypothyroidism.

====Cancer====

The most common tumor affecting the thyroid is a benign adenoma, usually presenting as a painless mass in the neck. Thyroid cancers are most often carcinomas, although cancer can occur in any tissue that the thyroid consists of, including cancer of C-cells and lymphomas. Cancers from other sites also rarely lodge in the thyroid. Radiation of the head and neck presents a risk factor for thyroid cancer, and cancer is more common in women than men, occurring at a rate of about 2:1.

In most cases, thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck. It is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier in the course of disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine-needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.

Thyroid cancers are treated by removing the whole or part of thyroid gland. Radioactive Iodine-131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. Thyroxine is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH may stimulate recurrence. With the exception of the rare anaplastic thyroid cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent prognosis and can even be considered curable.

====Congenital====
A persistent thyroglossal duct is the most common clinically significant birth defect of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.

Infants with thyroid hormone deficiency (congenital hypothyroidism) can manifest problems of physical growth and development as well as brain development, termed cretinism. Children with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with levothyroxine, which facilitates normal growth and development.

Mucinous, clear secretions may collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3 cm in diameter. These are present in the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.

Another disorder is that of thyroid dysgenesis which can result in various presentations of one or more misplaced accessory thyroid glands. These can be asymptomatic.

====Iodine====
Iodine deficiency, most common in inland and mountainous areas, can predispose to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency. The use of iodised salt to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination of salt mandatory.

Because the thyroid concentrates iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In the event of large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken in the form of potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following the accident.

Excessive iodine intake is uncommon and usually has no effect on the thyroid function. Sometimes though it may cause hyperthyroidism, and sometimes hypothyroidism with a resulting goitre.

===Evaluation===
The thyroid is examined by observation of the gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves up and down with swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping the upper part of the chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton&#x27;s sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. 

An examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Graves&#x27; disease.

===Tests===
Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests, including the measurement of the thyroid hormones, as well as the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).

TSH levels are considered the most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, particularly if the cause of hypothyroidism is thought to be related to insufficient thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.

T3 and T4 can be measured directly. However, as the two thyroid hormones travel bound to other molecules, and it is the &quot;free&quot; component that is biologically active, free T3 and free T4 levels can be measured. T3 is preferred, because in hypothyroidism T3 levels may be normal. The ratio of bound to unbound thyroid hormones is known as the thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR). It is also possible to measure directly the main carriers of the thyroid hormones, thyroglobulin and throxine-binding globulin. Thyroglobulin will also be measurable in a healthy thyroid, and will increase with inflammation, and may also be used to measure the success of thyroid removal or ablation. If successful, thyroglobulin should be undetectable. Lastly, antibodies against components of the thyroid, particularly anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin, can be measured. These may be present in normal individuals but are highly sensitive for autoimmune-related disease.

====Imaging====
Ultrasound of the thyroid may be used to reveal whether structures are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. 

When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine the size and shape of lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.

A fine needle aspiration of a sample of thyroid tissue may be taken in order to evaluate a lesion seen on ultrasound which is then sent for histopathology and cytology.

Computed tomography of the thyroid plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. CT scans often incidentally find thyroid abnormalities, and thereby practically becomes the first investigation modality.

==History==
The thyroid gland received its modern name in the 1600s, when the anatomist Thomas Wharton likened its shape to that of an Ancient Greek shield or . However, the existence of the gland, and of the diseases associated with it, was known long before then.

===Antiquity===
The presence and diseases of the thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years. In 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed (which contain iodine) were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice which has developed in many parts of the world. In Ayurvedic medicine, the book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE described hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and goitre. Aristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases of diffuse toxic goitre. Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a salivary gland. Pliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of goitre in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of goitre. The Chinese pharmacology text &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot;, written ca. 200–250, also refers to goitre.

===Scientific era===
In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci provided the first illustration of the thyroid. In 1543 anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its modern name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name &quot;thyroid gland&quot; is derived from the medical Latin used by Wharton – . means &#x27;gland&#x27; in Latin, and can be traced back to the Ancient Greek word , meaning &#x27;shield-like/shield-shaped&#x27;.

French chemist Bernard Courtois discovered iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as the central ingredient in the thyroid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, a combination of the thyroid hormones, &#x27;iodothyrin&#x27;. David Marine in 1907 proved that iodine is necessary for thyroid function. 

Graves&#x27; disease was described by Robert James Graves in 1834. The role of the thyroid gland in metabolism was demonstrated in 1895 by Adolf Magnus-Levy. Thyroxine was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and triiodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.

In the nineteenth century numerous authors described both cretinism and myxedema, and their relationship to the thyroid. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910. Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis in 1912, antibodies in this disease were demonstrated in 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.

===Surgery===
Either Aetius in the sixth century CE or Persian Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi in 990 CE conducted the first recorded thyroidectomy as a treatment for goitre. Operations remained risky and generally were not successful until the 19th century, when descriptions emerged from a number of authors including Prussian surgeon Theodor Billroth, Swiss surgeon and physiologist Theodor Kocher, American physician Charles Mayo, American surgeons William Halsted and George Crile. These descriptions provided the basis for modern thyroid surgery. Theodor Kocher went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1909 &quot;for his work on the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid gland&quot;.

==Other animals==

The thyroid gland is found in all vertebrates. In fish, it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into distinct lobes. However, in some teleosts, patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere in the body, associated with the kidneys, spleen, heart, or eyes.

In tetrapods, the thyroid is always found somewhere in the neck region. In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands – that is, the right and left lobes are not joined. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.

In larval lampreys, the thyroid originates as an exocrine gland, secreting its hormones into the gut, and associated with the larva&#x27;s filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and amphioxi (lancelets), have a structure very similar to that of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds, though not thyroxine.

Thyroxine is critical to metabolic regulation, and growth throughout the vertebrate clade. Iodine and T4 trigger the change from a plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting, as seen in other predatory animals. A similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, do not transform into land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl. Among amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as propylthiouracil (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. In amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. Iodine, via iodolipids, has favored the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role in the evolution of the human brain.

<text>&quot;The Singularity&quot; is the eighteenth episode of the third season of the American television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they attempt to defeat Hive. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise&#x27;s films. The episode was written by Lauren LeFranc, and directed by Garry A. Brown.

Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell.

&quot;The Singularity&quot; originally aired on ABC on April 26, 2016, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.22 million viewers.

== Plot ==
S.H.I.E.L.D. scrambles to repair the damage Daisy Johnson did to the base, while Phil Coulson, who sustained a leg injury, resolves to defeat Hive and save Daisy. Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons and Lincoln Campbell determine that the effect of Hive&#x27;s infection will prevent those Inhumans he controls from being sedated. Realizing Alisha Whitley would be a powerful asset to Hive, Coulson, Melinda May and Lincoln visit her, where Coulson orders Lincoln to wear a vest that will self-destruct if he is infected, after which May chastises him for his hypocrisy. Lincoln speaks with Alisha, only to find she has already been infected and has gone with Hive, leaving her duplicates to attack them. After he unintentionally causes Alisha&#x27;s duplicates to die, Coulson orders Lincoln to stay out of the field until they have a cure for Hive&#x27;s infection.

Hive and Daisy approach James, revealing they know he has another Kree artifact connected to the orb, which Hive describes as the only thing that can destroy him. They induce his Terrigenesis, giving him the ability to explosively charge objects (in a similar manner to an Extremis combustion), and Hive enthralls him, learning he buried the companion artifact beneath his home. Daisy&#x27;s use of her seismokinetic powers to unearth the artifact attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Coulson and May arrive to find the Inhumans already gone, along with the artifact. The hut is destroyed by a planted bomb, but Coulson protects himself and May with an energy shield projected from his robotic hand.

Meanwhile, Fitz, Simmons and Alphonso &quot;Mack&quot; Mackenzie decide to seek out Holden Radcliffe, who was in charge of Transia&#x27;s work against invasive organisms, before he was fired for his transhumanist beliefs. While continuing to discuss how to proceed with their relationship, Fitz and Simmons infiltrate a transhumanist social club to find Radcliffe, under the guise of geneticists wanting to sell him eye prosthetic technology based on those used for Project Deathlok. Upon meeting Radcliffe they reveal their true intentions and ask for his help to devise a cure for Hive&#x27;s infection, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Hive himself and his Inhuman allies. Alisha abducts Radcliffe, while Daisy subdues Fitz with her powers and warns him of her vision of an agent&#x27;s death, wanting S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop trying to combat Hive, and avoid that future from coming to pass. Mack narrowly escapes James, and Hive approaches Simmons, speaking to her as Will Daniels, using his memories, only for her to shoot him and escape, after deriding him for trying to be someone he murdered. The three agents reconvene at a hotel, where Fitz and Simmons finally consummate their relationship.

Under Coulson&#x27;s direction, Glenn Talbot and the Advanced Threat Containment Unit  (ATCU) use information Gideon Malick provided before his death to neutralize what is left of Hydra, with the exception of the forces commanded by Hive.

In an end tag, Hive brings Daisy, Radcliffe, Alisha, and James (who has chosen the moniker &quot;Hellfire&quot;) to a town he bought with Malick&#x27;s money. Seeking to make Earth &quot;the home Inhumans deserve&quot;, he reveals his intention to recreate the original Kree experiments and convert the entire human race into Inhumans, with Radcliffe&#x27;s medical and scientific help.

<text>Paul Thomas Mann ( , ; ; 6 June 1875 – 12 August 1955) was a German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate. His highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Arthur Schopenhauer.

Mann was a member of the hanseatic Mann family and portrayed his family and class in his first novel, &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;. His older brother was the radical writer Heinrich Mann and three of Mann&#x27;s six children – Erika Mann, Klaus Mann and Golo Mann – also became significant German writers. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Mann fled to Switzerland. When World War II broke out in 1939, he moved to the United States, then returned to Switzerland in 1952. Mann is one of the best-known exponents of the so-called &quot;Exilliteratur&quot;, German literature written in exile by those who opposed the Hitler regime.

==Life==
Paul Thomas Mann was born to a hanseatic family in Lübeck, the second son of Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann (a senator and a grain merchant) and his wife Júlia da Silva Bruhns, a Brazilian woman of German, Portuguese and Native Brazilian ancestry, who emigrated to Germany with her family when she was seven years old. His mother was Roman Catholic but Mann was baptised into his father&#x27;s Lutheran religion. Mann&#x27;s father died in 1891, and after that his trading firm was liquidated. The family subsequently moved to Munich. Mann first studied science at a Lübeck &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (secondary school), then attended the Ludwig Maximillians University of Munich as well as the Technical University of Munich, where, in preparation for a journalism career, he studied history, economics, art history and literature.

Mann lived in Munich from 1891 until 1933, with the exception of a year spent in Palestrina, Italy, with his elder brother, the novelist Heinrich. Thomas worked at the South German Fire Insurance Company in 1894–95. His career as a writer began when he wrote for the magazine &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;. Mann&#x27;s first short story, &quot;Little Mr Friedemann&quot; (&quot;Der Kleine Herr Friedemann&quot;), was published in 1898.

In 1905, Mann married Katia Pringsheim, who came from a wealthy, secular Jewish industrialist family. She later joined the Lutheran church. The couple had six children: Erika (b. 1905), Klaus (b. 1906), Golo (b. 1909), Monika (b. 1910), Elisabeth (b. 1918) and Michael (b. 1919).

Due to the Pringsheim family&#x27;s high financial circumstances, Katia Mann was able to purchase a summer property in Bad Tölz in 1908, on which they built a country house the following year, which they kept until 1917. In 1914 they also purchased a villa in Munich (at Poschinger Str in the borough of Bogenhausen, today 10 Thomas-Mann-Allee) where they lived until 1933. 

===Pre-war and Second World War period===
In 1912, Katia was treated for tuberculosis for a few months in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland, where Thomas Mann visited her for a few weeks, which inspired him to write his novel &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, published in 1924. He was also appalled by the risk of international confrontation between Germany and France, following the Agadir Crisis in Morocco, and later by the outbreak of the First World War. The novel ends with the outbreak of this war, in which the hero perishes.

As a “German patriot,” Mann had the proceeds from their summer house used in 1917 to subscribe to war bonds, which lost their face value after the war was lost. His father-in-law did the same, which caused a loss of a major part of the Pringsheim family&#x27;s wealth. The disastrous inflation of 1923 and 1924 resulted in additional high losses. The sales success of his novel &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, published in 1924, improved his financial situation again, as did the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. He used the prize money to build a cottage in the fishing village of Nida, Lithuania on the Curonian Spit, where there was a German art colony and where he spent the summers of 1930–1932 working on &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot;. Today, the cottage is a cultural center dedicated to him, with a small memorial exhibition.

In February 1933, while having finished a book tour to Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, Thomas Mann recovered in Arosa (Switzerland) when Hitler took power and Mann heard from his eldest children, Klaus and Erika in Munich, that it would not be safe for him to return to Germany. His political views (see chapter below) had made him an enemy of the Nazis for years. He was doubtful at first, because, with a certain naïveté, he could not imagine the violence of the overthrow and the persecution of opponents of the regime, but the children insisted, and their advice later turned out to be accurate when it emerged that even their driver-caretaker had become an informant and that Mann&#x27;s immediate arrest would have been very likely. The family (except these two children who went to Amsterdam) emigrated to Küsnacht, near Zürich, Switzerland, after a stopover in Sanary-sur-Mer, France. The son Golo managed, at great risk, to smuggle the already completed chapters of the &quot;Joseph&quot; novel and the (sensitive) diaries into Switzerland. The Bavarian Political Police searched Mann&#x27;s house in Munich and confiscated the house, its inventory and the bank accounts. At the same time, an arrest warrant was issued. Mann was also no longer able to use his holiday home in Lithuania because it was only a few hundred yards from the German border and he seemed to be at risk there. When all members of the Poetry Section at the Prussian Academy of Arts were asked to make a declaration of loyalty to the National Socialist government, Mann declared his resignation on March 17, 1933.

The writer&#x27;s freedom of movement was reduced when his German passport expired. The Manns traveled to the United States for the first two times in 1934 and 1935. There was great interest in the prominent writer; the authorities allowed him entry without a valid passport. He received Czechoslovak citizenship and a passport in 1936, even though he had never lived there. A few weeks later, his German citizenship was revoked – at the same time as his wife Katia and their children Golo, Elisabeth and Michael. Furthermore, the Nazi government now expropriated the family home in Munich, which Reinhard Heydrich in particular insisted on. It had already been confiscated and forcibly rented out in 1933. In December 1936, the University of Bonn withdrew Mann&#x27;s honorary doctorate, which he had been awarded in 1919.

In 1939, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Mann emigrated to the United States, while his in-laws only managed thanks to high-ranking connections to leave Germany for Zurich in October 1939. The Manns moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where they lived on 65 Stockton Street and he began to teach at Princeton University. In 1941 he was designated consultant in German Literature, later Fellow in Germanic Literature, at the Library of Congress. In 1942, the Mann family moved to 1550 San Remo Drive in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The Manns were prominent members of the German expatriate community of Los Angeles and would frequently meet other emigres at the house of Salka and Bertold Viertel in Santa Monica, and at the Villa Aurora, the home of fellow German exile Lion Feuchtwanger. Thomas Mann&#x27;s always difficult relationship with his brother Heinrich, who envied Thomas&#x27;s success and wealth and also differed politically, hardly improved when the latter arrived in California, poor and sickly, in need of support. On 23 June 1944, Thomas Mann was naturalized as a citizen of the United States. The Manns lived in Los Angeles until 1952.

===Anti-Nazi broadcasts===
The outbreak of World War II, on 1 September 1939, prompted Mann to offer anti-Nazi speeches (in German) to the German people via the BBC. In October 1940, he began monthly broadcasts, recorded in the U.S. and flown to London, where the BBC German Service broadcast them to Germany on the longwave band. In these eight-minute addresses, Mann condemned Hitler and his &quot;paladins&quot; as crude philistines completely out of touch with European culture. In one noted speech, he said: &quot;The war is horrible, but it has the advantage of keeping Hitler from making speeches about culture.&quot;

Mann was one of the few publicly active opponents of Nazism among German expatriates in the U.S. In a BBC broadcast of 30 December 1945, Mann expressed understanding as to why those peoples that had suffered from the Nazi regime would embrace the idea of German collective guilt. But he also thought that many enemies might now have second thoughts about &quot;revenge&quot;. And he expressed regret that such judgement cannot be based on the individual:

=== Houses that the Manns lived in ===

===Last years===
With the start of the Cold War, he was increasingly frustrated by rising McCarthyism. As a &quot;suspected communist&quot;, he was required to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he was termed &quot;one of the world&#x27;s foremost apologists for Stalin and company&quot;. He was listed by HUAC as being &quot;affiliated with various peace organizations or Communist fronts&quot;. Being in his own words a non-communist, rather than an anti-communist, Mann openly opposed the allegations: &quot;As an American citizen of German birth, I finally testify that I am painfully familiar with certain political trends. Spiritual intolerance, political inquisitions, and declining legal security, and all this in the name of an alleged &#x27;state of emergency&#x27;. ... That is how it started in Germany.&quot; As Mann joined protests against the jailing of the Hollywood Ten and the firing of schoolteachers suspected of being Communists, he found &quot;the media had been closed to him&quot;. Finally, he was forced to quit his position as Consultant in Germanic Literature at the Library of Congress, and in 1952, he returned to Europe, to live in Kilchberg, near Zürich, Switzerland. Here he initially lived in a rented house and bought his last house there in 1954 (which later his widow and then their son Golo lived in until their deaths). He never again lived in Germany, though he regularly traveled there. His most important German visit was in 1949, at the 200th birthday of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, attending celebrations in Frankfurt am Main (then West Germany) and Weimar (then East Germany), as a statement that German culture extended beyond the new political borders. He also visited Lübeck, where he saw his parents&#x27; house, which was partially destroyed by the bombing of Lübeck in World War II (and only later rebuilt). The city welcomed him warmly, but the patrician hanseatic families gave him a reserved welcome, since the publication of &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; they had resented him for daring to describe their caste with some mockery, as they at least felt about it.

Along with Albert Einstein, Mann was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

===Death===
Following his 80th birthday, Mann went on vacation to Noordwijk in the Netherlands. On 18 July 1955, he began to experience pain and unilateral swelling in his left leg. The condition of thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by Dr. Mulders from Leiden and confirmed by Dr. Wilhelm Löffler. Mann was transported to a Zürich hospital, but soon developed a state of shock. On 12 August 1955, he died. Postmortem, his condition was found to have been misdiagnosed. The pathologic diagnosis, made by Christoph Hedinger, showed he had actually suffered a perforated iliac artery aneurysm resulting in a retroperitoneal hematoma, compression and thrombosis of the iliac vein. (At that time, lifesaving vascular surgery had not been developed.) On 16 August 1955, Thomas Mann was buried in the Kilchberg village cemetery.

===Legacy===
Mann&#x27;s work influenced many later authors, such as Yukio Mishima. Joseph Campbell also stated in an interview with Bill Moyers that Mann was one of his mentors. Many institutions are named in his honour, for instance the Thomas Mann Gymnasium of Budapest.

==Career==
Blanche Knopf of Alfred A. Knopf publishing house was introduced to Mann by H.L. Mencken while on a book-buying trip to Europe. Knopf became Mann&#x27;s American publisher, and Blanche hired scholar Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter to translate Mann&#x27;s books in 1924. Lowe-Porter subsequently translated Mann&#x27;s complete works. Blanche Knopf continued to look after Mann. After &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; proved successful in its first year, the Knopfs sent him an unexpected bonus. Later in the 1930s, Blanche helped arrange for Mann and his family to emigrate to America.

===Nobel Prize in Literature===
Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929, after he had been nominated by Anders Österling, member of the Swedish Academy, principally in recognition of his popular achievements with &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; (1901), &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; (&quot;Der Zauberberg&quot;, 1924), and his numerous short stories. (Due to the personal taste of an influential committee member, only&quot; Buddenbrooks&quot; was cited at any great length.) Based on Mann&#x27;s own family, &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; relates the decline of a merchant family in Lübeck over the course of four generations. &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; (&quot;Der Zauberberg&quot;, 1924) follows an engineering student who, planning to visit his tubercular cousin at a Swiss sanatorium for only three weeks, finds his departure from the sanatorium delayed. During that time, he confronts medicine and the way it looks at the body and encounters a variety of characters, who play out ideological conflicts and discontents of contemporary European civilization. The tetralogy &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot; is an epic novel written over a period of sixteen years and is one of the largest and most significant works in Mann&#x27;s oeuvre. Later novels included &quot;Lotte in Weimar&quot; (1939), in which Mann returned to the world of Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; (1774); &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1947), the story of the fictitious composer Adrian Leverkühn and the corruption of German culture in the years before and during World War II; and &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull&quot; (&quot;Bekenntnisse des Hochstaplers Felix Krull&quot;, 1954), which was unfinished at Mann&#x27;s death. These later works prompted two members of the Swedish Academy to nominate Mann for the Nobel Prize in Literature a second time, in 1948.

==Influence==
The writer Theodor Fontane, who died in 1889, had a particular stylistic influence on Thomas Mann. Of course, Mann always admired and emulated Goethe, the German “poet prince”. The Danish author Herman Bang, with whom he felt a kindred spirit, had a certain influence, especially on the novellas. The pessimistic philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer provided philosophical inspiration for the &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;&#x27; narrative of decline, especially with his two-volume work &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, which Mann studied closely while writing the novel. Russian narrators should also be mentioned, he admired the Russian Literature&#x27;s ability for self-criticism, at least during the 19th century, in Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev. Mann believed that in order to make a bourgeois revolution, the Russians had to forget Dostoevsky. He particularly loved Leo Tolstoy, whom he considered an anarchist and whom he lovingly and mockingly admired for his “courage to be boring.”

Throughout Mann&#x27;s Dostoevsky essay, he finds parallels between the Russian and the sufferings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Speaking of Nietzsche, he says, &quot;his personal feelings initiate him into those of the criminal ... in general all creative originality, all artist nature in the broadest sense of the word, does the same. It was the French painter and sculptor Degas who said that an artist must approach his work in the spirit of the criminal about to commit a crime.&quot; Nietzsche&#x27;s influence on Mann runs deep in his work, especially in Nietzsche&#x27;s views on decay and the proposed fundamental connection between sickness and creativity. Mann believed that disease should not be regarded as wholly negative. In his essay on Dostoevsky, we find: &quot;but after all and above all it depends on who is diseased, who mad, who epileptic or paralytic: an average dull-witted man, in whose illness any intellectual or cultural aspect is non-existent; or a Nietzsche or Dostoyevsky. In their case something comes out in illness that is more important and conducive to life and growth than any medical guaranteed health or sanity... [I]n other words: certain conquests made by the soul and the mind are impossible without disease, madness, crime of the spirit.&quot;

== Thematic and stylistic focuses ==
Many of Thomas Mann&#x27;s works have the following similarities:

* A “gravely-mischievous” style that is very popular with readers, with superficial solemnity and an underlying ironic humor, mostly benevolent, never drastic or bitter and only rarely degenerating into the macabre. Thomas Mann took this &quot;mild irony&quot; from his literary predecessor and role model Theodor Fontane, at first in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; where it is modified into local sedateness through Low German sprinkles and quotations. He continued this style, with variations, throughout his life (the contemporary, much more avant-garde author Alfred Döblin mocked that Mann had &quot;elevated the &quot;pressed crease&quot; to a style principle&quot;). In &quot;Joseph and His Brothers&quot; the tone takes on something fairytale-biblical, but here too the irony often shines through. In &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, Thomas Mann adopts a predominantly serious tone in view of the sinister theme, although the critical irony does not completely disappear there either, for which the description of the nationalist milieu in the Weimar Republic in particular provides ample reason.
* The amusingly entertaining, mostly ironic descriptions of contemporaries as well as people of the past and their views and lifestyles based on his own observations or research, often very detailed, similar to his contemporary Marcel Proust, are combined with various profound components: in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; with the motif of economic and spiritual decline of a family, in &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; with the philosophical disputes of the time before the First World War, in &quot;Lotte in Weimar&quot; with the circumstances of Goethe&#x27;s Weimar Classicism and the complicated effect between real and literary love, in &quot;Joseph and his brothers&quot; with biblical-mythical motifs and the question of origins as well as the eternal recurrence of the same &quot;mythical&quot; stories, in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; with the historical-political circumstances of the rise, success and fall of Nazism.
* Attachment to home regions: Lübeck (Buddenbrooks, Tonio Kröger) and Munich (Gladius Dei, At the Prophet, Disorder and Early Suffering) are in the foreground of important works.
* Classical music already plays a central role in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; and &quot;Tristan&quot; (Mann loved Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas, but also saw him in his essay &quot;Suffering and greatness of Richard Wagner&quot; (1933) as a forerunner of right-wing extremism) and Neue Musik plays the main role in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (about which Mann sought advice from Theodor W. Adorno and gave his hero&#x27;s music features of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s compositional style). The criticism of Wagner would later serve as one of the official pretexts for the Nazis to ostracize Mann as an exile.
* Central to Thomas Mann&#x27;s thoughts and work is the mutual relationship between art and life: &quot;Ambiguity as a system&quot; is also the title of an essay.
* Conscientiousness: Thomas Mann always wrote his works after long and thorough research into the facts and the atmospheric circumstances.
* Political commitment (see below: Political views): His – mostly indirect – commitment runs through many of his works, from the &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; (covering the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary shifts of the entire 19th century) to &quot;Mario and the Magician&quot; (mocking the atmosphere of 1920s Italian fascism) to &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. In contrast to his brother Heinrich and his children Erika and Klaus, Thomas Mann at first advocated a rather conservative stance, especially in the &quot;Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man&quot; (1918), later and in his major works, however, a moderate, centrist and occasionally progressive attitude, while they were more “left-leaning”.
* Homoerotic allusions are also common and recur in many works (see below: Sexuality and literary work).

==Political views==

During World War I, Mann supported the conservatism of Kaiser Wilhelm II, attacked liberalism, and supported the war effort, calling the Great War &quot;a purification, a liberation, an enormous hope&quot;. In his 600-page-long work &quot;Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man&quot; (1918), Mann presented his conservative, anti-modernist philosophy: spiritual tradition over material progress, German patriotism over egalitarian internationalism, and rooted culture over rootless civilisation.

In &quot;On the German Republic&quot; (, 1922), Mann called upon German intellectuals to support the new Weimar Republic. The work was delivered at the Beethovensaal in Berlin on 13 October 1922, and published in &quot;Die neue Rundschau&quot; in November 1922. In the work, Mann developed his eccentric defence of the Republic based on extensive close readings of Novalis and Walt Whitman. Also in 1921, he wrote an essay &quot;Mind and Money&quot; in which he made a very open assessment of his family background: &quot;In any case, I am personally indebted to the capitalist world order from the past, which is why it will never be appropriate for me to spit on it as it is &quot;à la mode&quot; these days.&quot; Thereafter, his political views gradually shifted toward liberal-left. He especially embraced democratic principles when the Weimar Republic was established.

Mann initially gave his support to the left-liberal German Democratic Party before urging unity behind the Social Democrats, probably less for ideological reasons, but because he only trusted the political party of the workers to provide sufficient mass and resistance to the growing Nazism. In 1930, he gave a public address in Berlin titled &quot;An Appeal to Reason&quot;, in which he strongly denounced Nazism and encouraged resistance by the working class. This was followed by numerous essays and lectures in which he attacked the Nazis. At the same time, he expressed increasing sympathy for socialist ideas. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Mann and his wife were on holiday in Switzerland. Due to his strident denunciations of Nazi policies, his son Klaus advised him not to return. In contrast to those of his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus, Mann&#x27;s books were not among those burnt publicly by Hitler&#x27;s regime in May 1933, possibly since he had been the Nobel laureate in literature for 1929. In 1936, the Nazi government officially revoked his German citizenship.

During the war, Mann made a series of anti-Nazi radio-speeches, published as &quot;Listen, Germany!&quot; in 1943. They were recorded on tape in the United States and then sent to the United Kingdom, where the British Broadcasting Corporation transmitted them, hoping to reach German listeners.

=== Views on Soviet communism and German National-Socialism ===
Mann expressed his belief in the collection of letters written in exile, &quot;Listen, Germany!&quot; (&quot;Deutsche Hörer!&quot;), that equating Soviet communism with Nazi fascism on the basis that both are totalitarian systems was either superficial or insincere in showing a preference for nazism. He clarified this view during a German press interview in July 1949, declaring that he was not a communist but that communism at least had some relation to ideals of humanity and of a better future. He said that the transition of the communist revolution into an autocratic regime was a tragedy while Nazism was only &quot;devilish nihilism&quot;.

==Sexuality and literary work==
Mann&#x27;s diaries reveal his struggles with his bisexuality, his attraction to men finding frequent reflection in his works, most prominently through the obsession of the elderly Aschenbach for the 14-year-old Polish boy Tadzio in the novella &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (&quot;Der Tod in Venedig&quot;, 1912). Anthony Heilbut&#x27;s biography &quot;Thomas Mann: Eros and Literature&quot; (1997) uncovered the centrality of Mann&#x27;s sexuality to his oeuvre. Gilbert Adair&#x27;s work &quot;The Real Tadzio&quot; (2001) describes how, in 1911, Mann had stayed at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Venice Lido with his wife and brother, when he became enraptured by the angelic figure of Władysław (Władzio) Moes, a 10-year-old Polish boy (the real Tadzio). 
In the autobiographical novella &quot;Tonio Kröger&quot; from 1901, the young hero has a crush on a handsome male classmate (modeled after real-life Lübeck classmate Armin Martens). In the novella &quot;With the prophet&quot; (1904) Mann mocks the believing disciples of a neo-Romantic &quot;prophet&quot; who preaches asceticism and has a strong resemblance to the real contemporary poet Stefan George and his &quot;George-Kreis&quot; (&quot;George-Circle&quot;). In 1902, George had met the fourteen-year-old boy Maximilian Kronberger; He made an idol of him and after his early death in 1904 transfigured him into a kind of Antinous-style &quot;god&quot;. 

Mann had also started planning a novel about Frederick the Great in 1905/1906, which ultimately did not come to fruition. The sexuality of Frederick the Great would have played a significant role in this, its impact on his life, his political decisions and wars. In late 1914, at the start of World War I, Mann used the notes and excerpts already collected for this project to write his essay &quot;Frederick and the grand coalition&quot; in which he contrasted Frederick&#x27;s soldierly, male drive and his literary, female connotations consisting of &quot;decomposing&quot; skepticism. A similar &quot;decomposing skepticism&quot; had already estranged the barely concealed gay novel characters &quot;Tonio Kröger&quot; and &quot;Hanno Buddenbrook&quot; (1901) from their traditional upper class family environments and hometown (which in both cases is Lübeck). The &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull&quot;, written from 1910 onwards, describes a self-absorbed young dandyish imposter who, if not explicitly, fits into the gay typology. The 1909 novel &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, which describes a young unworldly and dreamy prince who forces himself into a marriage of convenience that ultimately becomes happy, was modeled after Mann&#x27;s own romance and marriage to Katia Mann in February 1905. In &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, the enamored Hans Castorp, with his heart pounding, asks Pribislav Hippe if he could lend him his pencil, of which he keeps a few scraps like a relic. Borrowing and returning are poetic masks for a sexual act. But it is not just a poetic symbol. In his diary entry from September 15, 1950, Mann remembers &quot;Williram Timpe&#x27;s scraps from his pencil&quot;, referring to a classmate from Lübeck. The novella &quot;Mario and the Magician&quot; (1929) ends with a murder due to a male-male kiss. 

Numerous homoerotic crushes are documented in his letters and diaries, both before and after his marriage. Mann&#x27;s diary records his attraction to his own 13-year-old son, &quot;Eissi&quot; – Klaus Mann: &quot;Klaus to whom recently I feel very drawn&quot; (22 June). In the background conversations about man-to-man eroticism take place; a long letter is written to Carl Maria Weber on this topic, while the diary reveals: &quot;In love with Klaus during these days&quot; (5 June). &quot;Eissi, who enchants me right now&quot; (11 July). &quot;Delight over Eissi, who in his bath is terribly handsome. Find it very natural that I am in love with my son ... Eissi lay reading in bed with his brown torso naked, which disconcerted me&quot; (25 July). &quot;I heard noise in the boys&#x27; room and surprised Eissi completely naked in front of Golo&#x27;s bed acting foolish. Strong impression of his premasculine, gleaming body. Disquiet&quot; (17 October 1920).

Mann was a friend of the violinist and painter Paul Ehrenberg, for whom he had feelings as a young man (at least until around 1903 when there is evidence that those feelings had cooled). The attraction that he felt for Ehrenberg, which is corroborated by notebook entries, caused Mann difficulty and discomfort and may have been an obstacle to his marrying an English woman, Mary Smith, whom he met in 1901. In 1927, while on summer vacation in Kampen (Sylt), Mann fell in love with 17-year-old Klaus Heuser, to whom he dedicated the introduction to his essay &quot;Kleist&#x27;s Amphitryon, a Reconquest&quot; in the fall of the same year, which he read publicly in Munich in the presence of Heuser. Jupiter, who has transformed himself into the form of the general Amphitryon, tries to seduce his wife Alcmene when the real Amphitryon returns home and Alcmene rejects the god. Mann understands Jupiter as the &quot;lonely artistic spirit&quot; who courts life, is rejected and, &quot;a triumphant renouncer&quot;, learns to be content with his divinity. In 1950, Mann met the 19-year-old waiter Franz Westermeier, confiding to his diary &quot;Once again this, once again love&quot;. He immediately processed the experience in his essay &quot;Michelangelo in his poems&quot; (1950) and was also inspired to write &quot;The Black Swan&quot; (1954). In 1975, when Mann&#x27;s diaries were published, creating a national sensation in Germany, the retired Westermeier was tracked down in the United States: he was flattered to learn he had been the object of Mann&#x27;s obsession, but also shocked at its depth.

Mann&#x27;s infatuations probably remained largely platonic. Katia Mann tolerated these love affairs, as did the children, because they knew that it didn&#x27;t go too far. He exchanged letters with Klaus Heuser for a while and met him again in 1935. He wrote about the Heuser experience in his diary on May 6, 1934: &quot;In comparison, the early experiences with Armin Martens and Williram Timpe recede far into the childlike, and that with Klaus Heuser was a late happiness with the character of life-relevant fulfillment... That&#x27;s probably how it is humanly, and because of this normality I can feel my life is more canonical than through marriage and children.&quot; In the entry from February 20, 1942, he spoke again about Klaus Heuser: &quot;Well, yes − lived and loved. Black eyes that shed tears for me, beloved lips that I kissed − it was there, I had it too, I&#x27;ll be able to tell myself when I die.&quot; He was partly delighted, partly ashamed of the depth of his own emotions in these cases and mostly made them productive at some earlier or later date, but the experiences themselves were not yet literary. Only in retrospective, he converted them into literary production and sublimated his shame into the theory that “a writer experiences in order to express himself”, that his life is just material. Mann even went so far as to accuse his brother Heinrich of his &quot;aestheticism being a gesture-rich, highly gifted impotence for life and love.&quot; When Mann met the aging bachelor Heuser, who had worked in China for 18 years, for the last time in 1954, his daughter Erika scoffed: &quot;Since he (Heuser) couldn&#x27;t have the magician (= Thomas Mann&#x27;s nickname with his children), he preferred to give it up completely.&quot;

Although Mann had always denied his novels had autobiographical components, the unsealing of his diaries revealing how consumed his life had been with unrequited and sublimated passion resulted in a reappraisal of his work. Thomas Mann had burned all of his diaries from before March 1933 in the garden of his home in Pacific Palisades in May 1945. Only the booklets from September 1918 to December 1921 were preserved because the author needed them for his work on &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. He later decided to have them − and his diaries from 1933 onwards – published 20 years after his death and predicted “surprise and cheerful astonishment”. They were published by Peter von Mendelssohn in 10 volumes.

From the very beginning, Thomas&#x27; son Klaus Mann openly dealt with his own homosexuality in his literary work and open lifestyle and referred critically to his father&#x27;s &quot;sublimation&quot; in his diary. On the other hand, Thomas&#x27;s daughter Erika Mann and his son Golo Mann came out only later in their lives. Thomas Mann reacted cautiously to Klaus&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Pious Dance, Adventure Book of a Youth&quot; (1926), which is openly set in Berlin&#x27;s homosexual milieu. Although he embraced male-male eroticism, he disapproved of gay lifestyle. The Eulenburg affair, which broke out two years after Mann&#x27;s marriage, had strengthened him in his renunciation of a gay life and he supported the journalist Maximilian Harden, who was friends with Katia Mann&#x27;s family, in his denunciatory trial against the gay Prince of Eulenburg, a close friend of Emperor Wilhelm II. Thomas Mann was always concerned about his dignity, reputation and respectability; the &quot;poet king&quot; Goethe was his role model. His horror at a possible collapse of these attributes found expression in the character of Aschenbach in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. But as time went on Mann became more open. When the twenty-two-year-old war novelist Gore Vidal published his first novel &quot;The City and the Pillar&quot; in 1948, a love-story between small-town American boys and a portrait of homosexual life in New York and Hollywood in the forties, a highly controversial book even among the publishers, not to mention the press, Mann called it a &quot;noble work.&quot;

When the physician and pioneer of gay liberation Magnus Hirschfeld sent another petition to the Reichstag in 1922 to abolish Section 175 of the German Criminal Code, under which many homosexuals were imprisoned simply because of their inclinations, Thomas Mann also signed. However, criminal liability among adults was only abolished through a change in the law on June 25, 1969 − fourteen years after Mann&#x27;s death and just three days before the Stonewall riots. This legal situation certainly had an impact throughout his life; The man whom the Nazis labeled a traitor never had any desire to be incarcered for &quot;criminal acts&quot;.

==Cultural references==
===&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;===
Several literary and other works make reference to Mann&#x27;s book &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, including:
*Frederic Tuten&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Tintin in the New World&quot; features many characters (such as Clavdia Chauchat, Mynheer Peeperkorn and others) from &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; interacting with Tintin in Peru.
*Andrew Crumey&#x27;s novel &quot;Mobius Dick&quot; (2004) imagines an alternative universe where an author named Behring has written novels resembling Mann&#x27;s. These include a version of &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; with Erwin Schrödinger in place of Castorp.
*Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (1987), in which the main character is criticized for reading &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; while visiting a friend in a sanatorium.
*The song &quot;Magic Mountain&quot; by the band Blonde Redhead.
*The painting &quot;Magic Mountain (after Thomas Mann)&quot; by Christiaan Tonnis (1987). &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; is also a chapter in Tonnis&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Krankheit als Symbol&quot; (&quot;Illness as a Symbol&quot;).
*The 1941 film &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, in which the character Philip Armstrong Scott unknowingly praises Mann&#x27;s work to an escaped World War II Nazi U-boat commander, who later responds by burning Scott&#x27;s copy of &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;.
*In Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1964), character Indian Jenny purchases a Thomas Mann novel and tries to find out &quot;just where was this mountain full of magic...&quot; (p. 578).
*Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;, in which an unnamed German man at a mountain resort invokes the novel as cover for furtively condemning the rapidly arming Hitler and Hirohito regimes. After he flees to escape the Japanese secret police, the protagonist, who fears his own mail is being read, refers to him as the novel&#x27;s Mr. Castorp. The film is partly based on another Japanese novel, set like &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot; in a tuberculosis sanatorium.
*Father John Misty&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Pure Comedy&quot; contains a song titled &quot;So I&#x27;m Growing Old on Magic Mountain&quot;, in which a man, near death, reflects on the passing of time and the disappearance of his Dionysian youth in homage to the themes in Mann&#x27;s novel.
*Viktor Frankl&#x27;s book &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot; relates the &quot;time-experience&quot; of Holocaust prisoners to TB patients in &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;: &quot;How paradoxical was our time-experience! In this connection we are reminded of Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, which contains some very pointed psychological remarks. Mann studies the spiritual development of people who are in an analogous psychological position, i.e., tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium who also know no date for their release. They experience a similar existence—without a future and without a goal.&quot;
*The movie A Cure For Wellness, directed by Gore Verbinski, was inspired by and is somewhat a modernization, somewhat a parody, of &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;. In one scene, an orderly at the asylum can be seen reading &quot;Der Zauberberg&quot;.
*The album cover for Peter Schickele&#x27;s recording of P.D.Q. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Bluegrass Cantata&quot; shows an illustration of the 18th Century German bluegrass ensemble Tommy Mann and his Magic Mountain Boys.
*The 2022 novel The Empusium by Olga Tokarczuk reprises key plot elements from The Magic Mountain, including an alpine sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, a time setting of 1913 which precedes World War I, a protagonist who is a young engineer and an isolated health resort as a microcosm of society.

===&quot;Death in Venice&quot;===

Many literary and other works make reference to &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, including:
*Luchino Visconti&#x27;s 1971 famous film version of Mann&#x27;s novella: Death in Venice (film)
*Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1973 operatic adaptation in two acts of Mann&#x27;s novella.
*Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) refers to the novella.
*Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1994 novel, &quot;Closing Time&quot;, which makes several references to Thomas Mann and &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.
*Alexander McCall Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Portuguese Irregular Verbs&quot; (1997) has a final chapter entitled &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and refers to Thomas Mann by name in that chapter.
*Philip Roth&#x27;s novel &quot;The Human Stain&quot; (2000).
*Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, which mentions the character Tadzio in the refrain.
*Alan Bennett&#x27;s 2009 play &quot;The Habit of Art&quot;, in which Benjamin Britten is imagined paying a visit to W. H. Auden about the possibility of Auden writing the libretto for Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.
*David Rakoff&#x27;s essay &quot;Shrimp&quot;, which appears in his 2010 collection &quot;Half Empty&quot;, makes a humorous comparison between Mann&#x27;s Aschenbach and E. B. White&#x27;s Stuart Little.
* Two main characters in &quot;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl&quot; make a spoof film titled &quot;Death in Tennis&quot;.
* &#x27;A Good Year&#x27; 2006 film.
* In the MTV animated series Daria, Daria Morgendorffer receives from Tom Sloane a first-edition English translation as a present (&quot;One J at a Time, Season 5, Episode 8, 2001) and is ridiculed by her sister, Quinn, for having a boyfriend who only gives her &quot;a used book&quot;.

===Other===

*&quot;Hayavadana&quot; (1972), a play by Girish Karnad, was based on a theme drawn from &quot;The Transposed Heads&quot; and employed the folk theatre form of &quot;Yakshagana&quot;. A German version of the play was directed by Vijaya Mehta as part of the repertoire of the Deutsches National Theatre, Weimar. A staged musical version of &quot;The Transposed Heads,&quot; adapted by Julie Taymor and Sidney Goldfarb, with music by Elliot Goldenthal, was produced at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia and the Lincoln Center in New York in 1988.
*Mann&#x27;s 1896 short story &quot;Disillusionment&quot; is the basis for the Leiber and Stoller song &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;, famously recorded in 1969 by Peggy Lee.
*In a 1994 essay, Umberto Eco suggests that the media discuss &quot;Whether reading Thomas Mann gives one erections&quot; as an alternative to &quot;Whether Joyce is boring&quot;.
*Mann&#x27;s life in California during World War II, including his relationships with his older brother Heinrich Mann and Bertolt Brecht is a subject of Christopher Hampton&#x27;s play &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot;.
* Hans Pleschinski&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Königsallee&quot; fictionalizes an actual visit by Thomas Mann to Klaus Heuser&#x27;s parents in Düsseldorf in 1954. He lets Mann&#x27;s former lover come along with his boy named Anwar, as well as Mann&#x27;s children Erika and Golo. Everything gets complicated.
*Colm Tóibín&#x27;s 2021 fictionalised biography &quot;The Magician&quot; is a portrait of Mann in the context of his family and political events.

<text>The Incredible Shrinking Man is a 1957 American science fiction film directed by Jack Arnold, based on Richard Matheson&#x27;s 1956 novel, &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot;. The film stars Grant Williams as Scott and Randy Stuart as Scott&#x27;s wife, Louise. While relaxing on a boat, Scott is enveloped by a strange fog. Months later, he discovers that he appears to be shrinking. By the time Scott has reached the height of a small boy, his condition becomes known to the public. When he learns there is no cure for his condition, he lashes out at his wife. As Scott shrinks to the point where he can fit into a dollhouse, he has a battle with his family cat, leaving him lost and alone in his basement, where he is now smaller than the average insect.

The film&#x27;s storyline was expanded by Matheson after he had sold the story to Universal-International Pictures Co., Inc. He also completed the novel upon which the film is based while production was underway. Matheson&#x27;s script was initially written in flashbacks, and Richard Alan Simmons rewrote it using a more conventional narrative structure. Director Jack Arnold initially wanted Dan O&#x27;Herlihy to play Scott, but O&#x27;Herlihy turned down the role, leading Universal to sign Williams as the lead. Filming began on May 31, 1956. Scenes involving special effects were shot throughout production, while others used the large sets of Universal&#x27;s backlot. Production went over budget, and filming had to be extended; certain special effects shots required reshooting. Williams was constantly being injured on set.

Before the film&#x27;s release in New York City on February 22, 1957, its ending first went to test audiences who felt the character&#x27;s fate should be changed. The director&#x27;s original ending remained in the film. The film grossed $1.43 million in the United States and Canada and was among the highest-grossing science fiction films of the 1950s. A sequel, &quot;The Fantastic Little Girl&quot;, originally penned by Matheson, never went into production. A remake was developed years later, eventually becoming the comedy &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot; (1981). Other remakes were planned in the early 2000s, one of which was to star Eddie Murphy in a more comedic variation on the film. A new adaptation was announced in 2013, with Matheson writing the screenplay with his son Richard Christian Matheson. In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
Robert Scott Carey, known as &quot;Scott,&quot; is on vacation with his wife, Louise, when a strange mist envelops him. Six months later, he observes that his clothes are too large, suspects he is shrinking, and seeks medical advice. Initially, his doctor denies that Carey is shrinking. Later, the doctor confirms the shrinking through X-rays and refers him to a medical research institute. The institute determines that Carey&#x27;s exposure to the mist, combined with earlier exposure to a pesticide, rearranged his molecular structure, causing him to shrink. Carey informs Louise that, given his predicament, she is free to leave him. Louise promises to stay, and as she does, Carey&#x27;s wedding ring slips off his finger.

Carey&#x27;s condition turns him into a national curiosity. Media attention forces him into seclusion within his home. Advised to sell his story, Carey starts a journal detailing his experiences. An antidote is discovered, halting his shrinking, but doctors caution that he will remain three feet tall for the rest of his life unless a solution is found to reverse his condition. Emotionally shattered, Carey meets Clarice, a carnival worker and dwarf, who is exactly his height. Clarice encourages Carey, inspiring him to continue his journal. Later, he notices he is now shorter than Clarice and dejectedly runs home.

Carey shrinks small enough to live in a dollhouse and becomes more tyrannical. When Louise leaves home on an errand, he falls into his basement after Butch, the family cat, attacks him. Louise returns and assumes Butch ate Carey after finding a bloody scrap of Carey&#x27;s clothing. Louise prepares to move out, with Carey&#x27;s brother, Charlie, assisting.

Carey faces significant challenges navigating his basement and is unable to climb the stairs back up, deciding to wait for Louise to come down. The water heater bursts, but when Charlie and Louise come to investigate, Carey is too small for them to hear his screams for help. He battles a large spider while searching for food and shelter. He ultimately kills the spider with a straight pin and collapses in exhaustion. He awakens, small enough to escape the basement through one of the netting squares of a window screen. Carey accepts his fate of shrinking to microscopic size. He is no longer afraid, concluding that no matter how small he becomes, he will still matter in the universe because God will know he exists.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development and pre-production===
Richard Matheson&#x27;s idea for the original novel was inspired by a scene in the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, where Ray Milland&#x27;s character leaves an apartment with the wrong hat. It is much too large for Milland and sinks down around his head and ears. Matheson sold the rights to Universal on the condition that he write the screenplay. It was Matheson&#x27;s first screenplay, a writing format he felt he adapted to quickly. Matheson&#x27;s initial script followed Scott Carey already shrunken and battling a spider in his basement. His rewrite is told in flashback form: scenes of Carey and the spider are interspersed with scenes telling the story of Carey&#x27;s gradual loss in height.

The film was already into its second month of production before the novel was published in May 1956 by Gold Medal Books. Producer Albert Zugsmith added the word &quot;Incredible&quot; to Matheson&#x27;s title and passed the script to Richard Alan Simmons, who removed the script&#x27;s flashback structure. Matheson later discussed working with Universal, finding that the producer had a &quot;very commercial mind&quot; which made the script weaker in terms of character. In an interview in &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine, Matheson stated he protested sharing a screen credit with Simmons. The screen credits list Matheson as the writer, while the shooting script lists both Matheson and Simmons.
Pre-production was originally set to begin on April 20, 1956, but it started officially on April 24. The cast consisted of mostly unknown actors. Director Jack Arnold phoned Randy Stuart, who was a personal friend, asking if she would be interested in doing the film. Zugsmith initially wanted Dan O&#x27;Herlihy to play the role of Scott Carey. O&#x27;Herlihy had just been nominated for an Academy Award for his role in &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. After reading the script, he refused to play another isolated character, not wanting to be typecast in that kind of role. Grant Williams was cast because Universal had him pegged to become a star. On April 4, 1956, Williams and Stuart were screen tested and deemed acceptable for the roles of Scott and Louise Carey.

===Filming===

On the first day of production, May 31, Universal&#x27;s operating committee decided that because of the type of special photography involved in the making of the film, the publicity department would cooperate by publicizing a closed-door policy on the set. On-set photography would not be allowed while the film was shot to stimulate public and trade interest. Shooting took either five or six weeks, including the special effects sequences. The budget ranged between $700,000 and $800,000. Film critic Kim Newman said the budget was &quot;not expensive&quot;, with most of it used for special effects.

Some special effects shots were the earliest taken for the picture. For example, shots with Randy Stuart were taken against a black velvet backdrop and then composited with shots of Williams on an enlarged living room set. Their movements were synchronized using negatives from the first exposed scene in the camera gate, with the opposite done for the other scene. Sound production began on May 31. An oversized dollhouse was built for Williams on Stage 28. It had previously been used for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Dracula&quot;. Arnold said he filmed scenes with the cat in a normal studio with an animal trainer who had about 40 identical cats. To coax the cat to approach the dollhouse, Arnold hid food in it so the cat would find a way into the house. Later he timed the cat&#x27;s reactions and directed Williams accordingly to react to the cat. Arnold first attempted to follow the novel and use a black widow spider. After preliminary tests, he found black widows were too small to use properly in the film. In an interview with Tom Weaver, Randy Stuart said the spiders presented problems. The overhead lamps on the set had to be turned up high, leading to the deaths of 24 tarantulas. They were directed with little puffs of air, a technique which had been used previously in Arnold&#x27;s film &quot;Tarantula&quot;. Despite sources suggesting otherwise, the films did not use the same tarantulas.

Many of the basement scenes were shot on Stage 12 of Universal Studios which, according to Tom Weaver, was one of the largest sound stages in the world at the time. While trying to find a way to simulate giant drops of water landing, Arnold recalled a time when he was a child and found condoms in his father&#x27;s drawer. Not knowing what they were, he filled them with water and dropped them. Arnold ordered about 100 condoms and placed them on a treadmill so they would drop in sequence. The flood scene was shot on July 2 and 3. There was a 20-minute delay in filming because of a bad camera cable. There was a further delay from 11:05 am to 11:25 am to allow water to drain so a crane could be used properly. These scenes involved nine-hour workdays. When the actors were not filming, they were sent to have publicity shots taken.

The film was originally shot in the standard 4:3 aspect ratio, but midway through filming, on June 22, it was decided that the remaining footage would be shot in 1.75:1. The belief was this would give the film a better look, as a shorter frame would allow the production department to scale down the height of certain props for the special effects. During this period, Grant Williams suffered the first of many injuries on set. On June 22, he reported to the studio hospital with a scratched leg; on June 29, he had to leave the set to be treated for an eye condition; and on July 2 he both had to be driven to the hospital for further treatment for his eyes and was sent to the studio hospital with blisters and scratches from climbing sets. Due to Williams&#x27; injuries and some special effects shots being too bright, the film was four days behind schedule and $25,000 over budget.

===Post-production===
Special effects shots using black velvet trick photography took three weeks of post-production and were scheduled after the film completed production on July 13, 1956. Warren described the special effects as &quot;hard to assign correctly.&quot; Clifford Stine, whose field was process work and rear screen projection, is credited with &quot;special photography&quot;. The boat scene at the beginning of the film was shot on Universal&#x27;s process stage, which allowed for rear screen projection. Shots of Scott in certain scenes, such as his encounter with the mist, were shot with him against a black velvet back drop.

According to Randy Stuart, the film&#x27;s ending had Williams return to his original size, which Matheson felt was the wrong ending for the story. Arnold argued with Universal over the ending. The studio wanted a happy ending, while he wanted the original ending that had been shot. To decide on which ending to use, a test screening was held to judge the audience&#x27;s reaction. Lucas said audience review cards from a December 7 preview screening in California included comments reacting to the ending such as: &quot;Should&#x27;ve had a different ending, should&#x27;ve grown again.&quot; and &quot;What happened at the end?&quot;. On the overall quality of the film, comments included, &quot;Can&#x27;t you do any better? This is pretty sad.&quot; &quot;You scared my son to death.&quot; and &quot;This is an insult to the brain power of my two-year old son&quot;. The film was released with Arnold&#x27;s original ending intact. After its release, Mel Danner, manager of the Circle Theater in Waynoka, Oklahoma, noted audiences felt it was a good film, but that Carey should have returned to his original size at the end.

===Soundtrack===
The film&#x27;s title theme was composed by Fred Carling and Ed Lawrence and played by Ray Anthony and his Orchestra.

==Release==

&quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; premiered at the Globe Theatre in New York City on February 22, 1957. This was followed by a screening in Los Angeles on March 27, 1957, and a wider release in April. Actress Randy Stuart recalled the film was either &quot;second or third, I think third, after &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;&quot; in terms of how much money it made against what it cost. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that by the end of the year it had grossed $1.43 million, making it one of the highest grossing science fiction films of the decade (for comparison, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; grossed $8 million, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; grossed $4.8 million, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; grossed $1.95 million, and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; grossed $1.2 million).

The film was reissued theatrically in 1964, but otherwise was rarely shown on television and screened only occasionally at science fiction conventions. It was released on laser disc in 1978 and 1991, on VHS in 1992, and on DVD in 2006 (as part of a box set containing a collection of Universal-International&#x27;s science fiction films). Arrow Video released the film on Blu-ray in 2017. In July 2021, The Criterion Collection announced a blu-ray of the film with a new 4K digital restoration; its bonus material includes audio commentary from Tom Weaver and David Schecter.

==Reception==
Arnold&#x27;s biographer Dana M. Reemes described &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; as initially being received as a routine to above average film; its reception has steadily grown ever since. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a fascinating exercise in imagination, as terrifying as it is funny [...] Science-fiction admirers who are accustomed to finding food for thought as well as vicarious thrills in such flights of fancy will not be disappointed, either.&quot;
The &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised the film, and declared it a &quot;horrifying story that grips the imagination throughout&quot;, one that &quot;straightforward, macabre, and as startlingly original as a vintage Ray Bradbury short story, for all its peaceful and resigned conclusion—opens new vistas of cosmic terror&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film, writing that &quot;unless a viewer is addicted to freakish ironies, the unlikely spectacle of Mr. Williams losing an inch of height each week, while his wife, Randy Stuart, looks on helplessly, will become tiresome before Universal has emptied its lab of science-fiction clichés.&quot; William Brogdon of &quot;Variety&quot; commented that the film was not thoroughly satisfactory, but had enough good qualities, specifically declaring &quot;unfoldment is inclined to slow down on occasion, resulting in flagging interest here and there&quot;. The review noted the special effects and cinematography were &quot;visually effective&quot;, but that &quot;portions of the background score are overworked&quot;, which distracted from the plot. The film was the winner of the first Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1958.

Martin Rubin discussed the film in a 1974 issue of &quot;Film Comment&quot; and compared it to its contemporaries in the genre. He found it did not have the &quot;schoolboy cynicism and moralizing of a Roger Corman film, nor any of the hysteria common to the Red-scare science-fictioners of the Fifties&quot;. He felt the story was well-suited to Jack Arnold, noting a &quot;WeIlesian director would have overinflated this film and compromised its sense of the ordinary with shadows and angles, while a more accomplished stylist of almost any other order would have softened it too much—such attitudes are better off in the horror film.&quot; Rubin also compared it the other science fiction films Arnold made in the 1950s—&quot;The Creature From the Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;It Came From Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Tarantula&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Creature&quot;, and &quot;The Space Children&quot;—finding them competitively &quot;interesting in patches&quot;, but lacking in comparison to the &quot;unity and clarity&quot; of &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, which &quot;totally fulfills its central metaphor without being unduly constricted by it&quot;.

Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; referred to the film as a classic of 1950s science fiction films, and noted how the everyday objects found at home are &quot;transformed into a terrifying vertiginous world fraught with peril. A confrontation with a &#x27;giant&#x27; spider, impressively realised, as are all the effects, for its day, has become one of the iconic image[s] of the entire era.&quot; Tim Lucas declared that the film &quot;remains one of the perfectly realized science fiction films&quot;, noting it was &quot;less about science than a masterful example of the &#x27;what if&#x27; branch of speculative human drama&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Arnold commented on science films made after &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;, saying that since his films were financially successful, AIP and Japanese studios developed similar productions, which he felt lacked in atmosphere or morals and were just stories about monsters. These included &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; and &quot;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&quot;. Arnold was unable to sell a sci-fi story after these films began appearing and went to England to create &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;, which he felt was a fantasy film that still had a deeper meaning to it. Arnold later declared &quot;Mouse&quot; as his favorite picture and that he thought &quot;almost as much of&quot; it as &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot;.

Arnold spoke about the film later in life after watching a revival screening, saying he was happy that audiences enjoyed the film and that they &quot;got all the nuances that I put in. It was a joy to me, just to watch their reaction to the film.&quot; Matheson discussed the film in an interview in John Bronsan&#x27;s &quot;Horror People&quot;, where he declared he only enjoyed the film after his son pointed out the film&#x27;s story structure, specifically that &quot;it didn&#x27;t have the usual story line, the usual happy ending. Actually it had no particular story line, it was very picaresque, it just wandered on.&quot; Matheson re-iterated his enjoyment in &quot;Cinefantastique&quot;, finding himself able to appreciate the film with subsequent watches, finding the visuals as &quot;truly remarkable&quot; and that Arnold created &quot;quite a mood in the film.&quot; The film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2009.

===Proposed sequels and remakes===

Matheson scripted a sequel, titled &quot;The Fantastic Little Girl&quot;. The film has Louise Carey certain that Scott is still alive. She returns home and finds herself shrinking and is injected with a new cure. The script also featured Scott in his microscopic world where he encounters strange eel-like creatures. The script was 43 pages long and described as inferior compared to the original film by author Bill Warren. Matheson said that, since the original film made &quot;a lot of money&quot;, he was unsure why the sequel was not developed past the script stage. The script in its entirety was published in the 2005 book &quot;Unrealized Dreams&quot;. The reluctance for a home media re-release was due to Universal&#x27;s intention for a pseudo-sequel. This included John Landis developing, writing and directing &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, which was cancelled after the budget was found to be too high. It was later revived by Jane Wagner. Arnold said he &quot;hated&quot; &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, declaring the special effects weak and adding there was &quot;no point of view...the major fault is that it&#x27;s not a comedy even though they tried so hard to make it funny&quot;.

In 2003, Universal and Imagine Entertainment attempted a remake, with Eddie Murphy to star and Keenen Ivory Wayans to direct. Following this, other directors were attached, including Peter Segal and Brett Ratner, with Murphy still slated to star in a comedic remake.

The source material rights lapsed by 2012 and were purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. A new adaptation of &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot; was announced in 2013, with Matheson writing the screenplay with his son Richard Christian Matheson. The Mathesons commented that the new adaptation would modernise the story and reflect on advancements such as nanotechnology. The elder Matheson died on June 23, 2013.

The Los Angeles-based producer Patrick Wachsberger of Picture Perfect Federation was in France developing a French remake in 2023 starring Jean Dujardin.

<doc id="30089" wikidata="Q22528" url="?curid=30089" title="Geography of Taiwan">
<text>Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a country in East Asia. The island of Taiwan, formerly known to Westerners as Formosa, has an area of and makes up 99% of the land under ROC control. It lies about across the Taiwan Strait from the southeastern coast of the Mainland China . The East China Sea is to the north of the island, the Philippine Sea to its east, the Luzon Strait directly to its south, and the South China Sea to its southwest. The ROC also controls a number of smaller islands, including the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan Strait, Kinmen and Matsu in Fuchien near the Mainland coast, as well as Pratas and Taiping in the South China Sea.

Geologically, the main island comprises a tilted fault block, characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges running parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of the population resides. Several peaks exceed 3,500 m in height - the highest, Yu Shan at , makes Taiwan the world&#x27;s fourth-highest island. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges remains active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, some of them highly destructive. There are also many active submarine volcanoes in the Taiwan Straits.

The climate ranges from tropical in the south to subtropical in the north, and is governed by the East Asian Monsoon. On average, four typhoons strike the main island each year. The heavily forested eastern mountains provide a habitat for a diverse range of wildlife, while human land use in the western and northern lowlands is intensive.

== Physical boundaries ==
The total land area of Taiwan is , slightly larger than Belgium. It has a coastline of . The ROC claims an exclusive economic zone of with and a territorial sea of .

The island of Taiwan, the largest of the archipelago, was known in the West until after World War II as &quot;Formosa&quot;, from the Portuguese (), &quot;beautiful island&quot;. It is long and wide, and has an area of . The northernmost point of the island is Cape Fugui in New Taipei&#x27;s Shimen District. The central point of the island is in Puli Township, Nantou County. The southernmost point on the island is Cape Eluanbi in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County.

The main island is separated from the southeast coast of mainland China by the Taiwan Strait, which ranges from at its widest point to at its narrowest. Part of the continental shelf, the Strait is no more than deep, and has become a land bridge during glacial periods. Niushan Island in Nanlai village, Aoqian town, Pingtan County, Fuzhou, Fujian is the closest China (PRC)-administered island to the main island.

To the south, the main island is separated from the Philippine island of Luzon by the -wide Luzon Strait. The South China Sea lies to the southwest, the East China Sea to the north, and the Philippine Sea to the east.

Smaller islands of the archipelago include the Penghu islands in the Taiwan Strait west of the main island, with an area of , the tiny islet of Xiaoliuqiu off the southwest coast, and Orchid Island and Green Island to the southeast, separated from the northernmost islands of the Philippines by the Bashi Channel. The islands of Kinmen and Matsu near the coast of Fujian across the Taiwan Strait have a total area of ; the Pratas and Taiping islets in the South China Sea are also administered by the ROC, but are not part of the Taiwanese archipelago.

== Geology ==

The island of Taiwan was formed approximately 4 to 5 million years ago at a complex convergent boundary between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. In a boundary running the length of the island and continuing southwards in the Luzon Volcanic Arc (including Green Island and Orchid Island), the Eurasian Plate is sliding under the Philippine Sea Plate.

Most of the island comprises a huge fault block tilted to the west.
The western part of the island, and much of the central range, consists of sedimentary deposits scraped from the descending edge of the Eurasian Plate. In the northeast of the island, and continuing eastwards in the Ryukyu Volcanic Arc, the Philippine Sea Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate.

The tectonic boundary remains active, and Taiwan experiences 15,000 to 18,000 earthquakes each year, of which 800 to 1,000 are noticed by people. The most catastrophic recent earthquake was the magnitude-7.3 Chi-Chi earthquake, which occurred in the centre of Taiwan on 21 September 1999, killing more than 2,400 people. On 4 March 2010 at about 01:20 UTC, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake hit southwestern Taiwan in the mountainous area of Kaohsiung County.
Another major earthquake occurred on 6 February 2016, with a magnitude of 6.4. Tainan was damaged the most, with 117 deaths, most of them caused by the collapse of a 17-story apartment building.

== Terrain ==

The terrain in Taiwan is divided into two parts: the flat to gently rolling plains in the west, where 90% of the population lives, and the mostly rugged forest-covered mountains in the eastern two-thirds.

The eastern part of the island is dominated by five mountain ranges, each running from north-northeast to south-southwest, roughly parallel to the east coast of the island. As a group, they extend from north to south and average about from east to west. They include more than two hundred peaks with elevations of over .

The Central Mountain Range extends from Su&#x27;ao in the northeast to Eluanbi at the southern tip of the island, forming a ridge of high mountains and serving as the island&#x27;s principal watershed. The mountains are predominantly composed of hard rock formations resistant to weathering and erosion, although heavy rainfall has deeply scarred the sides with gorges and sharp valleys. The relative relief of the terrain is usually extensive, and the forest-clad mountains with their extreme ruggedness are almost impenetrable. The east side of the Central Mountain Range is the steepest mountain slope in Taiwan, with fault scarps ranging in height from . Taroko National Park, on the steep eastern side of the range, has good examples of mountainous terrain, gorges and erosion caused by a swiftly flowing river.

The East Coast Mountain Range extends down the east coast of the island from the mouth of the Hualien River in the north to Taitung County in the south, and chiefly consist of sandstone and shale. It is separated from the Central Range by the narrow Huatung Valley, at an altitude of . Although Hsinkangshan (新港山), the highest peak, reaches an elevation of , most of the range is composed of large hills. Small streams have developed on the flanks, but only one large river cuts across the range. Badlands are located at the western foot of the range, where the ground water level is the lowest and rock formations are the least resistant to weathering. Raised coral reefs along the east coast and the frequent occurrences of earthquakes in the rift valley indicate that the fault block is still rising.

The ranges to the west of the Central range are divided into two groups separated by the Sun Moon Lake Basin in the centre of the island. The Dadu and Zhuoshui Rivers flow from the western slopes of the Central Range through the basin to the west coast of the island.

The Xueshan Range lies to the northwest of the Central Mountain Range, beginning at Sandiaojiao, the northeast tip of the island, and gaining elevation as it extends southwest towards Nantou County. Xueshan, the main peak, is high.

The Yushan Range runs along the southwestern flank of the Central Range. It includes the island&#x27;s tallest peak, the Yu Shan (&#x27;Jade Mountain&#x27;) which makes Taiwan the world&#x27;s fourth-highest island, and is the highest point in the western Pacific region outside of the Kamchatka Peninsula, New Guinea Highlands and Mount Kinabalu.

The Alishan Range lies west of the Yushan Range, across the valley of the south-flowing Kaoping River. The range has major elevations between . The main peak, Data Mountain (大塔山), towers .

Below the western foothills of the ranges, such as the Hsinchu Hills and the Miaoli Hills, lie raised terraces formed of material eroded from the ranges. These include the Linkou Plateau, the Taoyuan Plateau and the Dadu Plateau. About 23% of Taiwan&#x27;s land area consists of fertile alluvial plains and basins watered by rivers running from the eastern mountains. Over half of this land lies in the Chianan Plain in southwest Taiwan, with lesser areas in the Pingtung Plain, Taichung Basin and Taipei Basin. The only sizable plain on the east coast is the Yilan Plain in the northeast.

== Climate ==

The island of Taiwan lies across the Tropic of Cancer, and its climate is influenced by the East Asian Monsoon. Northern Taiwan has a humid subtropical climate, with substantial seasonal variation of temperatures, while parts of central and most of southern Taiwan have a tropical monsoon climate where seasonal temperature variations are less noticeable, with temperatures typically varying from warm to hot. During the winter (November to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny. The summer monsoon (from May to October) accounts for 90% of the annual precipitation in the south, but only 60% in the north. The average rainfall is approximately 2,600 mm per year.
Typhoons are most likely to strike between July and October, with on average about four direct hits per year. Intensive rain from typhoons often leads to disastrous mudslides.

== Flora and fauna ==
Before extensive human settlement, the vegetation on Taiwan ranged from tropical rainforest in the lowlands through temperate forests, boreal forest and alpine plants with increasing altitude.
Most of the plains and low-lying hills of the west and north of the island have been cleared for agricultural use since the arrival of the Chinese immigrants during the 17th and 18th century. However the mountain forests are very diverse, with several endemic species such as Formosan cypress (&quot;Chamaecyparis formosensis&quot;) and Taiwan fir (&quot;Abies kawakamii&quot;), while the camphor laurel (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;) was once also widespread at lower altitudes.
Taiwan is a centre of bird endemism (see List of endemic birds of Taiwan).

Before the country&#x27;s industrialization, the mountainous areas held several endemic animal species and subspecies, such as the Swinhoe&#x27;s pheasant (&quot;Lophura swinhoii&quot;), Taiwan blue magpie (&quot;Urocissa caerulea&quot;), the Formosan sika deer (&quot;Cervus nippon taiwanensis&quot; or &quot;Cervus nippon taiouanus&quot;) and the Formosan landlocked salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus masou formosanus&quot;). A few of these are now extinct, and many others have been designated endangered species.

Taiwan has 65 species of fireflies, the third highest density after Jamaica and Costa Rica. Fireflies are protected and their numbers are increasing, but they are threatened by climate change in the long term.

Taiwan had relatively few carnivores, 11 species in total, of which the Formosan clouded leopard is likely extinct and the otter is restricted to Kinmen island. The largest carnivore is the Formosan black bear (&quot;Selanarctos thibetanus formosanus&quot;), a rare and endangered species.

Nine national parks in Taiwan showcase the archipelago&#x27;s diverse terrain, flora and fauna. Kenting National Park on the southern tip of Taiwan contains uplifted coral reefs, moist tropical forest and marine ecosystems. Yushan National Park has alpine terrain, mountain ecology, forest types that vary with altitude, and remains of ancient roads. Yangmingshan National Park has volcanic geology, hot springs, waterfalls, and forest. Taroko National Park has a marble canyon, cliff, and fold mountains. Shei-Pa National Park has alpine ecosystems, geological terrain, and valley streams. Kinmen National Park has lakes, wetlands, coastal topography, flora and fauna-shaped island. Dongsha Atoll National Park has the Pratas reef atolls for integrity, a unique marine ecology, and biodiversity, and is a key habitat for the marine resources of the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.

== Natural resources ==
Natural resources on the islands include small deposits of gold, copper, coal, natural gas, limestone, marble, and asbestos. The island is 55% forest and woodland (mostly on the mountains) and 24% arable land (mostly on the plains), with 15% going to other purposes. 5% is permanent pasture and 1% is permanent crops.

Because of the intensive exploitation throughout Taiwan&#x27;s pre-modern and modern history, the island&#x27;s mineral resources (e.g. coal, gold, marble), as well as wild animal reserves (e.g. deer), have been virtually exhausted. Moreover, much of Taiwan&#x27;s forestry resources, especially firs were harvested during Japanese rule for the construction of shrines and have only recovered slightly since then. To this day, forests do not contribute to significant timber production mainly because of concerns about production costs and environmental regulations.

=== Agriculture ===

The few natural resources with significant economic value remaining in Taiwan are agriculture-associated. Sugarcane and rice have been cultivated in western Taiwan since the 17th century. Camphor extraction and sugar refining played an important role in Taiwan&#x27;s exports from the late 19th century through the first half of the 20th century. The importance of these industries declined mainly due to the reduction of international demand rather than the exhaustion of related natural resources.

Domestic agriculture (rice being the dominant kind of crop) and fisheries retain some importance. Still, they have been greatly challenged by foreign imports since Taiwan&#x27;s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002. Consequently, upon the decline of subsistence, Taiwan&#x27;s agriculture now relies heavily on the marketing and export of specialty crops, such as bananas, guavas, lychees, bell fruits, and high-mountain tea.

=== Energy resources ===

Taiwan has significant coal deposits and some insignificant petroleum and natural gas deposits. , oil accounts for 49.0% of the total energy consumption. Coal comes next with 32.1%, followed by nuclear energy with 8.3%, natural gas (indigenous and liquefied) with 10.2%, and energy from renewable sources with 0.5%. Taiwan has six nuclear reactors and two under construction. Nearly all oil and gas for transportation and power needs must be imported, making Taiwan particularly sensitive to fluctuations in energy prices. Taiwan is rich in wind energy resources, with wind farms both onshore and offshore, though limited land area favours offshore wind resources. By promoting renewable energy, Taiwan&#x27;s government hopes to also aid the nascent renewable energy manufacturing industry, and develop it into an export market.

== Human geography ==

Taiwan has a population of over 23 million, the vast majority of whom live in the lowlands near the western coast of the island.
The island is highly urbanized, with nearly 9 million people living in the Taipei–Keelung–Taoyuan metropolitan area at the northern end, and over 2 million each in the urban areas of Kaohsiung and Taichung.

Taiwanese indigenous peoples comprise approximately 2% of the population, and now mostly live in the mountainous eastern part of the island. Most scholars believe their ancestors arrived in Taiwan by sea between 4000 and 3000 BC, most likely from southeastern China.

Han Chinese make up over 95% of the population. Immigrants from southern Fujian began to farm the area around modern Tainan and Kaohsiung from the 17th century, later spreading across the western and northern plains and absorbing the indigenous population of those areas. Hakka people from eastern Guangdong arrived later and settled the foothills further inland, but the rugged uplands of the eastern half of the island remained the exclusive preserve of the indigenous peoples until the early 20th century. A further 1.2 million people from throughout China entered Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

=== Environmental issues ===


Some areas in Taiwan with high population density and many factories are affected by heavy pollution. The most notable areas are the southern suburbs of Taipei and the western stretch from Tainan to Lin Yuan, south of Kaohsiung. By the late 20th century, Taipei suffered from extensive vehicle and factory air pollution, but after the government required mandatory use of unleaded petrol and established the Environmental Protection Administration in 1987 to regulate air quality, the air quality of Taiwan has improved dramatically. Motor scooters, especially older or cheaper two-stroke versions, which are ubiquitous in Taiwan, contribute disproportionately to urban air pollution. The Taichung Power Plant also contributes significantly to air pollution, producing more than the country of Switzerland.

Other environmental issues include water pollution from industrial emissions and raw sewage, contamination of drinking water supplies, trade in endangered species, and low-level radioactive waste disposal. Though regulation of sulfate aerosol emissions from petroleum combustion is becoming stringent, acid rain remains a threat to the health of residents and forests. Atmospheric scientists in Taiwan estimate that more than half of the pollutants causing Taiwan&#x27;s acid rain are carried from China by monsoon winds.

Taiwan historically had a serious problem with the illegal dumping of household and industrial waste which became so severe that Taiwan was known as &quot;garbage island&quot;. This high level of pollution led to civil and government action, by 2022 the recycling rate was one of the highest in the world at 55%. Community activism was key to this change along with innovations such as garbage trucks which play music.

Illegal extraction by Chinese sand dredging vessels has caused significant damage to the marine environment of Taiwan&#x27;s outlying areas. The Taiwan Banks are a particularly hard hit target. Bottom trawling is a controversial practice due to the environmental damage it causes. Bottom trawlers with a tonnage under 50 are restricted from trawling within 5 km of shore and those over 50 tons are restricted from trawling within 12 km of shore. In 2023 the maximum penalty for ocean pollution was raised from US$48,820 to US$3.25 million.

<doc id="30091" wikidata="Q707438" url="?curid=30091" title="Politics of Taiwan">
<text>Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is governed in a framework of a representative democratic republic under a five-power system first envisioned by Sun Yat-sen in 1906, whereby under the constitutional amendments, the President is head of state and the Premier (President of the Executive Yuan) is head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Executive Yuan. Legislative power is vested primarily in the Legislative Yuan. Taiwan&#x27;s judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. In addition, the Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants, and the Control Yuan inspects, reviews, and audits the policies and operations of the government.

The party system is currently dominated by two major parties: the Kuomintang (KMT), which broadly favors maintaining the constitutional framework of the Republic of China Constitution and economic cooperation with mainland China, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which broadly favors de jure Taiwanese independence, and the eventual abolition of the ROC Constitution in favor of creating a &quot;Taiwanese Republic.&quot;

Ever since the &quot;de facto&quot; end of the Chinese Civil War and the retreat of the government of the Republic of China to Taiwan, the modern-day ROC, or the &quot;free area&quot;, currently consists of Taiwan Island, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and several smaller islands, including Taiping Island in the South China Sea. Taiwan&#x27;s six major cities, Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, and Taoyuan, are special municipalities. The rest of the country is divided into 3 cities and 13 counties. Historically but no longer published since early 2000s, the nominally &quot;de jure&quot; subdivided into 35 provinces, 1 special administrative region, 2 regions, and 18 special municipalities.

Prior to the constitutional reforms in 1991, the political system of Taiwan took place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, where the President served a primarily ceremonial role as Head of State. Executive power was exercised by the government. Legislative power is formally vested in both the government and its tricameral parliament: the National Assembly where it elects the President and Vice-President as well as make major constitutional amendments, the Control Yuan and the Legislative Yuan.

Until the end of the martial law period in 1987, the Taiwanese political system under the KMT &quot;Dang Guo&quot; regime and White Terror was authoritarian, whereby political opposition was harshly suppressed, all religious activity controlled by the KMT, dissent not permitted, and civil rights curtailed. After democratization in the 1990s, new political parties became legal, and restrictions on free speech and civil rights were lifted. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Taiwan was 2023 the second most electoral democratic country in Asia.

== Legal framework ==
Taiwan is governed under the Constitution of the Republic of China, which was drafted in 1947 before the fall of the mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the full retreat of the ROC government to Taiwan. The Constitution outlined a government intended for Greater China, with territorial considerations encompassing mainland China, Mongolia, Taiwan, and other Qing-ruled areas. Significant amendments were made to the Constitution in 1991, and there have been a number of judicial interpretations made to take into account the fact that the Constitution covers a much smaller area than originally envisioned.

As the Kuomintang government continued to insist that it was the only legitimate government of Greater China, when the KMT retreated to Taipei in 1949, it re-established the full array of central political bodies which existed in mainland China in the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of Nanjing (Nanking). While much of this structure remains in place, in 1991 President Lee Teng-hui unofficially abandoned the government&#x27;s claim of sovereignty over mainland China by stating that Taiwan does not &quot;dispute the fact that the Communists control mainland China.&quot; However, the National Assembly has not officially altered the nominal national borders, since to do so might be viewed as a prelude to formal Taiwanese independence. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has several times threatened to start a war if the government of Taiwan formalizes independence, as codified in its Anti-Secession Law. Neither the National Assembly nor the Supreme Court has defined what the term &quot;existing national boundaries,&quot; as stated in the constitution, actually means. The latter refused to do so, noting it was a &quot;significant political question.&quot;

=== Administrative divisions ===

The ROC currently administers the island of Taiwan (Formosa), Penghu (Pescadores), Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu Islands. The whole country is divided into two streamlined provinces (Taiwan and Fukien) and six special municipalities. Since the provinces are streamlined and the de facto dissolution of the provincial governments, the cities and counties are directly governed by the central government, namely Executive Yuan. The central governed administrative divisions are listed below
* Six special municipalities: Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, and Taoyuan.
* Two non-functioning provinces: Fukien and Taiwan
** Three provincial cities: Chiayi, Keelung, Hsinchu.
** 13 counties: Changhua, Chiayi, Hsinchu, Hualien, Kinmen, Lienchiang, Miaoli, Nantou, Penghu, Pingtung, Taitung, Yilan and Yunlin.

== Political history ==

===Taiwan under Qing rule===

After the conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning by Qing admiral Shi Lang, Taiwan was brought under Qing rule from 1683 to 1895. The Qing dynasty was a Manchu-led absolute monarchy with the emperor holding absolute authority.

===Taiwan under Japanese rule===

After the First Sino-Japanese War, Qing China ceded Formosa and surrounding islands to Japan. Under Japanese rule, Taiwan had its governor general as its head of government under the constitutional monarchy led by the Emperor. Taiwanese citizens in Formosa and Pescadores were Japanese citizens until the end of World War II in 1945.

In the 1920s, activists led by the Taiwanese Cultural Association launched a series of campaigns to petition for a Taiwanese parliament.

===Republic of China (1945–present)===
Prior to the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1949, the Kuomintang (KMT) government of the Republic of China (ROC) took over administration of Taiwan from the Japanese. Escorted by George H. Kerr, KMT official Chen Yi officially accepted Japan&#x27;s surrender on 25 October 1945 and proclaimed that day to be Retrocession Day.

In the early years of KMT rule of Taiwan, rampant corruption in the new administration headed by Chen caused high unemployment rates, widespread disease, and severe inflation, which in turn led to widespread local discontent. These domestic problems culminated in the eruption of an anti-government uprising in 1947. The government imposed military repression in what became one of the longest imposition of martial law by any regime in the world, lasting a total of 38 years.

After the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975, Vice President Yen Chia-kan briefly took over from 1975 to 1978, according to the Constitution, but the actual power was in the hands of Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, who was KMT chairman and son of Chang Kai-shek. 

In 1977, Taiwan experienced its first mass political protest since the 1940s during the Zhongli Incident. Protesting election fraud by the KMT, a crowd of ten thousand clashed with soldiers and burned down a police station.

In December 1979, a mass demonstration for democracy led to the Kaohsiung Incident in which police suppressed the demonstrations with violence, arresting dozens including eight opposition leaders known as the Kaohsiung Eight.

During the presidency of Chiang Ching-kuo from 1978 to 1988, Taiwan&#x27;s political system began to undergo gradual liberalization.

After the lifting of martial law, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party was formed and allowed to participate overtly in politics. After Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, Vice President Lee Teng-hui succeeded him as the first Taiwan-born president and chairman of the KMT. Lee became the first ROC president elected by popular vote in 1996, despite the PRC&#x27;s missile tests.

=== Transition to democracy ===

Changes in the political process were the result of the liberalizing trend that began in the 1980s under President Chiang Ching-kuo. In 1987, he lifted the emergency decree, which had been in place since 1948 and which had granted virtually unlimited powers to the president for use in the anti-communist campaign. This decree provided the basis for nearly four decades of martial law under which individuals and groups expressing dissenting views were dealt with harshly. Expressing views contrary to the authorities&#x27; claim to represent all of China or supporting independent Taiwan independence was treated as sedition. Vice-President Lee Teng-hui succeeded Chiang Ching-kuo as president when Chiang died on 13 January 1988. Lee was elected by the National Assembly to a 6-year term in 1990, marking the final time a president was elected by the National Assembly.

Since ending martial law, the Republic of China has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic political system. Most restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been lifted.

As the National Assembly took action in 1994 to allow for the popular election of the president, the LY in 1994 passed legislation to allow for the direct election of the governor of Taiwan Province and the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung Municipalities. These elections were held in December 1994, with the KMT winning the governor and Kaohsiung mayor posts, and the DPP winning the Taipei mayor&#x27;s position. In March 1996, Lee Teng-hui was elected president and Lien Chan vice president in the first direct election by Taiwan&#x27;s voters. In 1998, the KMT&#x27;s Ma Ying-jeou wrestled back control of the mayorship of Taipei from the opposition DPP&#x27;s most prominent figure Chen Shui-bian. In the same elections, however, the DPP&#x27;s Frank Hsieh managed to defeat Kaoshiung&#x27;s KMT incumbent.

The position of elected governor and many other elements of the Taiwan Provincial Government were eliminated at the end of 1998. The stated purpose of this was to streamline administrative efficiency, but some commentators have argued that this was also intended to weaken the power base of Governor James Soong. In November 1997 local elections, the DPP won 12 of the 23 county magistrate and city mayor contests to the KMT&#x27;s 8, outpolling the KMT for the first time in a major election.

In March 2000, Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian became the first opposition party candidate to win the presidency. His victory resulted in the first-ever transition of the presidential office from one political party to another in the ROC. The election also had the effect of splitting the KMT&#x27;s support base. James Soong launched an independent bid for the presidency after failing to be nominated by the party. In response the KMT expelled Soong and his supporters. Soong and his supporters blamed then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui of harboring pro-independence sentiments and purposely trying to aid Chen Shui-bian by splitting the KMT&#x27;s vote by running the less charismatic Lien Chan along with Soong. After losing the vote narrowly to Chen and ahead of Lien, Soong established the People First Party. Lee Teng-hui was soon forced out of the KMT Chairmanship amid popular protests and riots demanding he take responsibility for the KMT&#x27;s defeat.

In the months following the 2000 presidential election, Lee Teng-hui&#x27;s supporters established the Taiwan Solidarity Union, which advocated a more radical brand of Taiwan independence than the DPP. For this, Lee was expelled from the KMT and the KMT gradually moved itself to a more conservative and pro-unification position. This permitted the formation of two rival coalitions that have since dominated Taiwanese politics: the Pan-Blue Coalition formed by the KMT, People First Party, and New Party and the Pan-Green Coalition formed by the Democratic Progressive Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union.

In the 2001 LY elections, the DPP won a plurality of seats for the first time. However, the Pan-Blue Coalition held a small majority over the Pan-Green Coalition, causing much of President Chen&#x27;s agenda to be derailed. This also gave independents in the legislature more power, some of whom founded the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union in 2004.

In election on 20 March 2004, President Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by 50.1% of the popular vote to a second term. The election was marred by a shooting incident the day before the election during which President Chen and his running mate Vice President Annette Lu were slightly wounded. While the opposition contested the results and suggested the shooting was staged to win sympathy (as President Chen had previously been slated to lose narrowly), it was the first time that the DPP has won an outright majority in an island-wide election.

The March election also included a &quot;peace referendum&quot;. Historically, the issue of referendums has been closely tied to the question of Taiwan independence, and thus has been a sensitive issue in cross Strait relations. There were two referendums before the voters on 20 March 2004. The first asked in light of the PRC missile threat whether the ROC should purchase anti-missile systems. The second asked whether Taiwan should adopt a &quot;peace framework&quot; for addressing cross Strait differences with the PRC. However both referendums failed to obtain support from over 50% of registered voters, as required to be valid. The Pan-Blue Coalition campaigned against the referendum as unnecessary and urged voters to boycott it.

President Chen Shui-bian has called for major constitutional reforms by 2006 aimed at further reducing layers of government, and making other structural changes aimed at improving governance. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has accused Chen of using the constitution issue to move Taiwan towards independence. He expressed opposition, however, in his 20 May 2004 inaugural address to using constitutional reform to alter the constitution&#x27;s definition of Taiwan sovereignty.

The Legislative Yuan passed a set of constitutional amendments on 23 August 2004 that halve the number of LY seats and create single-member districts. The revisions also eliminate the role of the National Assembly and permit the public to confirm or reject future revisions passed by the LY. These constitutional amendments were ratified by the National Assembly in 2005.

Prior to the 11 December 2004 elections to the Legislative Yuan, signs indicated that the DPP would for the first time dominate the Legislative Yuan. Polls projected a huge pan-green victory, and the DPP&#x27;s election tactics were based on them. This over-reliance on polls resulted in a huge setback. The pan-blue opposition managed to maintain their majority status within the Legislative Yuan, winning 114 seats out of the 225 seats. The Pan-Green only managed to win 101 seats. The remaining 10 seats were won by the independent candidates. Although the Pan-Green coalition increased their seats by one and the DPP remained the largest party, because of raised hopes the election was viewed as a disaster, and President Chen resigned his post as Chairman of DPP as a result.

On 3 December 2005, the KMT made major gains in municipal elections, taking 14 of 23 mayor or county magistrate seats, while the DPP retained only six seats of their previous 10. The pan-blue People First Party and New Party each took one seat, and an independent won one seat. The pan-green TSU was completely shut out. DPP chairman Su Tseng-chang had promised to resign to take responsibility for the defeat. This dramatic setback for the DPP and pan-greens was seen as a reaction to recent corruption scandals, and public disapproval of Chen Shui-Bian&#x27;s apparent refusal to improve cross-strait relations.

A. M. Rosenthal, former executive editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; accused China of fostering an &quot;apartheid&quot; policy toward Taiwan. Dr Tan Sun Chen, Taiwan&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, asserts that China&#x27;s obstruction in the international community has led to a &quot;political apartheid&quot; which &quot;harms the human rights, interests, and dignity of Taiwan&#x27;s people.&quot;.

In 2000, Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was elected president, marking the first peaceful democratic shift in governance to an opposition party in ROC history and a decisive end to the KMT&#x27;s governmenetal monopoly.

In the 2004 presidential election, the day after being shot while campaigning, Chen was reelected by a narrow margin of 0.2%. The KMT filed lawsuits to demand a recount, alleged voting fraud and staged huge rallies to demand a new election. The courts ruled that the election was accurate and valid.

In both of Chen&#x27;s terms, the DPP and the independence-leaning Pan-Green Coalition failed to secure a majority in the legislature, losing to the KMT and the pro-unification leaning Pan-Blue Coalition. This has led to many impasses; the president in the ROC system does not have the power of veto, so the legislature is not required to obtain the assent of the executive branch in order to make laws.

In January 2008, opposition party Kuomintang won a landslide victory in legislative election. President Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost. In March 2008, Ma Ying-jeou of Kuomintang party was elected as president. In January 2012, President Ma Ying-jeou was re-elected.

In January 2016, Democratic Progressive Party candidate Tsai Ing-wen won presidential election. She became the first female president of Republic of China. In January 2020, Tsai was re-elected, and in the simultaneous legislative election, President Tsai&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won a majority, with 61 out of 113 seats. The Kuomintang (KMT) got 38 seats.

In the 21st century, Taiwan&#x27;s political system has been moving towards digital democracy with increased participation from civil society and greater transparency from the government.

In January 2024, William Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party won the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election. However, no party won a majority in the simultaneous Taiwan&#x27;s legislative election for the first time since 2004, meaning 51 seats for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), 52 seats for the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party (TPP) secured eight seats.

== Current political issues ==

The dominant political issue today in Taiwan is its relationship with the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that has jurisdiction over mainland China. Specifically, many people in Taiwan desire the opening of direct transportation links with mainland China, including direct flights, which would aid many Taiwanese businesses that have opened factories or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such links will lead to tighter economic and thus political integration with the PRC, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, Chen Shui-bian called for managed opening of links.

Mainland China and Taiwan resumed regular direct flights or cross-Strait relations on 4 July 2008, after six decades, as a &quot;new start&quot; in their tense relations. Liu Shaoyong, chair of China Southern Airlines, piloted the first flight from Guangzhou to Taipei (Taoyuan International Airport). Simultaneously, a Taiwan-based China Airlines flight flew to Shanghai. Five mainland Chinese cities will be connected with eight Taiwan airports, with 4 days a week, 36 round-trip flights across the Taiwan Strait, thereby eliminating time-consuming Hong Kong stopovers. Other major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States were reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder the recent improvement of ties between China and Taiwan. Another major political issue, is the establishment of a National Communications Commission to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget exercised great control over the media.

Banking reform, including consumer finance (limiting rates on credit cards) and bank mergers, is also a major issue. Taiwan&#x27;s financial sector is quite unwieldy, with over 48 banks, none of which have a market share over 10%. In addition, the government controls 50% to 60% of Taiwan&#x27;s banking assets. The ultimate aim is the creation of large financial institutions that will then have the ability to compete internationally.

In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT&#x27;s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of any wrong-doings by the courts. Since completing his second term as President, Chen Shui-bian has been charged with corruption and money laundering.

The merger of the KMT and People First Party (PFP) was thought to be certain, but a string of defections from the PFP to the KMT have increased tensions within the Pan-Blue camp.

In 2006, due to the Pacific Sogo Department Store scandal, the pro-KMT Pan-Blue Coalition moved to impeach the President but failed to obtain the requisite number of votes in the legislature. This failure led to a &quot;Down Ah-Bian&quot; campaign, which sought to pressure the president to resign from office. The campaign began on 1 September 2006. Campaign organizers claimed that the first day of the strike attracted 300,000 people in Taipei, while the police estimated the number to be closer to 90,000. The &quot;Down Ah-Bian&quot; event was being led by activist and politician Shih Ming-te as a peaceful sit-in around the capital, besieging the presidential residence. While the protests have been largely peaceful, there have been isolated incidences of violence associated with the campaign, including fist fights between Pan-Blue and Pan-Green (pro-DPP) legislatures. The &quot;Up Ah-Bian&quot; event was organized to counteract the &quot;Down Ah-Bian&quot; campaign. On 13 October 2006, the Pan-Blue Coalition attempted again to pass a recall motion against the ROC President Chen Shui-bian, which also failed to garner sufficient votes in the legislature.

On 3 November 2006, prosecutors in Taiwan stated that they have enough evidence to indict Chen&#x27;s wife on corruption charges in connection with her handling of a secret diplomatic fund. According to the prosecutors, while Chen would not be indicted while in office, there is a possibility that he would be indicted after he leaves office.

=== Political status ===
One key issue has been the political status of Taiwan itself. With the diplomatic isolation brought about in the 1970s and 1980s, the notion of &quot;recovering the mainland&quot; by force has been dropped and the Taiwanese localization movement strengthened. The relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the related issues of Taiwan independence and Chinese unification continue to dominate Taiwanese politics.

The political scene in the ROC is divided into two camps, with the pro-unification KMT, People First Party (PFP), and New Party forming the Pan-Blue Coalition; and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and strongly pro-independence Social Democratic Party (SDP), and Taiwan Statebuilding Party (TSP) forming the Pan-Green Coalition. Because of the dominance of the unification-independence issue in Taiwan&#x27;s political scene, it is difficult to categorise either camp as &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot; on the conventional basis of economic or social policies.

Supporters of the Pan-Green camp tend to favor emphasizing the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Many Pan-Green supporters seek formal Taiwan independence and for dropping the title of the Republic of China. However, more progressive members of the coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, have moderated their views and claim that it is unnecessary to proclaim independence because Taiwan is already &quot;an independent, sovereign country&quot; and that the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Some members take a much more extreme view about Taiwan&#x27;s status, claiming that the ROC is nonexistent and calling for the establishment of an independent &quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot;. Supporters of this idea have even gone as far as issuing self-made &quot;passports&quot; for their republic. Attempts to use these &quot;passports&quot; however, have been stopped by officials at Chang Kai-shek International Airport.

While the Pan-Green camp favors Taiwan having an identity separate from that of China, some Pan-Blue members, especially former leaders from the older generation, seem to be strongly supportive of the concept of the Republic of China, which remains an important symbol of their links with China. During his visit to mainland China in April 2005, former KMT Party Chairman Lien Chan reiterated his party&#x27;s belief in the &quot;One China&quot; policy that states that there is only one China controlled by two governments and that Taiwan is a part of China. PFP Party Chair James Soong expressed the same sentiments during his visit in May. In contrast to the positions of these two leaders of the older generation, the more mainstream Pan-Blue position is to pursue negotiations with the PRC to immediately open direct transportation links with China and to lift investment restrictions. With regards to independence, the mainstream Pan-Blue position is to simply maintain the ROC&#x27;s current state, and being open to negotiations for unification after China is democratized enough to respect human rights.

For its part, the PRC has indicated that it finds a Republic of China far more acceptable than an independent Taiwan. Although it views the ROC as an illegitimate entity, it has stated that any effort on Taiwan to formally abolish the ROC or formally renounce its claim over mainland China would result in a strong and possibly military reaction. However, the defense of Taiwan by the US and Japan is likely, so it is not, in reality, clear what the PRC reaction would be. The US&#x27;s current position is that the Taiwan issue must be resolved peacefully and that it condemns unilateral action by either side, an unprovoked invasion by China or a declaration of formal independence by Taiwan.

=== National identity ===
Roughly 84% of Taiwan&#x27;s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from mainland China between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the 1940s and 1950s. But between 1895 and the present, Taiwan and mainland China have shared a common government for only 4 years. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival Taiwan and China have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for &quot;de jure&quot; Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only. The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.

According to a survey conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese. 3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider that Taiwan and China are two separate countries developing each on its own. A recent survey conducted in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese only.

=== Cross-Strait relations ===
Despite the differences between Taiwan and mainland China, contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has grown significantly over the past decade. The ROC has continued to relax restrictions on unofficial contacts with the PRC, and cross-Strait interaction has mushroomed. Since 1987, when the ban on travel to mainland China was lifted, Taiwan residents have made more than 10 million trips to mainland China. The ROC Bureau of Foreign Trade estimates that indirect trade with mainland China reached about US$61.639 billion, or 18% of the total trade of the ROC, in 2004. This indirect trade runs heavily in Taiwan&#x27;s favor, providing another outlet for the island&#x27;s booming economy. In an attempt to facilitate trade, in 1995 the Executive Yuan approved the construction of an offshore transshipment center at the port of Kaohsiung through which direct shipping with the mainland would be permitted. In April 1997 the first sanctioned direct cross-Strait shipping began between selected mainland China ports and Kaohsiung for cargo being transshipped through Taiwan.

Beijing has expressed a mixed view of these developments. PRC leaders are pleased at the development of economic ties and exchanges, which they believe helps their cause of unification. However, the increase in contacts, combined with domestic political liberalization on Taiwan, also has resulted in more open discussion in Taiwan of the future of Taiwan, including the option of independence, to which Beijing is strongly opposed.

When Lee Teng-hui visited his alma mater in the US in 1995, this caused harsh criticism from the PRC, which ultimately led to the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. Lee Teng-hui&#x27;s characterization in 1999 of relations between the ROC and mainland China as &quot;between two states&quot; was denounced by the Chinese government; Lee partially changed his earlier statement and referred to the 1992 consensus between the ROC and the PRC. Taiwan business representatives have concerns about issues such as safety, corruption, and contract disputes, which have led to increased caution and a search for alternative investment venues but not to pulling out from mainland China altogether. President Chen has yet to revise the previous administration&#x27;s &quot;no haste, be patient&quot; policy regarding Taiwan-mainland China investment to prevent over-dependence on the PRC. As a result of this policy the ROC placed restrictions on large-scale infrastructure investments on mainland China in 1997.

The development of semi official cross-Strait relations has been incremental. Prior to April 1993, when talks were held in Singapore between the heads of two private intermediary organizationsTaiwan&#x27;s Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the PRC&#x27;s Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)there had been some lower-level exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. The April 1993 SEF-ARATS talks primarily addressed technical issues relating to cross-Strait interactions. Lower-level talks continued on a fairly regular basis until they were suspended by Beijing in 1995 after President Lee&#x27;s U.S. visit. Unofficial exchanges resumed in 1997 through informal meetings between personnel of the two sides&#x27; unofficial representative organizations. Direct SEF-ARATS contacts resumed in April 1998, and the SEF Chairman visited mainland China in October 1998. A planned visit by ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan to Taiwan in the fall, however, was postponed following statements made by then-President Lee Teng-hui that relations between mainland China and Taiwan should be conducted as &quot;state-to-state&quot; or at least as &quot;special state-to-state relations.&quot; Since his 20 May 2000 inauguration, President Chen has called for resuming the cross-Strait dialogue without any preconditions. President Chen has stated that such talks should be conducted on the basis of the &quot;spirit of 1992,&quot; a reference to the agreement to hold the 1993 Singapore talks. The PRC, however, has insisted that President Chen must recognize the one China principle before talks can be held.

===Presidency===
The President is the head of state of the Republic of China and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president has authority over the five administrative branches (Yuan): Executive, Legislative, Control, Judicial, and Examination.

===National Assembly===
The National Assembly of the Republic of China was elected in mainland China in 1947 to officially carry out the duties of choosing the president, to amend the constitution, and to exercise the sovereignty of the citizens, but in actuality, the Assembly&#x27;s role in Taipei seemed to reconfirm the executive powers of President Chang Kai-shek. The National Assembly was re-established on Taiwan when the government moved. Because it was impossible to hold subsequent elections to represent constituencies in mainland China, representatives elected in 1947–48 held these seats &quot;indefinitely.&quot; In June 1990, however, the Council of Grand Justices mandated the retirement, effective December 1991, of all remaining &quot;indefinitely&quot; elected members of the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and other bodies.

The second National Assembly, elected in 1991, was composed of 325 members. The majority was elected directly; 100 were chosen from party slates in proportion to the popular vote. This National Assembly amended the constitution in 1994, paving the way for the direct election of the president and vice president that was held in March, 1996. The National Assembly retained the authority to amend the constitution, to recall or to impeach the president or vice president, and to ratify select senior-level presidential appointments. In April 2000, the members of the National Assembly voted to permit their terms of office to expire without holding new elections. They also determined that such an election would be called in the event the National Assembly is needed to decide a presidential recall or a constitutional amendment. In recent years, the National Assembly has handed most of its powers to the Legislative Yuan, including the power of impeachment. In 2005, the National Assembly permanently abolished itself by ratifying a constitution amendment passed by the Legislative Yuan.

Amending the ROC constitution now requires the approval of three-fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan. This quorum requires at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After passing by the legislature, the amendment needs ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC regardless of voter turnout.

===Executive Yuan===
The Executive Yuan comprises the premier, vice-premier, and the cabinet members who are responsible for policy and administration. The President of the Republic appoints the Premier, who is officially the President of the Executive Yuan.

===Legislative Yuan===
The main lawmaking body, the Legislative Yuan (LY), was originally elected in 1947. The first LY had 773 seats and was viewed as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; institution. Like the National Assembly, representatives elected in 1947–48 held these seats &quot;indefinitely&quot; until the 1991 ruling. The second LY was elected in 1992. The third LY, elected in 1995, had 157 members serving 3-year terms. The fourth LY, elected in 1998, was expanded to 225 members. The LY has greatly enhanced its standing in relation to the Executive Yuan and has established itself as an important player on the central level. Along with increasing strength and size this body is beginning to reflect the recently liberalized political system. In the 1992 and 1995 elections, the main opposition partythe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)challenged the KMT dominance of the Legislature. In both elections the DPP won a significant share of the LY seats, and the KMT held only half the seats in the LY. In 1998, however, the KMT increased its LY majority from 50% to 55% and continued to play a dominant role in the legislature as the leading opposition party. In the 2001 election, the DPP became the largest party after large losses suffered by the KMT. Control of the Yuan swung back to the KMT after the 2008 elections, while in 2016 the DPP regained the status as the largest party and achieved a majority for the first time in history.

===Judicial Yuan===
The Judicial Yuan (JY) administers the ROC&#x27;s court system. It includes a 15-member Council of Grand Justices (COGJ) that interprets the constitution. Grand Justices are appointed by the President, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan, to 8-year terms.

===Control Yuan===
The Control Yuan (CY) was elected in 1947 by provincial legislatures. The current form since 1993 monitors the efficiency of public service and investigates instances of corruption. The 29 Control Yuan members are appointed by the president and approved by the Legislative Yuan; they serve 6-year terms. In recent years, the Control Yuan has become more active, and it has conducted several major investigations and impeachments. The current president of the Control Yuan is Chen Chu.

===Examination Yuan===
The Examination Yuan (ExY) functions as a civil service commission and includes two ministries: the Ministry of Examination, which recruits officials through competitive examination, and the Ministry of Personnel, which manages the civil service. The President appoints the Examination Yuan&#x27;s President.
The current President of the Examination Yuan is Chou Hung-hsien.

=== Political parties ===
As of July 2015, there are 277 officially registered parties in Taiwan. The aftermath of the 2000 Presidential election and the 2001 legislative election left the Taiwan fragmented among several political parties. These parties can be divided into &quot;blue&quot; factions (Pan-Blue Coalition) and &quot;green&quot; factions (Pan-Green Coalition), with the &quot;blue&quot; faction tending toward unification and a national identity that is linked with China and the &quot;green&quot; faction leaning toward a national identity based on Taiwan independence which is separate from the Chinese national identity. The complex structure of the party system in Taiwan was also influenced by the voting system which uses single non-transferable vote for legislative elections and first past the post for executive elections. Starting with the 2008 legislative elections, the SNTV system was discarded in favor of a mixed single member district (SMD) with proportional representation based on national party votes, similar to Japan.

The &quot;blue&quot; faction comes from the color of the KMT and includes the KMT, the People First Party, and the New Party. The &quot;green&quot; faction comes from the color of the Democratic Progressive Party and includes the Democratic Progressive Party, Social Democratic Party, and the Taiwan Statebuilding Party.

; Democratic Progressive Party 
After 1986, the KMT&#x27;s hold on power was challenged by the emergence of competing political parties. Before 1986, candidates opposing the KMT ran in elections as independents or &quot;nonpartisans.&quot; Before the 1986 island-wide elections many &quot;nonpartisans&quot; grouped together to create Taiwan&#x27;s first opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Despite the official ban on forming new political parties, the government authorities did not prohibit the DPP from operating, and in the 1986 elections DPP and independent candidates captured more than 20% of the vote.

The Civic Organizations Law passed in 1989 allowed for the formation of new political parties, thereby legalizing the DPP, and its support and influence increased. In the 1992 Legislative Yuan elections, the DPP won 51 seats in the 161-seat body. While this was only half the number of KMT seats, it made the DPP&#x27;s voice an important factor in legislative decisions. Winning the Taipei mayor&#x27;s position in December 1994, significantly enhanced the DPP&#x27;s image. The DPP continued its strong showing in the 1995 LY race, winning 45 of the 157 seats to the KMT&#x27;s 81. The DPP for the first time succeeded in outpolling the KMT in the November 1997 local elections, gaining 12 of the 23 magistrate and mayoral seats as opposed to the KMT&#x27;s 8 and winning 43% of the vote versus the KMT&#x27;s 41%.

The DPP membership is made up largely of the Hoklo people, the largest ethnic group in Taiwan. The DPP maintains that Taiwan is an entity separate from mainland China and supports an independent &quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot; as part of its platform. The recent downplaying of Taiwan independence by the DPP as a party, however, led to the formation by hard-line advocates of a new political party called the Taiwan Independence Party in December 1996.

; Kuomintang 
Until 1986, Taiwan&#x27;s political system was effectively controlled by one party, the KMT, the leader of which also was the President. Many top political officials were members of the party. The party claimed over 2 million members, and its net assets were reputed to total more than NT $61.2 billion, making it the richest political party in the world.

; Taiwan People&#x27;s Party 
The Taiwan People&#x27;s Party was formed on August 6, 2019 by Ko Wen-je, who serves as its first and current chairman. It is a center-left party that considers itself as an alternative to both the DPP and the KMT.

; New Power Party 
The New Power Party was formed in early 2015. The party emerged from the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014, and advocates for universal human rights, civil and political liberties, as well as Taiwan independence/nationalism. The NPP currently had 3 members in the LY.

; Social Democratic Party 
The Social Democratic Party was formed in early 2015. The party emerged from the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014, and advocates for a social-democratic and progressive party, calling for a reduction in income inequality, the protection of labour rights, the abolition of the death penalty and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The SDP currently had 1 members in the Taipei City Council.

; Taiwan Statebuilding Party 
The Taiwan Statebuilding Party which advocates &quot;de jure&quot; Taiwan independence and the party is considered a close ally of the Democratic Progressive Party. The TSP was formed primarily because the DPP had to moderate its stance with regard to Taiwan independence, leaving a hole in the Taiwanese political spectrum. The party first came to national attention when Chen Po-wei won Taichung District 2 to secure the party’s first Legislative Yuan seat.

; People First Party 
A new opposition party was formed in the wake of the March 2000 presidential election by the runner up, a KMT maverick candidate. The People&#x27;s First Party is composed primarily of former KMT and NP members who supported former KMT Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong&#x27;s presidential bid. The PFP currently had 17 members in the LY before the 2001 election, but increased its representation to over 40 in that election.

; New Party 
The New Party was formed in August 1993 by a group made up largely of second-generation mainlander KMT members who were unhappy both with corruption in the KMT and with what they saw as the &quot;Taiwanization&quot; of KMT ideology and leadership. The NP emphasizes &quot;clean government&quot; and the original KMT focus on unification with mainland China. NP influence remains modest and seems on the wane; it won 21 of the 164 LY seats in the 1995 elections but only 11 of 225 seats in 1998. The New Party was almost annihilated in the 2001 election as its members defected to the Peoples First Party.

; Taiwan Solidarity Union 
In 2001, supporters of former President Lee founded the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). Even though Lee did not join this party, he is named its spiritual leader and most believe he endorsed it. The TSU was formed primarily because, as it took power, the DPP had to moderate its standing as regards to Taiwan independence, leaving a hole in the Taiwanese political spectrum. In a bid to help the &quot;green&quot; side achieve control in the Legislative Yuan, the TSU was formed to attract the radical votes left over from DPP and the localist support for KMT. The TSU had often expressed that it wanted to be the &quot;decisive minority&quot;.

Other parties than the parties listed above include:
* Taiwan Number One Party
* New Nation Association
* Democratic Alliance
* Natural Law Party
* Taiwan Independence Party
* Green Party Taiwan
* Non-Party Alliance
* Farmers&#x27; Party
* Chinese Liberal Democratic Party
* Labor Party
* Third Society Party

Although some friction between 1949 Chinese immigrants and native Taiwanese still exists, it has abated with time, and there has been a gradual melding of the two communities. In 1972, then-Premier Chiang Ching-kuo began a concentrated effort to bring Taiwanese into more senior position in the central administration and the KMT. Upon his accession to the presidency in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui, who is a native Taiwanese, continued this process. Steps by the government to redress past wrongs such as setting up a memorial to the victims of the February 28 Incident have contributed to this process.

<text>The economy of [[Taiwan]] is a highly developed free-market economy. It is the 8th largest in Asia and 21st-largest in the world by purchasing power parity, allowing Taiwan to be included in the advanced economies group by the International Monetary Fund. Taiwan is notable for its rapid economic development from an agriculture-based society to an industrialized, high-income country. This economic growth has been described as the Taiwan Miracle. It is gauged in the high-income economies group by the World Bank. Taiwan is one of the most technologically advanced computer microchip and high-tech electronics industries makers in the world.

==History==

Taiwan has transformed itself from a recipient of U.S. aid in the 1950s and early 1960s to an aid donor and major foreign investor, with investments primarily centered in Asia. Private Taiwanese investment in mainland China is estimated to total in excess of US$150 billion, and official tallies cite Taiwan as having invested a comparable amount in Southeast Asia.

In 1949, over two million Kuomintang supporters fled to the island following the loss of Mainland China in the Chinese Civil War. The sudden increase in population also affected Taiwan&#x27;s economy.

Facing the economic pressure, the Kuomintang regime established several economic plans and policies. The first step towards industrialization was land reforms, a crucial step in modernizing the economy, as it created a class of landowners with the capital they could invest in future economic endeavors. US aid was also important in stabilizing post-war Taiwan, and it constituted more than 30 percent of domestic investment from 1951 to 1962. These factors, together with government planning and universal education, brought rapid advancements in industry and agriculture, and living standards. The economy shifted from an agriculture-based economy (32% of GDP in 1952) to an industry-oriented economy (47% of GDP in 1986). Between 1952 and 1961, the economy grew by an average of 9.21% each year.

Once again, the transformation of Taiwan&#x27;s economy cannot be understood without reference to a larger geopolitical framework. Although aid was cut back in the 1970s, it was crucial in its formative years, spurring industrialization, and security and economic links between Taiwan and the United States were maintained. Uncertainty about the US commitment accelerated the country&#x27;s shift from subsidized import-substitution in the 1950s to export-led growth.The development of foreign trade and exports helped absorb excess labor from a decreased importance of agriculture in the economy. Taiwan moved from cheap, labor-intensive manufactures, such as textiles and toys, into an expansion of heavy industry and infrastructure in the 1970s and then to advanced electronics in the subsequent decade. By the 1980s, the economy was becoming increasingly open, and the government moved towards the privatization of government enterprises. Technological development led to the establishment of the Hsinchu Science Park in 1981. Investments in mainland China spurred cross-strait trade, decreasing Taiwan&#x27;s dependence on the United States market. From 1981 to 1995, the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.52%, and the service sector became the largest sector at 51.67%, surpassing the industrial sector and becoming a major source of the economy&#x27;s growth.

International Trade is officially assisted by Taiwan External Trade Development Council. Because of the financial policy by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little from the financial crisis of 1997-1999 compared to other economies in the region.
==Data==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2021–2027). Inflation under 5% is in green.
==Economy by region==

==Economic outlook==
As of 2021, the three highest-paid sectors in Taiwan include telecommunication service, financial services, and information services. The economy of Taiwan ranked the highest in Asia in the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI). 
With the technocracy-centered economic planning until 1987, real growth in GDP has averaged about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have grown since World War II, with inflation and unemployment staying low and foreign reserves being the world&#x27;s fourth largest. Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and Ministry of Economic Affairs release major economic indicators of the economy of Taiwan.

Taiwan now faces many of the same economic issues as other developed economies. With the prospect of continued relocation of labor-intensive industries to economies with cheaper workforces, such as in mainland China, the Philippines, and Vietnam, Taiwan&#x27;s future development will have to rely on further transformation to a high-technology and service-oriented economy. In recent years, Taiwan has successfully diversified its trade markets, cutting its share of exports to the United States from 49% in 1984 to 20% in 2002. Taiwan&#x27;s dependence on the United States should continue to decrease as its exports to Southeast Asia and mainland China grow, and its efforts to develop European markets produce results. Taiwan&#x27;s accession to the WTO and its desire to become an Asia-Pacific &quot;regional operations center&quot; are spurring further economic liberalization. The economy of Taiwan is facing economic marginalization in the world economy de-internationalization and lower salaries. This results in human resource talents seeking career opportunities elsewhere. Businesses in Taiwan suffer most from being the size of small and medium enterprises, which impedes attempts at economic transformation in Taiwan by the Taiwanese government.

The indirect tax system of the economy of Taiwan comprises Gross Business Receipts Tax (GBRT) (gross receipts tax) and value-added tax (VAT). The economy of Taiwan is ranked 15th overall in the Global Top 20 Top Destination Cities by International Overnight Visitors (2014) by the MasterCard 2014 Global Destination Cities Index.

In addition, economic inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has been on the rise in Taiwan, rising from a value of 0.47 in 1980 to 0.61 in 2022 (before considering taxes and welfare transfers). Post-tax GINI was 0.32, similar to most other developed countries. 

===2007–2010 global financial crisis===
Taiwan recovered quickly from the global financial crisis of 2007–2010, and its economy has been growing steadily since. Its economy faced a downturn in 2009 due to a heavy reliance on exports which in turn made it vulnerable to world markets. Unemployment reached levels not seen since 2003, and the economy fell 8.36% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In response, the government launched a US$5.6 billion economic stimulus package (3% of its GDP), provided financial incentives for businesses, and introduced tax breaks. The stimulus package focused on infrastructure development, small and medium-sized businesses, tax breaks for new investments, and low-income households. Boosting shipments to new overseas markets, such as Russia, Brazil, and the Middle East, was also a main goal of the stimulus. The economy has since slowly recovered; by November 2010, Taiwan&#x27;s unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low of 4.73%, and continued dropping to a 40-month low of 4.18% by the end of 2011. The average salary has also been rising steadily for each month in 2010, up 1.92% from the same period in 2009. Industrial output for November 2010 reached another high, up 19.37% from a year earlier, indicating strong exports and a growing local economy. Private consumption is also increasing, with retail sales up 6.4% compared to 2009. After 10.5% economic growth in 2010, the World Bank expected growth to continue and reach 5% for 2011.

According to the National Development Council, Taiwan&#x27;s economy declined in May 2019 due to the ongoing China–United States trade war.

==Foreign trade==

Foreign trade has been the engine of Taiwan&#x27;s rapid growth during the past 40 years. Taiwan&#x27;s economy remains export-oriented; thus, it depends on an open world trade regime and remains vulnerable to downturns in the world economy. The total value of trade increased over fivefold in the 1960s, nearly tenfold in the 1970s, and doubled again in the 1980s. The 1990s saw a more modest, slightly less than twofold, growth. Export composition changed from predominantly agricultural commodities to industrial goods (now 98%). The electronics sector is Taiwan&#x27;s most important industrial export sector and is the largest recipient of United States investment.

Taiwan is a member of numerous trade agreements, with China, Japan, USA, the European Union, and Hong Kong as top 5 trade partners in 2010. Taiwan has one of the world&#x27;s lowest fertility rate and high housing prices. Labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues are concerns as Taiwan&#x27;s population decline is faster than other advanced economies.

As an island economy with a lack of natural resources and comparatively lower domestic aggregate demand, Taiwan&#x27;s highly educated human resources would contribute greatly to Value added Innovation management for expanding Taiwan&#x27;s international trade.

Taiwan, as an independent economy, became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (often shortened to &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; - both names resulting from PRC interference in the WTO) in January 2002. In a 2011 report by Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI), Taiwan ranked third-best globally for its investment environment.

Taiwan is the world&#x27;s largest supplier of contract computer chip manufacturing (foundry services) and is a leading LCD panel manufacturer, DRAM computer memory, networking equipment, and consumer electronics designer and manufacturer. Major hardware companies include Acer, Asus, HTC, Foxconn, TSMC and Pegatron. Textiles are another major industrial export sector, though of declining importance due to labor shortages, increasing overhead costs, land prices, and environmental protection.

Imports are dominated by raw materials and capital goods, which account for more than 90% of the total. Taiwan imports most of its energy needs. The United States is Taiwan&#x27;s third largest trading partner, taking 11.4% of Taiwanese exports and supplying 10.0% of its imports. Mainland China has recently become Taiwan&#x27;s largest import and export partner. In 2010, the mainland accounted for 28.0% of Taiwan&#x27;s exports and 13.2% of imports. This figure is growing rapidly as both economies become ever more interdependent. Imports from mainland China consist mostly of agricultural and industrial raw materials. Exports to the United States are mainly electronics and consumer goods. As the Taiwanese per capita income level has risen, demand for imported, high-quality consumer goods has increased. Taiwan&#x27;s 2002 trade surplus with the United States was $8.70 billion.

The lack of formal diplomatic relations between the Republic of China (Taiwan) with Taiwan&#x27;s trading partners appears not to have seriously hindered Taiwan&#x27;s rapidly expanding commerce. The Republic of China maintains cultural and trade offices in more than 60 countries with which it does not have official relations to represent Taiwanese interests. In addition to the WTO, Taiwan is a member of the Asian Development Bank as &quot;Taipei, China&quot; (a name resulting from PRC influence on the bank) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; (for the same reason as above). These developments reflect Taiwan&#x27;s economic importance and its desire to become further integrated into the global economy.

Taiwan is a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Taiwan is also an observer at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Energy Agency (IEA) as Member under the acronym of Chinese Taipei, and a member of International Chamber of Commerce as Chinese Taipei. Taiwan signed Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with People&#x27;s Republic of China on 29 June 2010. Taiwan has also signed free trade pacts with Singapore and New Zealand. Taiwan applied for the membership in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015.

The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with the People&#x27;s Republic of China was signed on 29 June 2010, in Chongqing. It could potentially widen the market for Taiwan&#x27;s exports. However, the true benefits and impacts brought by ECFA to Taiwan&#x27;s overall economy are still in dispute. The newly signed agreement will allow for more than 500 products made in Taiwan to enter mainland China at low or no tariffs. As of 2021, Taiwan&#x27;s exports to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (including Hong Kong) totaled about US$270 billion per year, which is equivalent to more than 40% of Taiwan&#x27;s total GDP. The government is also looking to establish trade agreements with Singapore and the United States.

==Industry==


Industrial output has gradually decreased from accounting for over half of Taiwan&#x27;s GDP in 1986 to just 31% in 2002. Industries have gradually moved to the capital and technology-intensive industries from more labor-intensive industries, with electronics and information technology accounting for 35% of the industrial structure. Industry in Taiwan primarily consists of many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) with fewer large enterprises. Traditional labor-intensive industries are being moved off-shore and replaced with capital and technology-intensive industries. These industries are in the pre-mature stage of the manufacturing industry in various global economic competitions, and growing from the over-reliance from the original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer models. The Institute for Information Industry is responsible for the development of the IT and ICT industry in Taiwan. Industrial Technology Research Institute is the advanced research center for applied technology for the economy of Taiwan. The art industry is significant with sales worth $225.4 million made domestically in 2019. Taiwanese collectors and artists are also prominent in the global art market.

The &quot;e-Taiwan&quot; project launched by the government seeks to use US$1.83 billion to improve the information and communications infrastructure in Taiwan in five major areas: government, life, business, transport, and broadband. The program seeks to raise industry competitiveness, improve government efficiency, and improve the quality of life, and aims to increase the number of broadband users on the island to 6 million. In 2010, Taiwan&#x27;s software market grew by 7.1% to reach a value of US$4 billion, accounting for 3.3% of the Asia-Pacific region market value. The digital content production industry grew by 15% in 2009, reaching US$14.03 billion. The optoelectronics industry (including flat panel displays and photovoltaics) totaled NT$2.2 trillion in 2010, a 40% jump from 2009, representing a fifth of the global market share. The economy of Taiwan is a partner in the Global Value Chains of Electronics Industry. Electronic components and personal computer are areas of international strength of Taiwan&#x27;s Information Technology industry.

Taiwan has a growing startup sector.

===Consumer goods===
Taiwan is a major producer of sporting goods with NT$59.8 billion of production in 2020, 40–50% of production is indoor fitness equipment. Taiwan is the global leader in golf equipment with 80% of global production concentrated in the country. The four largest golf OEM are all Taiwanese, however, these firms are increasingly selling products under their own brands.

The Taiwanese bicycle industry is significant. Production peaked at ten million units a year in the 1980s but declined as low end production moved abroad and domestic manufactures moved upmarket. Giant Bicycles and Merida Bikes are the largest Taiwanese bicycle manufacturers. Mountain bikes and ebikes make up much of contemporary production. In 2022 the bicycle industry hit a record $6 billion US in revenue.

===Semiconductor industry===

The semiconductor industry, including IC manufacturing, design, and packing, forms a major part of Taiwan&#x27;s IT industry. Due to its strong capabilities in OEM wafer manufacturing and a complete industry supply chain, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors. The sector output reached US$39 billion in 2009, ranking first in global market share in IC manufacturing, packaging, and testing, and second in IC design. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest contract chipmakers in the world, while MediaTek is the fourth-largest fabless supplier globally. In 1987, TSMC pioneered the fabless foundry model, reshaping the global semiconductor industry. From ITRI&#x27;s first 3-inch wafer fabrication plant built in 1977 and the founding of UMC in 1980, the industry has developed into a world leader with 40 fabs in operation by 2002. In 2007, the semiconductor industry overtook that of the United States, second only to Japan. Although the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010 affected sales and exports, the industry has rebounded with companies posting record profits for 2010. The international industrial forecast of semiconductor manufacturing, which is the flagship industry of the economy of Taiwan that faces immense competition ahead with its American counterparts. By 2020 Taiwan was the unmatched leader of the global semiconductor industry with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone accounting for more than 50% of the global market.

===Information technology===
Taiwan&#x27;s information technology industry has played an important role in the worldwide IT market over the last 20 years. In 1960, the electronics industry in Taiwan was virtually nonexistent. However, with the government&#x27;s focus on development of expertise with high technology, along with marketing and management knowledge to establish its own industries, companies such as TSMC and UMC were established. The industry used its industrial resources and product management experience to cooperate closely with major international suppliers to become the research and development hub of the Asia-Pacific region. The structure of the industry in Taiwan includes a handful of companies at the top along with many small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) which account for 85% of industrial output. These SMEs usually produce products on an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or original design manufacturer (ODM) basis, resulting in less resources spent on research and development. Due to the emphasis of the OEM/ODM model, companies are usually unable to make in-depth assessments for investment, production, and marketing of new products, instead relying upon importation of key components and advanced technology from the United States and Japan. Twenty of the top information and communication technology (ICT) companies have International Procurement Offices set up in Taiwan. As a signer of the Information Technology Agreement, Taiwan phased out tariffs on IT products since 1 January 2002.

Taiwan is a hub for global computing, telecommunications, and data management with a number of large server farms operating in the country. Google&#x27;s data center in Changhua is believed to be the largest in Asia. Taiwan is well connected to the global undersea fiber optic cable network and serves as a substantial traffic interchange.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture has served as a strong foundation for Taiwan&#x27;s economic miracle. It contributes 3% to GDP and the service sector makes up 73% of the economy. After retrocession from Japan in 1945, the government announced a long-term strategy of &quot;developing industry through agriculture, and developing agriculture through industry&quot;. As such, agriculture became the foundation for Taiwan&#x27;s economic development during early years and served as an anchor for growth in industry and commerce. Whereas in 1951, agricultural production accounted for 35.8% of Taiwan&#x27;s GDP, by 2013, it had been vastly surpassed, and its NT$475.90 billion accounted for only 1.69% of the GDP. , Taiwan&#x27;s agriculture was a mixture of crops (47.88%), livestock (31.16%), fishery (20.87%), and forestry (0.09%). Since its accession into the World Trade Organization and the subsequent trade liberalization, the government has implemented new policies to develop the sector into a more competitive and modernized green industry.

Although only about one-quarter of Taiwan&#x27;s land area is suitable for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by the small size of farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan&#x27;s agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan&#x27;s main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption have risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture, and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.

===Energy===

Due to the lack of natural resources on the island, Taiwan is forced to import many of its energy needs (currently at 98%). Imported energy totaled US$11.52 billion in 2002, accounting for 4.1% of its GDP. Although the industrial sector has traditionally been Taiwan&#x27;s largest energy consumer, its share has dropped in recent years from 62% in 1986 to 58% in 2002. Taiwan&#x27;s energy consumption is dominated by crude oil &amp; petroleum products (48.52%), followed by coal (29.2%), natural gas (12.23%), nuclear power (8.33%), and hydroelectric power (0.28%). The island is also heavily dependent on imported oil, with 72% of its crude oil coming from the Middle East in 2002. Although the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), a state-owned enterprise, is in charge of providing electricity for the Taiwan area, a 1994 measure has allowed independent power producers (IPPs) to provide up to 20% of the island&#x27;s energy needs. Indonesia and Malaysia supply most of Taiwan&#x27;s natural gas needs. It currently has three operational nuclear power plants. A fourth plant under construction was mothballed in 2014.

Although Taiwan&#x27;s per capita energy use is on par with neighboring Asian countries, in July 2005 the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced plans to cut 170 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2025. In 2010, carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 5.14 million metric tons. In order to further reduce emissions, the government also plans to increase energy efficiency by 2% each year through 2020. In addition, by 2015, emissions are planned to be reduced by 7% compared to 2005 levels.

Taiwan is the world&#x27;s 4th largest producer of solar-powered batteries and largest LED manufacturer by volume. In 2010, Taiwan had over 1.66 million square meters of solar heat collectors installed, with an installation density that ranks it as third in the world. The government has already built 155 sets of wind turbines capable of producing 281.6 MW of electricity, and additional projects are planned or under construction. Renewable energy accounts for 6.8% of Taiwan&#x27;s energy usage as of 2010. In 2010, the green energy sector generated US$10.97 billion in production value. The government also announced plans to invest US$838 million for renewable energy promotion and an additional US$635 million for research and development.

===Steel and heavy manufacturing===
Taiwan, as of 2017, is the world&#x27;s thirteenth-largest steel exporter. In 2018, Taiwan exported 12.2 million metric tons of steel, a one percent increase from 12.0 million metric tons in 2017. Taiwan&#x27;s exports represented about 3 percent of all steel exported globally in 2017, based on available data. The volume of Taiwan&#x27;s 2018 steel exports was one-sixth that of the world&#x27;s largest exporter, China, and nearly one-third that of the second-largest exporter, Japan. In value terms, steel represented just 3.6 percent of the total amount of goods Taiwan exported in 2018. Taiwan exports steel to more than 130 countries and territories. Over the decade from 2009 to 2019, Taiwan grew its steel exports by 24%. In 2018, the US imported 300,000 metric tons of pipe and tube products. Taiwan has developed a vast export trade to its most proximate neighbors in flat products. Taiwan&#x27;s stainless steel exports numbered 2018 about 500,000 metric tons.

Taiwan is the fourth largest exporter of machine tools and machine tool components in the world. The greater Taichung area is home to a cluster of machine tool manufacturers.

Taiwanese company Techman Robot Inc. is the world&#x27;s second largest producer of cobots.

The automotive industry in Taiwan is significant, with Taiwanese firms increasingly invested in automotive electrification; 75% of Tesla, Inc.’s suppliers are Taiwanese.

===Maritime industries===

In 2017, Taiwan exported one hundred and sixty-two yachts. In 2018 Taiwan was the fourth largest yacht building nation by feet of yacht built after Italy, The Netherlands and Turkey. Taiwan is one of the largest fishing nations on earth and the associated fish processing industry is also significant.

===Tourism industry===
==Largest companies==

According to the 2019 Forbes Global 2000 index, Taiwan&#x27;s largest publicly traded companies are:

According to the 2022 Fortune Global 500 Rankings, Taiwan&#x27;s largest publicly traded companies are:

==Labor policy==
===Union policies===
The Labor Union Laws, legislated by the Kuomintang (KMT) on the mainland, gave Taiwan workers the right to unionize. However, prior to the democratization of Taiwan, the functions of trade unions were limited under strict regulation and state corporatism. Under the Labor Union Laws, workers were only allowed to be organized at the companies, which means industry level unions were forbidden. Also, only one union could exist within each company or geographical area. Special occupational groups such as teachers were not allowed to unionize. The right to strike and collective bargaining were also hamstrung by law. The Collective Bargaining Agreement in 1930 stipulated that collective bargains were not legally valid without government approval. The democratization in 1986 brought dramatic changes to union participation and policies. Between 1986 and 1992, unionized workers increased by 13%. A number of autonomous, non-official trade unions emerged, including the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU) which acquired legal recognition in 2000. The amendments to the Labor Union Laws and Collective Bargaining Agreement both became effective in the early 21st century. The amended Labor Union Law lifted the limitations on special occupational groups from collective representation. The Collective Bargaining Agreement Act in 2008 guaranteed trade unions the power to negotiate with employers.

===Employment protection===
Taiwan&#x27;s labor rights and employment protections increased with its democratization progress in the 1980s, and it still has a relatively high level of employment protection compared to other East Asia countries. Implemented in August 1984, Labor Standards Law was the first comprehensive employment protection law for Taiwan workers. Prior to its implementation, the Factory Act was the primary law governing labor affairs, but was ineffective in practice because of its narrow coverage of businesses and issues and absence of penalties for violation. In contrast, Labor Standards Law covered a broader range of businesses and labor affairs and detailed penalties for its violation. It regulated a period of notice before firing employees and also required a higher level of severance payment. Other labor issues were also regulated by the law, including contract, wage, overtime payment, compensations for occupational accidents, etc. Penalties for employer violation were also clear in the law, stating fines and criminal liabilities. Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) was set up on 1 August 1987 to help with labor inspection and the enforcement of the Labor Standards Law.

In Taiwan, companies with at least a single employee have the compulsion to contribute to the insurer&#x27;s employment service insurance premium. The share of labor insurance is divided into a 7:2:1 ratio between employer, employee, and state. As far as a contribution towards social security, companies should pay at least 6% of the wages of its employees towards the social security.

===Active labor market policies===
Active labour market policies were carried out in Taiwan in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as a result of economic structural changes caused by globalization and deindustrialization. Unemployment increased and reached approximately 5% in 2002 and 2009. A set of policies was adopted to help the unemployed and provide jobs. The Employment Insurance Act of 2002 grants income security during unemployment but, at the same time, requires beneficiaries to use all available resources to find jobs. The Multi-Faceted Job Creation Program, first introduced in 1999, creates job in the third sector groups, especially in nonprofit organizations. It subsidizes those companies to provide vocational trainings and job opportunities. The Public Sector Temporary Employment Creation Program directly addressed the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike the Multi-Faceted Job Creation Programs, the Public Sector Temporary Employment Creation Program creates jobs in the government itself. From 2008 to 2009, the government was estimated to create 102,000 job opportunities through that program. A job creation project was also implemented to help young people by subsidizing the hiring of young people in universities and private companies.

===Working hours===
On 30 July 1984, Taiwan implemented an eighty-six article Labor Standards Act under Presidential Order No.14069. The act defined the standard work week as 40 labor hours with an eight-hour limit per day, permitting an overtime-included maximum of forty-eight labor hours per week.

Article 25 of the Labor Standards Act upholds there will be no sexual discrimination in the conditions of workers, however, because the Taiwanese culture and thus political economy traditionally &quot;categorizes female employees as naturally marriage- and family-oriented,&quot; women are assumed to obtain employment in fields that are limited to these ideals. As a result of feminist ideals becoming more prevalent with women seeking equal work conditions in modern societies such as Taiwan, even marital status policy and immigration policy have been affected as women seek less patriarchal roles to the point where Taiwanese men have sought higher rates of transnational marriages since the 1990s.

==Science and industrial parks==

In order to promote industrial research and development, the government began establishing science parks, economic zones which provide rent and utility breaks, tax incentives, and specialized lending rates to attract investment. The first of these, the Hsinchu Science Park was established in 1980 by the National Science Council with a focus on research and development in information technology and biotechnology. It has been called Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; and has expanded to six campuses covering an area of . Over 430 companies (including many listed on TAIEX) employing over 130,000 people are located within the park, and paid in capital totaled US$36.10 billion in 2008. Both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest and second largest contract chipmakers, are headquartered within the park. Since 1980, the government has invested over US$1 billion in the park&#x27;s infrastructure, and further expansion for more specialized parks have been pursued. The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), headquartered within the park, is the largest nonprofit research organization in Taiwan and has worked to develop applied technological research for industry, including for many of Taiwan&#x27;s traditional industries (such as textiles).

Following the success of the first park, the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP), consisting of the Tainan Science Park and the Kaohsiung Science Park, was established in 1996. In addition to companies, several research institutes (including Academia Sinica) and universities have set up branches within the park with a focus on integrated circuits (ICs), optoelectronics, and biotechnology. The Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) was established more recently in 2003. While the CTSP is still under development, many firms (including AU Optronics) have already moved into the park and begun manufacturing operations. Like the other parks, CTSP also focuses on ICs, optoelectronics, and biotechnology, with the optoelectronics industry accounting for 78% of its revenue in 2008. These three science parks alone have attracted over NT$4 trillion (US$137 billion) worth of capital inflow, and in 2010 total revenue within the parks reached NT$2.16 trillion (US$72.8 billion).

The Linhai Industrial Park, established in Kaohsiung in 1960, is a well-developed industrial zone with over 490 companies focusing on other industries including base metals, machinery and repairs, nonmetallic mineral products, chemical products, and food and beverage manufacturing. The Changhua Coastal Industrial Park, located in Changhua County, is a newer industrial cluster with many different industries such as food production, glass, textiles, and plastics.

They consist of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps), Air Force and Military Police Force. The military is under the civilian control of the Ministry of National Defense, a cabinet-level agency overseen by the Legislative Yuan.

Formerly known as the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), it was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1947 due to the implementation of the newly promulgated Constitution of the Republic of China. It was also historically referred to as the Chinese National Armed Forces (CNAF) prior to the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Chinese mainland and the gradual loss of international recognition in the 1970s by the United Nations and many countries, including the ROC&#x27;s close ally, the United States.

Until the late 1970s, the military&#x27;s primary mission was to prepare for an invasion of the Communist-controlled People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) through efforts such as Project National Glory. The military&#x27;s current primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against a possible military invasion by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) of the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat in the ongoing dispute over the ambiguous political status of Taiwan dating back to the &quot;de facto&quot; end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.

The ROCAF has an approximate active strength of 150,000 personnel, and is capable of mobilizing as many as 1.67 million reservists in the event of national exigencies or a full-scale war. It also has a large pool of former conscripts, with every fit male citizen of the ROC having to serve a year when they reach the military age of 18.

== Names ==
The Republic of China Armed Forces is the national military of the ROC. Commonly referred as the Taiwanese Armed Forces to distinguish from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. It is abbreviated as &quot;Kuo2-Chün1&quot; (, literally &quot;National Army&quot;).. Colloquially, it is also known in mainland China and elsewhere as the Taiwanese Armed Forces () to distinguish from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

When the ROC was in power in mainland China, its army was the National Revolutionary Army before being renamed as the Republic of China Armed Forces in 1947 due to the implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of China. It was also historically referred as the Chinese National Armed Forces (CNAF) prior to the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The name continued to be used internationally by a number of countries until the 1970s.

== History ==
=== Mainland era ===

Prior to 1947, the ROC Armed Forces were known as the National Revolutionary Army, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen in Guangdong in 1924. Because the Republic of China was divided by warlords since the 1911 Revolution, he wanted to create a military that would be politically dominated by the Chinese Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang). Sun Yat-sen accepted the help of the Soviet Union in creating a Soviet-style military and party system. As part of this effort, the Whampoa Military Academy was founded on 1 May 1924 with Soviet trainers and equipment. The Whampoa Academy provided politically indoctrinated officers that were loyal to the ideals of the Revolution and the Kuomintang Party. A Political Department was established in the Army, training political officers to maintain the Kuomintang&#x27;s ideological and civilian control. 

The National Revolutionary Army fought in the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1928 to reunite China under one government for the first time in two decades. It fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, and then against the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War. After the ROC military was defeated by the Communists on the mainland in 1949, the Nationalists evacuated to Taiwan.

=== Cold War ===
The promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947 renamed the National Revolutionary Army to the Republic of China Armed Forces (). Although the army was theoretically nationalized, it remained effectively a party army of the Kuomintang until the 1990s. The United States began providing military supplies and equipment to the ROC after the Korean War broke out, and in 1951 the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) Taiwan was created. The ROC military received extensive support from the United States, with MAAG helping set up dozens of military schools (including each branch having its own staff college and officer academy), providing American vehicles, aircraft, ships, and weapons, and restructuring the ROC Army. In 1957, U.S. Ambassador Karl Rankin described the ROC as having the second largest Asian military allied to the United States. In the late 1950s, the ROC Armed Forces had 600,000 troops, including 375,000 in the Army and 17,000 political officers.

During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954 and 1955, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army gained air and naval superiority over the ROC Armed Forces near the Dachen and Yijiangshan islands, forcing the ROC to give them up, after artillery fire from the mainland and attacks by PLA Air Force bombers and PLA Navy PT boats. But the ROC prevented the situation from happening again during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, when its garrison on the Kinmen Islands held out through an artillery barrage, the ROC Air Force shot down many PLAAF jets while losing far less of its own, and the Navy sunk some of their PT boats. The ROC Marine Corps used its amphibious vehicles to deliver supplies to the population of the Kinmen Islands while under artillery fire from the mainland. In the 1960s the ROC sent military personnel to assist South Vietnam during the Vietnam War in non-combat roles.

Up until the late 1980s, the ROC military&#x27;s objective was to eventually retake the mainland. That strategy changed in the 1990s with the understanding that challenging the PRC&#x27;s control of the mainland was unrealistic, and instead focused on defending Taiwan and its offshore islands. At first this consisted of both offensive and defensive methods, before becoming focused only on the defensive. To reflect this change, a ten-year restructuring plan for the Armed Forces was proposed in 1993 but it was cancelled in 1995 and replaced by another plan, known as the Armed Forces streamlining program, which was adopted by the government in December 1996. The end of the martial law in Taiwan in 1987 also led to a series of administrative reforms, occurring at the same time as the political changes. These included ending the Kuomintang&#x27;s political control of the military.

===Post-Cold War===
The ROC military bureaucracy was traditionally dominated by the Army, which was primarily an infantry force, until the late 1980s, when more emphasis was placed on the Navy and Air Force. In July 1997, the Armed Forces streamlining program was started, reducing the total number of troops and reorganizing Army divisions into more mobile combined arms brigades. In the late 1980s, the Army had 270,000 personnel, out of a total military of over 500,000. The Army received the biggest reduction in size as part of the military reform. By 2003, the Army was reduced to 199,237 soldiers, while the other services included 56,284 in the Navy (including Marines), 55,170 in the Air Force, 15,015 in the Combined Logistics Command, and 14,168 in the Military Police. The reduction in the number of troops continued during the presidency of Chen Shui-bian from 2000 to 2008. Taiwan&#x27;s transition to democracy also meant that the Armed Forces had to transition from being the armed wing of the KMT to a modern national military. This was a challenge with change resisted by many officers.

In January 2000, two defense laws were passed, the National Defense Law and the Ministry of National Defense Reorganization Law, which both took effect in March 2002. The laws created the basis for the civilian control and nationalization of the ROC military, by subordinating the General Staff to a civilian Minister of Defense, and created new organizations at the MND to improve strategic planning and armaments procurement. The two defense laws were also passed in part because of a scandal during the 1990s about the ROC Navy&#x27;s decision to purchase certain French frigates, which involved bribery of senior officials and the death of the officer in charge of navy procurement, and resulted in years of investigations. The effect of the post-1987 military reforms was integrating the military into a democratic political system: before 2000 Taiwan&#x27;s defense policy was controlled by generals, and since then it has been set by the lawmakers. The military has also been included in the truth and reconciliation process which followed the transition from dictatorship to democracy.

In the 21st century as the PRC vastly increased its defense spending, the Republic of China registered the lowest growth in defense spending of the major Asia-Pacific powers. These cutbacks were felt as vital land based systems were cut in order to afford an upgrade of aging fourth generation jet fighters (needed to respond to the PRC&#x27;s fifth generation fighter programs). And even the jet fighter upgrades were cut back in areas such as high performance jet engines. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found that these defense cuts could jeopardize Taiwan&#x27;s military preparedness. 

By 2008 the ROC military had a total strength of 260,000. In 2013 the ROC Armed Forces had over 240,000 active troops, which was reduced to 215,000 as of 2015, and then to 180,000 by 2023. The International Institute of Strategic Studies reported the active duty personnel of the military in 2023 as 169,000. President Tsai Ing-wen, who took office in 2016, has worked to strengthen the military, including by raising its budget, creating the All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency, and restoring conscription from four months to twelve months.

== Organization ==

The professional head of the Armed Forces is the Chief of the General Staff, who answers to the civilian command structure under the Minister of National Defense and the ROC President. Below the Chief are the Executive Vice Chief of the General Staff and two other Vice Chiefs, who oversee the Political Warfare Department and several Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff, each of whom leads a section (J-1 personnel, J-2 intelligence, J-3 operations, J-4 logistics, and J-5 planning). The headquarters of each individual branch are subordinated to the General Staff.

The following service commands are directly subordinate to the General Staff.
* Republic of China Army (ROCA)
* Republic of China Navy (ROCN)
** Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC)
* Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF)
* Republic of China Military Police (ROCMP)

The Coast Guard Administration was created in 2001 from related police and military units and is administered by the Executive Yuan and may be incorporated as a military branch during times of emergency but for the large part remains in civilian control.

=== Army ===
The Army is the land branch of the ROC Armed Forces tasked with defending Taiwan and its offshore islands. Because of the historical legacy of having once controlled mainland China, the Army has traditionally been the dominant branch of the ROC&#x27;s military forces, has the largest number of personnel, but it has received the biggest reduction in size from the military reforms of the 1990s. Also part of the reform was changing Army divisions into smaller and more mobile combined arms brigades. In recent years, with the reduction of conscription, it has been reported that Army brigades may only have 60% to 80% of the soldiers they require. The Army has several hundred tanks, some from the U.S. and some locally made, though all of them are many decades old.

In 2015, the Army was organized into 3 army corps, 5 infantry brigades, 3 mechanized infantry brigades, 4 armored brigades, 3 aviation brigades, and 5 artillery brigades, with a total of 1,100 tanks and 1,600 artillery pieces. The number of infantry brigades was gradually reduced from 25 in 2005 to 5 by 2016 and the number of armored brigades from 5 to 4 in 2010, while artillery brigades were increased and army aviation brigades were established in 2015. Also in 2015, the Army&#x27;s total personnel was reported at 150,000. In 2023 it had 94,000 soldiers.

In 2021, it was announced that Army&#x27;s corps and regional defense commands will be abolished eventually and replaced with combat theater commands to better coordinate ground, air, and naval forces. Currently, each corps and defense command of the ROC Army is assigned to a combat theater command, and the commanding general of each formation will also lead their theater command in wartime. This was interpreted by some military analysts as reducing the control of the Army over the military command structure and putting a greater focus on joint operations among the three branches. Although they are led by Army generals, in the future Navy and Air Force officers will be appointed as theater commanders. The new commands are comparable to U.S. unified combatant commands or the theater commands of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. As of 2021 the Army&#x27;s Kinmen and Matsu island commands were outside of this structure, as was the Aviation and Special Forces Command.

=== Navy ===
The Navy is responsible for maritime warfare and protecting the waters of Taiwan, including the offshore islands, as well as shipping lanes. The ROC Navy was built up after 1949 with U.S. assistance, receiving destroyers and frigates that were made or designed during World War II. Some of these were still in use at the start of the 1990s, when Taiwan started buying modern ships. In that decade Taiwan acquired French &quot;La Fayette&quot; frigates, Dutch &quot;Zwaardvis&quot; submarines, and German minehunters, which are still in service as of 2024. It also received &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers and &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; frigates from the United States. Since the 2000s, the ROCN has tried to improve its asymmetric warfare capability to counter the much larger People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy by locally building smaller and stealthier craft, such as fast missile boats, corvettes, and submarines, though its destroyers and frigates remain the main component of the fleet.

The size of the ROCN has not changed significantly between 2005 and 2024, except for the decommissioning of two destroyers and the addition of 12 corvettes. As of 2023 the Navy also had 40,000 personnel. In 2015 the Navy had 4 destroyers, 22 frigates, 1 corvette, 14 landing ships, and 4 diesel attack submarines. The majority of these ships are former U.S. Navy vessels. 

==== Marine Corps ====
The Marine Corps is the amphibious warfare arm of the ROC Navy. The original purpose of the Marines was to carry out amphibious landings on the mainland to establish a bridgehead for Army forces, and starting in the 1950s the ROC Marines received training in amphibious warfare from the USMC. Training exercises with the USMC were officially ended in 1979, but were resumed in 2017. More recently, the main purpose of the Marine Corps has been to defend Taiwan by disrupting PRC amphibious operations and to serve as a rapid response force. In 2021 Marines were deployed to Pratas Island when the PLA carried out war games in the area. In 2023 there were 10,000 ROC Marines, and they were organized in two Marine brigades, a special forces unit (the Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol Unit), and some support units.

=== Air Force ===

The Air Force is responsible for defending Taiwanese airspace and assisting in disaster relief. In recent years the ROCAF had to send aircraft to respond to Chinese planes entering Taiwan&#x27;s air defense identification zone. Founded on mainland China, the ROC Air Force on Taiwan received U.S. military assistance in the Cold War, including over 400 aircraft, which were mostly fighters. Beginning in 1954 with the F-86 Saber, by the late 1980s the ROCAF&#x27;s fighter force also had the F-100 Super Saber, the F-104 Starfighter, and Northrop F-5. In the 1990s Taiwan began acquiring more modern aircraft to replace the F-5 and to counter the improving People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Dassault Mirage 2000.

The Air Force has reduced its total number of aircraft in the mid-2000s, has been replacing them with more modern fighters. As of 2015, the ROC Air Force had 384 fighters, 19 transports, and 25 aircraft of other types, a reduction from 420 fighters and 40 transport aircraft as of 2005. In 2024 the ROCAF had a total of 35,000 personnel and 430 combat capable aircraft, being organized into 28 squadrons. The main components of the ROC Air Force are the Air Combatant Command and the Air Defense and Missile Command, the latter having five brigades equipped with AA missile systems and several battalions of AA artillery. Its current fighters include the Dassault Mirage 2000, Northrop F-5, AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Although the PLAAF has both technological and numerical superiority over the ROCAF, Taiwan has made efforts to improve its aircraft, including upgrading its F-16 fleet to the most advanced variant, the Block 70 Viper (F-16V).

=== Military Police ===

The Military Police are tasked with enforcing military discipline, supporting the civilian police, providing security for government officials and buildings, counterterrorism, and defending the capital of Taipei. The ROCMP is organized into four regional commands (including one for Taipei) which consist of several battalions and other units. In 2024 there were 5,000 MPs. The Military Police Command plans to double the size of its current force in the future to increase security in the capital city.

=== Reserve ===

The Reserve Command manages the Armed Forces Reserve, and has a headquarters staff of 400. There are three regional reserve commands that each oversee a reserve training center and offices at the county and municipal levels (Northern, Central, and Southern Area Reserve Commands). The Command is responsible for maintaining mobilization plans and training reserve units during peace time, consisting of fourteen days of drill every one years, and more extensive training in the event of a wartime mobilization. It also has the task of preparing the civilian industries of Taiwan to assist the military during a war, and being the coordinator of an all-out defense effort that involves the civilian population.

As of 2023, the Reserve was estimated to have a total of 1,657,000 reservists by the International Institute of Strategic Studies, including 1.5 million in the Army, 67,000 in the Navy, and 90,000 in the Air Force. The RAND Corporation estimated in 2017 that the total number of reservists is 2.5 million, including 60,000 each in the Navy and the Air Force. 

The Army Reserve would form 44 infantry brigades and 2 armored Brigade. These brigades are organized into four categories depending on the level of readiness: A-Level brigades are the highest level, and include active-duty troops that would serve with reservists; B-Level brigades would consist of cadets studying at military schools and academies; C-Level brigades are local units and represent the largest category in the reserves, and D-Level brigades would be drawn from reserve officer training courses operated by Reserve Command. Army A-Level and B-level brigades along with Marine reserve units would have a front line role similar to regular forces, while the other Army reserves would be used for static defense of important locations. Navy and Air Force reservists would have a supporting role at naval or air bases.

== Personnel ==
As of 2024 the armed forces are estimated to have between 150,000 and 169,000 personnel. The number of reservists is estimated at 1.657 million. Starting in 2024, Taiwanese male citizens are required to serve 12 months in the military.

According to the December 2022 reform known as the &quot;Strengthening All-People&#x27;s Defense Military Force Restructuring Plan&quot; (), ROCAF personnel will be organized into four categories: the Main Battle Troops (), the active-duty volunteer force that will be responsible primarily for fighting; the Garrison Troops (), that will mostly consist of conscripts and be used for defending infrastructure; the Civil Defense System (), consisting of alternative service personnel that do not want or are ineligible for combat roles and will be used for humanitarian aid, medical assistance, and logistics; and the Reserve System (), providing former volunteers for the Main Battle Troops and former conscripts for the Garrison Troops.

Immigrants from the PRC have to reside in Taiwan for twenty years before they can volunteer for military service. They are exempt from conscription.

=== All-out defense ===

Since 2021 training for reserve formations has been increased with an emphasis placed on urban and asymmetric warfare. The training period for reservists has been increased to two weeks from 5–7 days. In 2022 reserves numbered 2.31 million. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine increased support for and understanding from the public of the effectiveness of well trained and equipped reserves. In 2022 women were included in reserve training. Following the Russian invasion the Ministry of Defense raised the required national stockpile minimum for medication from two months to six months with up to a years worth of stockpiles mandated for critical drugs.

The military runs combat training camps for high school students during school breaks.

=== Conscription ===

During the 2000s, there were initial plans to turn the ROCAF into a volunteer armed forces as relations between the ROC and PRC were improving during this time. In 2012, ROC Ministry of National Defence announced that the length of service was reduced to 4 months from the original 1 year in December 2011 for those born after 1 January 1994, due to aims to establish an all-volunteer force. As since, all able-bodied men reaching conscription age will undergo 4 month long military training instead of serving for 1 year, as it was done previously. Those born prior to 1 January 1994 and were yet to complete their military service were given an option to serve in a non-combatant role for a duration of one year. During the 2010s, when conscription was reduced to four months of training, the military struggled to meet its recruitment targets, especially for combat roles.

This policy was reversed in 2022, when president Tsai Ing-wen announced that conscription will revert back to 1 year from 2024, as relations with the PRC had deteriorated since at least 2016 when her party came into power. The required four months of training, when it was in effect, was also criticized as being not enough to provide conscripts with military training.

=== Rank structure ===

==== Officers ====
The ROC Armed Forces&#x27; officer corps is generally viewed as being competent, displaying a high degree of professionalism. However, as a whole, the culture in the officer corps tends to be very cautious and conservative. The military also faces difficulties in the recruitment and retention of junior officers and NCOs due to competition with the private sector.

Officers are promoted monthly with ceremonial conferences of rank carried out twice a year. Previously both the promotions and ceremonial conferences had been carried out simultaneously on a biannual cycle.

The Republic of China Military Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy are the officer commissioning academies of each service branch.

==== Enlisted ====


=== Women ===
Women have a long history of service in Taiwan&#x27;s armed forces but were exempted from conscription. In 2022, Chen Yu-lin, a political warfare officer, became the first woman promoted to the rank of two star Lieutenant General. In 2023, 15% of active duty military personnel were women.

=== Indigenous ===
Taiwanese indigenous people make up a greater percentage of Taiwan&#x27;s armed forces than their percentage of the overall Taiwanese population, making up 8.7 percent of military personnel as of 2024. Taiwanese indigenous people are especially critical to elite military units where they constitute over half of the personnel in some units.

== Arms purchases and weapons development ==
=== Arms purchases ===

Acquisitions over the next several years will emphasize modern ISR equipment that will vastly improve communications and data-sharing among services. These and other planned acquisitions will gradually shift the island&#x27;s strategic emphasis to offshore engagement of invading PRC forces. It is hoped that this will serve to reduce civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure in the event of armed conflict.

The ROC&#x27;s armed forces are equipped with weapons obtained primarily from the United States, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

In July 2007 it was reported that the ROC Army would request the purchase of 30 AH-64D II Apache attack helicopters based on the 2008 defense budget. The United Daily News reported that as many as 90 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters would also be ordered to replace the UH-1Hs then in service.

During August, the ROC requested 60 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II missiles, two Harpoon guidance control units, 30 Harpoon containers, 30 Harpoon extended air-launch lugs, 50 Harpoon upgrade kits from AGM-84G to AGM-84L configuration and other related elements of logistics and program support, to a total value of US$125 million. The United States government indicated its approval of the order with notification to the United States Congress of the potential sale.

In mid-September 2007, the Pentagon notified the U.S. Congress of P-3C Orion order, which included 12 Orions and three &quot;spare aircraft&quot;, along with an order for 144 SM-2 Block IIIA missiles. The total value of the 12 P-3C Orions were estimated at around $1.96 billion and $272 million for the 144 SM-2 missiles. A contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin to refurbish the 12 P-3C Orion aircraft for the ROC on 2009-03-13, with deliveries to start in 2012.

In mid-November 2007, the Pentagon notified the US Congress about a possible sale to upgrade the ROC&#x27;s existing three Patriot missile batteries to the PAC-3 standard. The total value of the upgrade could be as much as $939 million.

The US government announced on 3 October that it planned to sell $6.5 billion worth of arms to the ROC ending the freeze of arms sales to the ROC. The plans include $2.5 billion worth of 30 AH-64D Block III Apache Longbow attack helicopters with night-vision sensors, radar, 174 Stinger Block I air-to-air missiles, 1,000 AGM-114L Hellfire missiles, PAC-3 missiles (330), four missile batteries, radar sets, ground stations and other equipment valued up to $3.1 billion. E-2T aircraft upgraded to E-2C Hawkeye 2000 standard were also included, worth up to $250 million. $200 million worth of submarine-launched Harpoon Block II missiles (32) would also be available for sale, $334 million worth of various aircraft spare parts and 182 Javelin missiles, with 20 Javelin command launchers.

However, not included in the arms sale were new F-16 C/D fighters, the feasibility study for diesel-electric submarines or UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The White House had declined to sell 66 F-16C/D fighter planes as US Pacific Command has felt no need for advanced arms to be sold to the ROC.

On 29 January 2010 the US government announced five notifications to US Congress for arms sales to the ROC, two Osprey class mine hunters for $105 million (all figures in US dollars), 25 Link 16 terminals on ships for $340 million, two ship- and two air-launched Harpoon L/II for $37 million, 60 UH-60M and other related items for $3.1 billion and three PAC-3 batteries with 26 launchers and 114 PAC-3 missiles for $2.81 billion, for a total $6.392 billion overall.

The ROC&#x27;s efforts at arms purchases have consistently been opposed by the PRC.

=== Local Weapons Development ===

The military&#x27;s light weapons are generally managed by the Armaments Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, whose 205th Arsenal is responsible for developing and producing light weapons such as T65 assault rifle, T75 Light machine gun, T86 assault rifle, T91 assault rifle, T75 pistol, various types of bullets etc.

The military has also stressed military &quot;self-reliance,&quot; which has led to the growth of indigenous military production, producing items such as the ROC&#x27;s Indigenous Defense Fighter, the Thunderbolt 2000 Multiple Launch Rocket System, Clouded Leopard Armoured Vehicle, the Sky Bow II and Sky Bow III SAMs and Hsiung Feng series of anti-ship missiles.

==Reforms and development==

===Civilian control of the military===
The modern day ROC military is styled after western military systems, mostly the US military. Internally, it has a political warfare branch/department that tightly controls and monitors each level of the ROC military, and reports directly to the General Headquarters of the ROC military, and if necessary, directly to the President of the ROC. This is a carryover from the pre-1949 era, when KMT and its army were penetrated by Communist agents repeatedly and led to frontline units defecting to Communist China. To strengthen their control over the military and prevent massive defection after retreating to Taiwan in 1949, CKS and CCK employed tight control over the military, by installing political officers and commissioners down to the company level, in order to ensure political correctness in the military and loyalty toward ROC leadership. This gave the political officers/commissars a great deal of power, allowing them to overrule the unit commander and take over the unit. Only in recent years has the political warfare department (due to cutbacks) reduced its power within the ROC military.

Two defense reform laws implemented in 2002 granted the civilian defense minister control over the entire military, and expanded legislative oversight authority for the first time in history. In the past the ROC military was closely linked with and controlled by the KMT (Nationalist Party). Following the democratization of the 1990s the military moved to a politically neutral position, though the senior officer ranks remained dominated by KMT members in 2001. In the years following the handover of control to civilian authority politicians remained wary of associating too closely with the military due to the legacy of martial law and the associated abuses conducted by the military. Support for the military increased in accordance with threats from the PRC and the Russian invasion of Ukraine however even in the 2020s many Taiwanese were still distrustful of the military.

===Doctrine and exercises===


The primary goal of the ROC Armed Forces is to provide a credible deterrent against hostile action by establishing effective counterstrike and defense capabilities. ROC military doctrine in 2004 centered upon the principle of &quot;offshore engagement&quot; where the primary goal of the armed forces in any conflict with the PRC would be to keep as much of the fighting away from Taiwan proper for as long as possible to minimize damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties. As of 2004 the military had also begun to take the threat of a sudden &quot;decapitation attack&quot; by the PRC seriously. Consequently, there was growing emphasis on the role of the Navy and Air Force (where the Army had traditionally dominated); as well as the development of rapid reaction forces and quick mobilization of local reserve forces.

As of 2021 training for electronic warfare had been emphasized with significant offensive and defensive capabilities having been fielded.

The Han Kuang Exercise is the annual military exercise of the Republic of China Armed Forces for combat readiness in the event of an attack by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

===Strategy===
Mainland China has removed the phrase &quot;peaceful&quot; in official government documents regarding plans to take back Taiwan. Though the Army had previously been the dominant service, the shift to a defensive orientation has shifted importance to the Navy and Air Force to conduct most fighting away from population centers. Given the current budgetary and numerical superiority of the Chinese military, Taiwan has moved towards an asymmetric anti-access/area denial system to imperil China&#x27;s ability to operate in the Taiwan Strait rather than try to match its strength. The RoCN, which was once the most neglected force, has become the most important to defeat an invasion fleet. Combating the enemy fleet and sinking transport ships would take out large amounts of the ground invasion force and permanently degrade amphibious capabilities. Surface ships primarily consist of guided missile destroyers and frigates, as well as four dozen small, fast missile boats to take out much larger Chinese surface and amphibious ships. The RoCAF is optimized for air superiority and was once the more formidable of the two countries, but current Chinese technology investments have made China much more able to contest airspace. Air bases are likely to come under attack from Chinese conventional ballistic missiles in range of the island. Taiwan has equipment to keep exposed bases operating while under fire with runway repair systems and mobile aircraft arresting systems. There are two underground air bases used by the RoCAF: Chiashan Air Force Base which is in a hollowed-out mountain that can protect 200 fighters and Chihhang Air Base which can protect 80 aircraft. The RoCAF operates a nationwide air defense network to engage targets anywhere over the mainland; some anti-aircraft missile batteries are also located in underground silos. The Army would only fight if Chinese forces manage to land and would engage in asymmetric warfare. In 2014 Taiwan Minister of National Defense Yen Ming believed that the country would be able to hold off a Chinese invasion for at least one month.

In the late 2010s, Taiwan&#x27;s military adopted a new strategy called the Overall Defense Concept (ODC), according to The Diplomat &quot;In short, the ODC is a holistically integrated strategy for guiding Taiwan&#x27;s military force development and joint operations, emphasizing Taiwan&#x27;s existing natural advantages, civilian infrastructure and asymmetrical warfare capabilities. It is designed to deter and, if necessary, defeat an invasion by China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA).&quot; In 2021 Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said that “I always tell my peers to stop asking, ‘how many days we need to hold out?’ The question is, ‘how many days does China want to fight?’ We’ll keep them company for as many days as they want to fight.” The adopted ODC emphasizes deep strike and layered deterrence.

==Foreign cooperation==

Taiwan has engaged in training with foreign forces, primarily American and British, for a long time but cooperation was stepped up after the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act in 2018. Exchanges between high ranking Taiwanese officers and their NATO counterparts have also been on the rise. This cooperation includes both military and academic exchanges such as those with the NATO School and the NATO Defense College.

===El Salvador===
In the 1970s the Republic of China trained Salvadoran officers involved in human rights violations during the country&#x27;s civil war.

===European Union===
In 2011 and 2012 Taiwan worked with the EU&#x27;s Naval Force in Operation Atalanta to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia. Since then exchanges and information sharing has continued, between 2011 and 2015 EU anti-piracy officials made five visits to Taiwan.

===Eswatini===
In 2020, Taiwan donated two UH-1H utility helicopters to Eswatini.

===Guatemala===
In the 1970s the Republic of China trained Guatemalan officers involved in human rights violations. In 2019 Guatemalan Minister of Defense Major General Luis Miguel Ralda Moreno visited Taiwan and met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.

===Honduras===
In 2015 Taiwan donated three UH-1H utility helicopters to Honduras.

===Japan===
There is no official cooperation between the ROC military and the Japanese Self Defense Force (JSDF). The JSDF has sent observers to the digital part of the annual Han Kuang Exercise.
New Japanese military legislation came into effect in 2016, allowing deployment to defend a regional ally under attack. This is thought to be primarily legislation for Japan to deploy to Taiwan in an event of an attack on Taiwan, which in turn threatens Japanese security in its southern islands.

===Nicaragua===
In 2019 Taiwan donated five refurbished surplus interceptor boats to the Nicaraguan Armed Forces. The transfer ceremony occurred at the naval forces’ 2nd battalion in Puerto Sandino.

===Paraguay===
In 2019 Taiwan donated two UH-1H helicopters and 30 Humvees to the Armed Forces of Paraguay. Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez shared pictures of the military aid on the presidential Twitter feed.

===Singapore===

Starting in 1975, Singapore has sent units from its military to train in the Republic of China under the Starlight training program (). Singaporean forces training in Taiwan numbered roughly 3,000 as of 2005. Singapore has also supplied the ROCAF with military equipment.

In 2007, a F-5F fighter operated by the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) crashed into base housing that was occupied by Singaporean personnel, killing the pilots. Two Singaporeans on the ground were also killed, with nine injured. The Starlight program at that time numbered around 7,000 personnel.

In 2019, a Singaporean paratrooper was seriously injured during nighttime parachute training. He underwent intensive surgery and recovery in Taiwan. In 2020 he was flown back to Singapore aboard a Singapore Air Force A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport.

===United States===

Collaboration between the ROC and US militaries began during World War II when both nations were members of the Allied forces, and continued through the Chinese Civil War when ROC forces were supplied primarily by the US until the final evacuation of ROC forces to Taiwan in 1949. Initially the U.S. expected the ROC government to fall and withdrew support until the outbreak of the Korean War when the U.S. 7th Fleet was ordered to the Taiwan Straits both to protect Taiwan from a PRC attack, and to stop ROC actions against the PRC. A formal US-ROC security pact was signed in 1954 establishing a formal alliance that lasted until US recognition of the PRC in 1979. During this period US military advisers were deployed to the ROC and joint exercises were common. The United States Taiwan Defense Command was established in the Philippines for reinforcement of Taiwan airspace. The US and ROC also collaborated on human and electronic intelligence operations directed against the PRC.

ROC units participated in the Korean War and the Vietnam War in non-combat capacities, primarily at the insistence of the United States which was concerned that the high-profile roles for ROC forces in these conflicts would lead to full scale PRC intervention. The United States deployed nuclear weapons on Taiwan as part of the United States Taiwan Defense Command. Nuclear weapons are known to have been stored at Tainan Air Force Base until their withdrawal was ordered by the American President in 1972. High-level cooperation ended with the US recognition of the PRC in 1979, when all remaining US forces in Taiwan were withdrawn. The US continued to supply the ROC with arms sales per the Taiwan Relations Act, albeit in a diminished role.

When the United States Congress enacted on September 30, 2002, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY 2003, it required that Taiwan be &quot;treated as though it were designated a major non-NATO ally.&quot; Despite some initial misgivings about Congress&#x27;s perceived intrusion into the President&#x27;s foreign affairs authority, the Bush administration subsequently submitted a letter to Congress on August 29, 2003, designating Taiwan as a major non-NATO ally.

In recent years, the ROC military has again begun higher level cooperation with the United States Armed Forces after over two decades of relative isolation. Senior officers from the U.S. Pacific Command observed the annual Han Kuang military exercises in 2005. The US also upgraded its military liaison position in Taipei from a position held by retired officers hired on a contractual basis to one held by an active duty officer the same year. The United States regularly sends personnel to Taiwan for both training and liaison purposes but does so either secretly or in an unofficial capacity. ROC Marines have trained with their American counterparts in Hawaii and US Marines have also deployed to Taiwan.

In 2015 two United States Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornets made an unscheduled landing at Tainan Air Force Base after one of them developed an engine anomaly in-flight. The aircraft were accommodated in an air force hangar until a C-130 full of American technicians could be flown in to check them out.

Tsai Ing-wen&#x27;s request of purchasing weaponry from the US was approved by the US State Department in July 2019. The deal includes 108 M1 Abrams tanks, 250 FIM-92 Stinger missiles and related equipment worth $2.2 billion. Tsai said the weaponry would &quot;greatly enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen military morale and show to the world the US commitment to Taiwan&#x27;s defense.&quot; In May 2020, the U.S. Department of State approved a Foreign Military Sale of 18 MK-48 Mod 6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes for Taiwan in a deal estimated to cost $180 million.

Elite units of the ROC and American militaries have trained together for a long time, units often have particular relationships for example the MPSSC trains and engages in exercises with United States Army Special Forces. In June 2020 the United States Army Special Forces published a promotional video which included footage of Green Berets training in Taiwan. The ROC Army Aviation and Special Forces Command and the United States Army Special Forces have an annual training exercise called Balance Tamper. The ROC Marines receive training annually from the US Marine Corps’ Marine Raider Regiment. The United States Air Force supports Taiwan&#x27;s air force through air-to-air refueling and training.

=== West Germany ===
In the 1960s West Germany participated in the Mingteh Project (Ming-teh-Gruppe in German) in which off-duty military officers were sent to Taiwan to advise the government of Chiang Kai-shek.

==Military parades==

The Republic of China held their first military parade on 10 October 2007 for National Day celebrations since 1991. Previous parades were halted in an effort to ease the tension with the PRC. The parade was aimed at easing worries that the armed forces might be unprepared for a conflict with the PRC. The parade consisted of indigenous missiles, U.S. Patriot II and Avenger anti-missiles systems, U.S.-made F-16s, French-made Mirages and Taiwan-made IDF fighters.

In 2015, another parade was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Japan in 1945 in northern Hsinchu county. The parade was long at two hours and consisted of indigenous missiles, Apache helicopters and awards for World War II veterans.

==Nuclear weapons program==

The development of nuclear weapons by the ROC has been a contentious issue. The U.S., hoping to avoid escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait, has continually opposed arming the ROC with nuclear weapons. Accordingly, the ROC, although not a member of the United Nations, adheres to the principles of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has stated that it does not intend to produce nuclear weapons. Past nuclear research by the ROC makes it a &#x27;threshold&#x27; nuclear state.

In 1967, a nuclear weapons program began under the auspices of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) at the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology. The ROC was able to acquire nuclear technology from abroad (including a research reactor from Canada and low-grade plutonium from the United States) allegedly for a civilian energy system, but in actuality to develop fuel for nuclear weapons.

After the International Atomic Energy Agency found evidence of the ROC&#x27;s efforts to produce weapons-grade plutonium, Taipei agreed in September 1976 under U.S. pressure to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. The nuclear reactor was soon shut down and the plutonium mostly returned to the U.S.

Another secret program was revealed after 1987 Lieyu massacre, when Colonel Chang Hsien-yi, deputy director of Nuclear Research at INER who was secretly working for the CIA, defected to the U.S. in December, and produced a cache of incriminating documents. In 1988 upon being questioned by Director of American Institute in Taiwan, David Dean in person with the United States satellite image recording a minimized nuclear test at Jioupeng military base field in Pingtung in 1986, Superior-general Hau Pei-tsun claimed that scientists in Taiwan had already produced the controlled nuclear reaction as the continuous progress in decades after the previous accomplishment equivalent to 1/6 of Hiroshima scale in South Africa in 1980, as per General Hau&#x27;s Diary and President Nelson Mandela&#x27;s later findings. Under pressure from the U.S., the program was halted.

During the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, ROC President Lee Teng-hui proposed reactivating the program, but was forced to back down a few days later after drawing intense criticism from the U.S. government.

With the unbalanced military equation across the Taiwan Strait, Taipei may choose nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the military encirclement by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Budget==
Taiwan&#x27;s budget figures exclude both the classified budget and special funds allocated by the Executive Yuan. As of 2020 special funds expenditures were almost 2 billion a year. In 2021 the legislature approved a US$9 billion special budget for weapons and systems procurement.
