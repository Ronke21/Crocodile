<text>Shaka kaSenzangakhona (–24 September 1828), also known as Shaka Zulu () and Sigidi kaSenzangakhona, was the king of the Zulu Kingdom from 1816 to 1828. One of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu, he ordered wide-reaching reforms that reorganized the military into a formidable force.

King Shaka was born in the lunar month of &quot;uNtulikazi&quot; (July) in the year 1787, in Mthonjaneni, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The son of the Zulu King Senzankakhona kaJama, he was spurned as an illegitimate son. Shaka spent part of his childhood in his mother&#x27;s settlements, where he was initiated into an &quot;ibutho lempi&quot; (fighting unit/regiment), serving as a warrior under Inkosi Dingiswayo.

King Shaka further refined the &quot;ibutho&quot; military system with the Mthethwa Paramountcy&#x27;s support over the next several years. He forged alliances with his smaller neighbours to counter Ndwandwe raids from the north. The initial Zulu maneuvers were primarily defensive, as King Shaka preferred to apply pressure diplomatically, with an occasional strategic assassination. His reforms of local society built on existing structures. Although he preferred social and propagandistic political methods, he also engaged in a number of battles.

King Shaka&#x27;s reign coincided with the start of the (&quot;upheaval&quot; or &quot;crushing&quot;), a period of devastating warfare and chaos in southern Africa between 1815 and 1840 that depopulated the region. His role in the &quot;Mfecane/Difaqane&quot; is highly controversial. He was ultimately assassinated by his half-brothers, King Dingane and Prince Mhlangana and Mbopha kaSithayi.

==Early life==
Shaka (roughly translated as &quot;intestinal beetle&quot;) was born to the Zulu king. He was the eldest of many sons, but was considered to be a bastard child and was sent away to live with his mother&#x27;s tribe, known as the Elangeni, leaving his half-brother to rule the Zulu kingdom. At the time, the Zulu were a regional tribe relying on pastoral livestock, maize, and milk. When Shaka reached a suitable age, he and his mother were sent to the Mthethwa clan, the most powerful regional tribe. There, he matured, and served as a warrior under Jobe, and then for Dingiswayo, a respected warrior and chief of the clan. When Inkosi Dingiswayo discovered Shaka was royalty, he put him in charge of a regiment, helping to develop Shaka&#x27;s military tactics and strategy.

After Inkosi Zwide, the king of the Ndwandwe (Nxumalo) nation, murdered Dingiswayo, Shaka sought to avenge his death. During that encounter, Zwide&#x27;s mother, Ntombazi, a sangoma, was killed by Shaka. Shaka chose a particularly gruesome revenge on her by locking her in a house with jackals or hyenas inside. They devoured her, and in the morning, Shaka burned the house to the ground. Shaka continued his pursuit of Zwide. It was not until around 1825 that the two military leaders met in the vicinity of Pongola, near the present-day border of Mpumalanga, a province in South Africa. Shaka was victorious in battle, although his forces sustained heavy casualties, including his military commander, Mgobhozi Ovela Entabeni.

Already at this time, Shaka had grown famous for his use of the short stabbing spear. It was deadly and easy to thrust, whereas before, tribesmen barely tried to customize or improve their weapons. Shaka&#x27;s innovative tactics, among them the bull horn tactic, devastated Zwide&#x27;s forces at the battle of Gqokli Hill.

In his initial years, Shaka had neither the influence nor reputation to compel any but the smallest of groups to join him, and upon Dingiswayo&#x27;s death, he moved southwards across the Thukela River, establishing his capital, Bulawayo, in Qwabe territory. He never returned to the traditional Zulu heartland. In Qwabe, Shaka may have intervened in an existing succession dispute to help his own choice, Nqetho, into power.

==Expansion of power and conflict with Zwide==


As Shaka became more respected by his people, he was able to spread his ideas along with greater ease. Using his background as a soldier, Shaka taught the Zulus that the most effective way of gaining power quickly was by conquering and controlling other tribes. His teachings greatly influenced the social outlook of the Zulus. The Zulu tribe soon developed a warrior outlook, which Shaka used to his advantage.

Shaka&#x27;s hegemony was primarily based on military might, smashing rivals and incorporating scattered remnants into his own army. He supplemented this with a mixture of diplomacy and patronage, incorporating friendly chieftains, including Zihlandlo of the Mkhize, Jobe of the Sithole, and Mathubane of the Thuli. These people were never defeated in battle by the Zulus; they did not have to be. Shaka won them over with subtler tactics, such as patronage and reward. As for the ruling of Qwabe, they began re-inventing their genealogies to give the impression that Qwabe and Zulu were closely related (i.e. as Nguni) in the past. In this way, a greater sense of cohesion was created, though it never became complete, as subsequent civil wars attest.

Shaka still recognised Dingiswayo and his larger Mthethwa clan, as overlord after he returned to the Zulu land but, some years later, Dingiswayo was ambushed by Zwide&#x27;s Ndwandwe and killed. There is no evidence to suggest that Shaka betrayed Dingiswayo. The Zulu people had to retreat before several Ndwandwe incursions; the Ndwandwe was clearly the most aggressive grouping in the sub-region.

Shaka was able to form an alliance with the leaders of the Mthethwa peoples and was able to establish himself amongst the Qwabe, after Phakathwayo was overthrown with relative ease. With Qwabe, Hlubi and Mkhize support, Shaka was finally able to summon a force capable of resisting the Ndwandwe (of the Nxumalo clan). Shaka&#x27;s first major battle against Zwide, of the Ndwandwe, was the Battle of Gqokli Hill, on the Mfolozi River. Shaka&#x27;s troops maintained a strong position on the crest of the hill. A frontal assault by their opponents failed to dislodge them, and Shaka sealed the victory by sending his reserve forces in a sweep around the hill to attack the enemy&#x27;s rear. Losses were high overall but the efficiency of the new Shakan innovations was proven. It is probable that, over time, the Zulus were able to hone and improve their encirclement tactics.

Another decisive battle eventually took place on the Mhlatuze River, at the confluence with the Mvuzane stream. In the two-day running battle, the Zulus inflicted a resounding defeat on their opponents. Shaka then led a fresh reserve some to the royal kraal of Zwide, ruler of the Ndwandwe, and destroyed it. Zwide himself escaped with a handful of followers before falling afoul of a chieftain named Mjanji, ruler of a Babelu clan. (He died in mysterious circumstances soon afterwards.) Zwide&#x27;s general, Soshangane (of the Shangaan), moved north towards what is now Mozambique to inflict further damage on less resistant foes and take advantage of slaving opportunities, obliging Portuguese traders to pay tribute. Shaka later had to contend again with Zwide&#x27;s son, Sikhunyane, in 1826.

Shaka granted permission to Europeans to enter Zulu territory on rare occasions. In the mid-1820s, Henry Francis Fynn provided medical treatment to the king after an assassination attempt by a rival tribe member hidden in a crowd. To show his gratitude, Shaka permitted European settlers to enter and operate in the Zulu kingdom. Shaka observed several demonstrations of European technology and knowledge, but he held that the Zulu way was superior to that of the foreigners.

== Death ==

Dingane and Mhlangana, Shaka&#x27;s half-brothers, appeared to have made at least two attempts to assassinate Shaka before they succeeded, with support from the Mpondo elements and some disaffected iziYendane people. Shaka had made enough enemies among his own people to hasten his demise. It came relatively quickly after the death of his mother, Nandi, in October 1827 and the devastation caused by Shaka&#x27;s subsequent erratic behavior. According to Donald Morris, Shaka ordered that no crops should be planted during the following year of mourning, no milk (the basis of the Zulu diet at the time) was to be used, and any woman who became pregnant was to be killed along with her husband. At least 7,000 people who were deemed to be insufficiently grief-stricken were executed, although the killing was not restricted to humans; cows were slaughtered so that their calves would know what losing a mother felt like.

Shaka was killed by three assassins sometime in 1828; September is the most frequently cited date, when almost all available Zulu manpower had been sent on yet another mass sweep to the north. This left the royal kraal critically lacking in protection. It was all the conspirators needed. An iNduna named Mbopa created a diversion, and Dingane and Mhlangana struck the fatal blows. Shaka&#x27;s corpse was dumped by his assassins in an empty grain pit, which was then filled with stones and mud. The exact location is unknown. A monument was built at one alleged site. Historian Donald Morris holds that the true site is somewhere on Couper Street in the village of Stanger, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

Dingane assumed power and embarked on an extensive purge of pro-Shaka elements and chieftains, over the course of several years, in order to secure his position. The initial problem Dingane faced was maintaining the loyalty of the Zulu fighting regiments. He set up his main residence at Mgungundlovu and established his authority over the Zulu kingdom. Dingane ruled for some twelve years, during which time he fought, disastrously, against the Voortrekkers, and against another half-brother, Mpande, who, with Boer and British support, took over the Zulu leadership in 1840, ruling for some 30 years.

==Social and military revolution==
Some older histories have doubted the military and social innovations customarily attributed to Shaka, denying them outright, or attributing them variously to European influences. More modern researchers argue that such explanations fall short, and that the general Zulu culture, which included other tribes and clans, contained a number of practices that Shaka could have drawn on to fulfill his objectives, whether in raiding, conquest or hegemony. Some of these practices are shown below.

===Weapons changes===
Shaka is often said to have been dissatisfied with the long throwing assegai, and is credited with having introduced a new variant of the weapon: the &quot;iklwa&quot;, a short stabbing spear with a long, broad, sword-like spearhead.

Although he is credited with introducing the &quot;ilkwa&quot; to his people, Shaka likely did not invent it himself. He most likely outsourced it from Nzama, who later had a feud with him because he did not want to pay for the spears. According to Zulu scholar John Laband, Shaka insisted that his warriors train with the weapon, which gave them a &quot;terrifying advantage over opponents who clung to the traditional practice of throwing their spears and avoiding hand-to-hand conflict.&quot; The throwing spear was not discarded, but used as an initial missile weapon before close contact with the enemy, when the shorter stabbing spear was used in hand-to-hand combat.

It is also supposed that Shaka introduced a larger, heavier version of the Nguni shield. Furthermore, it is believed that he taught his warriors how to use the shield&#x27;s left side to hook the enemy&#x27;s shield to the right, exposing the enemy&#x27;s ribs for a fatal spear stab. In Shaka&#x27;s time, these cowhide shields were supplied by the king, and they remained the king&#x27;s property. Different coloured shields distinguished different &quot;amabutho&quot; within Shaka&#x27;s army. Some had black shields, others used white shields with black spots, and some had white shields with brown spots, while others used pure brown or white shields.

===Mobility of the army===
The story that sandals were discarded to toughen the feet of Zulu warriors has been noted in various military accounts such as &quot;The Washing of the Spears&quot;, &quot;Like Lions They Fought&quot;, and &quot;Anatomy of the Zulu Army&quot;. Implementation was typically blunt. Those who objected to going without sandals were simply killed. Shaka drilled his troops frequently, in forced marches that sometimes covered more than a day in a fast trot over hot, rocky terrain. He also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics.

Historian John Laband dismisses these stories as myth, writing: &quot;What are we to make, then, of [European trader Henry Francis] Fynn&#x27;s statement that once the Zulu army reached hard and stony ground in 1826, Shaka ordered sandals of ox-hide to be made for himself?&quot;

Laband also dismissed the idea of an march in a single day as ridiculous. He further claims that even though these stories have been repeated by &quot;astonished and admiring white commentators,&quot; the Zulu army covered &quot;no more than a day, and usually went only about .&quot; Furthermore, Zulus under Shaka sometimes advanced more slowly. They spent two whole days recuperating in one instance, and on another they rested for a day and two nights before pursuing their enemy. Several other historians of the Zulu and the Zulu military system, however, affirm the mobility rate of up to per day.

===Logistic support by youths===
Boys aged six and over joined Shaka&#x27;s force as apprentice warriors (&quot;udibi&quot;) and served as carriers of rations, supplies such as cooking pots and sleeping mats, and extra weapons until they joined the main ranks. It is sometimes held that such support was used more for very light forces designed to extract tribute in cattle and slaves from neighboring groups. Nevertheless, the concept of &quot;light&quot; forces is questionable. The fast-moving Zulu raiding party, or &quot;ibutho lempi,&quot; on a mission invariably traveled light, driving cattle as provisions on the hoof, and were not weighed down with heavy weapons and supply packs.

===Age-grade regimental system===
Age-grade groupings of various sorts were common in the Bantu culture of the day, and indeed are still important in much of Africa. Age grades were responsible for a variety of activities, from guarding the camp, to cattle herding, to certain rituals and ceremonies. Shaka organised various grades into regiments, and quartered them in special military kraals, with regiments having their own distinctive names and insignia. The regimental system clearly built on existing tribal cultural elements that could be adapted and shaped to fit an expansionist agenda.

===&quot;Bull horn&quot; formation===
Most historians credit Shaka with initial development of the famous &quot;bull horn&quot; formation. It was composed of three elements:

# The main force, the &quot;chest,&quot; closed with the enemy impi and pinned it in position, engaging in melee combat. The warriors who formed the &quot;chest&quot; were senior veterans.
# While the enemy impi was pinned by the &quot;chest,&quot; the &quot;horns&quot; would flank the Impi from both sides and encircle it; in conjunction with the &quot;chest&quot; they would then destroy the trapped force. The warriors who formed the &quot;horns&quot; were young and fast juniors.
# The &quot;loins,&quot; a large reserve, was hidden, seated, behind the &quot;chest&quot; with their backs to the battle, for the sake of them not losing any confidence. The &quot;loins&quot; would be committed wherever the enemy impi threatened to break out of the encirclement.

===Discipline===
Shaka created ruthless determination in his army by instilling in his warriors the knowledge of what would happen if their courage failed them in battle or their regiments were defeated. A brutal fate awaited them and their families if they did not perform well in combat. H. Rider Haggard learned about Shaka&#x27;s methods from his nephew and late 19th-century Zulu king, Cetshwayo kaMpande:

===Shaka&#x27;s methods versus European technology===
The expanding Zulu power inevitably clashed with European hegemony in the decades after Shaka&#x27;s death. In fact, European travellers to Shaka&#x27;s kingdom demonstrated advanced technology such as firearms and writing, but the Zulu monarch was less than convinced. There was no need to record messages, he held, since his messengers stood under penalty of death should they bear inaccurate tidings. As for firearms, Shaka acknowledged their utility as missile weapons after seeing muzzle-loaders demonstrated, but he argued that in the time a gunman took to reload, he would be swamped by charging spear-wielding warriors.

The first major clash after Shaka&#x27;s death took place under his successor Dingane, against expanding European Voortrekkers from the Cape. Initial Zulu success rested on fast-moving surprise attacks and ambushes, but the Voortrekkers recovered and dealt the Zulu a severe defeat from their fortified wagon laager at the Battle of Blood River. The second major clash was against the British during 1879. Once again, most Zulu successes rested on their mobility, ability to screen their forces and to close when their opponents were unfavourably deployed. Their major victory at the Battle of Isandlwana was the most prominent one, but they also forced back a British column at the Battle of Hlobane, by deploying fast-moving regiments over a wide area of rugged ravines and gullies, and attacking the British who were forced into a rapid disorderly fighting retreat, back to the town of Kambula.

=== Creator of a revolutionary warfare style ===
A number of historians argue that Shaka &quot;changed the nature of warfare in Southern Africa&quot; from &quot;a ritualised exchange of taunts with minimal loss of life into a true method of subjugation by wholesale slaughter.&quot; Others dispute this characterization. A number of writers focus on Shaka&#x27;s military innovations such as the &quot;iklwa&quot; – the Zulu thrusting spear, and the &quot;buffalo horns&quot; formation. This combination has been compared to the standardization supposedly implemented by the reorganized Roman legions under Marius.

Much controversy still surrounds the character, methods and activities of the Zulu king. From a military standpoint, historian John Keegan notes exaggerations and myths that surround Shaka, but nevertheless maintains:

===As a borrower, not an innovator===
Some scholars hold that popular depictions of Shaka as a suddenly appearing genius creating innovation are overstated, and that to the contrary, Shaka was a borrower and imitator of indigenous methods, customs and even ruler-lineages already in place. They also argue that Shaka&#x27;s line was relatively short-lived and receives undue attention, compared to other, longer established lines and rulers in the region.

Shaka&#x27;s triumphs did not succeed in obliterating or diminishing the memories of his better-born rivals. The hypothesis that several states of a new kind arose about the same time does not take account of the contrast between the short line of Shaka and the long pedigrees of his most important opponents – especially the coalition grouped around his deadly enemy Zwide (d. 1822). The founders of the states which Omer-Cooper called &quot;Zulu-type states,&quot; including the Ndebele, the Gasa, the Ngoni, and the Swazi had all been closely associated with Zwide. Instead of hypothesizing that they all chose to imitate Shaka, it is easier to imagine that he modeled his state on theirs. And as they stemmed from ancient families it is entirely possible that states of that type existed in a more remote past. Soga and Bryant related each of them to a larger grouping they called Mho.

==Scholarship==

===Biographical sources===
Scholarship in recent years has revised views of the sources on Shaka&#x27;s reign. The earliest are two eyewitness accounts written by European adventurer-traders who met Shaka during the last four years of his reign. Nathaniel Isaacs published his &quot;Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa&quot; in 1836, creating a picture of Shaka as a degenerate and pathological monster, which survives in modified forms to this day. Isaacs was aided in this by Henry Francis Fynn, whose diary (actually a rewritten collage of various papers) was edited by James Stuart only in 1950. Their accounts may be balanced by the rich resource of oral histories collected around 1900 by the same James Stuart, now published in six volumes as &quot;The James Stuart Archive&quot;. Stuart&#x27;s early 20th century work was continued by D. McK. Malcolm in 1950. These and other sources such as A.T. Bryant gives us a more Zulu-centered picture. Most popular accounts are based on E.A. Ritter&#x27;s novel &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; (1955), a pot boiling romance that was re-edited into something more closely resembling a history. John Wright (history professor at University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg), Julian Cobbing and Dan Wylie (Rhodes University, Grahamstown) are among a number of writers who have modified these stories.

Various modern historians writing on Shaka and the Zulu point to the uncertain nature of Fynn and Isaac&#x27;s accounts of Shaka&#x27;s reign. A general reference work in the field is Donald Morris&#x27;s &quot;The Washing of The Spears&quot;, which notes that the sources, as a whole, for this historical era are not the best. Morris references a large number of sources, including Stuart, and A. T. Bryant&#x27;s &quot;Olden Times in Zululand and Natal&quot;, which is based on four decades of interviews of tribal sources. After sifting through these sources and noting their strengths and weaknesses, Morris generally credits Shaka with a large number of military and social innovations. This is the general consensus in the field.

A 1998 study by historian Carolyn Hamilton summarizes much of the scholarship on Shaka towards the dawn of the 21st century in areas ranging from ideology, politics and culture, to the use of his name and image in a popular South African theme park, &quot;Shakaland.&quot; It argues that in many ways, the image of Shaka has been &quot;invented&quot; in the modern era according to whatever agenda persons hold. This &quot;imagining of Shaka&quot; it is held, should be balanced by a sober view of the historical record, and allow greater scope for the contributions of indigenous African discourse.

Military historians of the Zulu War describe Zulu fighting methods and tactics, including authors Ian Knight and Robert Edgerton. General histories of Southern Africa include Noel Mostert&#x27;s &quot;Frontiers&quot; and a detailed account of the results from the Zulu expansion, J.D. Omer-Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Zulu Aftermath&quot;, which advances the traditional Mfecane/Difaqane theory.

===The Mfecane===
====History and legacy====
The increased military efficiency led to more and more clans being incorporated into Shaka&#x27;s Zulu empire, while other tribes moved away to be out of range of Shaka&#x27;s &quot;impis&quot;. The ripple effect caused by these mass migrations would become known (though only in the twentieth century) as the &quot;Mfecane/Difaqane&quot; (annihilation).

Shaka&#x27;s army set out on a massive programme of expansion &amp; killing those who resisted in the territories he conquered. His &quot;impis&quot; (armies) were rigorously disciplined: failure in battle meant death.

At the time of his death, Shaka ruled over 250,000 people and could muster more than 50,000 warriors. His 12-year-long kingship resulted in a massive number of deaths, mostly due to the disruptions the Zulu caused in neighbouring tribes, although the exact death toll is a matter of scholarly dispute. Further unquantifiable deaths occurred during mass tribal migrations to escape his armies.

The Mfecane produced Mzilikazi of the Khumalo, a general of Shaka&#x27;s. He fled Shaka&#x27;s employ, and in turn conquered an empire in Zimbabwe, after clashing with European groups like the Boers. The settling of Mzilikazi&#x27;s people, the Ama Ndebele or Matabele, in the south of Zimbabwe with the concomitant driving of the Mashona into the north caused a tribal conflict that still resonates today. Other notable figures to arise from the Mfecane/Difaqane include Soshangane, who expanded from the Zulu area into what is now Mozambique, and Zwangendaba.

====Disruptions of the Mfecane/Difaqane====
The theory of the Mfecane holds that the aggressive expansion of Shaka&#x27;s armies caused a brutal chain reaction across the southern areas of the continent, as dispossessed tribe after tribe turned on their neighbours in a deadly cycle of fight and conquest. Some scholars contend that this theory must be treated with caution as it generally neglects several other factors such as the impact of European encroachment, slave trading and expansion in that area of Southern Africa around the same time. Normal estimates for the death toll range from 1 million to 2 million. These numbers are, however, controversial.

According to Julian Cobbing, the development of the view that Shaka was the monster responsible for the devastation is based on the need of apartheid era historians to justify the apartheid regime&#x27;s racist policies. Other scholars acknowledge distortion of the historical record by apartheid supporters and shady European traders seeking to cover their tracks, but dispute the revisionist approach, noting that stories of cannibalism, raiding, burning of villages, or mass slaughter were not developed out of thin air but based on the clearly documented accounts of hundreds of black victims and refugees. Confirmation of such accounts can also be seen in modern archaeology of the village of Lepalong, an entire settlement built underground to shelter remnants of the Kwena people from 1827 to 1836 against the tide of disruption that engulfed the region during Shakan times.

William Rubinstein wrote that &quot;Western guilt over colonialism, have also accounted for much of this distortion of what pre-literate societies actually were like, as does the wish to avoid anything which smacks of racism, even when this means distorting the actual and often appalling facts of life in many pre-literate societies&quot;. Rubinstein also notes:

South African historian Dan Wylie has expressed skepticism of the portrayal of Shaka as a pathological monster destroying everything within reach. He argues that attempts to distort his life and image have been systematic— beginning with the first European visitors to his kingdom. One visitor, Nathaniel Isaacs, wrote to Henry Fynn, a white adventurer, trader and quasi-local chieftain:
:Here you are about to publish. Do make Shaka out to be as bloodthirsty as you can; it helps swell out the work and make it interesting.

Fynn, according to Wylie, complied with the request, and Wylie notes that he had an additional motive to distort Shaka&#x27;s image— he applied for a huge grant of land— an area allegedly depopulated by Shaka&#x27;s savagery.
:[Fynn] stated that Shaka had killed &#x27;a million people.&#x27; You will still find this figure, and higher, repeated in today&#x27;s literature. However, Fynn had no way of knowing any such thing: it was a thumb-suck based in a particular view of Shaka—Shaka as a kind of genocidal maniac, an unresting killing-machine. But why the inventive lie? ... Fynn was bidding for a stretch of land, which allegedly had been depopulated by Shaka.. [he insinuated], Shaka didn&#x27;t deserve that land anyway because he was such a brute, while he—Fynn— was a lonely, morally upright pioneer of civilization.

Michal Lesniewski has criticised Wylie for some of his attempts to revise Western thinking about Shaka.

==Physical descriptions==
Though much remains unknown about Shaka&#x27;s personal appearance, sources tend to agree he had a strong, muscular body. He was tall and his skin tone was dark brown.

Shaka&#x27;s enemies described him as ugly in some respects. He had a big nose, according to Baleka of the Qwabe, as told by her father. He also had two prominent front teeth. Her father also told Baleka that Shaka spoke as though &quot;his tongue were too big for his mouth.&quot; Many said that he spoke with a speech impediment.

There is an anecdote that Shaka joked with one of his friends, Magaye, that he could not kill Magaye because he would be laughed at. Supposedly if he killed Magaye, it would appear to be out of jealousy because Magaye was so handsome and &quot;Shaka himself was ugly, with a protruding forehead&quot;.

== In Zulu culture ==
The figure of Shaka still sparks interest among not only the contemporary Zulu but many worldwide who have encountered the tribe and its history. The current tendency appears to be to lionise him; popular film and other media have certainly contributed to his appeal. Certain traditional Zulu cultural forms are still used to express reverence for the dead monarch. The praise song is one of the most widely used poetic forms in Africa, applying not only to spirits but to men, animals, plants and even towns.

Other Zulu sources are sometimes critical of Shaka, and numerous negative images abound in Zulu oral history. When Shaka&#x27;s mother Nandi died for example, the monarch ordered a massive outpouring of grief including mass executions, forbidding the planting of crops or the use of milk, and the killing of all pregnant women and their husbands. Oral sources record that in this period of devastation, a single Zulu, a man named &quot;Gala&quot;, eventually stood up to Shaka and objected to these measures, pointing out that Nandi was not the first person to die in Zululand. Taken aback by such candid talk, the Zulu king is supposed to have called off the destructive edicts, rewarding the blunt teller-of-truths with a gift of cattle.

The figure of Shaka thus remains an ambiguous one in African oral tradition, defying simplistic depictions of the Zulu king as a heroic, protean nation builder on one hand, or a depraved monster on the other. This ambiguity continues to lend the image of Shaka its continued power and influence, almost two centuries after his death.

<text>Sinusitis, also known as rhinosinusitis, is an inflammation of the mucous membranes that line the sinuses resulting in symptoms that may include production of thick nasal mucus, nasal congestion, facial congestion, facial pain, facial pressure, loss of smell, or fever.
Sinusitis is a condition that affects both children and adults. It is caused by a combination of environmental and a person&#x27;s individual health factors. It can occur in individuals with allergies, exposure to environmental irritants, structural abnormalities of the nasal cavity and sinuses and poor immune function. Most cases are caused by a viral infection. Recurrent episodes are more likely in persons with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and immunodeficiency.

The diagnosis of sinusitis is based on the symptoms and their duration along with signs of disease identified by endoscopic and/or radiologic criteria. Sinusitis is classified into acute sinusitis and chronic sinusitis. In acute sinusitis, symptoms last for less than 4 weeks. In chronic sinusitis symptoms must be present for at least 12 weeks. In the initial evaluation of sinusitis an otolaryngologist, also known as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor, may confirm sinusitis using nasal endoscopy. Diagnostic imaging is not usually needed in acute stage unless complications are suspected. In chronic cases, confirmatory testing is recommended by use of computed tomography.
Prevention of sinusitis focuses on regular hand washing, staying up-to date on vaccinations, and avoiding smoking. Pain killers such as naproxen, nasal steroids, and nasal irrigation may be used to help with symptoms. Recommended initial treatment for acute sinusitis is watchful waiting. If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or worsen, then an antibiotic may be implemented or changed. In those in whom antibiotics are indicated, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line, with amoxicillin/clavulanate being superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects. Surgery may be recommended in those with chronic disease who have failed medical management.
Sinusitis is a common condition. It affects between about 10 and 30 percent of people each year in the United States and Europe. The management of sinusitis in the United States results in more than 11 billion in costs.
==Signs and symptoms==
Acute sinusitis can present as facial pain and tenderness that may worsen on standing up or bending over, headache, cough, bad breath, nasal congestion, ear pain, ear pressure or nasal discharge that is usually green in color, and may contain pus or blood. Dental pain can also occur. A way to distinguish between toothache and sinusitis is that sinusitis-related pain is usually worsened by tilting the head forward or performing the Valsalva maneuver.

Chronic sinusitis presents with more subtle symptoms of nasal obstruction, with less fever and pain complaints. Symptoms include facial pain, headache, night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or yellow nasal discharge, feeling of facial fullness or tightness that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and bad breath. Often, chronic sinusitis can lead to anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell.

A 2005 review suggested that most &quot;sinus headaches&quot; are migraines. The confusion occurs in part because migraine involves activation of the trigeminal nerves, which innervate both the sinus region and the meninges surrounding the brain. As a result, accurately determining the site from which the pain originates is difficult. People with migraines do not typically have the thick nasal discharge that is a common symptom of a sinus infection.

===By location===
The four paired paranasal sinuses are the frontal, ethmoidal, maxillary, and sphenoidal sinuses. The ethmoidal sinuses are further subdivided into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses, the division of which is defined as the basal lamella of the middle nasal concha. In addition to the severity of disease, discussed below, sinusitis can be classified by the sinus cavity it affects:

* Maxillary – may cause pain or pressure in the maxillary (cheek) region, often experienced as toothache or headache.
* Frontal – may cause pain or pressure in the frontal sinus cavity (above the eyes), often experienced as headache, particularly in the forehead area.
* Ethmoidal – may cause pain or pressure pain between or behind the eyes, along the sides of the upper nose (medial canthi), and headaches.
* Sphenoidal – may cause pain or pressure behind the eyes, though it is often felt at top of the head, over the mastoid processes, or the back of the head.

=== Complications ===

Complications are thought to be rare (1 case per 10,000). Infectious complications of acute bacterial sinusitis include eye, brain and bone complications.

==== Orbital complications ====
The Chandler Classification is used to group orbital complications into five stages according to their severity. Stage I, known as preseptal cellulitis, occurs when an infection develops in front to the orbital septum. It is thought to result from restricted venous drainage from the sinuses and affects the soft tissue of the eyelids and other superficial structures. Stage II, known as orbital cellulitis, occurs when infection develops behind the orbital septum and affects the orbits. This can result in impaired eye movement, protrusion of the eye, and eye swelling. Stage III, known as subperiosteal abscess, occurs when pus collects between walls of the orbit and the surrounding periosteal structures. This can result in impaired eye movement and acuity. Stage IV, known as orbital abscess, occurs when an abscess forms within the orbital tissue. This can result in severe vision impairment. Stage V, known as cavernous sinus thrombosis, is considered an intracranial complication. It can occur as bacterial spread progresses, triggering blood clots that become trapped within the cavernous sinus. This can result in previously described symptoms within the opposite eye and in severe cases, meningitis.

==== Intracranial complications ====
The close proximity of the sinuses to the brain makes brain infections one of the most dangerous complication of acute bacterial sinusitis, especially when the frontal and sphenoid sinuses are involved. These infections can result from invasion of anaerobic bacteria through the bones or blood vessels. Abscesses, meningitis, and other life-threatening conditions may occur. In rare cases, mild personality changes, headache, altered consciousness, visual problems, seizures, coma, and even death may occur.

==== Osseous complications ====
A rare complication of acute sinusitis is a bone infection, known as osteomyelitis, which affects the frontal and other facial bones. Specifically, the combination of frontal sinusitis, osteomyelitis and subperiosteal abscess formation is referred to as Pott&#x27;s puffy tumor.

Other complications

When an infection originating from a tooth or dental procedure affects the maxillary sinus it can lead to odontogenic sinusitis (ODS). Odontogenic sinusitis can often spread to nearby sinuses including the ethmoid, frontal, sphenoid sinuses, and the contralateral nasal cavity. In rare instances, these infections may spread to the orbit, leading to orbital cellulitis.

==Causes==

===Acute===
Acute sinusitis is usually precipitated by an earlier upper respiratory tract infection, generally of viral origin, mostly caused by rhinoviruses (with RVA and RVC giving more severe infection than RVB), coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, and metapneumovirus. If the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three causative agents are &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%)&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae (36%)&quot;, and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis (16%)&quot;. Until recently, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; was the most common bacterial agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the &quot;H. influenzae&quot; type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased these infections and now non-typable &quot;H. influenzae&quot; (NTHI) is predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing bacterial pathogens include &quot;S. aureus&quot; and other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less commonly, Gram-negative bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically lasts for 7 to 10 days.

Acute episodes of sinusitis can also result from fungal invasion. These infections are typically seen in people with diabetes or other immune deficiencies (such as AIDS or transplant on immunosuppressive antirejection medications) and can be life-threatening. In type I diabetics, ketoacidosis can be associated with sinusitis due to mucormycosis.

===Chronic===
====Definition and nomenclature====
By definition, chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks and can be caused by many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. It is subdivided into cases with and without polyps. When polyps are present, the condition is called chronic hyperplastic sinusitis; however, the causes are poorly understood. It may develop with anatomic derangements, including deviation of the nasal septum and the presence of concha bullosa (pneumatization of the middle concha) that inhibit the outflow of mucus, or with allergic rhinitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and dental infections.

Chronic rhinosinusitis represents a multifactorial inflammatory disorder, rather than simply a persistent bacterial infection. The medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis is now focused upon controlling the inflammation that predisposes people to obstruction, reducing the incidence of infections. Surgery may be needed if medications are not working.

Attempts have been made to provide a more consistent nomenclature for subtypes of chronic sinusitis. The presence of eosinophils in the mucous lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses has been demonstrated for many people, and this has been termed eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS). Cases of EMRS may be related to an allergic response, but allergy is not often documented, resulting in further subcategorization into allergic and nonallergic EMRS.

====Fungi====
A more recent, and still debated, development in chronic sinusitis is the role that fungi play in this disease. Whether fungi are a definite factor in the development of chronic sinusitis remains unclear, and if they are, what is the difference between those who develop the disease and those who remain free of symptoms. Trials of antifungal treatments have had mixed results.

====One airway theory====
Recent theories of sinusitis indicate that it often occurs as part of a spectrum of diseases that affect the respiratory tract (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the &quot;one airway&quot; theory) and is often linked to asthma.

====Smoking====
Both smoking and secondhand smoke are associated with chronic rhinosinusitis.

====Air pollution====
Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which consists of particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, has been associated with an increased risk of developing rhinosinusitis. PM2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the nasal and sinus mucosa, leading to inflammation and impaired mucociliary clearance. Individuals living in areas with higher concentrations of PM2.5 experience increased symptoms and exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis. The fine particles cause oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to the pathogenesis of rhinosinusitis.

While both PM10 (particles less than 10 micrometers) and PM2.5 can affect the respiratory system, PM2.5 particles are more closely associated with rhinosinusitis due to their ability to reach deeper into the sinus cavities. These smaller particles bypass the nasal hair filtering mechanism and deposit in the mucous membranes of the sinuses, leading to greater inflammatory responses.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 μg/m3, and 24-hour mean exposures should not exceed 15 μg/m3 to minimize health risks. Exposure to concentrations above these thresholds has been linked to an increased incidence and severity of rhinosinusitis and other respiratory diseases.

====Other diseases====
Other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis can also cause chronic sinusitis.

===Maxillary sinus===
Maxillary sinusitis may also develop from problems with the teeth, and these cases were calculated to be about 40% in one study and 50% in another. The cause of this situation is usually a periapical or periodontal infection of a maxillary posterior tooth, where the inflammatory exudate has eroded through the bone superiorly to drain into the maxillary sinus.

An estimated 0.5 to 2.0% of viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) will develop into bacterial infections in adults and 5 to 10% in children.

==Pathophysiology==
Chronic rhinosinusitis is multifactorial process hypothesized to be caused by inflammatory processes driven by dysfunction between local host and environmental interactions. It is divided into two phenotypes that depend on the presence or absence of nasal polyps. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps are thought to have two different inflammatory pathways, with the latter form driven by a Th1 response and the former driven by a Th2 response. Both pathways result in an increase in inflammatory molecules (cytokines). The Th1 response is characterized by secretion of interferon gamma. The Th2 response is characterized by secretion of interleukin-4 receptor, interleukin 5, and interleukin 13. Both forms of chronic rhinosinusitis are considered to be highly heterogenous, each with the ability to demonstrate three inflammatory endotypes, the third being a Th17 response.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
Sinusitis (or rhinosinusitis) is defined as an inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the paranasal sinuses and is classified chronologically into several categories:
* Acute sinusitis – A new infection that may last up to four weeks and can be subdivided symptomatically into severe and nonsevere. Some use definitions up to 12 weeks.
* Recurrent acute sinusitis – Four or more full episodes of acute sinusitis that occur within one year
* Subacute sinusitis – An infection that lasts between four and 12 weeks, and represents a transition between acute and chronic infection.
* Chronic sinusitis – When the signs and symptoms last for more than 12 weeks.
* Acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis – When the signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis exacerbate, but return to baseline after treatment.

Roughly 90% of adults have had sinusitis at some point in their lives.

===Acute===
Health care providers distinguish bacterial and viral sinusitis by watchful waiting. If a person has had sinusitis for fewer than 10 days without the symptoms becoming worse, then the infection is presumed to be viral. When symptoms last more than 10 days or get worse in that time, then the infection is considered bacterial sinusitis. Pain in the teeth and bad breath are also more indicative of bacterial disease.

Imaging by either X-ray, CT or MRI is generally not recommended unless complications develop. Pain caused by sinusitis is sometimes confused for pain caused by pulpitis (toothache) of the maxillary teeth, and vice versa. Classically, the increased pain when tilting the head forwards separates sinusitis from pulpitis.

For cases of maxillary sinusitis, limited field CBCT imaging, as compared to periapical radiographs, improves the ability to detect the teeth as the sources for sinusitis. A coronal CT picture may also be useful.

===Chronic===
For sinusitis lasting more than 12 weeks, a CT scan is recommended. On a CT scan, acute sinus secretions have a radiodensity of 10 to 25 Hounsfield units (HU), but in a more chronic state they become more viscous, with a radiodensity of 30 to 60 HU.

Nasal endoscopy and clinical symptoms are also used to make a positive diagnosis. A tissue sample for histology and cultures can also be collected and tested. Nasal endoscopy involves inserting a flexible fiber-optic tube with a light and camera at its tip into the nose to examine the nasal passages and sinuses.

Sinus infections, if they result in tooth pain, usually present with pain involving more than one of the upper teeth, whereas a toothache usually involves a single tooth. Dental examination and appropriate radiography aid in ruling out pain arises from a tooth.

==Treatment==
Recommended treatments for most cases of sinusitis include rest and drinking enough water to thin the mucus. Antibiotics are not recommended for most cases.

Breathing high-temperature steam such as from a hot shower or gargling can relieve symptoms. There is tentative evidence for nasal irrigation in acute sinusitis, for example during upper respiratory infections. Decongestant nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline may provide relief, but these medications should not be used for more than the recommended period. Longer use may cause rebound sinusitis. It is unclear if nasal irrigation, antihistamines, or decongestants work in children with acute sinusitis. There is no clear evidence that plant extracts such as &quot;Cyclamen europaeum&quot; are effective as an intranasal wash to treat acute sinusitis. Evidence is inconclusive on whether anti-fungal treatments improve symptoms or quality of life.

===Antibiotics===
Most sinusitis cases are caused by viruses and resolve without antibiotics. However, if symptoms do not resolve within 10 days, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate are reasonable antibiotics for first treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate being slightly superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects. A 2018 Cochrane review, however, found no evidence that people with symptoms lasting seven days or more before consulting their physician are more likely to have bacterial sinusitis as one study found that about 80% of patients have symptoms lasting more than 7 days and another about 70%. Antibiotics are specifically not recommended in those with mild / moderate disease during the first week of infection due to risk of adverse effects, antibiotic resistance, and cost.

Fluoroquinolones, and a newer macrolide antibiotic such as clarithromycin or a tetracycline like doxycycline, are used in those who have severe allergies to penicillins. Because of increasing resistance to amoxicillin the 2012 guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends amoxicillin-clavulanate as the initial treatment of choice for bacterial sinusitis. The guidelines also recommend against other commonly used antibiotics, including azithromycin, clarithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, because of growing antibiotic resistance. The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.

A short-course (3–7 days) of antibiotics seems to be just as effective as the typical longer-course (10–14 days) of antibiotics for those with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis without any other severe disease or complicating factors. The IDSA guideline suggest five to seven days of antibiotics is long enough to treat a bacterial infection without encouraging resistance. The guidelines still recommend children receive antibiotic treatment for ten days to two weeks.

===Corticosteroids===
For unconfirmed acute sinusitis, nasal sprays using corticosteroids have not been found to be better than a placebo either alone or in combination with antibiotics. For cases confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy, treatment with intranasal corticosteroids alone or in combination with antibiotics is supported. The benefit, however, is small.

For confirmed chronic rhinosinusitis, there is limited evidence that intranasal steroids improve symptoms and insufficient evidence that one type of steroid is more effective.

There is only limited evidence to support short treatment with corticosteroids by mouth for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. There is limited evidence to support corticosteroids by mouth in combination with antibiotics for acute sinusitis; it has only short-term effect improving the symptoms.

===Surgery===
For sinusitis of dental origin, treatment focuses on removing the infection and preventing reinfection, by removal of the microorganisms, their byproducts, and pulpal debris from the infected root canal. Systemic antibiotics are ineffective as a definitive solution, but may afford temporary relief of symptoms by improving sinus clearing, and may be appropriate for rapidly spreading infections, but debridement and disinfection of the root canal system at the same time is necessary. Treatment options include non-surgical root canal treatment, periradicular surgery, tooth replantation, or extraction of the infected tooth.

For chronic or recurring sinusitis, referral to an otolaryngologist may be indicated, and treatment options may include nasal surgery. Surgery should only be considered for those people who do not benefit with medication or have non-invasive fungal sinusitis. It is unclear how benefits of surgery compare to medical treatments in those with nasal polyps as this has been poorly studied.

A number of surgical approaches can be used to access the sinuses and these have generally shifted from external/extranasal approaches to intranasal endoscopic ones. The benefit of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is its ability to allow for a more targeted approach to the affected sinuses, reducing tissue disruption, and minimizing post-operative complications. However, if a traditional FESS with Messerklinger technique is followed the success rate will be as low as 30%, 70% of the patients tend to have recurrence within 3 years. On the other hand with use of TFSE technique along with navigation system, debriders and balloon sinuplasty or EBS can give a success rate of over 99.9%. The use of drug eluting stents such as propel mometasone furoate implant may help in recovery after surgery.

Another recently developed treatment is balloon sinuplasty. This method, similar to balloon angioplasty used to &quot;unclog&quot; arteries of the heart, utilizes balloons in an attempt to expand the openings of the sinuses in a less invasive manner. The effectiveness of the functional endoscopic balloon dilation approach compared to conventional FESS is not known.

Histopathology of sinonasal contents removed from surgery can be diagnostically valuable:
===Treatments directed to rhinovirus infection===
A study has shown that patients given spray formulation of 0.73 mg of Tremacamra (a soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1] receptor) reduced the severity of illness.

==Prognosis==
A 2018 review has found that without the use of antibiotics, about 46% were cured after one week and 64% after two weeks.

==Epidemiology==
Sinusitis is a common condition, with between 24 and 31 million cases occurring in the United States annually. Chronic sinusitis affects approximately 12.5% of people.

==Research==
Based on recent theories on the role that fungi may play in the development of chronic sinusitis, antifungal treatments have been used, on a trial basis. These trials have had mixed results.

<doc id="28601" wikidata="Q1350132" url="?curid=28601" title="Aos Sí">
<text>(; English approximation: ; older form: ) is the Irish name for a supernatural race in Gaelic folklore, similar to elves. They are said to descend from the Tuatha Dé Danann or the gods of Irish mythology.

The name &quot;aos sí&quot; means &quot;folk of the &quot;sí&quot;&quot;; these are the burial mounds in which they are said to dwell, which are seen as portals to an Otherworld. Such abodes are referred to in English as &#x27;shee&#x27;, &#x27;fairy mounds&#x27;, &#x27;elf mounds&#x27; or &#x27;hollow hills&#x27;. The &quot;aos sí&quot; interact with humans and the human world. They are variously said to be the ancestors, the spirits of nature, or goddesses and gods.

In modern Irish, they are also called daoine sí; in Scottish Gaelic daoine sìth (&#x27;folk of the fairy mounds&#x27;).

==Etymology==
In the Irish language, &quot;aos sí&quot;, earlier &quot;aes sídhe&quot;, means &quot;folk of the fairy mounds&quot;. In Old Irish, it was &quot;áes síde&quot;. The word &quot;sí&quot; or &quot;sídh&quot; in Irish means a fairy mound or ancient burial mound, which were seen as portals to an Otherworld. It is derived from proto-Celtic &quot;*sīdos&quot; (&#x27;abode&#x27;), and is related to the English words &#x27;seat&#x27; and &#x27;settle&#x27;.

David Fitzgerald conjectured that the word &quot;sídh&quot; was synonymous with &quot;immortal&quot; and is compared with words such as &quot;sídsat&quot; (&quot;they wait/remain&quot;), &quot;síthbeo&quot; (&quot;lasting&quot;), &quot;sídhbuan&quot; (&quot;perpetual&quot;), and &quot;sídhbe&quot; (&quot;long life&quot;). In most of the tales concerning the &quot;sí&quot;, a great age or long life is implied.

==In medieval literature==
In medieval Irish literature, the names &quot;aes síde&quot; and &quot;fír síde&quot; (folk of the &quot;síd&quot;) are equivalent to the terms &quot;Tuath Dé&quot; and &quot;Tuatha Dé Danann&quot;. The only difference is that &quot;Tuath Dé&quot; tends to be used in contexts of legendary history and mythology.

Writing in the 7th century, the Irish bishop Tírechán described the &quot;sídh&quot; folk as &quot;earthly gods&quot; (). The 8th century &quot;Fiacc&#x27;s Hymn&quot; says that the Irish adored the &quot;sídh&quot; folk before the coming of Saint Patrick.

==In Irish folklore==
Due to the oral nature of Irish folklore, the exact origins of the fairies are not well defined. There are enough stories to support two possible origins. The fairies could either be fallen angels or the descendants of the Tuatha Dé Danann; in the latter case, this is equivalent with &quot;aos sí&quot;. In the former case, it is said that the fairies are angels who have fallen from heaven, but whose sins were not great enough to warrant hell.

In many Gaelic tales, the &quot;aos sí&quot; are later literary versions of the Tuatha Dé Danann (&quot;People of the Goddess Danu&quot;)—the deities and deified ancestors of Irish mythology. Some sources describe them as the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann who retreated into the Otherworld when fleeing the mortal Sons of Míl Espáine who, like many other early invaders of Ireland, came from Iberia. As part of the terms of their surrender to the Milesians, the Tuatha Dé Danann agreed to retreat and dwell underground.

In folk belief and practice, the &quot;aos sí&quot; are often appeased with offerings and care is taken to avoid angering or insulting them. Often, they are not named directly, but rather spoken of as &quot;The Good Neighbours&quot;, &quot;The Fair Folk&quot;, or simply &quot;The Folk&quot;. The most common names for them, &quot;aos sí&quot;, &quot;aes sídhe&quot;, &quot;daoine sídhe&quot; (singular &quot;duine sídhe&quot;) and &quot;daoine sìth&quot; mean, literally, &quot;people of the mounds&quot; (referring to the &quot;sídhe&quot;). The &quot;aos sí&quot; are generally described as stunningly beautiful, though they can also be terrible and hideous.

&quot;Aos sí&quot; are seen as fierce guardians of their abodes—whether a fairy hill, a fairy ring, a special tree (often a hawthorn) or a particular loch or wood. It is believed that infringing on these spaces will cause the &quot;aos sí&quot; to retaliate in an effort to remove the people or objects that invaded their homes. Many of these tales contribute to the changeling myth in west European folklore, with the &quot;aos sí&quot; kidnapping trespassers or replacing their children with changelings as a punishment for transgressing. The &quot;aos sí&quot; are often connected to certain times of year and hours; as the Gaelic Otherworld is believed to come closer to the mortal world at the times of dusk and dawn, the &quot;aos sí&quot; correspondingly become easier to encounter. Some festivals such as Samhain, Bealtaine and Midsummer are also associated with the &quot;aos sí.&quot;

===The &quot;sídhe&quot;===
A &quot;sídh&quot; (anglicized &#x27;shee&#x27;) is burial mound (tumuli) associated with the &quot;aos sí&quot;. In modern Irish, the word is &quot;sí&quot; (plural &quot;síthe&quot;); in Scottish Gaelic it is &quot;sìth&quot; (plural &quot;sìthean&quot;); in Old Irish it is &quot;síd&quot; (plural &quot;síde&quot;). These &quot;sídhe&quot; are referred to in English as &#x27;fairy mounds&#x27;, &#x27;elf mounds&#x27; or &#x27;hollow hills&#x27;. 

In some later English-language texts, the word &quot;sídhe&quot; is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. For example, W. B. Yeats, writing in 1908, referred to the &quot;aos sí&quot; simply as &quot;the &quot;sídhe&quot;&quot;. However, &quot;sidh&quot; in older texts refers specifically to &quot;the palaces, courts, halls or residences&quot; of the otherworldly beings that supposedly inhabit them.

===Other names in Irish folklore===
The &quot;Aos sí&quot; are known by many names in Ireland, among them:
* &quot;Aingil Anúabhair&quot;: &quot;Proud angels&quot;
* &quot;Daoine Uaisle&#x27;: &quot;The noble folk&quot;
* &quot;Daoine maithe&quot;: &quot;Good people&quot;
* &quot;Deamhan Aerig&quot;: &quot;Air demons&quot;
* &quot;Dream Anúabhair&quot;: &quot;Excessively proud [people]&quot;
* &quot;Sídhfir&quot;: &quot;fairy men&quot;
* &quot;Sídheógaídhe&quot;: &quot;Young Moundlings&quot;
* &quot;Slúagh Cille&quot;: &quot;Host of the churchyard&quot;
* &quot;Slúagh na Marbh&quot;: &quot;Host of the dead&quot;
* &quot;Slúagh Sídhe&quot;: &quot;Mound host&quot;
* &quot;Slúagh-Sídhe-Thúatha-Dé-Danann&quot;: &quot;Mound host of the Túatha Dé Danann&quot;
* &quot;na Uaisle&quot;: &quot;The noble&quot; or &quot;The gentry&quot;

==Types==
The banshee or &quot;bean sídhe&quot; (from ), which means &quot;woman of the &quot;sídhe&quot;&quot;, has come to indicate any supernatural woman of Ireland who announces a coming death by wailing and keening. Her counterpart in Scottish mythology is the &quot;bean sìth&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;bean-sìdh&quot;). Other varieties of &quot;aos sí&quot; and &quot;daoine sìth&quot; include the Scottish &quot;bean-nighe&quot; (the washerwoman who is seen washing the bloody clothing or armour of the person who is doomed to die), the &quot;leanan sídhe&quot; (the &quot;fairy lover&quot;), the &quot;cat-sìth&quot; (a fairy cat), and the &quot;cù-sìth&quot; (a fairy dog).

The &quot;sluagh sídhe&quot;—&quot;the fairy host&quot;—is sometimes depicted in Irish and Scottish lore as a crowd of airborne spirits, perhaps the cursed, evil or restless dead. The &quot;siabhra&quot; (anglicised as &quot;sheevra&quot;), may be a type of these lesser spirits, prone to evil and mischief. However, an Ulster folk song also uses &quot;sheevra&quot; simply to mean &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;fairy&quot;.

==&quot;Creideamh Sí&quot;==

&quot;Creideamh Sí&quot; is Irish for the &quot;Fairy Faith&quot;, a term for the collection of beliefs and practices observed by those who wish to keep good relationships with the &quot;aos sí&quot; and avoid angering them. General belief in the Celtic otherworld, the existence of &quot;aos sí&quot; and the ability of the &quot;aos sí&quot; to influence the local area and its people are all beliefs characteristic of the &quot;Creideamh Sí&quot;. It is characterised as an aspect of Irish popular religion and exists syncretically with folk Christianity. 

Effort is made by those who believe to appease local &quot;aos sí&quot; through food and drink. The custom of offering milk and traditional foods—such as baked goods, apples or berries—to the &quot;aos sí&quot; has survived through the Christian era into the present day in parts of Ireland, Scotland and the diaspora. Those who maintain some degree of belief in the &quot;aos sí&quot; also are careful to leave their sacred places alone and protect them from damage through road or housing construction.

<text>Star clusters are large groups of stars held together by self-gravitation. Two main types of star clusters can be distinguished. Globular clusters are tight groups of ten thousand to millions of old stars which are gravitationally bound. Open clusters are more loosely clustered groups of stars, generally containing fewer than a few hundred members, that are often very young. As they move through the galaxy, over time, open clusters become disrupted by the gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds. Even though they are no longer gravitationally bound, they will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space and are then known as stellar associations, sometimes referred to as &quot;moving groups&quot;.

Star clusters visible to the naked eye include the Pleiades, Hyades, and 47 Tucanae.

==Open cluster==
Open clusters are very different from globular clusters. Unlike the spherically distributed globulars, they are confined to the galactic plane, and are almost always found within spiral arms. They are generally young objects, up to a few tens of millions of years old, with a few rare exceptions as old as a few billion years, such as Messier 67 (the closest and most observed old open cluster) for example. They form in H II regions such as the Orion Nebula.

Open clusters typically have a few hundred members and are located in an area up to 30 light-years across. Being much less densely populated than globular clusters, they are much less tightly gravitationally bound, and over time, are disrupted by the gravity of giant molecular clouds and other clusters. Close encounters between cluster members can also result in the ejection of stars, a process known as &quot;evaporation&quot;.

The most prominent open clusters are the Pleiades and Hyades in Taurus. The Double Cluster of h+Chi Persei can also be prominent under dark skies. Open clusters are often dominated by hot young blue stars, because although such stars are short-lived in stellar terms, only lasting a few tens of millions of years, open clusters tend to have dispersed before these stars die.

A subset of open clusters constitute a binary or aggregate cluster. New research indicates Messier 25 may constitute a ternary star cluster together with NGC 6716 and Collinder 394.

Establishing precise distances to open clusters enables the calibration of the period-luminosity relationship shown by Cepheids variable stars, which are then used as standard candles. Cepheids are luminous and can be used to establish both the distances to remote galaxies and the expansion rate of the Universe (Hubble constant). Indeed, the open cluster NGC 7790 hosts three classical Cepheids which are critical for such efforts.

===Embedded cluster===


Embedded clusters are groups of very young stars that are partially or fully encased in interstellar dust or gas which is often impervious to optical observations. Embedded clusters form in molecular clouds, when the clouds begin to collapse and form stars. There is often ongoing star formation in these clusters, so embedded clusters may be home to various types of young stellar objects including protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. An example of an embedded cluster is the Trapezium Cluster in the Orion Nebula. In ρ Ophiuchi cloud (L1688) core region there is an embedded cluster.

The embedded cluster phase may last for several million years, after which gas in the cloud is depleted by star formation or dispersed through radiation pressure, stellar winds and outflows, or supernova explosions. In general less than 30% of cloud mass is converted to stars before the cloud is dispersed, but this fraction may be higher in particularly dense parts of the cloud. With the loss of mass in the cloud, the energy of the system is altered, often leading to the disruption of a star cluster. Most young embedded clusters disperse shortly after the end of star formation.

The open clusters found in the Galaxy are former embedded clusters that were able to survive early cluster evolution. However, nearly all freely floating stars, including the Sun, were originally born into embedded clusters that disintegrated.

==Globular cluster==

Globular clusters are roughly spherical groupings of from 10 thousand to several million stars packed into regions of from 10 to 30 light-years across. They commonly consist of very old Population II stars – just a few hundred million years younger than the universe itself – which are mostly yellow and red, with masses less than two solar masses. Such stars predominate within clusters because hotter and more massive stars have exploded as supernovae, or evolved through planetary nebula phases to end as white dwarfs. Yet a few rare blue stars exist in globulars, thought to be formed by stellar mergers in their dense inner regions; these stars are known as blue stragglers.

In the Milky Way galaxy, globular clusters are distributed roughly spherically in the galactic halo, around the Galactic Center, orbiting the center in highly elliptical orbits. In 1917, the astronomer Harlow Shapley made the first respectable estimate of the Sun&#x27;s distance from the Galactic Center, based on the distribution of globular clusters.

Until the mid-1990s, globular clusters were the cause of a great mystery in astronomy, as theories of stellar evolution gave ages for the oldest members of globular clusters that were greater than the estimated age of the universe. However, greatly improved distance measurements to globular clusters using the Hipparcos satellite and increasingly accurate measurements of the Hubble constant resolved the paradox, giving an age for the universe of about 13 billion years and an age for the oldest stars of a few hundred million years less.

Our Galaxy has about 150 globular clusters, some of which may have been captured cores of small galaxies stripped of stars previously in their outer margins by the tides of the Milky Way, as seems to be the case for the globular cluster M79. Some galaxies are much richer in globulars than the Milky Way: The giant elliptical galaxy M87 contains over a thousand.

A few of the brightest globular clusters are visible to the naked eye; the brightest, Omega Centauri, was observed in antiquity and catalogued as a star, before the telescopic age. The brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere is M13 in the constellation of Hercules.

==Super star cluster==

Super star clusters are very large regions of recent star formation, and are thought to be the precursors of globular clusters. Examples include Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way.

==Intermediate forms==
In 2005, astronomers discovered a new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters although less dense. No such clusters (which also known as &quot;extended globular clusters&quot;) are known in the Milky Way. The three discovered in Andromeda Galaxy are M31WFS C1 M31WFS C2, and M31WFS C3.

These new-found star clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number to globular clusters. The clusters also share other characteristics with globular clusters, &quot;e.g.&quot; the stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are thus much greater. The clusters have properties intermediate between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

How these clusters are formed is not yet known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way has not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains this kind of clusters, but it would be very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.

Another type of cluster are &quot;faint fuzzies&quot; which so far have only been found in lenticular galaxies like NGC 1023 and NGC 3384. They are characterized by their large size compared to globular clusters and a ringlike distribution around the centres of their host galaxies. As the latter they seem to be old objects.

==Astronomical significance==
Star clusters are important in many areas of astronomy. The reason behind this is that almost all the stars in old clusters were born at roughly the same time. Various properties of all the stars in a cluster are a function only of mass, and so stellar evolution theories rely on observations of open and globular clusters. This is primarily true for old globular clusters. In the case of young (age &lt; 1Gyr) and intermediate-age (1 &lt; age &lt; 5 Gyr), factors such as age, mass, chemical compositions may also play vital roles. Based on their ages, star clusters can reveal a lot of information about their host galaxies. For example, star clusters residing in the Magellanic Clouds can provide essential information about the formation of the Magellanic Clouds dwarf galaxies. This, in turn, can help us understand many astrophysical processes happening in our own Milky Way Galaxy. These clusters, especially the young ones can explain the star formation process that might have happened in our Milky Way Galaxy.

Clusters are also a crucial step in determining the distance scale of the universe. A few of the nearest clusters are close enough for their distances to be measured using parallax. A Hertzsprung–Russell diagram can be plotted for these clusters which has absolute values known on the luminosity axis. Then, when similar diagram is plotted for a cluster whose distance is not known, the position of the main sequence can be compared to that of the first cluster and the distance estimated. This process is known as main-sequence fitting. Reddening and stellar populations must be accounted for when using this method.

Nearly all stars in the Galactic field, including the Sun, were initially born in regions with embedded clusters that disintegrated. This means that properties of stars and planetary systems may have been affected by early clustered environments. This appears to be the case for our own Solar System, in which chemical abundances point to the effects of a supernova from a nearby star early in our Solar System&#x27;s history.

==Star cloud==

Technically not star clusters, star clouds are large groups of many stars within a galaxy, spread over very many light-years of space. Often they contain star clusters within them. The stars appear closely packed, but are not usually part of any structure. Within the Milky Way, star clouds show through gaps between dust clouds of the Great Rift, allowing deeper views along our particular line of sight. Star clouds have also been identified in other nearby galaxies. Examples of star clouds include the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, Scutum Star Cloud, Cygnus Star Cloud, Norma Star Cloud, and NGC 206 in the Andromeda Galaxy.

==Nomenclature==
In 1979, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s 17th general assembly recommended that newly discovered star clusters, open or globular, within the Galaxy have designations following the convention &quot;Chhmm±ddd&quot;, always beginning with the prefix &quot;C&quot;, where &quot;h&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; represent the approximate coordinates of the cluster centre in hours and minutes of right ascension, and degrees of declination, respectively, with leading zeros. The designation, once assigned, is not to change, even if subsequent measurements improve on the location of the cluster centre. The first of such designations were assigned by Gosta Lynga in 1982.

<doc id="28606" wikidata="Q23733" url="?curid=28606" title="Seinfeld">
<text>Seinfeld ( ) is an American television sitcom created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld that originally aired on NBC from July 5, 1989, to May 14, 1998, with a total of nine seasons consisting of 180 episodes. Its ensemble cast stars Seinfeld as a fictionalized version of himself and focuses on his personal life with three of his friends: best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor from across the hall, Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards).

&quot;Seinfeld&quot; is set mostly in and around the titular character&#x27;s apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side in New York City. It has been described as &quot;a show about nothing&quot;, often focusing on the minutiae of daily life. Interspersed in all episodes of the first seven seasons are moments of stand-up comedy from the fictional Jerry Seinfeld, frequently related to the episode&#x27;s events.

As a rising comedian in the late 1980s, Jerry Seinfeld was presented with an opportunity to create a show with NBC. He asked Larry David, a fellow comedian and friend, to help create a premise for a sitcom. The series was produced by West-Shapiro Productions and Castle Rock Entertainment and is distributed in syndication by Sony Pictures Television. It was largely written by David and Seinfeld along with scriptwriters. A favorite among critics, the series led the Nielsen ratings in Seasons 6 and 9 and finished among the top two (along with &quot;ER&quot; of the same network) every year from 1994 to 1998. Only two other shows—&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;—finished their runs at the top of the ratings.

&quot;Seinfeld&quot; is universally regarded as one of the greatest and most influential American shows of all time. Its most renowned episodes include &quot;The Chinese Restaurant&quot;, &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot;, &quot;The Parking Garage&quot;, &quot;The Marine Biologist&quot;, and &quot;The Contest&quot;. E! named it the &quot;Number 1 reason [why] the &#x27;90s ruled&quot;. Quotes from numerous episodes have become catchphrases in popular culture.

==Production==
===Conception===
&quot;Seinfeld&quot; began as a 23-minute pilot titled &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;. Created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld&#x27;s stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life like laundry, the buttoning of the top button on one&#x27;s shirt, and the effort by men to interpret the intent of women spending the night in Seinfeld&#x27;s apartment.

The pilot was filmed at Stage 8 of Desilu Cahuenga studios, the same studio where &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; was filmed (seen by the crew as a good omen), and was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood. The pilot was first screened to a group of two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California, in early 1989. This one, however, did not yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade&#x27;s previous NBC successes like &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;The Golden Girls.&quot; Brandon Tartikoff was not convinced the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as &quot;Too New York, too Jewish&quot;. Test audiences were even harsher. NBC&#x27;s practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot&#x27;s performance among the respondents as &quot;weak&quot;, which Warren Littlefield, then second-in-command in NBC&#x27;s entertainment division, called &quot;a dagger to the heart&quot;. Comments included, &quot;You can&#x27;t get too excited about two guys going to the laundromat&quot;, &quot;Jerry&#x27;s loser friend George isn&#x27;t a forceful character&quot;, &quot;Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast&quot;, and &quot;Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?&quot; Seinfeld and David did not see the memo for several years, but after they became aware of it, they hung it in a bathroom on the set. Seinfeld comments, &quot;We thought, if someone goes in to use this bathroom, this is something they should see. It fits that moment.&quot;

Around the time the show&#x27;s pilot was filmed, Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the show, had also produced another pilot for NBC that featured Ann Jillian in her almost-similarly eponymous TV series. When &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot; tested poorly with audiences, Castle Rock focused on Jillian&#x27;s series, which tested better with audiences and received a full-season order. &quot;Ann Jillian&quot; lasted only a single season of 13 episodes and was off the air by the end of 1990.

===First seasons===
When NBC announced its 1989–90 (primetime) schedule in May 1989, &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot; was not included, but the show&#x27;s supporters did not give up. The pilot first aired on July 5, 1989, and finished second in its time slot against the CBS police drama &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;, receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19. The ratings did not exhibit the regional skew Tartikoff predicted, much to the encouragement of the show&#x27;s supporters. Ludwin canceled one of the Bob Hope specials budgeted for that season so the entertainment division had the money to order four more episodes of &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;, which formed the rest of the show&#x27;s first season (the series was by then retitled to &quot;Seinfeld&quot;)—a move without which &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Phil Rosenthal later said there &quot;would be no &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&quot;. Although this was a very low order number for a new series—and the smallest sitcom order in TV history—Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it shopped the show to other networks, and accepted the order. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; did not return to the airwaves until May 30, 1990, and it was another three years before it became a Top 5-rated show. Preston Beckman, in charge of NBC&#x27;s research department at the time, reminisced, &quot;The show was different. Nobody had seen anything like it. It wasn&#x27;t unusual for poor-testing shows to get on the air, but it was very rare that they became hits.&quot;

When the program was first repeated on July 5, 1990, it received a rating of 13.9/26. These ratings were high enough to secure a second season. NBC research showed that the show was popular with young male adults, a demographic sought after by advertisers. This gave NBC an incentive to keep broadcasting the show. One DVD reviewer, Britt Gillette, wrote that &quot;this initial episode exhibits the flashes of brilliance that made &quot;Seinfeld&quot; a cultural phenomenon.&quot;

===Filming===
Other than the pilot, the series was filmed at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles. The first three seasons were filmed on Soundstage 19; it then moved to the larger Stage 9 for the remainder of its production. Despite numerous establishing shots taken in New York City, all scenes of the actors walking in New York were also filmed at CBS Studio Center, on their New York Street backlot. Street scenes and park scenes were filmed in the CBS Studio Centre&#x27;s New York Street and Central Park backlots, respectively.

A source of problems for the cast was the small sets, especially that of Jerry&#x27;s apartment; Alexander noted, &quot;If you knew you were doing a series for nine years, you would never build that set.&quot; Adding to the problem was that the scripts contained only minimal physical direction, leaving the actors needing help to come up with actions to perform while speaking. Eventually, they got into a routine of directing each other on how to make their movements look natural. Alexander said this helped them build chemistry with each other.

Filming usually went long, as the cast and Larry David were perfectionists. If a joke did not elicit the desired reaction, they rewrote it and performed it again. In at least one case, &quot;The Marine Biologist,&quot; this led to David writing an entirely new scene requiring Alexander to memorize a monologue in only a matter of minutes. Laugh tracks were used only for matching shots, not for artificially adding laughter.

Various locations used for establishing shots included Tom&#x27;s Restaurant at 112th Street and Broadway (Monk&#x27;s Cafe), Midtown West&#x27;s Roosevelt Hospital (recurring exterior emergency room scene and indoor scenes in &#x27;The Junior Mint&#x27; and &#x27;The Bris&#x27;), Cornell Medical Centre at 525 East 68th Street, 22-39 37th Street, Queens (The Costanza&#x27;s house), the Taconic State Parkway exit to the Hopewell Junction, Dutchess County, New York (driving scene in &#x27;The Bubble Boy&#x27;), and the Amagansett farmers market, Long Island (&#x27;The Hamptons&#x27;). The exterior shot used for Jerry&#x27;s New York apartment building was actually located at 757 S New Hampshire Avenue, Los Angeles. The real-life exterior of Pendant Publishing, Elaine&#x27;s workplace, is located at 1325 Ave of the Americas, New York. The live stand-up comedy performed by Seinfeld at the beginning of most episodes was truly filmed at The Improv, a comedy club at 358 West 44th Street, Manhattan; though it closed in 1993, another comedy club operates at the site today. The Yankee Stadium exterior seen in the show has now been demolished. Most office building establishing shots are real businesses and locations. Various real street locations can be gleaned from the car windows during driving scenes. By the final season, each episode of the series cost $3 million to $3.5 million.

More than 120 episodes make reference to the &quot;Superman&quot; franchise. Teri Hatcher, who played Lois Lane on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, plays Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend Sidra. Paula Marshall, who played Christina Riley on the &quot;Superboy&quot; TV series, portrays the journalist Sharon, who Jerry says reminds him of Lois Lane. Sherman Howard, who played Lex Luthor on &quot;Superboy&quot;, portrays Roy. Superman logos and figurines frequently appear in Jerry&#x27;s apartment. Seinfeld and Superman later appear in an American Express commercial. The show was written by David and Seinfeld, along with writers who included Larry Charles, Peter Mehlman, Gregg Kavet, Carol Leifer, David Mandel, Jeff Schaffer, Steve Koren, Jennifer Crittenden, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Dan O&#x27;Keefe, Charlie Rubin, Marjorie Gross, Alec Berg, Elaine Pope, and Spike Feresten.

==Series overview==

===Plotlines===
Many &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes are based on the writers&#x27; real-life experiences, with the experiences reinterpreted for the characters&#x27; storylines. For example, George&#x27;s storyline in &quot;The Revenge&quot; is based on Larry David&#x27;s experience at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. &quot;The Contest&quot; is also based on David&#x27;s experiences. &quot;The Smelly Car&quot; storyline is based on Peter Mehlman&#x27;s lawyer friend, who could not get a bad smell out of his car. &quot;The Strike&quot; is based on Dan O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s dad, who made up his own holiday: Festivus. Other stories take a variety of turns. &quot;The Chinese Restaurant&quot; consists of George, Jerry, and Elaine waiting for a table throughout the entire episode. &quot;The Boyfriend&quot;, revolving around Keith Hernandez, extends through two episodes. &quot;The Betrayal&quot; is famous for using reverse chronology and was inspired by a similar plot device in a Harold Pinter play, &quot;Betrayal&quot;. Some stories were inspired by headlines and rumors, as explained in the DVD features &quot;Notes About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Inside Look&quot; and &quot;Audio Commentary.&quot; In &quot;The Maestro,&quot; Kramer&#x27;s lawsuit is roughly similar to the McDonald&#x27;s coffee case. &quot;The Outing&quot; is based primarily on rumors that Larry Charles heard about Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s sexuality.

===Themes===
The series was often described as &quot;a show about nothing&quot;. However, in 2014, Seinfeld stated: &quot;The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was [that] we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show &quot;about nothing&quot; was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show because, to us, it&#x27;s the opposite of that.&quot; David similarly commented: &quot;I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it. Doesn&#x27;t everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you&#x27;re going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show&#x27;s really about something. The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous.&quot;

Much of the show&#x27;s humor is based upon repeated use of irony, incongruity, and (oftentimes unfortunate) coincidences. Additionally, guest characters are frequently introduced with little to no context, with a humorous focus on the atypical names of these characters, which often contain alliteration. In keeping with Seinfeld&#x27;s reputation as a clean comedian, though the show frequently contains dialogue around sexual themes, the show notably avoids using almost all explicit sexual terminology. Notably, in the popular episode &quot;The Contest,&quot; whose plot line concerns a contest amongst the main characters to see which one can go the longest without masturbating, the word &#x27;masturbation&#x27; is never mentioned. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; broke several conventions of mainstream television. David is credited with refusing to follow a predictable sitcom formula that would have a romantic relationship develop between Jerry and Elaine.

The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters and eschews sentimentality. An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes revolve around the characters&#x27; involvement in the lives of others, with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the &quot;no hugging, no learning&quot; rule. Larry David was adamant from the beginning that he did not want the characters to mature, grow or learn from their past mistakes. The characters are &quot;thirty-something singles with vague identities, no roots, and conscious indifference to morals.&quot; Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan&#x27;s death in &quot;The Invitations&quot; elicits no genuine emotions from anybody in the show. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; does not shy away from making light of tough topics, from death to illness to disability.

The show frequently engages in fourth-wall-breaking humor and self-satire. One such example is the story arc, where the characters promote a TV sitcom series named &quot;Jerry&quot;. The show within a show, &quot;Jerry&quot; was much like &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in that it was &quot;about nothing,&quot; and Seinfeld played himself. The fictional &quot;Jerry&quot; was launched in the Season 4 finale, but unlike &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t picked up as a series. &quot;Jerry&quot; is one of many examples of metafiction in the show. There are no fewer than 22 fictional movies featured, like &quot;Rochelle, Rochelle&quot;. Because of these several elements, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; became the first TV series since &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; to be widely described as postmodern.

Seinfeld is an avid Abbott and Costello fan and has cited &quot;The Abbott and Costello Show&quot; as an influence on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;: &quot;Everybody on the show knows I&#x27;m a fan. We&#x27;re always joking about how we do stuff from their show. George and I will often get into a riff that has the rhythm from the old Abbott and Costello shows. And sometimes, I&#x27;ll hit George in the chest the way Abbott would hit Costello.&quot; The series includes numerous references to the team. George Costanza&#x27;s middle name is &quot;Louis&quot;, after Costello. &quot;The Old Man&quot; episode features a cantankerous character named &quot;Sid Fields&quot; as a tribute to the landlord on the team&#x27;s TV show. Kramer&#x27;s friend is named Mickey Abbott. A copywriter for the J. Peterman catalog is named Eddie Sherman, after the team&#x27;s longtime agent. In Episode 30, Kramer hears the famous Abbott and Costello line, &quot;His father was a mudder. His mother was a mudder.&quot;

===Catchphrases===
Many terms were coined, popularized, or re-popularized in the series&#x27; run and have become part of popular culture, including &quot;Yada, yada, yada&quot;, &quot;No soup for you!&quot;, &quot;Master of my domain&quot;, and &quot;Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.&quot; The lexicon of Seinfeldian code words and recurring phrases that evolved around particular episodes is referred to as Seinlanguage, which is also the title of Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s best-selling book on humor. These terms include &quot;man hands&quot;, &quot;shrinkage&quot;, &quot;regift&quot;, and &quot;double dip&quot;.

===Consumer products===
A recurring feature of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was its inclusion of specific products, especially candy, as plot points. These might be a central feature of a plot (e.g., Junior Mints, Twix, Chuckles, Jujyfruits, bite-size Three Musketeers, Snickers, Chunky, Oh Henry!, Drake&#x27;s Coffee Cake and PEZ), or an association of candy with a guest character (e.g. Oh Henry! bars) or simply a conversational aside (e.g., Chuckles, Clark Bar, Twinkies). A large number of non-candy products were also featured throughout the series.

The show&#x27;s creators claim that they weren&#x27;t engaging in a product placement strategy for commercial gain. One motivation for the use of real-world products, entirely unrelated to commercial considerations, is the comedy value of funny-sounding phrases and words. &quot;I knew I wanted Kramer to think of watching the operation like going to see a movie,&quot; explained &quot;Seinfeld&quot; writer/producer Andy Robin in an interview published in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. &quot;At first, I thought maybe a piece of popcorn falls into the patient. I ran that by my brother, and he said, &#x27;No, Junior Mints are just funnier.&#x27;&quot;

Many advertisers capitalized on the popularity of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. American Express created a webisode where Jerry Seinfeld and an animated Superman (voiced by Patrick Warburton, who played the role of Puddy) starred in its commercial. The makers of the Today Sponge created the &quot;Spongeworthy&quot; game on their website, inspired by &quot;The Sponge.&quot; An advertisement featured Jason Alexander in a Chrysler commercial. In this, Alexander acts much like his character George, and his relationship with Lee Iacocca plays on George&#x27;s relationship with Steinbrenner. Similarly, Michael Richards was the focus of a series of advertisements for Vodafone, which ran in Australia, where he dressed and acted precisely like Kramer, including the trademark bumbling pratfalls. In addition, the show occasionally incorporated fictional products like a Scotch brand called &quot;Hennigan&#x27;s&quot; (a blend of &quot;Hennessy&quot; and &quot;Brannigans&quot;) and a canned meat product called &quot;Beef-a-reeno&quot; (a parody of &quot;Beef-a-roni&quot;).

===Music===
A signature of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; is its theme music. Composed by Jonathan Wolff, it consists of distinct solo sampled electric bass riffs that open the show and connect the scenes, often accompanied by beatboxing. The bass music eventually replaced the original piano/synth music by Jep Epstein when it was played again after the first broadcast of the pilot episode. The show lacked a traditional title track and the riffs were played over the first moments of dialogue or action. They vary throughout each episode and are played in an improvised funk style, matching the timing of Seinfeld&#x27;s stand-up comedy delivery or transitions in the editing. An additional musical theme with an ensemble, led by a synthesized mid-range brass instrument, ends each episode.

In &quot;The Note,&quot; the first episode of Season 3, the bumper music featured a scatting female jazz singer who sang a phrase that sounded like the tune &quot;Easy to Beat&quot;. Jerry Seinfeld and executive producer Larry David both liked Wolff&#x27;s additions, and three episodes were produced with this new style of music. However, they had neglected to inform NBC and Castle Rock executives of the change, and when the season premiere aired, the executives were surprised and unimpressed and requested that they return to the original style. The subsequent two episodes were redone, leaving this episode as the only one with additional music elements. In the commentary of &quot;The Note,&quot; Louis-Dreyfus facetiously suggests it was removed because the perceived lyric related closely to the low ratings at the time. In the final three seasons, the bits were tweaked slightly with more frantic rhythms; a bass guitar was added in addition to the sampled bass from earlier seasons. Throughout the show, the main theme could be restyled in different ways depending on the episode. For instance, in &quot;The Betrayal,&quot; part of which takes place in India, the theme is heard played on a sitar. The soundtrack was given a digital release on July 2, 2021.
==Cast and characters==
===Main characters===

* Jerry Seinfeld (himself) – Jerry is a &quot;minor celeb&quot; stand-up comedian who is often depicted as &quot;the voice of reason&quot; amid the general insanity generated by the people in his world. The in-show character is a mild germophobe and neat freak as well as an avid Superman, New York Mets, and breakfast cereal fan. Jerry&#x27;s apartment is the center of a world visited by his eccentric friends and a focus of the show.
* George Costanza (Jason Alexander) – George has been Jerry&#x27;s best friend since high school. He is stingy, conniving, pedantic, and jealous of others&#x27; achievements. He is depicted as a loser who is perpetually lacking confidence about his capabilities. He rants and lies easily about his profession, relationships, and almost everything else, which usually creates trouble for him later. He often uses the alias Art Vandelay when lying or concocting a cover story. Despite these shortcomings, George is very reliable to his friends and has success in dating women, and he eventually secures a steady career as an assistant to the traveling secretary for the New York Yankees. The character of George was based on Larry David himself.
* Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) – Elaine is Jerry&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and later friend. Generally depicted as smarter than her friends, she is friendly while also being sarcastic, somewhat elitist, and hot-tempered. She is occasionally depicted as vegetarian or pescatarian, without the strength of conviction to keep this up regularly. She sometimes tends to be too honest with people (usually by losing her temper), which often gets her into trouble. She usually gets caught up in her boyfriends&#x27; quirks, eccentric employers&#x27; unusual behaviors and idiosyncrasies, and the maladjustment of total strangers. She tends to make poor choices in men she dates and is often overly reactive. She works for a time at Pendant Publishing with Mr. Lippman. Later she is hired as a personal assistant for Mr. Pitt. She eventually worked for the J. Peterman catalog as a writer. Elaine is popularly described as an amalgamation of David&#x27;s and Seinfeld&#x27;s girlfriends during their early days in New York as struggling comedians.
* Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards) – Kramer is Jerry&#x27;s slacker neighbor. His trademarks include his humorous upright pompadour hairstyle, vintage clothes, and energetic sliding bursts through Jerry&#x27;s apartment door. Kramer was heavily based on a neighbor of David&#x27;s during his amateur comedic years in Manhattan. At times, he appears naïve, uneducated, and impulsive, and at other times, quick-witted, helpful, and empathetic; similarly he is exaggeratedly successful, socially, with his charisma and laid-back personality. This is seen in his success with women and employers. He has been described as a &quot;hipster doofus.&quot; Although he never holds a steady job, he is rarely short of money and frequently invents wacky schemes that often work at first but eventually fail. Kramer is friends with Newman, and they work well together despite their differences.

===Recurring characters===

Many characters have made multiple appearances, notably Jerry&#x27;s parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld, who reside in Florida; George&#x27;s parents, the overbearing Frank and Estelle Costanza; George&#x27;s on-again, off-again fiancée Susan Ross; Jerry&#x27;s Uncle Leo; Elaine&#x27;s variety of bosses, Mr. Lippman, Mr. Pitt and J. Peterman; Elaine&#x27;s on-again, off-again boyfriend David Puddy; and Kramer&#x27;s friend, Newman, a mail carrier who lives in the same building and is Jerry&#x27;s nemesis. In addition to recurring characters, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; features numerous celebrities who appear as themselves or as girlfriends, boyfriends, bosses, and other acquaintances.

; Seinfeld&#x27;s girlfriends
A number of actresses made guest appearances as Seinfeld&#x27;s love interests in single episodes:

==Episodes==


Compared to other family and group sitcoms of the era, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; stood out. The principal characters are not related by family or work-associated connections but remain distinctly close friends throughout the series. Many characters were based primarily on Seinfeld&#x27;s and David&#x27;s real-life acquaintances. Two prominent recurring characters were fictional depictions of actual well-known people: Jacopo Peterman of the J. Peterman catalog (based on John Peterman) and George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees. Many characters were introduced as new writers got involved with &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Other characters based on real people include the Soup Nazi and Jackie Chiles, who was based on Johnnie Cochran.

Episodes have separate plot strands, but the characters&#x27; stories often intertwine at the end. The narratives reveal the creators&#x27; &quot;consistent efforts to maintain the intimacy&quot; among the small cast of characters.

The show maintains a strong sense of continuity, as characters and plots from past episodes are often referenced or expanded on. Occasionally, story arcs span multiple episodes or entire seasons, such as Season 4, which revolves around the pilot pitch to NBC by Jerry and George. Another example is Jerry&#x27;s girlfriend Vanessa, who appears in &quot;The Stake Out&quot; and with whom he ends the relationship when things do not work out in &quot;The Stock Tip&quot;. Larry David, the head writer and executive producer for the first seven seasons, was praised for keeping a close eye on minor details and ensuring the main characters&#x27; lives remained consistent and believable. &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, David&#x27;s later comedy series, also had an overarching plot for all but the first season.

A major difference between &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and the sitcoms that preceded it is that the principal characters never learn from their mistakes. In effect, they are indifferent and even callous toward the outside world and sometimes one another. A mantra of the show&#x27;s producers was &quot;No hugging, no learning.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s TV critic Ken Tucker has described them as &quot;a group dynamic rooted in jealousy, rage, insecurity, despair, hopelessness, and a touching lack of faith in one&#x27;s fellow human beings.&quot; This leads to very few happy endings, except at somebody else&#x27;s expense. More often in every episode, situations resolve with characters getting a justly deserved comeuppance.

=== Seasons 1–3 ===
The show premiered as &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot; on July 5, 1989. After it aired, a pickup by NBC seemed unlikely, and the show was offered to Fox, which declined to pick it up. Rick Ludwin, head of late night and special events for NBC, however, diverted money from his budget by canceling a Bob Hope television special, and the next four episodes were filmed. These episodes were highly rated as they followed summer re-runs of &quot;Cheers&quot; on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m., and the series was finally picked up. At one point, NBC considered airing these episodes on Saturdays at 10:30 p.m. but gave the slot to a short-lived sitcom called &quot;FM&quot; instead. The series was renamed simply &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as a precautionary measure due to the failure of the short-lived 1990 ABC series with a similarly sounding title, &quot;The Marshall Chronicles&quot;. After airing the remaining four episodes of its first season the summer of 1990, NBC ordered 13 more episodes. David believed that he and Seinfeld had no more stories to tell and advised Seinfeld to turn down the order, but Seinfeld agreed to the additional episodes. Season 2 was bumped off its scheduled premiere of January 16, 1991, due to the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War. It settled into a regular time slot on Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and eventually flipped with veteran series &quot;Night Court&quot; to 9 p.m.

TV critics championed &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in its early seasons, even as it was slow to cultivate a substantial audience. For the first three seasons, Jerry&#x27;s stand-up comedy act would bookend at the beginning and end of each episode, even functioning as transitions during the show. A few episodes set a benchmark for later seasons. &quot;The Deal&quot; establishes Jerry and Elaine&#x27;s relationship by setting rules about having sex while remaining friends. &quot;The Parking Garage&quot; was the first episode shot with no audience for the episode and, after &quot;The Chinese Restaurant&quot;, to not show Jerry&#x27;s apartment. &quot;The Keys&quot; contains a crossover to CBS show &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, marking the first such cooperation between rival networks. &quot;The Busboy&quot; introduces George, Kramer and Elaine as having their own storylines for the first time. Although Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s Glenn Padnick thought Seinfeld was too generous, showcasing his co-stars&#x27; comedic talent became a trademark throughout the series.

Larry Charles wrote an episode for Season 2, &quot;The Bet,&quot; in which Elaine buys a gun from Kramer&#x27;s friend. This episode was not filmed because the content was deemed unacceptable, and it was replaced by the episode &quot;The Phone Message&quot;. &quot;The Stranded,&quot; which aired during Season 3, was initially intended for Season 2. At the beginning of this episode, Jerry clears up the continuity error over George&#x27;s real estate job.

=== Seasons 4–5 ===

Season 4 marked the sitcom&#x27;s entry into the Nielsen ratings Top 30. It contains several of the most popular episodes, such as &quot;The Bubble Boy&quot; in which George and the bubble boy argue over &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, and &quot;The Junior Mint&quot; in which Jerry and Kramer accidentally fumble a mint in the operating room. This was the first season to use a story arc of Jerry and George creating their own sitcom, &quot;Jerry&quot;. Also, at this time, the use of Jerry&#x27;s stand-up act slowly declined, and the stand-up segment in the middle of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episodes was cut.

Much publicity followed the controversial episode &quot;The Contest,&quot; an Emmy Award-winning episode written by David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate for prime-time network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word &quot;masturbation&quot; was never used in the script, instead substituted for by a variety of oblique references. Midway through that season, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was moved from its original 9:00 p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30 p.m. on Thursdays, following &quot;Cheers&quot; again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; on ABC had aired at the same time, and &quot;Home Improvement&quot; kept beating &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in the ratings. NBC moved the series after Ted Danson announced the end of &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00 p.m. &quot;Cheers&quot; reruns that spring. The show won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, which was only in its second season on rival network ABC.

Season 5 was an even bigger ratings hit, consisting of popular episodes, such as &quot;The Puffy Shirt&quot; in which Jerry feels embarrassed wearing a &quot;pirate&quot; shirt on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Non-Fat Yogurt&quot; featuring Rudy Giuliani, the Republican then-mayor-elect of New York, and &quot;The Opposite&quot; in which George, doing the opposite of what his instincts tell him he should do, lands a job with the New York Yankees and Elaine leaves &quot;Pendant Publishing&quot; because of a comedy of errors that led to its demise. Another story arc has George returning to live with his parents. Amid the story arc, Kramer creates and promotes his coffee table book. The show was again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost to the &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;, then in its first season. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was nominated for the same award every year for its entire run but, after its win at the 45th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1994, always lost to &quot;Frasier&quot;, which went on to win a record 39 Emmy Awards in its 11-season run.

=== Seasons 6–7 ===

In Season 6, Andy Ackerman replaced Tom Cherones as director of the show. The series remained well regarded and produced some of its most famous episodes, such as &quot;The Beard&quot;, in which Jerry is put through a lie detector test to make him admit that he watched &quot;Melrose Place;&quot; &quot;The Switch&quot;, in which Kramer&#x27;s mom, Babs, reveals that his first name is Cosmo; and &quot;The Understudy&quot;, in which Elaine meets J. Peterman for the first time. Story arcs used in this season were Elaine working as a personal assistant to her eccentric boss Justin Pitt and George&#x27;s parents&#x27; temporary separation. This was the first season in which &quot;Seinfeld&quot; reached No. 1 in the Nielsen Ratings. The use of Jerry&#x27;s stand-up act declined, and the end stand-up segment no longer appeared because the storylines for all four characters grew denser.

In Season 7, a story arc involved George getting engaged to his ex-girlfriend, Susan Ross, after the pilot &quot;Jerry&quot; proved unsuccessful. In it, George spends most of the season regretting and trying to get out of the engagement. Along with the regular half-hour episodes, two notable one-hour episodes were &quot;The Cadillac,&quot; in which George plans to date award-winning actress Marisa Tomei, and &quot;The Bottle Deposit,&quot; with Elaine and Sue Ellen Mischke participating in a bidding war to buy JFK&#x27;s golf clubs in an auction.

=== Seasons 8–9 ===

&quot;Seinfeld&#x27;s&quot; final two seasons were considered distinct from the earlier seasons. Most noticeably, David left the writing crew (but returned to write &quot;The Finale&quot; in 1998), resulting in Seinfeld taking over David&#x27;s duties as showrunner, and, under the direction of a new writing staff, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; became a faster-paced show. The show no longer contained extracts of Jerry performing stand-up comedy—Jerry had no time or energy for this with his new responsibilities—and storylines occasionally delved into fantasy and broad humor. For example, in &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, Elaine is torn between exact opposites of her friends and Jerry dates a woman who has the now-famous &quot;man hands&quot;. Some notable episodes from Season 8 include &quot;The Little Kicks&quot; showing Elaine&#x27;s horrible dancing, and &quot;The Chicken Roaster&quot; which portrays the &quot;Kenny Rogers Roasters&quot; chicken restaurant which opened during that time. A story arc in this season involves Peterman going to Burma in &quot;The Foundation&quot; until he recovered from a nervous breakdown in &quot;The Money&quot;, followed by Elaine writing Peterman&#x27;s biography in &quot;The Van Buren Boys&quot;, which leads to Kramer&#x27;s parody of Kenny Kramer&#x27;s Reality Tour seen in &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;.

The final season included episodes like &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in which Kramer converts his apartment into a talk-show studio and plays the character of talk-show host, &quot;The Betrayal&quot; that presents in reverse chronological order what happened to Sue Ellen&#x27;s wedding in India, and &quot;The Frogger&quot; in which George pushes a &quot;Frogger&quot; machine across the street, mimicking the action of the game itself. The last season included a story arc in which Elaine has an on/off relationship with Puddy. Despite the enormous popularity and willingness of the cast to return for a tenth season, Seinfeld decided to end the show after Season 9, believing he would thereby be able to ensure the show would maintain its quality and go out on top. NBC offered Seinfeld $110 million—a record $5 million an episode for a 22-episode tenth season—but he declined.

A major controversy caused in the ninth season was the accidental burning of a Puerto Rican flag by Kramer in &quot;The Puerto Rican Day.&quot; This scene caused a furor among Puerto Ricans, and as a result, NBC showed this episode only once. Seinfeld defused the protestors by not letting this episode continue in syndication, as revealed in &quot;Inside Look&quot; on DVD. However, the episode would be added to the syndicated rerun package several years later uncut.

===Series finale===

After nine years on the air, NBC and Seinfeld announced on December 25, 1997, that the series would end production the following spring in 1998. The announcement made the front page of the major New York newspapers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Seinfeld was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s first issue of 1998. The series ended with a 75-minute episode (cut to 60 minutes in syndication, in two parts) written by co-creator and ex-executive producer Larry David, which aired on May 14, 1998. Before the finale, a 45-minute retrospective clip show, &quot;The Chronicle,&quot; was aired. The retrospective was expanded to an hour after the original airing and aired again on NBC as an hour-long episode, and has since aired in syndication.

It was the first episode since the finale of season 7, &quot;The Invitations&quot;, to feature opening and closing stand-up comedy acts by Seinfeld. The finale was filmed before an audience of NBC executives and friends of the show. The press and public were shut out of the taping to keep its plot secret; those who attended the shoot of the final episode were required to sign written &quot;vows of silence&quot;. The secrecy only seemed to increase speculation about how the series would end. The episode&#x27;s producers gave false information to the media, spreading a rumor about Newman ending up in the hospital and Jerry and Elaine sitting in a chapel, presumably to marry.

The final episode enjoyed a historic audience, estimated at 76.3 million viewers (58% of all viewers that night) making it the fourth-most watched regular series finale in U.S. TV history, behind &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. However, the finale received mixed reviews from critics and fans of the show. The finale poked fun at the many rumors that were circulating, seeming to move into multiple supposed plots before settling on its actual storyline—a lengthy trial where the gang is prosecuted for violating a &quot;Duty to Rescue&quot; law and sentenced to prison terms.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, Seinfeld&#x27;s earnings from the show in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings. He refused NBC&#x27;s offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue into a tenth season. The offer NBC made to Seinfeld was over three times higher per episode than anyone on TV had ever been offered before. Seinfeld told the network that he was not married nor had children, and wished to focus on his personal life. As reported in July 2007, he was the second-highest earner in the TV industry, earning at the time $60 million a year. The episode became the first to command over $1 million a minute for advertising—a mark previously attained only by the Super Bowl.

==Reception and legacy==
Elizabeth Magnotta and Alexandra Strohl analyze the success of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; with recourse to the incongruity theory of humor: &quot;The Incongruity Theory claims that humor is created out of a violation of an expectation. For humor to result from this unexpected result, the event must have an appropriate emotional climate, the setting, characters, prior discourse, relationships of the characters, and the topic.&quot; Specifically, Magnotta and Strohl focus on &quot;The Marine Biologist&quot;, where George is embroiled in yet another lie, and on &quot;The Red Dot,&quot; where George tries to save a few dollars at Elaine&#x27;s expense by giving her a marked-down cashmere sweater.

In &quot;Translating &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&quot;, Jennifer Armstrong observes that &quot;Seinfeld&quot; is less famous among non-English speakers as its unique style of humor is &quot;too cultural and word-based to make for easy translation&quot;. Carol Iannone sums up the legacy of this American hit in her &quot;Modern Age&quot; article &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot;: The Politically Incorrect Comedy&quot; when she says, &quot;It may be the first situation comedy truly to achieve the status of art.&quot; Nod Miller, of the University of East London, has discussed the self-referential qualities of the show:

William Irwin has edited an anthology of scholarly essays on philosophy in &quot;Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and Nothing&quot;. Some entries include &quot;The Jerry Problem and the Socratic Problem&quot;, &quot;George&#x27;s Failed Quest for Happiness: An Aristotelian Analysis&quot;, &quot;Elaine&#x27;s Moral Character&quot;, &quot;Kramer the &#x27;Seducer, &quot;Making Something Out of Nothing: Seinfeld, Sophistry and the Tao&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld, Subjectivity, and Sartre&quot;, &quot;Mr. Peterman, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Me&quot;, and &quot;Minimally Decent Samaritans and Uncommon Law&quot;.

===U.S. television ratings===
===Awards and honors===

&quot;Seinfeld&quot; has received awards and nominations in various categories throughout the mid-1990s. It was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, Golden Globe Award for Best TV Series (Comedy) in 1994, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 1995, 1997 and 1998. Apart from these, the show was also nominated for an Emmy award from 1992 to 1998 for Outstanding Comedy Series, Golden Globe award from 1994 to 1998 for Best TV-Series (Comedy), and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series from 1995 to 1998. The show even received the Peabody Award in 1993.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; named it the greatest TV show of all time in 2002, and in 2013, the magazine ranked it as the second-greatest TV show. A 2015 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as their #5 favorite show. In 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as the sixth-greatest TV show of all time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as the eighth-greatest TV show of all time.

==Distribution==
Free streaming service Channel 4 has been running &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in its original 4:3 format since February 2020. On April 29, 2015, it was officially announced, during Hulu&#x27;s upfronts presentation in New York, that all nine seasons of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; would stream on the platform starting in June 2015. The deal was for around $130 million to $180 million. On May 20, 2015, Hulu announced that every episode would be available starting June 24, 2015. Hulu&#x27;s streaming rights for the series expired on June 23, 2021. In January 2017, Amazon acquired the UK rights to all seasons of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; for its Amazon Prime Video streaming service.

On November 8, 2016, the Australian streaming service Stan announced via Twitter that later in the week all episodes would be available to stream for the first time in Australia. All episodes were available from November 11, 2016, with the remastered versions of all episodes on the service featuring HD and Widescreen enhancements. The widescreen offered was cropped from the original 4:3 format negatives, thus resulting in better visual quality than the previously available DVD version, however, the top and bottom portions of the frame were cut out to achieve the widescreen aspect ratio. In April 2020, all seasons of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; were also made available on-demand via pay television service Foxtel, as well as its internet-based alternative Foxtel Now.

In September 2019, Netflix and Sony Pictures announced that Netflix had acquired the exclusive global streaming rights for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, starting on October 1, 2021, superseding the above Hulu and Amazon rights. As of 2023, Netflix&#x27;s version of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; is available in 4K resolution. The transition was criticized as the show, initially displayed in 4:3 aspect ratio, had been converted to 16:9, resulting in some gags getting cropped, similarly to how &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was initially rendered on Disney+. Netflix has yet to comment on this situation.

===Home media releases===
The hour-long, two-part clip show episode &quot;The Highlights of 100&quot; became the first &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode available on home video when it was released on VHS in 1995 by food company General Mills. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (formerly Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment) released all nine seasons of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4 between 2004 and 2007. On November 6, 2007, &quot;Seinfeld: The Complete Series&quot; was released on DVD. The complete series box set includes a 2007 &quot;roundtable&quot; reunion of the four main cast members and Larry David; only highlights of this were also included in the Season 9 set.

The first complete series box set in Australia (Region 4) was released on October 24, 2007. The second boxset was released on December 2, 2008, and was a Collectible Fridge design packaging. On August 5, 2009, another Limited-Edition boxset was released, similar to the first boxset but does not include the book and the packaging was slightly different. On November 23, 2011, an additional Limited-Edition boxset was released. On November 14, 2018, a &quot;Festivus Celebration Edition&quot; was released which contained napkins and cups, playing cards and thumb wrestle gadgets. On August 12, 2020, yet another &quot;Complete Series&quot; boxset was released.

The entire series was released on Blu-ray (in the cropped 16:9 aspect ratio) and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray (in the original 4:3 aspect ratio) on December 17, 2024.

===Syndication===
According to Barry Meyer, chairman of Warner Bros. Entertainment (parent company of Castle Rock Entertainment), &quot;Seinfeld&quot; made $2.7 billion through June 2010 through off-network syndication and cable syndication. the show had made an estimated $4.06 billion in syndication. Steve Bannon, who invested in the show, later said, &quot;We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication. We were wrong by a factor of five&quot;. In September 2019, it was announced that Viacom (now Paramount Global) had acquired cable syndication rights to the series from TBS, with it airing on Comedy Central beginning in October 2021, Nick at Nite from May 31, 2022, until November 12, 2022, and TV Land since February 11, 2023.

===High-definition versions===
There are two high-definition versions of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The first is that of the network TV (non-syndicated) versions in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 that were downscaled for the DVD releases. Clips from this high-definition version in its upscale were seen on NBC during &quot;The Seinfeld Story&quot; special. Syndicated broadcast stations and the cable networks TBS and Comedy Central (and also Fox) began airing the syndicated version of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in HD. Unlike the version used for the DVD, Sony Pictures cropped the top and bottom parts of the frame while restoring previously cropped images on the sides from the 35mm film source to use the entire 16:9 frame.

==After &quot;Seinfeld&quot;==

===Another scene===
On the November 1, 2007, episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, Jerry Seinfeld mentioned the possibility of shooting one last scene after the characters leave jail. He mentioned that he was too busy to do it at the time, but did not announce what the scene would entail, as its production is not a certainty. In a commentary from the final season DVD, Seinfeld outlines that he and Jason Alexander spoke about this scene being in Monk&#x27;s Cafe, with George saying &quot;That was brutal&quot; about the foursome&#x27;s stint in prison.

On an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for Jerry behind bars after being transferred to the fictional prison portrayed on the HBO series &quot;Oz&quot;. The roughly four-minute sketch shows the opening credits for the HBO series with clips of Jerry mixed in doing various activities around the prison. The sketch continues and mixes in different storylines from both &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and has Jerry interacting with various characters from the show in his typical quick-witted, sarcastic way.

===The &quot;Seinfeld&quot; &quot;curse&quot;===

Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards have all tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was canceled quickly, usually within the first season. This gave rise to the term &quot;Seinfeld curse&quot;: the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite the conventional wisdom that each person&#x27;s &quot;Seinfeld&quot; popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor&#x27;s new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the &quot;Seinfeld curse&quot; are Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s &quot;Watching Ellie&quot;, Jason Alexander&#x27;s &quot;Bob Patterson&quot; and &quot;Listen Up&quot;, and Michael Richards&#x27; &quot;The Michael Richards Show&quot;. This phenomenon was mentioned throughout the second season of Larry David&#x27;s HBO program &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, which aired in 2001. In real life, David has repeatedly dismissed the idea of a curse, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s so completely idiotic. It&#x27;s very hard to have a successful sitcom.&quot;

The success of Louis-Dreyfus in the 2006–2010 CBS sitcom &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;, which included winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2006, led many to believe that she had broken the curse. In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;m not somebody who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!&quot; The show produced enough episodes to air in reruns in syndication for several years, something the other shows did not achieve. The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Nevertheless, the series&#x27; ratings declined soon after, and it was canceled after the fifth season. She went on to win six further Emmys (for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series) for her acclaimed performance as Vice President Selina Meyer in the HBO comedy series &quot;Veep&quot;.

===&quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;===

Early in March 2009, it was announced that the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; cast would reunite for season seven of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. The cast first appeared in the third episode of the season, all playing fictional versions of themselves. The season-long story is that Larry David tries to initiate a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; reunion show as a ploy to win back his ex-wife, Cheryl. Along with the four main characters, some &quot;Seinfeld&quot; supporting actors like Wayne Knight, Estelle Harris and Steve Hytner appeared in the ninth episode at a table read for the reunion show. Although much dialogue in &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; is improvised, the plot was scripted, and the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; special that aired within the show was scripted and directed by &quot;Seinfeld&quot; regular Andy Ackerman, making this the first time since &quot;Seinfeld&quot; went off the air that the central cast appeared together in a scripted show.

===&quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;===

Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Wayne Knight, playing their respective &quot;Seinfeld&quot; characters, appeared in a spot presented during halftime of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. Fox came up with the idea of doing such a spot, due in part to the Super Bowl&#x27;s location being New York City adjacent that year. An uncut version appeared on Crackle.com immediately afterward, as an episode of &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot; titled &quot;The Over-Cheer,&quot; establishing Seinfeld&#x27;s character on the series as an older version of his &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character. Although the spot was used to advertise Seinfeld&#x27;s web series, it was not considered a commercial, as Sony, which produces the series, did not pay for it. While Seinfeld indicated that the webisode would probably be the last cast reunion, saying, &quot;I have a feeling you&#x27;ve seen the final coda on that very unique experience,&quot; since then, Michael Richards and Julia Louis-Dreyfus have also appeared in episodes.

<text>Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev ( ; ; 19 August 1929), also known as Serge Diaghilev, was a Russian art critic, patron, ballet impresario and founder of the Ballets Russes, from which many famous dancers and choreographers would arise.

Diaghilev&#x27;s career can be divided into two periods: in Saint Petersburg (1898–1906) and while as an emigrant (1906–1929).

== Biography ==
Sergei Diaghilev was born in Selishchi to a noble officer . His mother died from childbed fever soon after his birth. In 1873, Pavel met and married Elena Panaeva, who loved Sergei and raised him as her own child. The in Perm was a local cultural centre, and the Diaghilevs housed a musical evening every second Thursday, Modest Mussorgsky being one of the most frequent guests. Sergei Diaghilev composed his first romance at the age of 15. When he entered the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, he also had private music lessons with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Instead of the usual four, it took him six years to graduate. By his own admission, Diaghilev used his student years ‘to look around’ and find his true interests in life. Seven months after graduation he opened his first exhibition.

=== Life in Saint Petersburg ===
During his years at University, Diaghilev&#x27;s cousin Dmitry Filosofov introduced him to a circle of art-loving friends who called themselves The Nevsky Pickwickians. They included Alexandre Benois, Walter Nouvel, Konstantin Somov, and Léon Bakst. Although not instantly received into the group, Diaghilev was aided by Benois in developing his knowledge of Russian and Western art. In two years, he had voraciously absorbed this new obsession (even travelling abroad to further his studies) and came to be respected as one of the most learned of the group.

In the late 1890s, Diaghilev created several art exhibitions that were intended to introduce the contemporary artists to the local public and, later, to the Europeans. The exposition of British and German watercolorists in 1897 at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts became a huge success—one which Diaghilev repeated in 1898 with the exhibition of the Russian and Finnish artists at the Stieglitz Academy with the works of those such as Mikhail Vrubel, Valentin Serov, and Isaac Levitan. In the same year he opened an exhibition of young Russian painters in Germany. Though the young art connoisseur had no private fortune, he managed to gain the protection and support of such high nobility as the
Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and later even Nicholas II.

The Russian-Finnish exhibition of 1898 became the first action of the recently formed society ‘Mir iskusstva’, established by Benois and Diaghilev earlier that year. The group also included Konstantin Somov, Dmitry Filosofov, Léon Bakst, and Eugene Lansere. Soon, with the help of Savva Mamontov (the director of the Russian Private Opera Company) and Princess Maria Tenisheva, the group founded the journal &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; (World of Art). The magazine was intended to serve ‘the god Apollo’ and promote modern art. The first issue was released in February 1898. As recalled by Benois, Diaghilev, as the art director, created the style and designed the publication, wrote critical essays, and, in 1904, published a monograph on Dmitry Levitzky. Nevertheless, Benois remembered him as the member of &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; least interested in philosophy and literature, frequently revealing huge gaps in his knowledge of the classics.

On 6 March 1905, he opened an exhibition of the ‘Russian portraits of the 18th and 19th centuries’ at the Tauride Palace with more than 4000 paintings collected from 450 owners. Diaghilev himself travelled to acquire the portraits and wrote a catalogue of 2300 art works with information on the artists, models, and other relevant data. The exposition, designed by Benois, was an innovative example of art synthesis and greatly impressed the visitors. The paintings were combined into groups and accompanied with notes, and the interiors were decorated differently in order to emphasize their meanings and double the effect. The exhibition enjoyed enormous success and raised Diaghilev to the top of art and society elite.

Passionate to promote Russian art abroad, in 1906, Diaghilev organized and opened the ‘Two Centuries of the Russian art and Sculpture’ exposition at Salon d&#x27;Automne. It included 750 works from 103 authors, from modern artists to the ancient icons. The exhibition was designed by Léon Bakst and occupied 12 rooms in the Grand Palais. It, too, enjoyed enormous success and in many ways paved the way for the future success of the Ballet Russe. France was soon immersed in fashion à la russe. Diaghilev was offered the Legion of Honour award, but refused in honour of Bakst.

=== Imperial Theaters ===

In 1899, Prince Serge Wolkonsky received directorship of all Imperial theaters. On 10 September 1899, he gave Diaghilev the post of officer on special duty. The post was usually a nominal one, but since Diaghilev managed to actively engage into the theatrical world, he was soon made responsible for the production of the Annual of the Imperial Theaters. As editor-in-chief, he reformed the edition and converted it into a full-scale luxurious magazine with critical essays, playbills, articles about artists and lots of pictures. Diaghilev even changed the paper to print the issues. He invited many of his fellow members in &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; to work on the magazine, design fonts and create illustrations. He also showed himself as a successful promoter by finding sponsors, advertisers, and new distribution channels. As recalled by Benois, the success of the magazine went to Sergey’s head and very soon he was thinking about himself as ‘the only one, without whom nothing can be done.

At that time Diaghilev started frequent visits to repetitions of the Imperial Ballet. His appearance as a dandy with a grey lock amazed the ballerinas, who soon nicknamed him ‘Chinchilla’. He was especially interested in young Mathilde Kschessinska, who was flattered by the attention of an already famous art connoisseur. Even though they would fight later and temporarily break contact, the friendship would last through all their lives.

Diaghilev brought the members of &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; with him to the Imperial theatres. Apollinary Vasnetsov, Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst, Valentin Serov, Eugene Lansere and other contemporary artists began working on decorations and costumes. In 1900, Prince Serge Wolkonsky entrusted Diaghilev with the staging of Léo Delibes&#x27; ballet Sylvia, a favorite of Benois. The two collaborators concocted an elaborate production plan that startled the established personnel of the Imperial Theatres. After several increasingly antagonistic differences of opinion, Diaghilev refused to go on editing the Annual of the Imperial Theatres and was discharged by Volkonsky in 1901. However, the scandal also ruined Wolkonsky’s career; in a week, he was similarly fired. By that time, even the Emperor, persuaded by Kschessinska, took Diaghilev’s side. Sergei didn’t think much of a civil servant career, so he went abroad and immersed in his other plans.

==Ballets Russes==
=== Concerts historiques russes ===
The success of the 1906 exhibition inspired Diaghilev to present Russian music to the world’s culture capitals such as Paris. In 1907, he organised ‘Concerts historiques russes’ with famous composers like Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Glazunov, Feodor Chaliapin, and Félia Litvinne. The tour was supported and sponsored by Diaghilev’s royal patrons Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In the spring of 1908, Diaghilev mounted a production of Mussorgsky&#x27;s Boris Godunov, starring Feodor Chaliapin, at the Paris Opéra. Boris Anisfeld created the sets, designed by Bakst and Benois. To maximize authenticity, one of the artists Ivan Bilibin even travelled to Arkhangelsk Oblast to purchase the costumes. The tour became a sensation and the success was overwhelming, however, financially, it was unprofitable and ended with a loss of 85,000 francs.

=== Ballets Russes ===

By 1909, Diaghilev was at odds with Kschessinska, and the Russian state treasury refused to finance the future tours. Sergei turned for help to his other friend, Misia Sert. Due to her efforts, the company ended up being able to rent the Théâtre du Châtelet, which was less prestigious than the Palais Garnier. At that time, Diaghilev was rather skeptical about ballet; he said that ‘anyone with no special wit can enjoy it, there is no sense or subject in ballet’. Serge Lifar recalled that to the end of his days Diaghilev referred to the corps-de-ballet dancers as ‘a herd of cattle’. Nevertheless, in 1909 the very first ballet Saison Russe took place and its success overwhelmed even the artists themselves. The first season included Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide, Polovtsian Dances, Nuit d’Egypte, Les Sylphides, and operas Boris Godunov, The Maid of Pskov and the first part of the Ruslan and Lyudmila. The ballets followed the operas and were performed after the second intermission. Leading dancers Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Ida Rubinstein, Mikhail Mordkin immediately became world-known stars. Diaghilev’s innovation was to synthesize dance, music and visual arts with set decorations and costumes into a single performance.

During these years, Diaghilev&#x27;s stagings included several compositions by the late Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, such as the operas &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot;, &quot;May Night&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;. His balletic adaptation of the orchestral suite &quot;Sheherazade&quot;, staged in 1910, drew the ire of the composer&#x27;s widow, Nadezhda Rimskaya-Korsakova, who protested in open letters to Diaghilev published in the periodical &quot;Rech.&quot; Diaghilev commissioned ballet music from composers such as Nikolai Tcherepnin (&quot;Narcisse et Echo&quot;, 1911), Claude Debussy (&quot;Jeux&quot;, 1913), Maurice Ravel (&quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, 1912), Erik Satie (&quot;Parade&quot;, 1917), Manuel de Falla (&quot;El Sombrero de Tres Picos&quot;, 1917), Richard Strauss (&quot;Josephslegende&quot;, 1914), Sergei Prokofiev (&quot;Ala and Lolli&quot;, 1915, rejected by Diaghilev and turned into the &quot;Scythian Suite&quot;; &quot;Chout&quot;, 1915 revised 1920; &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot;, 1926; and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, 1929); Ottorino Respighi (&quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot;, 1919); Francis Poulenc (&quot;Les biches&quot;, 1923) and others. His choreographer Michel Fokine often adapted the music for ballet. Diaghilev also worked with dancer and ballet master Léonide Massine. He played a decisive role in the career of Sergey Prokofiev.

The artistic director for the Ballets Russes was Léon Bakst. Together they developed a more complicated form of ballet with show-elements intended to appeal to the general public, rather than solely the aristocracy. The exotic appeal of the Ballets Russes had an effect on Fauvist painters and the nascent Art Deco style. Coco Chanel is said to have stated that &quot;Diaghilev invented Russia for foreigners.&quot; [Rhonda K. Garelick].

Perhaps Diaghilev&#x27;s most notable composer-collaborator, however, was Igor Stravinsky. Diaghilev heard Stravinsky&#x27;s early orchestral works &quot;Fireworks&quot; and &quot;Scherzo fantastique&quot;, and was impressed enough to ask Stravinsky to arrange some pieces by Chopin for the Ballets Russes. In 1910, he commissioned his first score from Stravinsky, &quot;The Firebird&quot;. &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911) and &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913) followed shortly afterwards, and the two also worked together on &quot;Les noces&quot; (1923) and &quot;Pulcinella&quot; (1920) together with Picasso, who designed the costumes and the set.

=== Late years ===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Diaghilev stayed abroad. Once it became obvious that he could not be lured back, the new Soviet regime condemned him in perpetuity as an especially insidious example of &quot;bourgeois decadence&quot;. Soviet art historians wrote him out of the picture for more than 60 years.

Diaghilev made Boris Kochno his secretary in 1920 and staged Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in London in 1921; it was a production of remarkable magnificence in both settings and costumes, but, despite being well received by the public, it was a financial disaster for Diaghilev and Oswald Stoll, the theatre-owner who had backed it. The first cast included the legendary ballerina Olga Spessivtseva and Lubov Egorova in the role of Aurora. Diaghilev insisted on calling the ballet &quot;The Sleeping Princess&quot;. When asked why, he quipped, &quot;Because I have no beauties!&quot; The later years of the Ballets Russes were often considered too &quot;intellectual&quot;, too &quot;stylish&quot; and seldom had the unconditional success of the first few seasons, although younger choreographers like George Balanchine hit their stride with the Ballets Russes.

The start of the 20th century brought a development in the handling of tonality, harmony, rhythm and meter towards more freedom. Until that time, rigid harmonic schemes had forced rhythmic patterns to stay fairly uncomplicated. Around the turn of the century, however, harmonic and metric devices became either more rigid, or much more unpredictable, and each approach had a liberating effect on rhythm, which also affected ballet. Diaghilev was a pioneer in adapting these new musical styles to modern ballet. When Ravel used a time in the final part of his ballet &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; (1912), dancers of the Ballets Russes sang &quot;Ser-gei-dia-ghi-lev&quot; during rehearsals to keep the correct rhythm.

Members of Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes later went on to found ballet traditions in the United States (George Balanchine) and England (Ninette de Valois and Marie Rambert). Ballet master Serge Lifar went on a technical revival at the Paris Opera Ballet, enhanced by Claude Bessy and Rudolf Nureyev in the 1980s. Lifar is credited for saving many Jewish and other minority dancers from the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. After dancing with the Ballets Russes in 1925, Ruth Page emerged as a founder of her own ballet troupes based in Chicago, including the Chicago Opera Ballet.

== Personal life ==
Diaghilev&#x27;s life and the Ballets Russes were inextricably entwined. His most famous lover was Vaslav Nijinsky. However, according to Serge Lifar, of all Diaghilev&#x27;s lovers, only Léonide Massine, who replaced Nijinsky, provided him with &quot;so many moments of happiness or anguish&quot;. Diaghilev&#x27;s other lovers included Anton Dolin, Serge Lifar and his secretary and librettist Boris Kochno.

Nijinsky&#x27;s later bitter comments about Diaghilev inspired a mention in W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem &quot;September 1, 1939&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
What mad Nijinsky wrote
About Diaghilev
Is true of the normal heart;
For the error bred in the bone
Of each woman and each man
Craves what it cannot have,
Not universal love
But to be loved alone.&lt;/poem&gt;

Diaghilev dismissed Nijinsky summarily from the Ballets Russes after the dancer&#x27;s marriage to Romola de Pulszky in 1913. Nijinsky appeared again with the company, but the old relationship between the men was never re-established; moreover, Nijinsky&#x27;s magic as a dancer was much diminished by incipient mental illness. Their last meeting was after Nijinsky&#x27;s mind had given way, and he appeared not to recognise his former lover.

Diaghilev was known as a hard, demanding, even frightening taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too afraid to ever look him in the face. George Balanchine said Diaghilev carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballets Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev &quot;Sergypops&quot;, and that he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.

Dancers such as Alicia Markova, Tamara Karsavina, Serge Lifar, and Lydia Sokolova remembered Diaghilev fondly as a stern but kind father-figure who put the needs of his dancers and company above his own. He lived from paycheck to paycheck to finance his company, and though he spent considerable amounts of money on a splendid collection of rare books at the end of his life, many people noticed that his impeccably cut suits had frayed cuffs and trouser-ends. Several sources have cited Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes as inspiration for the 1948 film &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Throughout his life, Diaghilev was severely afraid of dying in water, and avoided traveling by boat. He died of diabetes in Venice on 19 August 1929, and his tomb is on the nearby island of San Michele, near to the grave of Stravinsky, in the Orthodox section.

The Ekstrom Collection of the Diaghilev and Stravinsky Foundation is held by the Department of Theatre and Performance of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Diaghilev was played by Alan Bates in the 1980 movie &quot;Nijinsky&quot;, and the Contemporary Art Museum in Saint Petersburg State University is named after him.

<text>Soong Mei-ling (also spelled Soong May-ling; March 4, 1898 – October 23, 2003), also known as Madame Chiang (), was a Chinese political figure. The youngest of the Soong sisters, she married Chiang Kai-shek and played a prominent role in Chinese politics and foreign relations in the first half of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Soong Mei-ling was born in the Song family home, a traditional house called Neishidi (內史第), in Pudong, Shanghai, China. Her passport issued by the Qing government showed that she was born on 4 March 1898. Some sources said she was born on 5 March 1898 at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Shanghai, while others gave the year as 1897, since Chinese tradition considers one to be a year old at birth.

She was the fourth of six children of Charlie Soong, a wealthy businessman and former Methodist missionary from Hainan, and his wife Ni Kwei-tseng (). Mei-ling&#x27;s siblings were eldest sister Ai-ling, second sister Ching-ling, who later became Madame Sun Yat-sen, elder brother Tse-ven, usually known as T. V. Soong, and younger brothers Tse-liang (T.L.) and Tse-an (T.A.). 

==Education==

In Shanghai, Mei-ling attended the McTyeire School for Girls with her sister, Ching-ling. Their father, who had studied in the United States, arranged to have them continue their education in the US in 1907. Mei-ling and Ching-ling attended a private school in Summit, New Jersey. In 1908, Ching-ling was accepted by her sister Ai-ling&#x27;s alma mater, Wesleyan College, at age 15 and both sisters moved to Macon, Georgia, to join Ai-ling. Mei-ling insisted she have her way and be allowed to accompany her older sister though she was only ten, which she did. Mei-ling spent the year in Demorest, Georgia, with Ai-ling&#x27;s Wesleyan friend, Blanche Moss, who enrolled Mei-ling as an 8th grader at Piedmont College. In 1909, Wesleyan&#x27;s newly appointed president, William Newman Ainsworth, gave her permission to stay at Wesleyan and assigned her tutors. She briefly attended Fairmount College in Monteagle, Tennessee in 1910.

Mei-ling was officially registered as a freshman at Wesleyan in 1912 at the age of 15. She then transferred to Wellesley College two years later to be closer to her older brother, T. V., who, at the time, was studying at Harvard. By then, both her sisters had graduated and returned to Shanghai. She graduated from Wellesley as one of the 33 &quot;Durant Scholars&quot; on June 19, 1917, with a major in English literature and minor in philosophy. She was also a member of Tau Zeta Epsilon, Wellesley&#x27;s Arts and Music Society. As a result of her American education, she spoke excellent English, with a southern accent which helped her connect with American audiences.

==Madame Chiang==

Soong Mei-ling met Chiang Kai-shek in 1920. Since he was eleven years her elder, already married, and a Buddhist, Mei-ling&#x27;s mother vehemently opposed the marriage between the two, but finally agreed after Chiang showed proof of his divorce and promised to convert to Christianity. Chiang told his future mother-in-law that he could not convert immediately, because religion needed to be gradually absorbed, not swallowed like a pill. They married in Shanghai on December 1, 1927. Although biographers regard the marriage with varying appraisals of partnership, love, politics and competition, it lasted 48 years. The couple had no children.

Madame Chiang initiated the New Life Movement and became actively engaged in Chinese politics. As her husband rose to become generalissimo and leader of the Kuomintang, Madame Chiang acted as his English translator, secretary and advisor. In 1928, she was made a member of the Committee of Yuans by Chiang. She was a member of the Legislative Yuan from 1930 to 1932 and Secretary-General of the Chinese Aeronautical Affairs Commission from 1936 to 1938. In 1937 she led appeals to women to support the Second Sino-Japanese War, which led to the establishment of women&#x27;s battalions, such as the Guangxi Women&#x27;s Battalion.

In 1934, Soong Mei-ling was given a villa in Kuling town, Mount Lu. Chiang Kai-shek named the villa &quot;Mei Lu Villa&quot; to symbolize the beauty of the mountain. The couple usually stayed at this villa in summertime, so the mountain is called Summer Capital, and the villa is called the Summer Palace.

During World War II, Madame Chiang promoted the Chinese cause and tried to build a legacy for her husband. Well versed in both Chinese and Western culture, she became popular both in China and abroad.

In 1945 she became a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.

==&quot;Warphans&quot;==

Although Soong Mei-ling initially avoided the public eye after marrying Chiang, she soon began an ambitious social welfare project to establish schools for the orphans of Chinese soldiers. The orphanages were well-appointed: with playgrounds, hotels, swimming pools, a gymnasium, model classrooms, and dormitories. Soong Mei-ling was deeply involved in the project and even picked all of the teachers herself. There were two schools – one for boys and one for girls—built on a site at the foot of Purple Mountain, in Nanjing. She referred to these children as her &quot;warphans&quot; and made them a personal cause. The fate of the children of fallen soldiers became a much more important issue in China after the beginning of the war with Japan in 1937. In order to better provide for these children she established the Chinese Women&#x27;s National War Relief Society.

==Visits to the U.S.==

Soong Mei-ling made several tours to the United States to lobby support for the Nationalists&#x27; war effort. She drew crowds as large as 30,000 people and in 1943 made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for a third time. She had earlier appeared on the October 26, 1931, cover alongside her husband and on the January 3, 1937, cover with her husband as &quot;Man and Wife of the Year&quot;.

Soong dressed ostentatiously during her tours to seek foreign aid, bringing dozens of suitcases filled with Chanel handbags, pearl-decorated shoes, and other luxury garments on a visit to the White House. Soong&#x27;s approach shocked United States First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and prompted resentment from many officials in the Republic of China government.

Arguably showing the impact of her visits, in 1943, the United States Women&#x27;s Army Corps recruited a unit of Chinese-American women to serve with the Army Air Forces as &quot;Air WACs&quot;, referred to as the &quot;Madame Chiang Kai-Shek Air WAC unit&quot;.

Both Soong Mei-ling and her husband were on good terms with &quot;Time&quot; magazine senior editor and co-founder Henry Luce, who frequently tried to rally money and support from the American public for the Republic of China. On February 18, 1943, she became the first Chinese national and the second woman to address both houses of the US Congress. After the defeat of her husband&#x27;s government in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Madame Chiang followed her husband to Taiwan, while her sister Soong Ching-ling stayed in mainland China, siding with the communists. Madame Chiang continued to play a prominent international role. She was a Patron of the International Red Cross Committee, honorary chair of the British United Aid to China Fund, and First Honorary Member of the Bill of Rights Commemorative Society.

==Allegations of corruption==
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Soong&#x27;s family embezzled $20 million. During this period, the Nationalist Government&#x27;s revenues were less than $30 million per year. One of the key reasons was that Soong Mei-ling ignored her family&#x27;s involvement in corruption. The Soong family&#x27;s eldest son, T.V. Soong, was the Chinese premier finance minister, and the eldest daughter, Soong Ai-ling, was the wife of Kung Hsiang-hsi, the wealthiest man in China. The second daughter, Soong Ching-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China&#x27;s founding father. The youngest daughter, Soong Mei-ling, married Chiang in 1927, and following the marriage, the two families became intimately connected, creating the &quot;Soong dynasty&quot; and the &quot;Four Families&quot;. However, Soong was also credited for her campaign for women&#x27;s rights in China, including her attempts to improve the education, culture, and social benefits of Chinese women. Critics have said that the &quot;Four Families&quot; monopolized the regime and looted it. The US sent considerable aid to the Nationalist government but soon realized the widespread corruption. Military supplies that were sent appeared on the black market. Large sums of money that had been transmitted through T. V. Soong, China&#x27;s finance minister, soon disappeared. President Truman famously referred to the Nationalist leaders, &quot;They&#x27;re thieves, every damn one of them.&quot; He also said, &quot;They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it&#x27;s invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.&quot; Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling lived luxurious lifestyles and held millions in property, clothes, art, and jewelry. Soong Ai-ling and Soong Mei-ling were also the two richest women in China. Despite living a luxurious life for almost her entire life, Soong Mei-ling left only a $120,000 inheritance, and the reason, according to her niece, was that she donated most of her wealth when she was still alive. 

During Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s enforcement campaign in Shanghai after the war, Chiang Ching-kuo arrested her nephew David Kung and several employees of the Yangtze Development Corporation on allegations of holding foreign exchange. Mei-ling called Chiang Kai-shek to complain and also called Chiang Ching-Kuo directly. Kung was eventually freed after negotiations.

==Alleged tryst with Wendell Willkie==
There were allegations that Mei-ling had a tryst with Wendell Willkie, who had been the Republican candidate for president in 1940 and came to Chongqing on a world tour in 1942. The two are said to have left an official reception and gone to one of her private apartments. When Chiang Kai-shek noticed their absence, he gathered his bodyguards, who were armed with machine-guns, marched through the streets, and ransacked her apartment without finding the couple. She is said to have passionately kissed Willkie at the airport the next day and offered to come with him to the United States.

Scholars dismiss the allegations as weakly sourced, implausible, and even impossible. Jay Taylor&#x27;s biography of Chiang points out that this infidelity was uncharacteristic of Mei-ling, and that it would have been unlikely for such a major commotion to go unnoticed. In a 2016 review of the evidence Perry Johansson dismisses the allegation entirely, as it was based on the later memory of one person, and he further cites the work of China historian Yang Tianshi. Yang reviewed the official schedules and newspaper accounts of Willkie&#x27;s visit and found that there was no time or place where the alleged events could have taken place. He also found no mention of it in Chiang&#x27;s detailed private diaries.

==Later life==

After the death of her husband in 1975, Madame Chiang assumed a low profile. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1975 and would undergo two mastectomies in Taiwan. She also had an ovarian tumor removed in 1991.

Chang Hsien-yi claimed that Soong Mei-ling and military officials loyal to her expedited the development of nuclear weapons and even set up a parallel chain of command to further their agenda.

Chiang Kai-shek was succeeded to power by his eldest son Chiang Ching-kuo, from a previous marriage, with whom Madame Chiang had rocky relations. In 1975, she emigrated from Taiwan to her family&#x27;s 36 acre (14.6 hectare) estate in Lattingtown, New York, where she kept a portrait of her late husband in full military regalia in her living room. She kept a residence in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where she vacationed in the summer. Madame Chiang returned to Taiwan upon Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s death in 1988, to shore up support among her old allies. However, Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s successor, Lee Teng-hui, proved more adept at politics than she was, and consolidated his position. She again returned to the U.S. and made a rare public appearance in 1995 when she attended a reception held on Capitol Hill in her honor in connection with celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Madame Chiang made her last visit to Taiwan in 1995. In the 2000 Presidential Election on Taiwan, the Kuomintang produced a letter from her in which she purportedly supported the KMT candidate Lien Chan over independent candidate James Soong (no relation). James Soong never disputed the authenticity of the letter. Soong sold her Long Island estate in 2000 and spent the rest of her life in the 10 Gracie Square apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan owned by her niece. An open house viewing of the estate drew many Taiwanese expatriates. When Madame Chiang was 103 years old, she had an exhibition of her Chinese paintings in New York.

==Death==
Madame Chiang died in her sleep in New York City, in her Manhattan apartment on October 23, 2003, at the age of 105. Her remains were interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, pending an eventual burial with her late husband who was entombed in Cihu, Taiwan. The stated intention is to have them both buried in mainland China once political differences are resolved.

Upon her death, the White House released a statement:
Jia Qinglin, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), sent a telegram to Soong&#x27;s relatives where he expressed deep condolences on her death.

===Appraisals by the international press===

The &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary wrote:
&quot;Life&quot; magazine called Madame the &quot;most powerful woman in the world&quot; while &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine described her as &quot;the real brains and boss of the Chinese government.&quot; Writer and diplomat Clare Boothe Luce, wife of &quot;Time&quot; publisher Henry Luce, once compared her to Joan of Arc and Florence Nightingale. Author Ernest Hemingway called her the &quot;empress&quot; of China.

==Awards and honors==
** Grand Cross of Order of the Sun of Peru (1961)
** Order of Merit for National Foundation, 1st class (1966)

== In popular culture ==
Her tour to San Francisco is mentioned (under the name Madame Chiang) in &quot;Last Night at the Telegraph Club&quot;, a 2021 novel by Malinda Lo. She also appears in &quot;Cooking for Madame Chiang&quot; in &quot;Dear Chrysanthemums&quot; (Scribner, 2023), a novel in stories by Fiona Sze-Lorrain.

<text>The Soong sisters, Soong Ai-ling, Soong Ching-ling, and Soong Mei-ling, were three prominent women in modern Chinese history. Of Hakka descent, with ancestral roots in Wenchang, Hainan, they were raised as Christians in Shanghai and educated in the United States. All three sisters married powerful men, respectively, from eldest to youngest, H. H. Kung, Sun Yat Sen, and Chiang Kai-shek. Along with their husbands, they became among China&#x27;s most significant political figures of the early 20th century. 

Their father was American-educated Methodist minister Charlie Soong, who made a fortune in banking and printing. Their mother was Ni Kwei-tseng, also a Methodist who came from an Episcopalian family. All three sisters attended Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, United States. Mei-ling, however, left Wesleyan and eventually graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Their three brothers were all high-ranking officials in the Republic of China government, one of whom was T. V. Soong.

Their life stories have been summarized in a saying, sometimes attributed to Mao Zedong: &quot;One loved money, one loved power, one loved her country&quot;, referring to Ai-ling, Mei-ling, and Ching-ling in that order.

==History==

=== Early life ===

Charlie Soong, the father of the Soong sisters, was born in Wenchang, Hainan, in 1866, with the birth name Han Chiao Shun. He initially traveled to Java with his brother before being adopted by his uncle, who took them to Boston, United States, where Charlie worked as a shop assistant. His name was misunderstood by Americans as Charlie Soon and later became Charlie Soong.

In Boston, Charlie met New Shan-chow and , frequent visitors to the shop, who encouraged him to pursue further education. In 1879, he fled the store and boarded the USS &quot;Albert Gallatin&quot; of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, where he was adopted by Captain Eric Gabrielson. Charlie became a Christian in Wilmington in 1880, becoming the first baptised Chinese person in North Carolina. With the support of a local church, he studied at Trinity College and later Vanderbilt University.

He returned to China as a missionary in 1885 and later married Ni Kwei-tseng, a match arranged by Wen Bing-chung. The couple initially engaged in missionary work and business in Kunshan, later continuing their missionary efforts in Chuansha. Their first daughter, Ai-ling, was born on 15 July 1889 in Kunshan, followed by two more daughters, Ching-ling and Mei-ling, as well as three sons, Tse-ven (T. V.), Tse-liang (T. L.) and Tse-an (T. A.). Charlie resigned from the mission in 1892, due to insufficient fund to support his family and became a successful businessperson for printing the Bible.

Charlie was deeply committed to education in the United States for his daughters. He wanted them to receive a Methodist education, so he enrolled them at McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai, where Ching-ling studied from 1904 to 1907. Acting on the advice of his missionary friend William Burke, who had ties to the Mulberry Street United Methodist Church in Macon, Charlie sent his eldest daughter Ai-ling to Wesleyan College in 1904.

Ching-ling and Mei-ling was among the first government-funded female Chinese students to study in the United States. The group, consisting of ten male and four female students, departed from Shanghai on 1 August 1907 and arrived in Seattle on 28 August, under the escort of , the director of the Foreign Office of the Viceroy of Liangjiang. Ching-ling first attended school in Summit, New Jersey, to study Latin and French to fulfil Wesleyan&#x27;s entrance requirements. She joined Ai-ling as a full-time college student at Wesleyan in the autumn of 1908, with their youngest sister Mei-ling accompanying them despite being only ten years old.

Although the Soong sisters spent most of their time on campus, they also travelled across the United States, navigating the prevailing anti-Chinese sentiments of the time. They were warmly received by local communities in the American South. In the summer of 1910, Ching-ling and Mei-ling attended summer school together at Fairmount College. In the summer of 1912, they participated in a church-sponsored YMCA conference in Montreat, North Carolina. During several Christmas holidays, they visited Washington, D.C., where they were hosted as guests of the Chinese ambassador.

=== Marriage ===

After graduating, Ching-ling&#x27;s elder sister, Ai-ling, returned to Shanghai in 1908 and became the secretary to Sun Yat-sen. Sun became fascinated with Ai-ling, constantly gazing at her, although Ai-ling did not reciprocate his feelings in the same way. Ching-ling graduated from Wesleyan in 1913, and returned to China via Yokohama, Japan, where she met Sun. Ai-ling resigned in 1914 to marry H. H. Kung, passing the position on to Ching-ling, who admired Sun as the hero who founded the Chinese Republic. In the summer of 1915, Ching-ling returned to Shanghai, asking her parents for their permission to marry Sun, which shocked the family. Ching-ling was confined at home in Shanghai, during which Sun divorced with his wife Lu Mu-zhen.

Despite objections from her father, Ching-ling married Sun Yat-sen on 25 October 1915. There were limited witnesses in their wedding ceremony in Tokyo, which included Wada Mizu, who provided his home for the wedding,  Liao Zhong-kai and Liao&#x27;s 11-year-old daughter Cynthia. The Soong family chased Ching-ling to Tokyo, attempting to dissuade her from the marriage, with her father Charlie even appealing to the Japanese government to denounce Sun. Additionally, many of Sun’s colleagues did not acknowledge Ching-ling as his wife, referring to her as Miss Soong rather than Mrs Sun. 

During a visit to Sun&#x27;s residence in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek encountered Ching-ling&#x27;s younger sister, Mei-ling, for the first time and became enamoured with her. Subsequently, Chiang divorced his wife in Fenghua and sought Sun&#x27;s counsel on pursuing Mei-ling. When Sun consulted Ching-ling on the matter, she expressed her strong disapproval. Sun then advised Chiang to wait, and Chiang obeyed. In 1927, Mei-ling married Chiang, who was about to launch a purge against the CCP. Ching-ling protested and left China after the purge.

=== Reunion in the war ===

In 1937, when the Second Sino-Japanese war broke out, all three of them got together after a 10-year separation in an effort to unite the Kuomintang and Communists against the Imperial Japanese army. Soong Ai-ling devoted herself to social work such as helping wounded soldiers, refugees and orphans. She donated five ambulances and 37 trucks to the army in Shanghai and the air force, along with 500 leather uniforms. When the Japanese occupied Nanjing and Wuhan, the three sisters moved to Hong Kong. In 1940, they returned to Chongqing and established the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, which opened job opportunities for people through weaving, sewing and other crafts. The sisters frequently visited schools, hospitals, orphanages, air raid shelters and aided war torn communities along the way.

=== Break-up and deaths ===
In 1944, Soong Ai-ling left China for Brazil to receive medical treatment and later settled in the United States in 1946. In November 1948, Soong Mei-ling travelled to the United States to seek support for her husband, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang. In May 1949, she wrote to Soong Ching-ling, asking if there was anything she could do for her sister in China. This letter marked the last communication between Mei-ling and Ching-ling. Following the Kuomintang&#x27;s defeat in the Chinese Civil War, Mei-ling arrived in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1950, while Ching-ling remained on the mainland and joined the Communist-led government. In 1957, Ching-ling wrote to Ai-ling, requesting her to return to China.

In 1969, Ai-ling and Mei-ling attended the funeral of their brother T. A. Soong in San Francisco, but Ching-ling was absent. In 1971, T. V. Soong passed away in San Francisco, and his funeral was scheduled to take place in New York. Mei-ling flew from Taiwan to Hawaii for a stopover, during which Chiang Kai-shek urged her to cancel her trip. She later learned that the Communist Chinese government had informed the U.S. government of Ching-ling’s intention to attend the funeral in New York. Consequently, Mei-ling and Ai-ling both cancelled their trips, and none of the sisters attended their brother&#x27;s funeral. Ai-ling died in New York in 1973. Ching-ling had planned to reunite with Mei-ling in Japan before her death, which did not come true.

In 1981, Ching-ling fell critically ill. Her family sent a telegram to Mei-ling, hoping for a reunion. Mei-ling responded, suggesting that Ching-ling be sent to New York, United States instead. As a potential family reunion in Beijing was seen as a threat to the legitimacy of her stepson, Taiwanese President Chiang Ching-kuo. Xinhua noted that other family members were present at the time of Soong&#x27;s passing, she did not reunite with her sister. She was later invited by the Communist Chinese government for the funeral, but she told Chiang Ching-kuo, her stepson, that she would not come. Deng Xiaoping mentioned that Soong, the aunt of Chiang Ching-kuo, had expressed hope for reunification talks between the governments of Beijing and Taipei in the near future.

Ching-ling was buried in the Soong family graveyard in June. In January 1984, the cemetery was re-organised as the Mausoleum of Soong Ching Ling, Honorary Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which came under state protection in February 1982. Before Mei-ling died in 2003, she had refused to be buried in Taiwan and hoped to be buried with her parents in Shanghai, which was not acceptable for the Kuomintang. As a result, she was buried in the United States instead.

<doc id="28611" wikidata="Q131178" url="?curid=28611" title="Second Epistle of Peter">
<text>2 Peter, also known as the Second Epistle of Peter and abbreviated as 2 Pet., is an epistle of the New Testament written in Koine Greek. It identifies the author as &quot;Simon Peter&quot; (in some translations, &#x27;Simeon&#x27; or &#x27;Shimon&#x27;), a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ&quot; (). The epistle is traditionally attributed to Peter the Apostle, but most scholars consider the epistle pseudepigraphical (i.e., authored by one or more of Peter&#x27;s followers, using Peter as a pseudonym) Scholars estimate the date of authorship anywhere from AD 60 to 150.

== Authorship and date ==

According to the Epistle itself, it was composed by the Apostle Peter, an eyewitness to Jesus&#x27; ministry. says &quot;This is now the second letter I have written to you&quot;; if this is an allusion to 1 Peter, then the audience of the epistle may have been the same as it was for 1 Peter, namely, various churches in Asia Minor (see ).

The date of composition has proven to be difficult to determine. Taken literally, it would have been written around AD 64–68, as Christian tradition holds Peter was martyred in the 60s by Nero, and also because Peter references his approaching death in (&quot;since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me&quot;).
The questions of authorship and date are closely related. Scholars consider the epistle to have been written anywhere between c. AD 60–150, with &quot;some reason to favour&quot; a date between 80 and 90. Dates suggested by various authors include:

* c. 60 (Charles Bigg)
* 63 (Giese, Wohlenberg) 
* 64 – 110 (Davids)
*Mid 60s (Harvey and Towner, M. Green, Moo, Mounce)
* c. 70 or 80 (Chaine) 
* 75 – 100 (Bauckham, perhaps about 80–90)
* 80 – 90 (Duff)
* c. 90 (Reicke, Spicq)
*Late first or early second century (Perkins, Harrington, Werse)
* c. 100 (Schelkle)
* 100 – 110 (Knoch, Kelly)
* 100 – 125 (James, Vogtle, Paulsen) 
* 100 – 140 (Callan, perhaps about 125) 
* 130 (Raymond E. Brown, Sidebottom)
* 150 (L. Harris)

The scholarly debate can be divided into two parts: external and internal evidence. The external evidence for its authenticity, although feasible, remains open to criticism. (There is debate as to whether 2 Peter is being quoted or the other way around.) Much of this debate derives from Professor Robert E. Picirilli&#x27;s article &quot;Allusion to 2 Peter in the Apostolic Fathers,&quot; which compiles many of the allusions by the Apostolic Fathers of the late first and early second centuries, thus demonstrating that 2 Peter is not to be considered a second-century document. Despite this effort, scholars such as Michael J. Gilmour, who consider Picirilli&#x27;s evidences to be correct, disagree with classifying the work as authentic but rather as a pseudepigrapha, arguing among many other things that Paul () had to warn against contemporary pseudo-Pauline writers.

The internal debate focuses more on its style, its ideology, and its relationship to the other works and stories. Some of the internal arguments against the authenticity of 2 Peter have gained significant popularity since the 1980s. One such argument is the argument that the scholar Bo Reicke first formulated in 1964, where he argued that 2 Peter is clearly an example of an ancient literary genre known as a &#x27;testament&#x27;, which originally arose from Moses&#x27; farewell discourse in Deuteronomy. Richard J. Bauckham, who popularized this argument, wrote that the &#x27;testament&#x27; genre contains two main elements: ethical warnings to be followed after the death of the writer and revelations of the future. The significant fact about the &#x27;testament&#x27; genre was not in its markers but in its nature; it is argued that a piece of &#x27;testament&#x27; literature is meant to &quot;be a completely transparent fiction.&quot; This argument has its detractors, who classify it as a syllogism. Others characterize the writing as a &#x27;farewell speech&#x27; because it lacks any semblance of final greetings or ties with recipients.

One of the questions to be resolved is 2 Peter&#x27;s relationship with the Pauline letters since it refers to the Pauline epistles and so must postdate at least some of them, regardless of authorship. Thus, a date before AD 60 is improbable. Further, it goes as far as to name the Pauline epistles as &quot;scripture&quot;—one of only two times a New Testament work refers to another New Testament work in this way—implying that it postdates them by some time. Various hypotheses have been put forward to improve or resolve this issue; one notable hypothesis is that the First Epistle of Clement (c. AD 96), by citing as Scripture several of the Pauline letters, was inspired by 2 Peter because it was considered authentic. This would mean that even the recipients of 1 Clement, the inhabitants of Corinth, would have also considered it authentic, which would indicate that the letter must have been in circulation long before that time. The earliest reference to a Pauline collection is probably found in Ignatius of Antioch around AD 108.

Another debate is about its linguistic complexity and its relationship with 1 Peter. According to the scholar Bart D. Ehrman, the historical Peter could not have written any works, either because he was &quot;unlettered&quot; () or because he was a fisherman from Capernaum, a comparatively small and probably monolingual town, in a time and province where there was little literacy. Bauckham addresses the statistical differences in the vocabulary of the two writings, using the data given by U. Holzmeister&#x27;s 1949 study; 38.6 percent of the words are common to 1 and 2 Peter. 61.4 percent peculiar to 2 Peter, while of the words used in 1 Peter, 28.4 percent are common to 1 and 2 Peter, 71.6 percent are peculiar to 1 Peter. However, these figures can be compared with other epistles considered authentic, showing that pure statistical analysis of this type is a weak way of showing literary relationship. Bauckham also notes that &quot;the Greek style of Second Peter is not to the taste of many modern readers, at times pretentiously elaborate, with an effort at pompous phrasing, a somewhat artificial piece of rhetoric, and &#x27;slimy Greek&#x27;&quot;; contrary to the style of the first epistle, &quot;2 Peter must relate to the &#x27;Asiatic Greek.&#x27;&quot; The crux of the matter is how these differences are explained. Those who deny the Petrine authorship of the epistle, such as, for example, Kelly, insist that the differences show that First and Second Peter were not written by the same person. Others add that 2 Peter was a specific type of pseudepigraphy common and morally accepted at the time, either because it was a testamentary genre or because the works of the disciples could bear the names of their masters without any inconvenience.

Those who defend Petrine authorship often appeal to the different amanuenses or secretaries Peter used to write each letter, as first suggested by Jerome. Thomas R. Schreiner criticizes people who regard arguments in favor of the authenticity of 2 Peter as mere arguments of religious conservatives who impotently try to invent arguments to support authenticity. People of this mindset, according to Schreiner, object to the claim that different secretaries may have been used but then claim that the corpus of the two letters is too small to establish stylistic variation. Schreiner states: 
The scholar Simon J. Kistemaker believes that linguistically &quot;the material presented in both documents provides substantial evidence to indicate that these letters are the product of a single author.&quot; However, this view is very much in the minority. Most biblical scholars have concluded Peter is not the author, considering the epistle pseudepigraphal. Reasons for this include its linguistic differences from 1 Peter, its apparent use of Jude, possible allusions to second-century gnosticism, encouragement in the wake of a delayed parousia, and weak external support.

==Early surviving manuscripts==
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are:

===Greek===
*Papyrus 72 (3rd/4th century)
*Codex Vaticanus (B or 03; 325–50)
*Codex Sinaiticus ( or 01; 330–60)
*Codex Alexandrinus (A or 02; 400–40)
*Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C or 04; c. 450; partial)
*Papyrus 74 (7th century; extant verses 3:4, 3:11, 3:16)

===Latin===
*Codex Floriacensis (h; 6th century Old-Latin; partial)

==Relationship with the Epistle of Jude==
There is an obvious relationship between the texts of 2 Peter and the Epistle of Jude, to the degree that one of them clearly had read the other and copied phrases, or both had read some lost common source. The shared passages are:
In general, most scholars believe that Jude was written first, and 2 Peter shows signs of adapting phrases from Jude for its specific situation.

== Canonical acceptance ==

The earliest undisputed mention of 2 Peter is by the theologian Origen (c. 185–254) in his &quot;Commentary on the Gospel of John&quot;, although he marks it as &quot;doubted&quot;/&quot;disputed&quot;. Origen mentioned no explanation for the doubts, nor did he give any indication concerning the extent or location. Donald Guthrie suggests that &quot;It is fair to assume, therefore, that he saw no reason to treat these doubts as serious, and this would mean to imply that in his time the epistle was widely regarded as canonical.&quot; Acceptance of the letter into the canon did not occur without some difficulty; however, &quot;nowhere did doubts about the letter&#x27;s authorship take the form of definitive rejection.&quot;

Origen, in another passage, has been interpreted as considering the letter to be Petrine in authorship. Before Origen&#x27;s time, the evidence is inconclusive; there is a lack of definite early quotations from the letter in the writings of the Apostolic Fathers, though possible use or influence has been located in the works of Clement of Alexandria (d. c. 211), Theophilius (d. c. 183), Aristides (d. c. 134), Polycarp (d. 155), and Justin (d. 165).

Robert E. Picirilli observed that Clement of Rome linked James 1:8, 2 Peter 3:4, and Mark 4:26 in 1 Clement 23:3. Richard Bauckham and Peter H. Davids also noted the reference to “Scripture” in 1 Clement 23:3 matched 2 Peter 3:4, but make it dependent on a common apocalyptic source, which was also used in 2 Clement 11:2.

Carsten Peter Thiede adds to Picirilli&#x27;s work authors such as Justin and Minucius Felix who would use 2 Peter directly and a new reference in Clement of Rome (1 Clem. 9.2 = 2 Pet. 1.17).
2 Peter seems to be quoted amongst apocryphal literature in Shepherd of Hermas (AD 95–160), Apocalypse of Peter (c. AD 125–135), the Gospel of Truth (AD 140–170), and the Apocryphon of John (AD 120–180).

Eusebius (c. 275–339) professed his own doubts (see also Antilegomena), and is the earliest direct testimony of such, though he stated that the majority supported the text, and by the time of Jerome (c. 346–420) it had been mostly accepted as canonical.

The Peshitta, the standard version of the Bible for churches in the Syriac tradition, does not contain the Second Epistle of Peter and thus rejects its canonical status.

==Content==
In both content and style this letter is very different from 1 Peter. Its author, like the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles, is familiar with literary conventions, writing in a more elevated Koine Greek than, for example, Paul&#x27;s writings or the Gospel of Mark. Gorgianic figures are used which are characteristic of Asian rhetoric (Asianism), with style similar to that of Ignatius and the Epistle to Diognetus. This leads some scholars to think that, like 1 Peter, the letter is addressed to Gentile Christians in Asia Minor.

The epistle presciently declares that it is written shortly before the apostle&#x27;s death (1:14), an assertion that may not have been part of the original text. Arguments for and against the assertion being original are based largely on the acceptance or rejection of supernatural intervention in the life of the writer.

The epistle contains eleven references to the Old Testament. In 3:15-16 a reference is made to one of Paul&#x27;s epistles, which some have identified as &quot;3:10a&quot; with 1 Thess. 5:2; &quot;3:14&quot; with 1 Thess. 5:23.

The author of 2 Peter had a relationship with the Gospel tradition, mainly in the Transfiguration of Jesus, &quot;1:4&quot; with Mark 9:1; &quot;1:11&quot; with Mark 9:1; &quot;1:16,18&quot; with Mark 9:2-10; &quot;1:17&quot; with Matthew 17:5; &quot;1:19&quot; with Mark 9:4; and in the promise of the Second Coming, &quot;3:10b&quot; with Mark 13:31 or Luke 21:33.

The book also shares a number of passages with the Epistle of Jude, &quot;1:5&quot; with Jude 3; &quot;1:12&quot; with Jude 5; &quot;2:1&quot; with Jude 4; &quot;2:4&quot; with Jude 6; &quot;2:5&quot; with Jude 5; &quot;2:6&quot; with Jude 7; &quot;2:10–11&quot; with Jude 8–9; &quot;2:12&quot; with Jude 10; &quot;2:13–17&quot; with Jude 11–13; &quot;2:18&quot; with Jude 16; &quot;3:2f&quot; with Jude 17f; &quot;3:3&quot; with Jude 18; &quot;3:14&quot; with Jude 24; and &quot;3:18&quot; with Jude 25. Because the Epistle of Jude is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, the scholarly consensus is that Jude was the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter.

Tartarus is mentioned in 2 Peter 2:4 as devoted to the holding of certain fallen angels. It is elaborated on in Jude 6. Jude 6, however, is a clear reference to the Book of Enoch. Bauckham suggests that 2 Peter 2:4 is partially dependent on Jude 6 but is independently drawing on paraenetic tradition that also lies behind Jude 5–7. The paraenetic traditions are found in Sirach 16:7–10, Damascus Document 2:17–3:12, 3 Maccabees 2:4–7, Testament of Naphtali 3:4–5, and Mishna Sanhedrin 10:3.

==Outline==
===Chapter 1===

The chapters of this epistle show a triangular relationship between Christology (chapter 1), ethics (chapter 2) and eschatology (chapter 3).

At the beginning of chapter 1, the author calls himself &quot;Simeon Peter&quot; (see Acts 15:14). This detail, for the scholar Rob. van Houwelingen, is evidence of the authenticity of the letter. The letter gives a list of seven virtues in the form of a ladder: Love, Brotherly affection, Godliness, Steadfastness, Self-control, Knowledge, and Excellence. Through the memory of Peter (1:12–15), the author encourages the addressees to lead holy and godly lives (11b); in verse 13 the author speaks of righteousness (being just) in a moral sense, and in verse 14 his line of argument reaches a climax as the addressees are encouraged to do all they can to be found blameless (1 Thess 5:23). In short, the author&#x27;s concern is to encourage his addressees to behave ethically without reproach (1:5–7; 3:12–14), probably because of the impending parousia (Second Coming), which will come like a thief in the night (3:10; 1 Thess 5:2).

===Chapter 2===

In this chapter, the author affirms that false teachers have arisen among the faithful to lead them astray with &quot;destructive heresies&quot; and &quot;exploit people with false words&quot; (2:1–2). Just as there were false prophets in ancient times, so there would be false teachers, false prophets and sheep&#x27;s clothing were one of the prophecies of Jesus [Matt. 7:15], to which the author of this letter together with the author of 1 John refers [1 John 4:1]. False teachers are accused of &quot;denying the Lord who bought them&quot; and promoting licentiousness (2:1–2). The author classifies false teachers as &quot;irrational animals, instinctive creatures, born to be caught and destroyed&quot; (2:12). They are &quot;spots and stains, delighting in their dissipation&quot; with &quot;eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin… hearts trained in covetousness&quot; (2:13–14). As a solution, 2 Peter proposes in the following chapter tools such as penance, aimed at purging sins, and the reactualization of the eschatological hope, to be expected with attention, service and perseverance. This chapter in all likelihood adapts significant portions of the Epistle of Jude.

The ethical goal is not to fall into that debauchery, and errors, and to have hope. This is promoted with many stories of how God rescues the righteous while holding back the unrighteous for the day of judgment, and the stories of Noah, the story of Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah (2:6–8) and the story Balaam, son of Bosor (2:15–16) are used as a warning.

 quotes : &quot;As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.&quot;

===Chapter 3===
The fundamental of this chapter is the authoritative Christian revelation. The revelation is found in a two-part source (3:2). There is little doubt that the &quot;words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets&quot; refers to the OT writings, either in part or in whole. Then the author mentions the second source of revelation, the &quot;commandment of the Lord&quot; spoken by &quot;your apostles.&quot; It is remarkable that this two-part authority includes an obvious older means &quot;words spoken beforehand&quot; as well as an obvious newer half, the apostolically mediated words (words about Jesus). One could be forgiven if he sees here a precursor to a future &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; Testament. This juxtaposition of prophet and apostle as a two-part revelatory source is not first found in 3:1–2, but in 1:16–21.

Another remarkable feature of this chapter is that the author presupposes that his audience is familiar with a plurality of apostles (&quot;how many&quot; is unclear), and, moreover, that they have had (and perhaps still have) access to the teaching of these apostles. One cannot &quot;remember&quot; teaching that they have not received. Of course, this raises difficult questions about the precise medium (oral or written) by which the public received this apostolic teaching. However, near the end of this chapter, the means by which the audience at least received the apostle Paul&#x27;s teaching is expressly stated. We are told that the audience knew the teachings of &quot;our beloved brother Paul&quot; (3:15) and that they knew them in written form: &quot;Paul also wrote to you according to wisdom as he does in all his letters&quot; (3:16), the &quot;also&quot; being the key word since in the first verse of the chapter the author referred to another written apostolic text, namely his first epistle (1 Peter): considering part of the &quot;Scriptures&quot; not only the OT prophets, but also Paul and the author himself, from the Pauline corpus the author may have known 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Romans, Galatians, and possibly Ephesians and Colossians. Thought on Christian revelation is also located in other early authors, namely Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, and in the work 2 Clement.

In the middle of the chapter is the explanation for the delay in Jesus&#x27; return (3:9); Jesus&#x27; delay is only to facilitate the salvation of the &quot;already faithful&quot; who may at times waver in their faith or have been led astray by false teachers (2:2–3). God is delaying to make sure that &quot;all&quot; have had sufficient time to secure their commitment (or return) to the gospel, including the false teachers. The remaining verses provide details about the coming day of the Lord along with the exhortation that flows seamlessly into the conclusion of the letter. The instruction offered here (3:11–13) echoes that of Jesus who called his disciples to await the consummation of his kingdom with attention, service and perseverance (Mt 24–25; Mk 13:3–13, 32–37; Lk 18:1–30; 21:1–38). Taken together with the final verses (3:14–18), here again the author expresses the concern that believers secure their eternal place in God&#x27;s new creation by embracing lives that foster blessing and even hasten God&#x27;s coming day.

<text>The Second Epistle of John is a book of the New Testament attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the other two epistles of John, and the Gospel of John (though this is disputed). Most modern scholars believe this is not John the Apostle, but in general there is no consensus as to the identity of this person or group. (See Authorship of the Johannine works.)

== Composition ==

The language of this epistle is remarkably similar to 3 John. It is therefore suggested by a few that a single author composed both of these letters. The traditional view contends that all the letters are by the hand of John the Apostle, and the linguistic structure, special vocabulary, and polemical issues all lend toward this theory.

Also significant is the clear warning against paying heed to those who say that Jesus was not a flesh-and-blood figure: &quot;For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.&quot; This establishes that, from the time the epistle was first written, there were those who had docetic Christologies, believing that the human person of Jesus was actually pure spirit or not come at all.

Alternatively, the letter&#x27;s acknowledgment and rejection of gnostic theology may reveal a later date of authorship than orthodox Christianity claims. This can not be assured by a simple study of the context. Gnosticism&#x27;s beginnings and its relationship to Christianity are poorly dated, due to an insufficient corpus of literature relating the first interactions between the two religions. It vehemently condemns such anti-corporeal attitudes, which also indicates that those taking such unorthodox positions were either sufficiently vocal, persuasive, or numerous enough to warrant rebuttal in this form. Adherents of gnosticism were most numerous during the second and third centuries.

==Interpretation of &quot;The Lady&quot;==

The text is addressed &quot;to the elect lady&quot; and her children (; some interpretations translate this phrase as &quot;elder lady,&quot; &quot;a very special woman,&quot; &quot;chosen lady,&quot; &quot;dear Lady&quot; etc.), and closes with the words, &quot;The children of thy elect sister greet thee.&quot; The person addressed is commended for her piety, and is warned against false teachers.

The lady has often been seen as a metaphor for the church, the church being the body of believers as a whole and as local congregations. The children would be members of that local congregation. The writer also includes a greeting from another church in the final verse, &quot;The children of thy elect sister greet thee.&quot; The term &quot;the elect&quot; (ἐκλεκτοί, &quot;eklektoi&quot;) was a fairly common term for those who believe in the gospel and follow Christ. Scholar Amos Wilder supports this view, saying the content of the epistle itself shows it was addressed to the church as a whole rather than a single person.

Another interpretation holds that the letter is addressed to a specific individual. Athanasius proposed that Kyria, the Greek word used here which means lady, was actually a name. The Young&#x27;s Literal Translation of the Bible translates it this way. It is also possible it refers to an individual but simply does not use her name. One theory is that the letter refers to Mary, mother of Jesus; Jesus had entrusted his &quot;beloved disciple&quot; with Mary&#x27;s life when Jesus was on the cross (John 19:26–27). The children would thus refer to the brothers of Jesus: James, Joses, Simon and Jude, and the sister to Mary&#x27;s sister mentioned in . Mary was likewise never referred to by name in John&#x27;s gospel. Such an interpretation would assume a much earlier date of composition than modern scholars have suggested.

<text>In genetics and biochemistry, sequencing means to determine the primary structure (sometimes incorrectly called the primary sequence) of an unbranched biopolymer. Sequencing results in a symbolic linear depiction known as a sequence which succinctly summarizes much of the atomic-level structure of the sequenced molecule.

==DNA sequencing==

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleotide order of a given DNA fragment. So far, most DNA sequencing has been performed using the chain termination method developed by Frederick Sanger. This technique uses sequence-specific termination of a DNA synthesis reaction using modified nucleotide substrates. However, new sequencing technologies such as pyrosequencing are gaining an increasing share of the sequencing market. More genome data are now being produced by pyrosequencing than Sanger DNA sequencing. Pyrosequencing has enabled rapid genome sequencing. Bacterial genomes can be sequenced in a single run with several times coverage with this technique. This technique was also used to sequence the genome of James Watson recently.

The sequence of DNA encodes the necessary information for living things to survive and reproduce. Determining the sequence is therefore useful in fundamental research into why and how organisms live, as well as in applied subjects. Because of the key importance DNA has to living things, knowledge of DNA sequences is useful in practically any area of biological research. For example, in medicine it can be used to identify, diagnose, and potentially develop treatments for genetic diseases. Similarly, research into pathogens may lead to treatments for contagious diseases. Biotechnology is a burgeoning discipline, with the potential for many useful products and services.

The Carlson curve is a term coined by &quot;The Economist&quot; to describe the biotechnological equivalent of Moore&#x27;s law, and is named after author Rob Carlson. Carlson accurately predicted the doubling time of DNA sequencing technologies (measured by cost and performance) would be at least as fast as Moore&#x27;s law. Carlson curves illustrate the rapid (in some cases hyperexponential) decreases in cost, and increases in performance, of a variety of technologies, including DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, and a range of physical and computational tools used in protein expression and in determining protein structures.

===Sanger sequencing===
In chain terminator sequencing (Sanger sequencing), extension is initiated at a specific site on the template DNA by using a short oligonucleotide &#x27;primer&#x27; complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a DNA polymerase, an enzyme that replicates DNA. Included with the primer and DNA polymerase are the four deoxynucleotide bases (DNA building blocks), along with a low concentration of a chain terminating nucleotide (most commonly a di-deoxynucleotide). The deoxynucleotides lack in the OH group both at the 2&#x27; and at the 3&#x27; position of the ribose molecule, therefore once they are inserted within a DNA molecule they prevent it from being further elongated. In this sequencer four different vessels are employed, each containing only of the four dideoxyribonucleotides; the incorporation of the chain terminating nucleotides by the DNA polymerase in a random position results in a series of related DNA fragments, of different sizes, that terminate with a given dideoxiribonucleotide. The fragments are then size-separated by electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel, or more commonly now, in a narrow glass tube (capillary) filled with a viscous polymer.

An alternative to the labelling of the primer is to label the terminators instead, commonly called &#x27;dye terminator sequencing&#x27;. The major advantage of this approach is the complete sequencing set can be performed in a single reaction, rather than the four needed with the labeled-primer approach. This is accomplished by labelling each of the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength. This method is easier and quicker than the dye primer approach, but may produce more uneven data peaks (different heights), due to a template dependent difference in the incorporation of the large dye chain-terminators. This problem has been significantly reduced with the introduction of new enzymes and dyes that minimize incorporation variability.
This method is now used for the vast majority of sequencing reactions as it is both simpler and cheaper. The major reason for this is that the primers do not have to be separately labelled (which can be a significant expense for a single-use custom primer), although this is less of a concern with frequently used &#x27;universal&#x27; primers. This is changing rapidly due to the increasing cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation systems from Illumina, 454, ABI, Helicos, and Dover.

===Pyrosequencing===

The pyrosequencing method is based on the detection of the pyrophosphate release on nucleotide incorporation. Before performing pyrosequencing, the DNA strand to sequence has to be amplified by PCR. Then the order in which the nucleotides have to be added in the sequencer is chosen (i.e. G-A-T-C). When a specific nucleotide is added, if the DNA polymerase incorporates it in the growing chain, the pyrophosphate is released and converted into ATP by ATP sulfurylase. ATP powers the oxidation of luciferase through the luciferase; this reaction generates a light signal recorded as a pyrogram peak. In this way, the nucleotide incorporation is correlated to a signal. The light signal is proportional to the amount of nucleotides incorporated during the synthesis of the DNA strand (i.e. two nucleotides incorporated correspond to two pyrogram peaks). When the added nucleotides aren&#x27;t incorporated in the DNA molecule, no signal is recorded; the enzyme apyrase removes any unincorporated nucleotide remaining in the reaction.
This method requires neither fluorescently-labelled nucleotides nor gel electrophoresis.
Pyrosequencing, which was developed by Pål Nyrén and Mostafa Ronaghi DNA, has been commercialized by Biotage (for low-throughput sequencing) and 454 Life Sciences (for high-throughput sequencing). The latter platform sequences roughly 100 megabases [now up to 400 megabases] in a seven-hour run with a single machine. In the array-based method (commercialized by 454 Life Sciences), single-stranded DNA is annealed to beads and amplified via EmPCR. These DNA-bound beads are then placed into wells on a fiber-optic chip along with enzymes which produce light in the presence of ATP. When free nucleotides are washed over this chip, light is produced as ATP is generated when nucleotides join with their complementary base pairs. Addition of one (or more) nucleotide(s) results in a reaction that generates a light signal that is recorded by the CCD camera in the instrument. The signal strength is proportional to the number of nucleotides, for example, homopolymer stretches, incorporated in a single nucleotide flow. 

===True single molecule sequencing===

===Large-scale sequencing ===
Whereas the methods above describe various sequencing methods, separate related terms are used when a large portion of a genome is sequenced. Several platforms were developed to perform exome sequencing (a subset of all DNA across all chromosomes that encode genes) or whole genome sequencing (sequencing of the all nuclear DNA of a human).

==RNA sequencing==
RNA is less stable in the cell, and also more prone to nuclease attack experimentally. As RNA is generated by transcription from DNA, the information is already present in the cell&#x27;s DNA. However, it is sometimes desirable to sequence RNA molecules. While sequencing DNA gives a genetic profile of an organism, sequencing RNA reflects only the sequences that are actively expressed in the cells. To sequence RNA, the usual method is first to reverse transcribe the RNA extracted from the sample to generate cDNA fragments. This can then be sequenced as described above.
The bulk of RNA expressed in cells are ribosomal RNAs or small RNAs, detrimental for cellular translation, but often not the focus of a study. This fraction can be removed &quot;in vitro&quot;, however, to enrich for the messenger RNA, also included, that usually is of interest. Derived from the exons these mRNAs are to be later translated to proteins that support particular cellular functions. The expression profile therefore indicates cellular activity, particularly desired in the studies of diseases, cellular behaviour, responses to reagents or stimuli. Eukaryotic RNA molecules are not necessarily co-linear with their DNA template, as introns are excised. This gives a certain complexity to map the read sequences back to the genome and thereby identify their origin.
For more information on the capabilities of next-generation sequencing applied to whole transcriptomes see: RNA-Seq and MicroRNA Sequencing.

==Protein sequencing==

Methods for performing protein sequencing
include:
*Edman degradation
*Peptide mass fingerprinting
*Mass spectrometry
*Protease digests

If the gene encoding the protein is known, it is currently much easier to sequence the DNA and infer the protein sequence. Determining part of a protein&#x27;s amino-acid sequence (often one end) by one of the above methods may be sufficient to identify a clone carrying this gene.

==Polysaccharide sequencing==
Though polysaccharides are also biopolymers, it is not so common to talk of &#x27;sequencing&#x27; a polysaccharide, for several reasons. Although many polysaccharides are linear, many have branches. Many different units (individual monosaccharides) can be used, and bonded in different ways. However, the main theoretical reason is that whereas the other polymers listed here are primarily generated in a &#x27;template-dependent&#x27; manner by one processive enzyme, each individual join in a polysaccharide may be formed by a different enzyme. In many cases the assembly is not uniquely specified; depending on which enzyme acts, one of several different units may be incorporated. This can lead to a family of similar molecules being formed. This is particularly true for plant polysaccharides. Methods for the structure determination of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides include NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis.

<doc id="28616" wikidata="Q1073526" url="?curid=28616" title="Shotgun sequencing">
<text>In genetics, shotgun sequencing is a method used for sequencing random DNA strands. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random shot grouping of a shotgun.

The chain-termination method of DNA sequencing (&quot;Sanger sequencing&quot;) can only be used for short DNA strands of 100 to 1000 base pairs. Due to this size limit, longer sequences are subdivided into smaller fragments that can be sequenced separately, and these sequences are assembled to give the overall sequence.
In shotgun sequencing, DNA is broken up randomly into numerous small segments, which are sequenced using the chain termination method to obtain &quot;reads&quot;. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence.

Shotgun sequencing was one of the precursor technologies that was responsible for enabling whole genome sequencing.

==Example==
For example, consider the following two rounds of shotgun reads:
In this extremely simplified example, none of the reads cover the full length of the original sequence, but the four reads can be assembled into the original sequence using the overlap of their ends to align and order them. In reality, this process uses enormous amounts of information that are rife with ambiguities and sequencing errors. Assembly of complex genomes is additionally complicated by the great abundance of repetitive sequences, meaning similar short reads could come from completely different parts of the sequence.

Many overlapping reads for each segment of the original DNA are necessary to overcome these difficulties and accurately assemble the sequence. For example, to complete the Human Genome Project, most of the human genome was sequenced at 12X or greater &quot;coverage&quot;; that is, each base in the final sequence was present on average in 12 different reads. Even so, current methods have failed to isolate or assemble reliable sequence for approximately 1% of the (euchromatic) human genome, as of 2004.

==Whole genome shotgun sequencing==

=== History ===
Whole genome shotgun sequencing for small (4000- to 7000-base-pair) genomes was first suggested in 1979. The first genome sequenced by shotgun sequencing was that of cauliflower mosaic virus, published in 1981.

=== Paired-end sequencing ===
Broader application benefited from pairwise end sequencing, known colloquially as &quot;double-barrel shotgun sequencing&quot;. As sequencing projects began to take on longer and more complicated DNA sequences, multiple groups began to realize that useful information could be obtained by sequencing both ends of a fragment of DNA. Although sequencing both ends of the same fragment and keeping track of the paired data was more cumbersome than sequencing a single end of two distinct fragments, the knowledge that the two sequences were oriented in opposite directions and were about the length of a fragment apart from each other was valuable in reconstructing the sequence of the original target fragment.

History. The first published description of the use of paired ends was in 1990 as part of the sequencing of the human HGPRT locus, although the use of paired ends was limited to closing gaps after the application of a traditional shotgun sequencing approach. The first theoretical description of a pure pairwise end sequencing strategy, assuming fragments of constant length, was in 1991. At the time, there was community consensus that the optimal fragment length for pairwise end sequencing would be three times the sequence read length. In 1995 Roach et al. introduced the innovation of using fragments of varying sizes, and demonstrated that a pure pairwise end-sequencing strategy would be possible on large targets. The strategy was subsequently adopted by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) to sequence the genome of the bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; in 1995, and then by Celera Genomics to sequence the &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (fruit fly) genome in 2000, and subsequently the human genome.

=== Approach ===
To apply the strategy, a high-molecular-weight DNA strand is sheared into random fragments, size-selected (usually 2, 10, 50, and 150 kb), and cloned into an appropriate vector. The clones are then sequenced from both ends using the chain termination method yielding two short sequences. Each sequence is called an &quot;end-read&quot; or &quot;read 1 and read 2&quot; and two reads from the same clone are referred to as &quot;mate pairs&quot;. Since the chain termination method usually can only produce reads between 500 and 1000 bases long, in all but the smallest clones, mate pairs will rarely overlap.

=== Assembly ===
The original sequence is reconstructed from the reads using sequence assembly software. First, overlapping reads are collected into longer composite sequences known as &quot;contigs&quot;. Contigs can be linked together into &quot;scaffolds&quot; by following connections between mate pairs. The distance between contigs can be inferred from the mate pair positions if the average fragment length of the library is known and has a narrow window of deviation. Depending on the size of the gap between contigs, different techniques can be used to find the sequence in the gaps. If the gap is small (5-20kb) then the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the region is required, followed by sequencing. If the gap is large (&gt;20kb) then the large fragment is cloned in special vectors such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) followed by sequencing of the vector.

=== Pros and cons ===
Proponents of this approach argue that it is possible to sequence the whole genome at once using large arrays of sequencers, which makes the whole process much more efficient than more traditional approaches. Detractors argue that although the technique quickly sequences large regions of DNA, its ability to correctly link these regions is suspect, particularly for eukaryotic genomes with repeating regions. As sequence assembly programs become more sophisticated and computing power becomes cheaper, it may be possible to overcome this limitation.

===Coverage===

Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence. It can be calculated from the length of the original genome (&quot;G&quot;), the number of reads(&quot;N&quot;), and the average read length(&quot;L&quot;) as formula_1. For example, a hypothetical genome with 2,000 base pairs reconstructed from 8 reads with an average length of 500 nucleotides will have 2x redundancy. This parameter also enables one to estimate other quantities, such as the percentage of the genome covered by reads (sometimes also called coverage). A high coverage in shotgun sequencing is desired because it can overcome errors in base calling and assembly. The subject of DNA sequencing theory addresses the relationships of such quantities.

Sometimes a distinction is made between &quot;sequence coverage&quot; and &quot;physical coverage&quot;. Sequence coverage is the average number of times a base is read (as described above). Physical coverage is the average number of times a base is read or spanned by mate paired reads.

==Hierarchical shotgun sequencing==
Although shotgun sequencing can in theory be applied to a genome of any size, its direct application to the sequencing of large genomes (for instance, the human genome) was limited until the late 1990s, when technological advances made practical the handling of the vast quantities of complex data involved in the process. Historically, full-genome shotgun sequencing was believed to be limited by both the sheer size of large genomes and by the complexity added by the high percentage of repetitive DNA (greater than 50% for the human genome) present in large genomes. It was not widely accepted that a full-genome shotgun sequence of a large genome would provide reliable data. For these reasons, other strategies that lowered the computational load of sequence assembly had to be utilized before shotgun sequencing was performed.
In hierarchical sequencing, also known as top-down sequencing, a low-resolution physical map of the genome is made prior to actual sequencing. From this map, a minimal number of fragments that cover the entire chromosome are selected for sequencing. In this way, the minimum amount of high-throughput sequencing and assembly is required.

The amplified genome is first sheared into larger pieces (50-200kb) and cloned into a bacterial host using BACs or P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PAC). Because multiple genome copies have been sheared at random, the fragments contained in these clones have different ends, and with enough coverage (see section above) finding the smallest possible scaffold of BAC contigs that covers the entire genome is theoretically possible. This scaffold is called the minimum tiling path. Once a tiling path has been found, the BACs that form this path are sheared at random into smaller fragments and can be sequenced using the shotgun method on a smaller scale.

Although the full sequences of the BAC contigs is not known, their orientations relative to one another are known. There are several methods for deducing this order and selecting the BACs that make up a tiling path. The general strategy involves identifying the positions of the clones relative to one another and then selecting the fewest clones required to form a contiguous scaffold that covers the entire area of interest. The order of the clones is deduced by determining the way in which they overlap. Overlapping clones can be identified in several ways. A small radioactively or chemically labeled probe containing a sequence-tagged site (STS) can be hybridized onto a microarray upon which the clones are printed. In this way, all the clones that contain a particular sequence in the genome are identified. The end of one of these clones can then be sequenced to yield a new probe and the process repeated in a method called chromosome walking.

Alternatively, the BAC library can be restriction-digested. Two clones that have several fragment sizes in common are inferred to overlap because they contain multiple similarly spaced restriction sites in common. This method of genomic mapping is called restriction or BAC fingerprinting because it identifies a set of restriction sites contained in each clone. Once the overlap between the clones has been found and their order relative to the genome known, a scaffold of a minimal subset of these contigs that covers the entire genome is shotgun-sequenced.

Because it involves first creating a low-resolution map of the genome, hierarchical shotgun sequencing is slower than whole-genome shotgun sequencing, but relies less heavily on computer algorithms than whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The process of extensive BAC library creation and tiling path selection, however, make hierarchical shotgun sequencing slow and labor-intensive. Now that the technology is available and the reliability of the data demonstrated, the speed and cost efficiency of whole-genome shotgun sequencing has made it the primary method for genome sequencing.

==Newer sequencing technologies==
The classical shotgun sequencing was based on the Sanger sequencing method: this was the most advanced technique for sequencing genomes from about 1995–2005. The shotgun strategy is still applied today, however using other sequencing technologies, such as short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing.

Short-read or &quot;next-gen&quot; sequencing produces shorter reads (anywhere from 25–500bp) but many hundreds of thousands or millions of reads in a relatively short time (on the order of a day).
This results in high coverage, but the assembly process is much more computationally intensive. These technologies are vastly superior to Sanger sequencing due to the high volume of data and the relatively short time it takes to sequence a whole genome.

== Metagenomic shotgun sequencing ==
Having reads of 400-500 base pairs length is sufficient to determine the species or strain of the organism where the DNA comes from, provided its genome is already known, by using for example a &quot;k&quot;-mer based taxonomic classifier software. With millions of reads from next generation sequencing of an environmental sample, it is possible to get a complete overview of any complex microbiome with thousands of species, like the gut flora. Advantages over 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing are: not being limited to bacteria; strain-level classification where amplicon sequencing only gets the genus; and the possibility to extract whole genes and specify their function as part of the metagenome. The sensitivity of metagenomic sequencing makes it an attractive choice for clinical use. It however emphasizes the problem of contamination of the sample or the sequencing pipeline.

<text>The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; ) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, within New York City. The copper-clad statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

The statue is a figure of a classically draped woman, likely inspired by the Roman goddess of liberty Libertas. In a contrapposto pose, she holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a &quot;tabula ansata&quot; inscribed (July 4, 1776, in Roman numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. With her left foot she steps on a broken chain and shackle, commemorating the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War. After its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, being subsequently seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea.

The idea for the statue was conceived in 1865, when the French historian and abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye proposed a monument to commemorate the upcoming centennial of U.S. independence (1876), the perseverance of American democracy and the liberation of the nation&#x27;s slaves. The Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the people of France finance the statue and the United States provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the &quot;New York World&quot;, started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar (). The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe&#x27;s Island. The statue&#x27;s completion was marked by New York&#x27;s first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.

The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since 1933, it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a major tourist attraction. Limited numbers of visitors can access the rim of the pedestal and the interior of the statue&#x27;s crown from within; public access to the torch has been barred since 1916.

==Development==
===Origin===
According to the National Park Service, the idea of a monument presented by the French people to the United States was first proposed by Édouard René de Laboulaye, president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time. The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between Laboulaye, a staunch abolitionist, and Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a sculptor. In after-dinner conversation at his home near Versailles, Laboulaye, an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War, is supposed to have said: &quot;If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort—a common work of both our nations.&quot; The National Park Service, in a 2000 report, however, deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet, and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870. In another essay on their website, the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences, &quot;With the abolition of slavery and the Union&#x27;s victory in the Civil War in 1865, Laboulaye&#x27;s wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States. In order to honor these achievements, Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France. Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States, the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy.&quot;

According to sculptor Bartholdi, who later recounted the story, Laboulaye&#x27;s alleged comment was not intended as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi. Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III, Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects. In 1856, he traveled to Egypt to study ancient works. In the late 1860s, he approached Isma&#x27;il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, with a plan to build &quot;Progress&quot; or &quot;Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia&quot;, a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female &quot;fellah&quot; or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected. There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal, the Colossus of Rhodes: an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun, Helios. This statue is believed to have been over high, and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships. Both the khedive and Ferdinand de Lesseps, developer of the Suez Canal, declined the proposed statue from Bartholdi, citing the high cost. The Port Said Lighthouse was built instead, by François Coignet in 1869.

Upon his return from Egypt, Bartholdi visited a 76-foot Giovanni Battista Crespi&#x27;s sculpture in repoussé copper covering an iron armature at Lago Maggiore in Italy, and was familiar with the similar construction of the Vercingétorix monument by Aimé Millet; the restoration of Millet&#x27;s statue a century later called international attention to the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s poor state. Copper was chosen over bronze or stone due to its lower cost, weight, and ease of transportation.

Any large project was further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was captured and deposed. Bartholdi&#x27;s home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.

Arriving at New York Harbor, Bartholdi focused on Bedloe&#x27;s Island (now named Liberty Island) as a site for the statue, struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it. He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government—it had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense. It was thus, as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye: &quot;land common to all the states.&quot; As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers, Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S. Grant, who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue. Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail, and met many Americans whom he thought would be sympathetic to the project. But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal, and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign.
Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870. The son of a friend of Bartholdi&#x27;s, artist John LaFarge, later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his visit to La Farge&#x27;s Rhode Island studio. Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France. He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians. One of these was the &quot;Lion of Belfort&quot;, a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort, which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months. The defiant lion, long and half that in height, displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism, which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty.

===Design, style, and symbolism===
Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom, and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the traditional European Personification of the Americas as an &quot;Indian princess&quot;, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; (1863) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building.

The statue&#x27;s design evokes iconography evident in ancient history including the Egyptian goddess Isis, the ancient Greek deity of the same name, the Roman Columbia and the Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary.

Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol. A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France. However, Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s famed &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; (1830). In this painting, which commemorates France&#x27;s July Revolution, a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen. Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution, and so Bartholdi&#x27;s figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes. Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work, Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch, representing progress, for the figure to hold. Its second toe on both feet is longer than its big toe, a condition known as Morton&#x27;s toe or &#x27;Greek foot&#x27;. This was an aesthetic staple of ancient Greek art and reflects the classical influences on the statue.

Crawford&#x27;s statue was designed in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a &quot;pileus&quot; or &quot;liberty cap&quot;, the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America, was concerned that the &quot;pileus&quot; would be taken as an abolitionist symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet. Delacroix&#x27;s figure wears a &quot;pileus&quot;, and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well. Instead, he used a radiate halo, nimbus, to top its head. In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a &quot;pileus&quot;. Many believed they evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents, and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world, but research has not confirmed this.

Bartholdi&#x27;s early models were all similar in concept: a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty, wearing a &quot;stola&quot; and &quot;pella&quot; (gown and cloak, common in depictions of Roman goddesses) and holding a torch aloft. According to popular accounts, the face was modeled after that of Augusta Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi, the sculptor&#x27;s mother, but Regis Huber, the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this, as well as other similar speculations, have no basis in fact. He designed the figure with austere face and a strong, uncomplicated silhouette, which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan. He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling, reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose. Bartholdi wrote of his technique:

Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved. Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain, but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War. The erected statue does stride over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground. Her right foot is raised and set back, in a classical contrapposto pose that looks stationary when viewed from the front, but dynamic when viewed from the side, signifying a solid footing and a posture more relaxed than that of two feet set side by side, and introducing a sense of tension between standing and moving forward, both physically and mentally. The upright form and outstretched leg may have also helped to stabilize the statue. Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty&#x27;s left hand; he settled on a &quot;tabula ansata&quot;, used to evoke the concept of law. Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution, he chose to inscribe on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country&#x27;s Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty.

Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor, architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, in the project. As chief engineer, Viollet-le-Duc proposed designing a brick pier filled with sand within the statue up to the hips, with iron bars like veins of a leaf to which the skin would be anchored.
After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co., Viollet-le-Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin, copper sheets, and the method used to shape it, repoussé, in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers. An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume, as the copper need be only thick. Bartholdi had decided on a height of just over for the statue, double that of Italy&#x27;s Sancarlone and the German statue of Arminius, both made with the same method. Viollet le Duc also designed the pleats of the dress.

===Announcement and early work===
By 1875, France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing interest in the upcoming Centennial Exposition to be held in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;. The French people were to finance the statue (contrary to the common misconception of it being funded by the French national government); and Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by the composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled &quot;La Liberté éclairant le monde&quot;, the French version of the statue&#x27;s announced name.
Initially focused on the elites, the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181 French municipalities. Laboulaye&#x27;s political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated of copper.

Although plans for the statue had not been finalized, Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm, bearing the torch, and the head. Work began at the Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co. workshop. In May 1876, Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition, and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities. The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August; because of its late arrival, it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue, and while some reports correctly identified the work, others called it the &quot;Colossal Arm&quot; or &quot;Bartholdi Electric Light&quot;. The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers&#x27; interest, including an outsized fountain designed by Bartholdi. Nevertheless, the arm proved popular in the exhibition&#x27;s waning days, and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds. After the exhibition closed, the arm was transported to New York City, where it remained on display in Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue.

During his second trip to the United States, Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project, and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco-American Union. Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the &quot;American Committee&quot;. One of its members was 19-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the future governor of New York and president of the United States. On March 3, 1877, on his final full day in office, President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who took office the following day, selected the Bedloe&#x27;s Island site that Bartholdi had proposed.

===Construction in France===
On his return to Paris in 1877, Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head, which was exhibited at the 1878 Paris World&#x27;s Fair. Fundraising continued, with models of the statue put on sale. Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co. workshop were also offered. The French government authorized a lottery; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue. By the end of 1879, about 250,000 francs had been raised.

The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier. The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel and his structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor, and, since the metal would expand on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars or springs, which culminated in a mesh of metal straps, known as &quot;saddles&quot;, that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually. To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac.

Eiffel&#x27;s design made the statue one of the earliest examples of curtain wall construction, in which the exterior of the structure is not , but is instead supported by an interior framework. He included two interior spiral staircases, to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown. Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided, but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder, long. As the pylon tower arose, Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure. The components of the pylon tower were built in the Eiffel factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret.

The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue&#x27;s assembly. He had originally expected to assemble the skin on-site as the masonry pier was built; instead, he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe&#x27;s Island.

In a symbolic act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue&#x27;s big toe, was driven by United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi&#x27;s exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Bartholdi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Lesseps. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.
The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi&#x27;s statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation&#x27;s history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; declared its wish that &quot;M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had &#x27;gone the whole figure&#x27; while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances.&quot; Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.

====Design====
The foundation of Bartholdi&#x27;s statue was to be laid inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe&#x27;s Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it had served as a recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue&#x27;s foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.
In 1881, the New York committee commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design the pedestal. Within months, Hunt submitted a detailed plan, indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months. He proposed a pedestal in height; faced with money problems, the committee reduced that to .

Hunt&#x27;s pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture, including Doric portals, as well as some elements influenced by Aztec architecture. The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail, in order to focus attention on the statue. In form, it is a truncated pyramid, square at the base and at the top. The four sides are identical in appearance. Above the door on each side, there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states (between 1876 and 1889, there were 38 of them), although this was not done. Above that, a balcony was placed on each side, framed by pillars. Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal, above which the statue itself rises. According to author Louis Auchincloss, the pedestal &quot;craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty&quot;. The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work. Construction on the foundation began in 1883, and the pedestal&#x27;s cornerstone was laid in 1884. In Hunt&#x27;s original conception, the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite. Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans; the final design called for poured concrete walls, up to thick, faced with granite blocks. This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in Branford, Connecticut. The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time.

Norwegian immigrant civil engineer Joachim Goschen Giæver designed the structural framework for the Statue of Liberty. His work involved design computations, detailed fabrication and construction drawings, and oversight of construction. In completing his engineering for the statue&#x27;s frame, Giæver worked from drawings and sketches produced by Gustave Eiffel.

====Fundraising====
Fundraising in the U.S. for the pedestal had begun in 1882. The committee organized a large number of money-raising events. As part of one such effort, an auction of art and manuscripts, poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work. She initially declined, stating she could not write a poem about a statue. At the time, she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled antisemitic pogroms in eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced. She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue. The resulting sonnet, &quot;The New Colossus&quot;, including the lines &quot;Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free&quot;, is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty in American culture and is inscribed on a plaque in its museum. Lazarus&#x27;s poem contrasted the classical Colossus of Rhodes as a frightening symbol, with the new &quot;American colossus&quot; as a &quot;beacon to the lost and hopeless&quot;.

Even with these efforts, fundraising lagged. Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York, vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it.

Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the &quot;New York World&quot;, a New York newspaper, announced a drive to raise $100,000 (). Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor, no matter how small the amount given. The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers, especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors. &quot;A young girl alone in the world&quot; donated &quot;60 cents, the result of self denial.&quot; One donor gave &quot;five cents as a poor office boy&#x27;s mite toward the Pedestal Fund.&quot; A group of children sent a dollar as &quot;the money we saved to go to the circus with.&quot; Another dollar was given by a &quot;lonely and very aged woman.&quot; Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York&#x27;s rival city of Brooklyn—the cities would not merge until 1898—donated $15; other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons. A kindergarten class in Davenport, Iowa, mailed the &quot;World&quot; a gift of $1.35. As the donations flooded in, the committee resumed work on the pedestal. France raised about $250,000 to build the statue, while the United States had to raise up to $300,000 to build the pedestal.

====Construction====
On June 17, 1885, the French steamer &quot;&quot; arrived in New York with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board. New Yorkers displayed their newfound enthusiasm for the statue. Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the ship. After five months&#x27; daily calls to donate to the statue fund, on August 11, 1885, the &quot;World&quot; announced that $102,000 had been raised from 120,000 donors, and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar ().

Even with the success of the fund drive, the pedestal was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel&#x27;s iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, it was not possible to erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch&#x27;s balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships&#x27; pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park and Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe&#x27;s Island in anticipation of the dedication. General Charles Stone claimed on the day of dedication that no man had died during the construction of the statue; this was not true, as Francis Longo, a thirty-nine-year-old Italian laborer, had been killed when an old wall fell on him. When built, the statue was reddish-brown and shiny, but within twenty years it had oxidized to its current green color through reactions with air, water and acidic pollution, forming a layer of verdigris which protects the copper from further corrosion.

===Dedication===
A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the &quot;World&quot; building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.

A nautical parade began at 12:45 p.m., and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe&#x27;s Island for the dedication. Lesseps made the first speech, on behalf of the French committee, followed by the chairman of the New York committee, Senator William M. Evarts. A French flag draped across the statue&#x27;s face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts&#x27;s speech, but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely. The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts&#x27;s address. President Cleveland spoke next, stating that the statue&#x27;s &quot;stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man&#x27;s oppression until Liberty enlightens the world&quot;. Bartholdi, observed near the dais, was called upon to speak, but he declined. Orator Chauncey M. Depew concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address.

No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only women granted access were Bartholdi&#x27;s wife and Lesseps&#x27;s granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group&#x27;s leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women&#x27;s right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.

Shortly after the dedication, &quot;The Cleveland Gazette&quot;, an African American newspaper, suggested that the statue&#x27;s torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation &quot;in reality&quot;:

==After dedication==
===Lighthouse Board and War Department (1886–1933) ===
When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue&#x27;s dedication, it produced only a faint gleam, barely visible from Manhattan. The &quot;World&quot; characterized it as &quot;more like a glowworm than a beacon.&quot; Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light, but this proved too expensive. The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch&#x27;s effect; in spite of its efforts, the statue remained virtually invisible at night. When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893, he made additional suggestions, all of which proved ineffective. He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue, allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel&#x27;s design. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt, once a member of the New York committee, ordered the statue&#x27;s transfer to the War Department, as it had proved useless as a lighthouse. A unit of the Army Signal Corps was stationed on Bedloe&#x27;s Island until 1923, after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction.

Wars and other upheavals in Europe prompted large-scale emigration to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century; many entered through New York and saw the statue not as a symbol of enlightenment, as Bartholdi had intended, but as a sign of welcome to their new home. The association with immigration only became stronger when an immigrant processing station was opened on nearby Ellis Island. This view was consistent with Lazarus&#x27;s vision in her sonnet—she described the statue as &quot;Mother of Exiles&quot;—but her work had become obscure. In 1903, the sonnet was engraved on a plaque that was affixed to the base of the statue.

Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty. One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled:

The statue rapidly became a landmark. Originally, it was a dull copper color, but shortly after 1900 a green patina, also called verdigris, caused by the oxidation of the copper skin, began to spread. As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue. Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion, Congress authorized for various repairs, and to paint the statue both inside and out. There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting. The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin, &quot;softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful.&quot; The statue was painted only on the inside. The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal.

On July 30, 1916, during World War I, German saboteurs set off a disastrous explosion on the Black Tom peninsula in Jersey City, New Jersey, in what is now part of Liberty State Park, close to Bedloe&#x27;s Island. Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Russia for its war efforts were detonated. The statue sustained minor damage, mostly to the torch-bearing right arm, and was closed for ten days. The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about . The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public-safety reasons, and it has remained closed ever since.

That same year, Ralph Pulitzer, who had succeeded his father Joseph as publisher of the &quot;World&quot;, began a drive to raise for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors, but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. Gutzon Borglum, who later sculpted Mount Rushmore, redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights, successfully illuminating the statue.

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the Liberty bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war&#x27;s stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue.

In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge used his authority under the Antiquities Act to declare the statue a national monument. A suicide occurred five years later when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death.

===Early National Park Service years (1933–1982)===
In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue to be transferred to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe&#x27;s Island. With the Army&#x27;s departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue&#x27;s halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.

During World War II, the statue remained open to visitors, although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts. It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on D-Day, June 6, 1944, when its lights flashed &quot;dot-dot-dot-dash&quot;, the Morse code for V, for victory. New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on V-E Day, the statue was once again illuminated after sunset. The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night. In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.

In 1956, an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe&#x27;s Island as Liberty Island, a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier. The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it. Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by the proclamation of President Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. In 1972, the immigration museum in the statue&#x27;s base was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon. The museum&#x27;s backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island.

In 1970, Ivy Bottini led a demonstration at the statue where she and others from the National Organization for Women&#x27;s New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read &quot;&quot; Beginning December 26, 1971, 15 anti-Vietnam War veterans occupied the statue, flying a US flag upside down from her crown. They left on December 28 following a federal court order. The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators who were publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence, opposition to abortion, and opposition to US intervention in Grenada. Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally.

A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976. The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail, a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island. The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.

===Renovation and rededication (1982–2000)===


The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986. In 1982, it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration. The engineers were faced with a lack of detailed drawings and documentation, as well as major structural changes in prior decades. A careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure. It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure. In addition, the head had been installed off center, and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind. The armature structure was badly corroded, and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced. Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936, when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed, much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years.

In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350 million in donations for the renovations of both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7 million to the restoration project.

In 1984, the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation. Workers erected the world&#x27;s largest free-standing scaffold, which obscured the statue from view. Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades, leaving two layers of coal tar, originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion. Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper. The restorers&#x27; work was hampered by the asbestos-based substance that Bartholdi had used—ineffectively, as inspections showed—to prevent galvanic corrosion. Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear, dubbed &quot;Moon suits&quot;, with self-contained breathing circuits. Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired, and new copper was added where necessary. The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs, which had a patina that closely resembled the statue&#x27;s; in exchange, the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing. The torch, found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations, was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi&#x27;s unaltered torch. Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead. The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one, whose flame is covered in 24-karat gold. The torch reflects the Sun&#x27;s rays in daytime and is lighted by floodlights at night.

The entire puddled iron armature designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant stainless steel bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing disability access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up to the level of the shoulder.

July 3–6, 1986, was designated &quot;Liberty Weekend&quot;, marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening. President Reagan presided over the rededication, with French President François Mitterrand in attendance. July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail, and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5. In Reagan&#x27;s dedication speech, he stated, &quot;We are the keepers of the flame of liberty; we hold it high for the world to see.&quot;

===Closures and reopenings (2001–present)===

Immediately following the September 11 attacks, the statue and Liberty Island were closed to the public. The island reopened at the end of 2001, while the pedestal and statue remained off-limits. The pedestal reopened in August 2004, but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration. New York Congressman Anthony Weiner made the statue&#x27;s reopening a personal crusade. On May 17, 2009, President Barack Obama&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, announced that as a &quot;special gift&quot; to America, the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4, but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day.

The statue, including the pedestal and base, closed on October 29, 2011, for installation of new elevators and staircases and to bring other facilities, such as restrooms, up to code. The statue was reopened on October 28, 2012, but then closed again a day later in advance of Hurricane Sandy. Although the storm did not harm the statue, it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty and Ellis Islands, including the dock used by the ferries that ran to Liberty and Ellis Islands. On November 8, 2012, a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done. Since Liberty Island had no electricity, a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night. The superintendent of Statue of Liberty National Monument, David Luchsinger—whose home on the island was severely damaged—stated that it would be &quot;optimistically ... months&quot; before the island was reopened to the public. The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4, 2013. Ellis Island remained closed for repairs for several more months but reopened in late October 2013.
The Statue of Liberty has also been closed due to government shutdowns and protests, as well as for disease pandemics. During the October 2013 United States federal government shutdown, Liberty Island and other federally funded sites were closed. In addition, Liberty Island was briefly closed on July 4, 2018, after a woman protesting against American immigration policy climbed onto the statue. However, the island remained open during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown because the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation had donated funds. It closed beginning on March 16, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 20, 2020, the Statue of Liberty reopened partially under New York City&#x27;s Phase IV guidelines, with Ellis Island remaining closed. The crown did not reopen until October 2022.

On October 7, 2016, construction started on the new Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island. The new $70 million, museum may be visited by all who come to the island, as opposed to the museum in the pedestal, which only 20% of the island&#x27;s visitors had access to. The new museum, designed by FXFOWLE Architects, is integrated with the surrounding parkland. Diane von Fürstenberg headed the fundraising for the museum, and the project received over $40 million in fundraising by groundbreaking. The museum opened on May 16, 2019.

==Access and attributes==
===Location and access===
The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island south of Ellis Island, which together comprise the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800. As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay&#x27;s midpoint, the original islands remain New York territory though located on the New Jersey side of the state line. Liberty Island is one of the islands that are part of the borough of Manhattan in New York. Land created by reclamation added to the original island at Ellis Island is New Jersey territory.

No charge is made for entrance to the national monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use, as private boats may not dock at the island. A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing Circle Line, which had operated the service since 1953. The ferries, which depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and the Battery in Lower Manhattan, also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public, making a combined trip possible. All ferry riders are subject to security screening, similar to airport procedures, prior to boarding.

Visitors intending to enter the statue&#x27;s base and pedestal must obtain pedestal access for a nominal fee when purchasing their ferry ticket. Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown must purchase a special ticket departing from either Battery Park or Liberty State Park, which may be reserved up to five months in advance for groups of up to four people. About 425 people per day may purchase tickets for the combined ferry, pedestal, and crown. 

Climbers may bring only medication, plastic water bottles, phones, and cameras—lockers are provided for other items—and must undergo a second security screening. The balcony around the torch was closed to the public following the munitions explosion on Black Tom Island in 1916. The balcony can however be seen live via webcam.

===Inscriptions, plaques, and dedications===

There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty.
* A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty, designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget, Gauthier et Cie (&quot;Cie&quot; is the French abbreviation analogous to &quot;Co.&quot;).
* A presentation tablet, also bearing Bartholdi&#x27;s name, declares the statue is a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors &quot;the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship.&quot;
* A tablet placed by the American Committee commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal.
* The cornerstone bears a plaque placed by the Freemasons.
* In 1903, a bronze tablet that bears the text of Emma Lazarus&#x27;s sonnet, &quot;The New Colossus&quot; (1883), was presented by friends of the poet. Until the 1986 renovation, it was mounted inside the pedestal; later, it resided in the Statue of Liberty Museum, in the base.
* &quot;The New Colossus&quot; tablet is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977, celebrating the poet&#x27;s life.

A group of statues stands at the western end of the island, honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty. Two Americans—Pulitzer and Lazarus—and three Frenchmen—Bartholdi, Eiffel, and Laboulaye—are depicted. They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner.

==Historical designations==
President Calvin Coolidge officially designated the Statue of Liberty as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument in 1924. The monument was expanded to also include Ellis Island in 1965. The following year, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island were jointly added to the National Register of Historic Places, and the statue individually in 2017. On the sub-national level, the Statue of Liberty National Monument was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was made a New York City designated landmark in 1976.

In 1984, the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The UNESCO &quot;Statement of Significance&quot; describes the statue as a &quot;masterpiece of the human spirit&quot; that &quot;endures as a highly potent symbol—inspiring contemplation, debate and protest—of ideals such as liberty, peace, human rights, abolition of slavery, democracy and opportunity.&quot;

==Measurements==

== Depictions ==

Hundreds of replicas of the Statue of Liberty are displayed worldwide. A smaller version of the statue, one-fourth the height of the original, was given by the American community in Paris to that city. It now stands on the Île aux Cygnes, facing west toward her larger sister. A replica tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64th Street in Manhattan for many years; it now resides at the Brooklyn Museum. In a patriotic tribute, the Boy Scouts of America, as part of their Strengthen the Arm of Liberty campaign in 1949–1952, donated about two hundred replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper and in height, to states and municipalities across the United States. Though not a true replica, the statue known as the Goddess of Democracy temporarily erected during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was similarly inspired by French democratic traditions—the sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty. Among other recreations of New York City structures, a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

As an American icon, the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country&#x27;s coinage and stamps. It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York&#x27;s 2001 entry in the state quarters series. An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997, and it was placed on the reverse, or tails, side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins. Two images of the statue&#x27;s torch appear on the current ten-dollar bill. The statue&#x27;s intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino.

Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions. Between 1986 and 2000, New York State issued license plates with an outline of the statue. The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association&#x27;s New York Liberty use both the statue&#x27;s name and its image in their logo, in which the torch&#x27;s flame doubles as a basketball. The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League depicted the statue&#x27;s head on their third jersey, beginning in 1997. The National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s 1996 Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four, played at New Jersey&#x27;s Meadowlands Sports Complex, featured the statue in its logo. The Libertarian Party of the United States uses the statue in its emblem.

The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture. In music, it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies, as in Toby Keith&#x27;s 2002 song &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)&quot;, and in opposition, appearing on the cover of the Dead Kennedys&#x27; album &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;, which protested the Reagan administration. In film, the torch is the setting for the climax of director Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1942 movie &quot;Saboteur&quot;. The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, in which it is seen half-buried in sand. It is knocked over in the science-fiction film &quot;Independence Day&quot; and in &quot;Cloverfield&quot; the head is ripped off. In Jack Finney&#x27;s 1970 time-travel novel &quot;Time and Again&quot;, the right arm of the statue, on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park, plays a crucial role. Robert Holdstock, consulting editor of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, wondered in 1979:

<doc id="28618" wikidata="Q3270773" url="?curid=28618" title="Speech coding">
<text>Speech coding is an application of data compression to digital audio signals containing speech. Speech coding uses speech-specific parameter estimation using audio signal processing techniques to model the speech signal, combined with generic data compression algorithms to represent the resulting modeled parameters in a compact bitstream.

Common applications of speech coding are mobile telephony and voice over IP (VoIP). The most widely used speech coding technique in mobile telephony is linear predictive coding (LPC), while the most widely used in VoIP applications are the LPC and modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) techniques.

The techniques employed in speech coding are similar to those used in audio data compression and audio coding where appreciation of psychoacoustics is used to transmit only data that is relevant to the human auditory system. For example, in voiceband speech coding, only information in the frequency band 400 to 3500 Hz is transmitted but the reconstructed signal retains adequate intelligibility.

Speech coding differs from other forms of audio coding in that speech is a simpler signal than other audio signals, and statistical information is available about the properties of speech. As a result, some auditory information that is relevant in general audio coding can be unnecessary in the speech coding context. Speech coding stresses the preservation of intelligibility and &quot;pleasantness&quot; of speech while using a constrained amount of transmitted data. In addition, most speech applications require low coding delay, as latency interferes with speech interaction.

== Categories ==
Speech coders are of two classes:
# Waveform coders
#* Time-domain: PCM, ADPCM
#* Frequency-domain: sub-band coding, ATRAC
# Vocoders
#* Linear predictive coding (LPC)
#* Formant coding
#* Machine learning, i.e. neural vocoder

== Sample companding viewed as a form of speech coding ==
The A-law and μ-law algorithms used in G.711 PCM digital telephony can be seen as an earlier precursor of speech encoding, requiring only 8 bits per sample but giving effectively 12 bits of resolution. Logarithmic companding are consistent with human hearing perception in that a low-amplitude noise is heard along a low-amplitude speech signal but is masked by a high-amplitude one. Although this would generate unacceptable distortion in a music signal, the peaky nature of speech waveforms, combined with the simple frequency structure of speech as a periodic waveform having a single fundamental frequency with occasional added noise bursts, make these very simple instantaneous compression algorithms acceptable for speech.

A wide variety of other algorithms were tried at the time, mostly delta modulation variants, but after careful consideration, the A-law/μ-law algorithms were chosen by the designers of the early digital telephony systems. At the time of their design, their 33% bandwidth reduction for a very low complexity made an excellent engineering compromise. Their audio performance remains acceptable, and there was no need to replace them in the stationary phone network.

In 2008, G.711.1 codec, which has a scalable structure, was standardized by ITU-T. The input sampling rate is 16 kHz.

== Modern speech compression ==
Much of the later work in speech compression was motivated by military research into digital communications for secure military radios, where very low data rates were used to achieve effective operation in a hostile radio environment. At the same time, far more processing power was available, in the form of VLSI circuits, than was available for earlier compression techniques. As a result, modern speech compression algorithms could use far more complex techniques than were available in the 1960s to achieve far higher compression ratios.

The most widely used speech coding algorithms are based on linear predictive coding (LPC). In particular, the most common speech coding scheme is the LPC-based code-excited linear prediction (CELP) coding, which is used for example in the GSM standard. In CELP, the modeling is divided in two stages, a linear predictive stage that models the spectral envelope and a code-book-based model of the residual of the linear predictive model. In CELP, linear prediction coefficients (LPC) are computed and quantized, usually as line spectral pairs (LSPs). In addition to the actual speech coding of the signal, it is often necessary to use channel coding for transmission, to avoid losses due to transmission errors. In order to get the best overall coding results, speech coding and channel coding methods are chosen in pairs, with the more important bits in the speech data stream protected by more robust channel coding.

The modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) is used in the LD-MDCT technique used by the AAC-LD format introduced in 1999. MDCT has since been widely adopted in voice-over-IP (VoIP) applications, such as the G.729.1 wideband audio codec introduced in 2006, Apple&#x27;s FaceTime (using AAC-LD) introduced in 2010, and the CELT codec introduced in 2011.

Opus is a free software audio coder. It combines the speech-oriented LPC-based SILK algorithm and the lower-latency MDCT-based CELT algorithm, switching between or combining them as needed for maximal efficiency. It is widely used for VoIP calls in WhatsApp. The PlayStation 4 video game console also uses Opus for its PlayStation Network system party chat.

A number of codecs with even lower bit rates have been demonstrated. Codec2, which operates at bit rates as low as , sees use in amateur radio. NATO currently uses MELPe, offering intelligible speech at and below. Neural vocoder approaches have also emerged: Lyra by Google gives an &quot;almost eerie&quot; quality at . Microsoft&#x27;s Satin also uses machine learning, but uses a higher tunable bitrate and is wideband.

<text>Stalinism (, ) is the totalitarian means of governing and Marxist–Leninist policies implemented in the Soviet Union (USSR) from 1924 to 1953 by dictator Joseph Stalin and in Soviet satellite states between 1944 and 1953. Stalinism included the creation of a one man totalitarian police state, rapid industrialization, the theory of socialism in one country (until 1939), forced collectivization of agriculture, intensification of class conflict, a cult of personality, and subordination of the interests of foreign communist parties to those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which Stalinism deemed the leading vanguard party of communist revolution at the time. After Stalin&#x27;s death and the Khrushchev Thaw, a period of de-Stalinization began in the 1950s and 1960s, which caused the influence of Stalin&#x27;s ideology to begin to wane in the USSR.

Stalin&#x27;s regime forcibly purged society of what it saw as threats to itself and its brand of communism (so-called &quot;enemies of the people&quot;), which included political dissidents, non-Soviet nationalists, the bourgeoisie, better-off peasants (&quot;kulaks&quot;), and those of the working class who demonstrated &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; sympathies. This resulted in mass repression of such people and their families, including mass arrests, show trials, executions, and imprisonment in forced labor camps known as gulags. The most notorious examples were the Great Purge and the Dekulakization campaign. Stalinism was also marked by militant atheism, mass anti-religious persecution, and ethnic cleansing through forced deportations. Some historians, such as Robert Service, have blamed Stalinist policies, particularly collectivization, for causing famines such as the Holodomor. Other historians and scholars disagree on Stalinism&#x27;s role.

== History ==

Stalinism is used to describe the period during which Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union while serving as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1922 to his death on 5 March 1953. It was a development of Leninism, and while Stalin avoided using the term &quot;Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism&quot;, he allowed others to do so. Following Lenin&#x27;s death, Stalin contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;. This concept was intricately linked to factional struggles within the party, particularly against Trotsky. He first developed the idea in December 1924, and elaborated upon it in his writings of 1925–26.

Stalin&#x27;s doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that its final victory could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For this reason, he retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism. Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, he believed that the Soviet state would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism. This concept synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals, and served to discredit Trotsky—who promoted the idea of &quot;permanent revolution&quot;—by presenting the latter as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers&#x27; abilities to construct socialism.

=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;Stalinism&quot; came into prominence during the mid-1930s when Lazar Kaganovich, a Soviet politician and associate of Stalin, reportedly declared: &quot;Let&#x27;s replace Long Live Leninism with Long Live Stalinism!&quot; Stalin dismissed this as excessive and contributing to a cult of personality he thought might later be used against him by the same people who praised him excessively, one of those being Khrushchev—a prominent user of the term during Stalin&#x27;s life who was later responsible for de-Stalinization and the beginning of the Khrushchev Thaw era.

== Stalinist policies ==
Some historians view Stalinism as a reflection of the ideologies of Leninism and Marxism, but some argue that it is separate from the socialist ideals it stemmed from. After a political struggle that culminated in the defeat of the Bukharinists (the &quot;Party&#x27;s Right Tendency&quot;), Stalinism was free to shape policy without opposition, ushering in an era of harsh totalitarianism that worked toward rapid industrialization regardless of the human cost.

From 1917 to 1924, though often appearing united, Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky had discernible ideological differences. In his dispute with Trotsky, Stalin de-emphasized the role of workers in advanced capitalist countries (e.g., he considered the U.S. working class &quot;bourgeoisified&quot; labor aristocracy).

All other October Revolution 1917 Bolshevik leaders regarded their revolution more or less as just the beginning, with Russia as the springboard on the road toward worldwide revolution. Stalin introduced the idea of socialism in one country by the autumn of 1924, a theory standing in sharp contrast to Trotsky&#x27;s permanent revolution and all earlier socialistic theses. The revolution did not spread outside Russia as Lenin had assumed it soon would. The revolution had not succeeded even within other former territories of the Russian Empire―such as Poland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. On the contrary, these countries had returned to capitalist bourgeois rule.

Despite this, by the autumn of 1924, Stalin&#x27;s notion of socialism in Soviet Russia was initially considered next to blasphemy by other Politburo members, including Zinoviev and Kamenev to the intellectual left; Rykov, Bukharin, and Tomsky to the pragmatic right; and the powerful Trotsky, who belonged to no side but his own. None would even consider Stalin&#x27;s concept a potential addition to communist ideology. Stalin&#x27;s socialism in one country doctrine could not be imposed until he had come close to being the Soviet Union&#x27;s autocratic ruler around 1929. Bukharin and the Right Opposition expressed their support for imposing Stalin&#x27;s ideas, as Trotsky had been exiled, and Zinoviev and Kamenev had been expelled from the party. In a 1936 interview with journalist Roy W. Howard, Stalin articulated his rejection of world revolution and said, &quot;We never had such plans and intentions&quot; and &quot;The export of revolution is nonsense&quot;.

=== Proletarian state ===
Traditional communist thought holds that the state will gradually &quot;wither away&quot; as the implementation of socialism reduces class distinction. But Stalin argued that the proletarian state (as opposed to the bourgeois state) must become stronger before it can wither away. In Stalin&#x27;s view, counter-revolutionary elements will attempt to derail the transition to full communism, and the state must be powerful enough to defeat them. For this reason, communist regimes influenced by Stalin are totalitarian. Other leftists, such as anarcho-communists, have criticized the party-state of the Stalin-era Soviet Union, accusing it of being bureaucratic and calling it a reformist social democracy rather than a form of revolutionary communism.

Sheng Shicai, a Chinese warlord with Communist leanings, invited Soviet intervention and allowed Stalinist rule to extend to Xinjiang province in the 1930s. In 1937, Sheng conducted a purge similar to the Great Purge, imprisoning, torturing, and killing about 100,000 people, many of them Uyghurs.

=== Ideological repression and censorship ===

Under Stalin, repression was extended to academic scholarship, the natural sciences, and literary fields. In particular, Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity was subject to public denunciation, many of his ideas were rejected on ideological grounds and condemned as &quot;bourgeois idealism&quot; in the Stalin era.

A policy of ideological repression impacted various disciplinary fields such as genetics, cybernetics, biology, linguistics, physics, sociology, psychology, pedology, mathematical logic, economics and statistics.

Pseudoscientific theories of Trofim Lysenko were favoured over scientific genetics during the Stalin era. Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko. Over 3,000 biologists were imprisoned, fired, or executed for attempting to oppose Lysenkoism and genetic research was effectively destroyed until the death of Stalin in 1953. Due to the ideological influence of Lysenkoism, crop yields in the USSR declined.

Orthodoxy was enforced in the cultural sphere. Prior to Stalin&#x27;s rule, literary, religious and national representatives had some level of autonomy in the 1920s but these groups were later rigorously repressed during the Stalinist era. Socialist realism was imposed in artistic production and other creative industries such as music, film and sport were subject to extreme levels of political control.

Historical falsification of political events such as the October Revolution and the Brest-Litovsk Treaty became a distinctive element of Stalin&#x27;s regime. A notable example is the 1938 publication, &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)&quot;, in which the history of the governing party was significantly altered and revised including the importance of the leading figures during the Bolshevik revolution. Retrospectively, Lenin&#x27;s primary associates such as Zinoviev, Trotsky, Radek and Bukharin were presented as &quot;vacillating&quot;, &quot;opportunists&quot; and &quot;foreign spies&quot; whereas Stalin was depicted as the chief discipline during the revolution. However, in reality, Stalin was considered a relatively unknown figure with secondary importance at the time of the event.

In his book, &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot;, Leon Trotsky argued that the Stalinist faction routinely distorted political events, forged a theoretical basis for irreconcilable concepts such as the notion of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; and misrepresented the views of opponents through an array of employed historians alongside economists to justify policy manoeuvering and safeguarding its own set of material interests. He cited a range of historical documents such as private letters, telegrams, party speeches, meeting minutes, and suppressed texts such as Lenin&#x27;s Testament. British historian Orlando Figes argued that &quot;The urge to silence Trotsky, and all criticism of the Politburo, was in itself a crucial factor in Stalin&#x27;s rise to power&quot;.

Cinematic productions served to foster the cult of personality around Stalin with adherents to the party line receiving Stalin prizes. However, film directors and their assistants were still liable to mass arrests during the Great Terror.
Censorship of films contributed to a mythologizing of history as seen with the films &quot;First Cavalry Army&quot; (1941) and &quot;Defence of Tsaritsyn&quot; (1942) in which Stalin was glorified as a central figure to the October Revolution. Conversely, the roles of other Soviet figures such as Lenin and Trotsky were diminished or misrepresented.

=== Cult of personality ===

In the aftermath of the succession struggle, in which Stalin had defeated both Left and Right Opposition, a cult of Stalin had materialised. From 1929 until 1953, there was a proliferation of architecture, statues, posters, banners and iconography featuring Stalin in which he was increasingly identified with the state and seen as an emblem of Marxism. In July 1930, a state decree instructed 200 artists to prepare propaganda posters for the Five Year Plans and collectivsation measures. Historian Anita Pisch drew specific focus to the various manifestations of the personality cult in which Stalin was associated with the &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Saviour&quot; and &quot;Warrior&quot; cultural archetypes with the latter imagery having gained ascendency during the Great Patrotic War and Cold War.

Some scholars have argued that Stalin took an active involvement with the construction of the cult of personality with writers such as Isaac Deutscher and Erik van Ree noting that Stalin had absorbed elements from the cult of Tsars, Orthodox Christianity and highlighting specific acts such as Lenin&#x27;s embalming. Yet, other scholars have drawn on primary accounts from Stalin&#x27;s associates such as Molotov which suggested he took a more critical and ambivalent attitude towards his cult of personality.

The cult of personality served to legitimate Stalin&#x27;s authority, establish continuity with Lenin as his &quot;discipline, student and mentee&quot; in the view of his wider followers. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, would later denounce the cult of personality around Stalin as contradictory to Leninist principles and party discourse.

=== Class-based violence ===
Stalin blamed the kulaks for inciting reactionary violence against the people during the implementation of agricultural collectivization. In response, the state, under Stalin&#x27;s leadership, initiated a violent campaign against them. This kind of campaign was later known as &quot;classicide&quot;, though several international legislatures have passed resolutions declaring the campaign a genocide. Some historians dispute that these social-class actions constitute genocide.

=== Purges and executions ===
As head of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin consolidated nearly absolute power in the 1930s with a Great Purge of the party that claimed to expel &quot;opportunists&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionary infiltrators&quot;. Those targeted by the purge were often expelled from the party; more severe measures ranged from banishment to the Gulag labor camps to execution after trials held by NKVD troikas.

In the 1930s, Stalin became increasingly worried about Leningrad party head Sergei Kirov&#x27;s growing popularity. At the 1934 Party Congress, where the vote for the new Central Committee was held, Kirov received only three negative votes (the fewest of any candidate), while Stalin received over 100. After Kirov&#x27;s assassination, which Stalin may have orchestrated, Stalin invented a detailed scheme to implicate opposition leaders in the murder, including Trotsky, Lev Kamenev, and Grigory Zinoviev. Thereafter, the investigations and trials expanded. Stalin passed a new law on &quot;terrorist organizations and terrorist acts&quot; that were to be investigated for no more than ten days, with no prosecution, defense attorneys, or appeals, followed by a sentence to be imposed &quot;quickly.&quot; Stalin&#x27;s Politburo also issued directives on quotas for mass arrests and executions. Under Stalin, the death penalty was extended to adolescents as young as 12 years old in 1935.

After that, several trials, known as the Moscow Trials, were held, but the procedures were replicated throughout the country. Article 58 of the legal code, which listed prohibited anti-Soviet activities as a counter-revolutionary crime, was applied most broadly. Many alleged anti-Soviet pretexts were used to brand individuals as &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, starting the cycle of public persecution, often proceeding to interrogation, torture, and deportation, if not death. The Russian word &quot;troika&quot; thereby gained a new meaning: a quick, simplified trial by a committee of three subordinated to the NKVD troika—with sentencing carried out within 24 hours. Stalin&#x27;s hand-picked executioner Vasili Blokhin was entrusted with carrying out some of the high-profile executions in this period.

Many military leaders were convicted of treason, and a large-scale purge of Red Army officers followed. The repression of many formerly high-ranking revolutionaries and party members led Trotsky to claim that a &quot;river of blood&quot; separated Stalin&#x27;s regime from Lenin&#x27;s. In August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, where he had lived in exile since January 1937. This eliminated the last of Stalin&#x27;s opponents among the former Party leadership.

Mass operations of the NKVD also targeted &quot;national contingents&quot; (foreign ethnicities) such as Poles, ethnic Germans, and Koreans. A total of 350,000 (144,000 of them Poles) were arrested and 247,157 (110,000 Poles) were executed. Many Americans who had emigrated to the Soviet Union during the worst of the Great Depression were executed, while others were sent to prison camps or gulags. Concurrent with the purges, efforts were made to rewrite the history in Soviet textbooks and other propaganda materials. Notable people executed by NKVD were removed from the texts and photographs as though they had never existed.

In light of revelations from Soviet archives, historians now estimate that nearly 700,000 people (353,074 in 1937 and 328,612 in 1938) were executed in the course of the terror, the great mass of them ordinary Soviet citizens: workers, peasants, homemakers, teachers, priests, musicians, soldiers, pensioners, ballerinas, and beggars. Scholars estimate the total death toll for the Great Purge (1936–1938) including fatalities attributed to imprisonment to be roughly 700,000-1.2 million. Many of the executed were interred in mass graves, with some significant killing and burial sites being Bykivnia, Kurapaty, and Butovo.
Some Western experts believe the evidence released from the Soviet archives is understated, incomplete or unreliable. Conversely, historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft, who spent much of his career researching the archives, contends that, before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the archives for historical research, &quot;our understanding of the scale and the nature of Soviet repression has been extremely poor&quot; and that some specialists who wish to maintain earlier high estimates of the Stalinist death toll are &quot;finding it difficult to adapt to the new circumstances when the archives are open and when there are plenty of irrefutable data&quot; and instead &quot;hang on to their old Sovietological methods with round-about calculations based on odd statements from emigres and other informants who are supposed to have superior knowledge.&quot;

Stalin personally signed 357 proscription lists in 1937 and 1938 that condemned 40,000 people to execution, about 90% of whom are confirmed to have been shot. While reviewing one such list, he reportedly muttered to no one in particular: &quot;Who&#x27;s going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one.&quot; In addition, Stalin dispatched a contingent of NKVD operatives to Mongolia, established a Mongolian version of the NKVD &quot;troika&quot;, and unleashed a bloody purge in which tens of thousands were executed as &quot;Japanese spies&quot;, as Mongolian ruler Khorloogiin Choibalsan closely followed Stalin&#x27;s lead. Stalin had ordered for 100,000 Buddhist lamas in Mongolia to be liquidated but the political leader Peljidiin Genden resisted the order.

Under Stalinist influence in the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, an estimated 17,000 monks were killed, official figures show. Stalinist forces also oversaw purges of anti-Stalinist elements among the Spanish Republican insurgents, including the Trotskyist allied POUM faction and anarchist groups, during the Spanish Civil War.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the Soviet leadership sent NKVD squads into other countries to murder defectors and opponents of the Soviet regime. Victims of such plots included Trotsky, Yevhen Konovalets, Ignace Poretsky, Rudolf Klement, Alexander Kutepov, Evgeny Miller, and the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) leadership in Catalonia (e.g., Andréu Nin Pérez). Joseph Berger-Barzilai, co-founder of the Communist Party of Palestine, spent twenty five years in Stalin&#x27;s prisons and concentrations camps after the purges in 1937.

=== Deportations ===
Shortly before, during, and immediately after World War II, Stalin conducted a series of deportations that profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union. Separatism, resistance to Soviet rule, and collaboration with the invading Germans were the official reasons for the deportations. Individual circumstances of those spending time in German-occupied territories were not examined. After the brief Nazi occupation of the Caucasus, the entire population of five of the small highland peoples and the Crimean Tatars—more than a million people in total—were deported without notice or any opportunity to take their possessions.

As a result of Stalin&#x27;s lack of trust in the loyalty of particular ethnicities, groups such as the Soviet Koreans, Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Chechens, and many Poles, were forcibly moved out of strategic areas and relocated to places in the central Soviet Union, especially Kazakhstan. By some estimates, hundreds of thousands of deportees may have died en route. It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949, nearly 3.3 million people were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. By some estimates, up to 43% of the resettled population died of diseases and malnutrition.

According to official Soviet estimates, more than 14 million people passed through the gulags from 1929 to 1953, with a further 7 to 8 million deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union (including entire nationalities in several cases). The emergent scholarly consensus is that from 1930 to 1953, around 1.5 to 1.7 million perished in the gulag system. In February 1956, Nikita Khrushchev condemned the deportations as a violation of Leninism and reversed most of them, although it was not until 1991 that the Tatars, Meskhetians, and Volga Germans were allowed to return &quot;en masse&quot; to their homelands.

=== Economic policy ===
At the start of the 1930s, Stalin launched a wave of radical economic policies that completely overhauled the industrial and agricultural face of the Soviet Union. This became known as the Great Turn as Russia turned away from the mixed-economic type New Economic Policy (NEP) and adopted a planned economy. Lenin implemented the NEP to ensure the survival of the socialist state following seven years of war (World War I, 1914–1917, and the subsequent Civil War, 1917–1921) and rebuilt Soviet production to its 1913 levels. But Russia still lagged far behind the West, and Stalin and the majority of the Communist Party felt the NEP not only to be compromising communist ideals but also not delivering satisfactory economic performance or creating the envisaged socialist society.

According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation. Trotsky maintained that the disproportions and imbalances which became characteristic of Stalinist planning in the 1930s such as the underdeveloped consumer base along with the priority focus on heavy industry were due to a number of avoidable problems. He argued that the industrial drive had been enacted under more severe circumstances, several years later and in a less rational manner than originally conceived by the Left Opposition.

Officially designed to accelerate development toward communism, the need for industrialization in the Soviet Union was emphasized because the Soviet Union had previously fallen behind economically compared to Western countries and also because socialist society needed industry to face the challenges posed by internal and external enemies of communism. Rapid industrialization was accompanied by mass collectivization of agriculture and rapid urbanization, which converted many small villages into industrial cities. To accelerate industrialization&#x27;s development, Stalin imported materials, ideas, expertise, and workers from western Europe and the United States, pragmatically setting up joint-venture contracts with major American private enterprises such as the Ford Motor Company, which, under state supervision, assisted in developing the basis of the industry of the Soviet economy from the late 1920s to the 1930s. After the American private enterprises had completed their tasks, Soviet state enterprises took over.

Fredric Jameson has said that &quot;Stalinism was…a success and fulfilled its historic mission, socially as well as economically&quot; given that it &quot;modernized the Soviet Union, transforming a peasant society into an industrial state with a literate population and a remarkable scientific superstructure.&quot; Robert Conquest disputes that conclusion, writing, &quot;Russia had already been fourth to fifth among industrial economies before World War I&quot;, and that Russian industrial advances could have been achieved without collectivization, famine, or terror. According to Conquest, the industrial successes were far less than claimed, and the Soviet-style industrialization was &quot;an anti-innovative dead-end.&quot; Stephen Kotkin said those who argue collectivization was necessary are &quot;dead wrong&quot;, writing that it &quot;only seemed necessary within the straitjacket of Communist ideology and its repudiation of capitalism. And economically, collectivization failed to deliver.&quot; Kotkin further claimed that it decreased harvests instead of increasing them, as peasants tended to resist heavy taxes by producing fewer goods, caring only about their own subsistence.

According to several Western historians, Stalinist agricultural policies were a key factor in the Soviet famine of 1930–1933; some scholars believe that Holodomor, which started near the end of 1932, was when the famine turned into an instrument of genocide; the Ukrainian government now recognizes it as such. Some scholars dispute the intentionality of the famine.

=== Social issues ===
The Stalinist era was largely regressive on social issues. Despite a brief period of decriminalization under Lenin, the 1934 Criminal Code re-criminalized homosexuality. Abortion was made illegal again in 1936 after controversial debate among citizens, and women&#x27;s issues were largely ignored.

== Relationship to Leninism ==

Stalin considered the political and economic system under his rule to be Marxism–Leninism, which he considered the only legitimate successor of Marxism and Leninism. The historiography of Stalin is diverse, with many different aspects of continuity and discontinuity between the regimes Stalin and Lenin proposed. Some historians, such as Richard Pipes, consider Stalinism the natural consequence of Leninism: Stalin &quot;faithfully implemented Lenin&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy programs.&quot; Robert Service writes that &quot;institutionally and ideologically Lenin laid the foundations for a Stalin [...] but the passage from Leninism to the worse terrors of Stalinism was not smooth and inevitable.&quot; Likewise, historian and Stalin biographer Edvard Radzinsky believes that Stalin was a genuine follower of Lenin, exactly as he claimed. Another Stalin biographer, Stephen Kotkin, wrote that &quot;his violence was not the product of his subconscious but of the Bolshevik engagement with Marxist–Leninist ideology.&quot;
Dmitri Volkogonov, who wrote biographies of both Lenin and Stalin, wrote that during the 1960s through 1980s, an official patriotic Soviet de-Stalinized view of the Lenin–Stalin relationship (during the Khrushchev Thaw and later) was that the overly autocratic Stalin had distorted the Leninism of the wise &quot;dedushka&quot; Lenin. But Volkogonov also lamented that this view eventually dissolved for those like him who had the scales fall from their eyes immediately before and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After researching the biographies in the Soviet archives, he came to the same conclusion as Radzinsky and Kotkin (that Lenin had built a culture of violent autocratic totalitarianism of which Stalinism was a logical extension). 

Proponents of continuity cite a variety of contributory factors, such as that Lenin, not Stalin, introduced the Red Terror with its hostage-taking and internment camps, and that Lenin developed the infamous Article 58 and established the autocratic system in the Communist Party. They also note that Lenin put a ban on factions within the Russian Communist Party and introduced the one-party state in 1921—a move that enabled Stalin to get rid of his rivals easily after Lenin&#x27;s death and cite Felix Dzerzhinsky, who, during the Bolshevik struggle against opponents in the Russian Civil War, exclaimed: &quot;We stand for organized terror—this should be frankly stated.&quot;

Opponents of this view include revisionist historians and many post–Cold War and otherwise dissident Soviet historians, including Roy Medvedev, who argues that although &quot;one could list the various measures carried out by Stalin that were actually a continuation of anti-democratic trends and measures implemented under Lenin…in so many ways, Stalin acted, not in line with Lenin&#x27;s clear instructions, but in defiance of them.&quot; In doing so, some historians have tried to distance Stalinism from Leninism to undermine the totalitarian view that Stalin&#x27;s methods were inherent in communism from the start. Other revisionist historians such as Orlando Figes, while critical of the Soviet era, acknowledge that Lenin actively sought to counter Stalin&#x27;s growing influence, allying with Trotsky in 1922–23, opposing Stalin on foreign trade, and proposing party reforms including the democratization of the Central Committee and recruitment of 50-100 ordinary workers into the party&#x27;s lower organs.

Critics include anti-Stalinist communists such as Trotsky, who pointed out that Lenin attempted to persuade the Communist Party to remove Stalin from his post as its General Secretary.Trotsky also argued that he and Lenin had intended to lift the ban on the opposition parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as soon as the economic and social conditions of Soviet Russia had improved. Lenin&#x27;s Testament, the document containing this order, was suppressed after Lenin&#x27;s death. Various historians have cited Lenin&#x27;s proposal to appoint Trotsky as a Vice-chairman of the Soviet Union as evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government. In his biography of Trotsky, British historian Isaac Deutscher writes that, faced with the evidence, &quot;only the blind and the deaf could be unaware of the contrast between Stalinism and Leninism.&quot; Similarly, historian Moshe Lewin writes, &quot;The Soviet regime underwent a long period of &#x27;Stalinism,&#x27; which in its basic features was diametrically opposed to the recommendations of [Lenin&#x27;s] testament&quot;. French historian Pierre Broue disputes the historical assessments of the early Soviet Union by modern historians such as Dmitri Volkogonov, which Broue argues falsely equate Leninism, Stalinism and Trotskyism to present the notion of ideological continuity and reinforce the position of counter-communism.

Some scholars have attributed the establishment of the one-party system in the Soviet Union to the wartime conditions imposed on Lenin&#x27;s government; others have highlighted the initial attempts to form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. According to historian Marcel Liebman, Lenin&#x27;s wartime measures such as banning opposition parties was prompted by the fact that several political parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, participated in sabotage, collaborated with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. Liebman also argues that the banning of parties under Lenin did not have the same repressive character as later bans enforced by Stalin&#x27;s regime. Several scholars have highlighted the socially progressive nature of Lenin&#x27;s policies, such as universal education, healthcare, and equal rights for women. Conversely, Stalin&#x27;s regime reversed Lenin&#x27;s policies on social matters such as sexual equality, legal restrictions on marriage, rights of sexual minorities, and protective legislation. Historian Robert Vincent Daniels also views the Stalinist period as a counterrevolution in Soviet cultural life that revived patriotic propaganda, the Tsarist programme of Russification and traditional, military ranks that Lenin had criticized as expressions of &quot;Great Russian chauvinism&quot;. Daniels also regards Stalinism as an abrupt break with the Leninist period in terms of economic policies in which a deliberated, scientific system of economic planning that featured former Menshevik economists at Gosplan was replaced by a hasty version of planning with unrealistic targets, bureaucractic waste, bottlenecks and shortages.
In his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, delivered in 1956, Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin&#x27;s successor, argued that Stalin&#x27;s regime differed profusely from the leadership of Lenin. He was critical of the cult of the individual constructed around Stalin whereas Lenin stressed &quot;the role of the people as the creator of history&quot;. He also emphasized that Lenin favored a collective leadership that relied on personal persuasion and recommended Stalin&#x27;s removal as General Secretary. Khrushchev contrasted this with Stalin&#x27;s &quot;despotism&quot;, which required absolute submission to his position, and highlighted that many of the people later annihilated as &quot;enemies of the party ... had worked with Lenin during his life&quot;. He also contrasted the &quot;severe methods&quot; Lenin used in the &quot;most necessary cases&quot; as a &quot;struggle for survival&quot; during the Civil War with the extreme methods and mass repressions Stalin used even when the revolution was &quot;already victorious&quot;. In his memoirs, Khrushchev argued that his widespread purges of the &quot;most advanced nucleus of people&quot; among the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and scientific fields had &quot;undoubtedly&quot; weakened the nation. According to Stalin&#x27;s secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Stalin was jubilant over Lenin&#x27;s death while &quot;publicly putting on the mask of grief&quot;.

Some Marxist theoreticians have disputed the view that Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks&#x27; actions, as Stalin eliminated most of the original central committee members from 1917. George Novack stressed the Bolsheviks&#x27; initial efforts to form a government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the Constituent Assembly for several reasons. They cited the outdated voter rolls, which did not acknowledge the split among the Socialist Revolutionary party, and the assembly&#x27;s conflict with the Congress of the Soviets as an alternative democratic structure.

A similar analysis is present in more recent works, such as those of Graeme Gill, who argues that Stalinism was &quot;not a natural flow-on of earlier developments; [it formed a] sharp break resulting from conscious decisions by leading political actors.&quot; But Gill adds that &quot;difficulties with the use of the term reflect problems with the concept of Stalinism itself. The major difficulty is a lack of agreement about what should constitute Stalinism.&quot; Revisionist historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have criticized the focus on the upper levels of society and the use of Cold War concepts such as totalitarianism, which have obscured the reality of the system.

Russian historian Vadim Rogovin writes, &quot;Under Lenin, the freedom to express a real variety of opinions existed in the party, and in carrying out political decisions, consideration was given to the positions of not only the majority, but a minority in the party&quot;. He compared this practice with subsequent leadership blocs, which violated party tradition, ignored opponents&#x27; proposals, and expelled the Opposition from the party on falsified charges, culminating in the Moscow Trials of 1936–1938. According to Rogovin, 80-90% of the members of the Central Committee elected at the Sixth through the Seventeenth Congresses were killed. The Right and Left Opposition have been held by some scholars as representing political alternatives to Stalinism despite their shared beliefs in Leninism due to their policy platforms which were at variance with Stalin. This ranged from areas related to economics, foreign policy and cultural matters.

== Legacy ==

In Western historiography, Stalin is considered one of the worst and most notorious figures in modern history. Biographer and historian Isaac Deutscher highlighted the totalitarian character of Stalinism and its suppression of &quot;socialist inspiration&quot;. 

Several scholars have derided Stalinism for fostering anti-intellectual, antisemitic and chauvinistic attitudes within the Soviet Union. According to Marxist philosopher Helena Sheehan, his philosophical legacy is almost universally rated negatively with most Soviet sources considering his influence to have negatively impacted the creative development of Soviet philosophy. Sheehan discussed omissions in his views on dialectics and noted that most Soviet philosophers rejected his characterization of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy.

Pierre du Bois argues that the cult of personality around Stalin was elaborately constructed to legitimize his rule. Many deliberate distortions and falsehoods were used. The Kremlin refused access to archival records that might reveal the truth, and critical documents were destroyed. Photographs were altered and documents were invented. People who knew Stalin were forced to provide &quot;official&quot; accounts to meet the ideological demands of the cult, especially as Stalin presented it in 1938 in &quot;Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)&quot;, which became the official history. Historian David L. Hoffmann sums up the consensus of scholars: &quot;The Stalin cult was a central element of Stalinism, and as such, it was one of the most salient features of Soviet rule. [...] Many scholars of Stalinism cite the cult as integral to Stalin&#x27;s power or as evidence of Stalin&#x27;s megalomania.&quot;

But after Stalin died in 1953, Khrushchev repudiated his policies and condemned his cult of personality in his Secret Speech to the Twentieth Party Congress in 1956, instituting de-Stalinization and relative liberalization, within the same political framework. Consequently, the world&#x27;s communist parties that previously adhered to Stalinism, except the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Romania, abandoned it and, to a greater or lesser degree, adopted Khrushchev&#x27;s positions. The Chinese Communist Party chose to split from the Soviet Union, resulting in the Sino-Soviet split. 

=== Maoism and Hoxhaism ===
Mao Zedong famously declared that Stalin was 70% good and 30% bad. Maoists criticized Stalin chiefly for his view that bourgeois influence within the Soviet Union was primarily a result of external forces, to the almost complete exclusion of internal forces, and his view that class contradictions ended after the basic construction of socialism. Mao also criticized Stalin&#x27;s cult of personality and the excesses of the great purge. But Maoists praised Stalin for leading the Soviet Union and the international proletariat, defeating fascism in Germany, and his anti-revisionism.

Taking the side of the Chinese Communist Party in the Sino-Soviet split, the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania remained committed, at least theoretically, to its brand of Stalinism (Hoxhaism) for decades under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. Despite their initial cooperation against &quot;revisionism&quot;, Hoxha denounced Mao as a revisionist, along with almost every other self-identified communist organization worldwide, resulting in the Sino-Albanian split. This effectively isolated Albania from the rest of the world, as Hoxha was hostile to both the pro-American and pro-Soviet spheres of influence and the Non-Aligned Movement under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, whom Hoxha had also previously denounced.

=== Trotskyism ===

Leon Trotsky always viewed Stalin as the &quot;candidate for grave-digger of our party and the revolution&quot; during the succession struggle. American historian Robert Vincent Daniels viewed Trotsky and the Left Opposition as a critical alternative to the Stalin-Bukharin majority in a number of areas. Daniels stated that the Left Opposition would have prioritised industrialisation but never contemplated the &quot;violent uprooting&quot; employed by Stalin and contrasted most directly with Stalinism on the issue of party democratization and bureaucratization. Trotsky also opposed the policy of forced collectivisation under Stalin and favoured a voluntary, gradual approach towards agricultural production with greater tolerance for the rights of Soviet Ukrainians.

Trotskyists argue that the Stalinist Soviet Union was neither socialist nor communist but a bureaucratized degenerated workers&#x27; state—that is, a non-capitalist state in which exploitation is controlled by a ruling caste that, although not owning the means of production and not constituting a social class in its own right, accrues benefits and privileges at the working class&#x27;s expense. Trotsky believed that the Bolshevik Revolution must be spread all over the globe&#x27;s working class, the proletarians, for world revolution. But after the failure of the revolution in Germany, Stalin reasoned that industrializing and consolidating Bolshevism in Russia would best serve the proletariat in the long run. The dispute did not end until Trotsky was murdered in his Mexican villa in 1940 by Stalinist assassin Ramón Mercader. Max Shachtman, a principal Trotskyist theorist in the U.S., argued that the Soviet Union had evolved from a degenerated worker&#x27;s state to a new mode of production called &quot;bureaucratic collectivism&quot;, whereby orthodox Trotskyists considered the Soviet Union an ally gone astray. Shachtman and his followers thus argued for the formation of a Third Camp opposed to the Soviet and capitalist blocs equally. By the mid-20th century, Shachtman and many of his associates, such as Social Democrats, USA, identified as social democrats rather than Trotskyists, while some ultimately abandoned socialism altogether and embraced neoconservatism. In the U.K., Tony Cliff independently developed a critique of state capitalism that resembled Shachtman&#x27;s in some respects but retained a commitment to revolutionary communism. Similarly, American Trotskyist David North drew attention to the fact that the generation of bureaucrats that rose to power under Stalin&#x27;s tutelage presided over the Soviet Union&#x27;s stagnation and breakdown.

Trotskyist historian Vadim Rogovin believed Stalinism had &quot;discredited the idea of socialism in the eyes of millions of people throughout the world&quot;. Rogovin also argued that the Left Opposition, led by Trotsky, was a political movement that &quot;offered a real alternative to Stalinism, and that to crush this movement was the primary function of the Stalinist terror&quot;. According to Rogovin, Stalin had destroyed thousands of foreign communists capable of leading socialist change in their respective countries. He cited 600 active Bulgarian communists who perished in his prison camps along with the thousands of German communists whom Stalin handed over to the Gestapo after the signing of the German-Soviet pact. Rogovin further noted that 16 members of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party became victims of Stalinist terror. Repressive measures were also enforced upon the Hungarian, Yugoslav and other Polish Communist parties. British historian Terence Brotherstone argued that the Stalin era had a profound effect on those attracted to Trotsky&#x27;s ideas. Brotherstone described figures who emerged from the Stalinist parties as miseducated, which he said helped to block the development of Marxism.

=== Other interpretations ===

Some historians and writers, such as Dietrich Schwanitz, draw parallels between Stalinism and the economic policy of Tsar Peter the Great; Schwanitz in particular views Stalin as &quot;a monstrous reincarnation&quot; of him. Both men wanted Russia to leave the western European states far behind in terms of development. Some reviewers have considered Stalinism a form of &quot;red fascism&quot;. Fascist regimes ideologically opposed the Soviet Union, but some regarded Stalinism favorably for evolving Bolshevism into a form of fascism. Benito Mussolini saw Stalinism as having transformed Soviet Bolshevism into a Slavic fascism.

British historian Michael Ellman writes that mass deaths from famines are not a &quot;uniquely Stalinist evil&quot;, noting that famines and droughts have been a common occurrence in Russian history, including the Russian famine of 1921–22, which occurred before Stalin came to power. He also notes that famines were widespread worldwide in the 19th and 20th centuries in countries such as India, Ireland, Russia and China. Ellman compares the Stalinist regime&#x27;s behavior vis-à-vis the Holodomor to that of the British government (toward Ireland and India) and the G8 in contemporary times, arguing that the G8 &quot;are guilty of mass manslaughter or mass deaths from criminal negligence because of their not taking obvious measures to reduce mass deaths&quot; and that Stalin&#x27;s &quot;behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&quot;.

David L. Hoffmann questions whether Stalinist practices of state violence derive from socialist ideology. Placing Stalinism in an international context, he argues that many forms of state interventionism the Stalinist government used, including social cataloguing, surveillance and concentration camps, predate the Soviet regime and originated outside of Russia. He further argues that technologies of social intervention developed in conjunction with the work of 19th-century European reformers and greatly expanded during World War I, when state actors in all the combatant countries dramatically increased efforts to mobilize and control their populations. According to Hoffman, the Soviet state was born at this moment of total war and institutionalized state intervention practices as permanent features.

In &quot;The Mortal Danger: Misconceptions about Soviet Russia and the Threat to America&quot;, anti-communist and Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn argues that the use of the term &quot;Stalinism&quot; hides the inevitable effects of communism as a whole on human liberty. He writes that the concept of Stalinism was developed after 1956 by Western intellectuals to keep the communist ideal alive. But &quot;Stalinism&quot; was used as early as 1937, when Trotsky wrote his pamphlet &quot;Stalinism and Bolshevism&quot;.

In two &quot;Guardian&quot; articles in 2002 and 2006, British journalist Seumas Milne wrote that the impact of the post–Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, equating communism&#x27;s evils with those of Nazism, &quot;has been to relativize the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.&quot;

According to historian Eric D. Weitz, 60% of German exiles in the Soviet Union had been liquidated during the Stalinist terror and a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo membership had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany. Weitz also noted that hundreds of German citizens, most of them Communists, were handed over to the Gestapo by Stalin&#x27;s administration.

=== Public opinion ===
In modern Russia, public opinion of Stalin and the former Soviet Union has improved in recent years. Levada Center had found that favorability of the Stalinist era has increased from 18% in 1996 to 40% in 2016 which had coincided with his rehabilitation by the Putin government for the purpose of social patriotism and militarisation efforts. According to a 2015 Levada Center poll, 34% of respondents (up from 28% in 2007) say that leading the Soviet people to victory in World War II was such an outstanding achievement that it outweighed Stalin&#x27;s mistakes. A 2019 Levada Center poll showed that support for Stalin, whom many Russians saw as the victor in the Great Patriotic War, reached a record high in the post-Soviet era, with 51% regarding him as a positive figure and 70% saying his reign was good for the country.

Lev Gudkov, a sociologist at the Levada Center, said, &quot;Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia of 2012 needs symbols of authority and national strength, however controversial they may be, to validate the newly authoritarian political order. Stalin, a despotic leader responsible for mass bloodshed but also still identified with wartime victory and national unity, fits this need for symbols that reinforce the current political ideology.&quot;

Some positive sentiments can also be found elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. A 2012 survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment found 38% of Armenians concurring that their country &quot;will always have need of a leader like Stalin&quot;. A 2013 survey by Tbilisi University found 45% of Georgians expressing &quot;a positive attitude&quot; toward Stalin.

<text>Sukkot, also known as the Feast of Tabernacles or Feast of Booths, is a Torah-commanded holiday celebrated for seven days, beginning on the 15th day of the month of Tishrei. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals on which Israelites were commanded to make a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem. Biblically an autumn harvest festival and a commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt, Sukkot’s modern observance is characterized by festive meals in a sukkah, a temporary wood-covered hut.

The names used in the Torah are &quot;Festival of Ingathering&quot; (or &quot;Harvest Festival&quot;, ) and &quot;Festival of Booths&quot; (). This corresponds to the double significance of Sukkot. The one mentioned in the Book of Exodus is agricultural in nature—&quot;Festival of Ingathering at the year&#x27;s end&quot; ()—and marks the end of the harvest time and thus of the agricultural year in the Land of Israel. The more elaborate religious significance from the Book of Leviticus is that of commemorating the Exodus and the dependence of the Israelites on the will of God ().

As an extension of its harvest festival community roots, the idea of welcoming all guests and extending hospitality is intrinsic to the celebration. Actual and symbolic &quot;guests&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;ushpizin&quot;) are invited to participate by visiting the sukkah. Specifically, seven &quot;forefathers&quot; of the Jewish people are to be welcomed during the seven days of the festival, in this order: Day 1: Abraham; Day 2: Isaac; Day 3: Jacob; Day 4: Moses; Day 5: Aaron; Day 6: Joseph; Day 7: David.

The holiday lasts seven days. The first day (and second day in the diaspora) is a Shabbat-like holiday when work is forbidden. This is followed by intermediate days called Chol HaMoed, during which certain work is permitted. The festival is closed with another Shabbat-like holiday called Shemini Atzeret (one day in the Land of Israel, two days in the diaspora, where the second day is called Simchat Torah). 

The Hebrew word &quot;&quot; is the plural of &quot;sukkah&quot; (&#x27;booth&#x27; or &#x27;tabernacle&#x27;) which is a walled structure covered with &quot;s&#x27;chach&quot; (plant material, such as overgrowth or palm leaves). A sukkah is the name of the temporary dwelling in which farmers would live during harvesting, reinforcing agricultural significance of the holiday introduced in the Book of Exodus. As stated in Leviticus, it is also reminiscent of the type of fragile dwellings in which the Israelites dwelled during their 40 years of travel in the desert after the Exodus from slavery in Egypt. Throughout the holiday, meals are eaten inside the sukkah and many people sleep there as well.

On each day of the holiday it is a mitzvah, or commandment, to &#x27;dwell&#x27; in the sukkah and to perform a shaking ceremony with a lulav (a palm frond, then bound with myrtle and willow), and an etrog (the fruit of a citron tree) (collectively known as the four species). The fragile shelter, the &#x27;now-three-item&#x27; lulav, the etrog, the revived Simchat Beit HaShoeivah celebration&#x27;s focus on water and rainfall and the holiday&#x27;s harvest festival roots draw attention to people&#x27;s dependence on the natural environment.

==Origins==
Sukkot shares similarities with older Canaanite new-year/harvest festivals, which included a seven-day celebration with sacrifices reminiscent of those in and &quot;dwellings of branches,&quot; as well as processions with branches. The earliest references in the Bible ( &amp; ) make no mention of Sukkot, instead referring to it as &quot;the festival of ingathering (hag ha&#x27;asif) at the end of the year, when you gather in the results of your work from the field,&quot; suggesting an agricultural origin. (The Hebrew term &quot;asif&quot; is also mentioned in the Gezer calendar as a two-month period in the autumn.)

The booths aspect of the festival may come from the shelters that were built in the fields by those involved in the harvesting process. Alternatively, it may come from the booths which pilgrims would stay in when they came in for the festivities at the cultic sanctuaries. Finally, talks about the taking of various branches (and a fruit), this too is characteristic of ancient agricultural festivals, which frequently included processions with branches.

Later, the festival was historicized by symbolic connection with the desert sojourn of exodus (). The narratives of the exodus trek do not describe the Israelites building booths, but they indicate that most of the trek was spent encamped at oases rather than traveling, and &quot;sukkot&quot; roofed with palm branches were a popular and convenient form of housing at such Sinai desert oases.

==Laws and customs==
Sukkot is a seven-day festival. Inside the Land of Israel, the first day is celebrated as a full festival with special prayer services and holiday meals. Outside the Land of Israel, the first two days are celebrated as full festivals. The seventh day of Sukkot is called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Great Hoshana&quot;, referring to the tradition that worshippers in the synagogue walk around the perimeter of the sanctuary during morning services) and has a special observance of its own. The intermediate days are known as &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot; (&quot;festival weekdays&quot;). According to Halakha, some types of work are forbidden during &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot;. In Israel many businesses are closed during this time.

Throughout the week of Sukkot, meals are eaten in the sukkah. If a brit milah (circumcision ceremony) or Bar Mitzvah rises during Sukkot, the seudat mitzvah (obligatory festive meal) is served in the sukkah. Similarly, the father of a newborn boy greets guests to his Friday-night Shalom Zachar in the sukkah. Males sleep in the sukkah, provided the weather is tolerable. If it rains, the requirement of eating and sleeping in the sukkah is waived, except for eating there on the first night where every effort needs to be made to at least say kiddush (the sanctification prayer on wine) and eat an egg-sized piece of bread before going inside the house to finish the meal if the rain does not stop. Every day except the Sabbath, a blessing is recited over the Lulav and the Etrog.
Keeping of Sukkot is detailed in the Hebrew Bible (, and ); the Mishnah (Sukkah 1:1–5:8); the Tosefta (Sukkah 1:1–4:28); and the Jerusalem Talmud (Sukkah 1a–) and Babylonian Talmud (Sukkah 2a–56b).

=== Sukkah ===

The sukkah walls can be constructed of any material that blocks wind (wood, canvas, aluminum siding, sheets). The walls can be free-standing or include the sides of a building or porch. There must be at least two and a partial wall. The roof must be of organic material, known as s&#x27;chach, such as leafy tree overgrowth, schach mats or palm fronds – plant material that is no longer connected with the earth. It is customary to decorate the interior of the sukkah with hanging decorations of the four species as well as with attractive artwork.

=== Prayers ===
Prayers during Sukkot include the reading of the Torah every day, reciting the Mussaf (additional) service after morning prayers, reciting Hallel, and adding special additions to the Amidah and Grace after Meals. In addition, the service includes rituals involving the Four Species. The lulav and etrog are not used on the Sabbath.

On the Festival days, as well as the Sabbath of Chol Hamoed, some communities recite piyyutim.

===&quot;Hoshanot&quot;===
On each day of the festival, worshippers walk around the synagogue carrying the Four Species while reciting special prayers known as &quot;Hoshanot&quot;. This takes place either between Hallel and the morning&#x27;s Torah reading or at the end of Mussaf. This ceremony commemorates the willow ceremony at the Temple in Jerusalem, in which willow branches were piled beside the altar with worshippers parading around the altar reciting prayers.

===&quot;Ushpizin&quot; and &quot;ushpizata&quot;===
A custom originating with Lurianic Kabbalah is to recite the &quot;ushpizin&quot; prayer to &quot;invite&quot; one of seven &quot;exalted guests&quot; into the sukkah. These &quot;ushpizin&quot; (Aramaic &#x27;guests&#x27;), represent the &quot;seven shepherds of Israel&quot;: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David, each of whom correlate with one of the seven lower Sephirot (this is why Joseph, associated with Yesod, follows Moses and Aaron, associated with Netzach and Hod respectively, even though he precedes them in the narrative). According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the &quot;ushpizin&quot; has a unique lesson to teach that parallels the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit, based on the Sephirah associated with that character.

Some streams of Reconstructionist Judaism also recognize a set of seven female shepherds of Israel, called variously (using modern Hebrew feminine pluralization), or (in reconstructed Aramaic). Several lists of seven have been proposed. The Ushpizata are sometimes coidentified with the seven prophetesses of Judaism: Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Hulda, and Esther. Some lists seek to relate each female leader to one of the Sephirot, to parallel their male counterparts of the evening. One such list (in the order they would be invoked, each evening) is: Ruth, Sarah, Rebecca, Miriam, Deborah, Tamar, and Rachel.

=== &quot;Chol HaMoed&quot; intermediate days ===

The second through seventh days of Sukkot (third through seventh days outside the Land of Israel) are called Chol HaMoed ( – &quot;festival weekdays&quot;). These days are considered by halakha to be more than regular weekdays but less than festival days. In practice, this means that all activities that are needed for the holiday—such as buying and preparing food, cleaning the house in honor of the holiday, or traveling to visit other people&#x27;s sukkot or on family outings—are permitted by Jewish law. Activities that will interfere with relaxation and enjoyment of the holiday—such as laundering, mending clothes, engaging in labor-intensive activities—are not permitted.

Religious Jews often treat Chol HaMoed as a vacation period, eating nicer than usual meals in their sukkah, entertaining guests, visiting other families in their sukkot, and taking family outings. Many synagogues and Jewish centers also offer events and meals in their sukkot during this time to foster community and goodwill.

On the Shabbat which falls during the week of Sukkot (or in the event when the first day of Sukkot is on Shabbat in the Land of Israel), the Book of Ecclesiastes is read during morning synagogue services in Ashkenazic communities. (Diaspora Ashkenazic communities read it the second Shabbat {eighth day} when the first day of sukkot is on Shabbat.) This Book&#x27;s emphasis on the ephemeralness of life (&quot;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity...&quot;) echoes the theme of the sukkah, while its emphasis on death reflects the time of year in which Sukkot occurs (the &quot;autumn&quot; of life). The penultimate verse reinforces the message that adherence to God and His Torah is the only worthwhile pursuit. (Cf. Ecclesiastes 12:13,14.)

=== &quot;Hakhel&quot; assembly ===

In the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, all Israelite, and later Jewish men, women, and children on pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festival would gather in the Temple courtyard on the first day of Chol HaMoed Sukkot to hear the Jewish king read selections from the Torah. This ceremony, which was mandated in Deuteronomy 31:10–13, was held every seven years, in the year following the Shmita (Sabbatical) year. This ceremony was discontinued after the destruction of the Temple, but it has been revived in Israel since 1952 on a smaller scale.

=== &quot;Simchat Beit HaShoevah&quot; water-drawing celebration ===
During the intermediate days of Sukkot, gatherings of music and dance, known as &quot;Simchat Beit HaShoeivah&quot; (Celebration of the Place of Water-Drawing), take place. This commemorates the celebration that accompanied the drawing of the water for the water-libation on the Altar, an offering unique to Sukkot, when water was carried up the Jerusalem pilgrim road from the Pool of Siloam to the Temple in Jerusalem.

=== &quot;Hoshana Rabbah&quot; (Great Supplication) ===
The seventh day of Sukkot is known as &quot;Hoshana Rabbah&quot; (Great Supplication). This day is marked by a special synagogue service in which seven circuits are made by worshippers holding their Four Species, reciting additional prayers. In addition, a bundle of five willow branches is beaten on the ground.

=== Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah ===
The holiday immediately following Sukkot is known as &quot;Shemini Atzeret&quot; ( &quot;Eighth [Day] of Assembly&quot;). Shemini Atzeret is usually viewed as a separate holiday. In the Diaspora a second additional holiday, &quot;Simchat Torah&quot; (&quot;Joy of the Torah&quot;), is celebrated. In the Land of Israel, Simchat Torah is celebrated on Shemini Atzeret. On Shemini Atzeret people leave their sukkah and eat their meals inside the house. Outside the Land of Israel, many eat in the sukkah without making the blessing. The sukkah is not used on Simchat Torah.

== Sukkot in the generations of Israel ==
=== Jeroboam&#x27;s feast ===
According to , King Jeroboam, first king of the rebellious northern kingdom, instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in imitation of the feast of Sukkot in Judah, and pilgrims went to Bethel instead of Jerusalem to make thanksgiving offerings. Jeroboam feared that continued pilgrimages from the northern kingdom to Jerusalem could lead to pressure for reunion with Judah:
=== Nehemiah ===
=== Hannukah ===
==In Christianity==
Sukkot is celebrated by a number of Christian denominations that observe holidays from the Old Testament. These groups base this on the belief that Jesus celebrated Sukkot (see the Gospel of John 7). The holiday is celebrated according to its Hebrew calendar dates. The first mention of observing the holiday by Christian groups dates to the 17th century, among the sect of the Subbotniks in Russia.

==Academic views==
De Moor has suggested that there are links between Sukkot and the Ugaritic New Year festival, in particular the Ugaritic custom of erecting two rows of huts built of branches on the temple roof as temporary dwelling houses for their gods.

Some have pointed out that the original Thanksgiving holiday had many similarities with Sukkot in the Bible.

<doc id="28623" wikidata="Q657977" url="?curid=28623" title="Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom">
<text>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (), billed on-screen as Pasolini&#x27;s 120 Days of Sodom on English-language prints and commonly referred to as simply Salò (), is a 1975 political art horror film directed and co-written by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The film is a loose adaptation of the 1785 novel (first published in 1904) &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot; by the Marquis de Sade, updating the story&#x27;s setting to the World War II era. It was Pasolini&#x27;s final film, released three weeks after his murder.

The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines in the time of the fascist Republic of Salò (1943–1945). The libertines kidnap 18 teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, genital torture and psychological torture. The film explores themes of political corruption, consumerism, authoritarianism, nihilism, morality, capitalism, totalitarianism, sadism, sexuality, and fascism. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Shit, and the Circle of Blood. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s 1887 book &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, Ezra Pound&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cantos&quot;, and Marcel Proust&#x27;s novel sequence &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

Premiering at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975, the film had a brief theatrical run in Italy before being banned in January 1976, and was released in the United States the following year on 3 October 1977. Because it depicts youths subjected to graphic violence, torture, sexual abuse, and murder, the film was controversial upon its release and has remained banned in many countries.

The confluence of thematic content in the film—ranging from the political and socio-historical, to psychological and sexual—has led to much critical discussion. It has been both praised and decried by various film historians and critics and was named the 65th-scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006.

==Plot==
The film is separated into four segments with intertitles, inspired by Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;:

===Ante Inferno / Antinferno===

In 1944, in the Republic of Salò, the fascist and Nazi-controlled portion of Italy, four wealthy men of power – the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President – agree to marry each other&#x27;s daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. They rule that when they get to the mansion, their daughters must be completely naked at all times. They recruit four teenage boys as collaborators (guards) in the Decima Flottiglia MAS and four young men (Blackshirt soldiers), called &quot;studs&quot;, who are chosen because of their large penises and good looks. The SS and fascist secret police (OVRA) are sent out to round up young victims, of whom nine teenage boys and nine teenage girls are picked and brought to a palace near Marzabotto. One of the boys tries to escape on the way, but is shot dead.

===Circle of Manias / ===

Accompanying the libertines at the palace are four middle-aged prostitutes, also collaborators, whose job it is to orchestrate debauched interludes for the men, who sadistically exploit their victims. During the many days at the palace, the four men devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. During breakfast, the daughters enter the dining hall naked to serve food. One of the studs, Efisio, trips and rapes Liana, the Duke&#x27;s elder daughter, in front of the crowd, who laugh at her cries of pain. Intrigued, the President moons several victims, as well as several collaborators including his favourite stud, Rinaldo, before prompting Efisio to perform anal sex on him while the Duke sings &quot;&quot;. Signora Vaccari uses a mannequin to demonstrate to the young men and women how to properly manually stimulate a penis only for Rinaldo to insult her for doing a poor job. After breakfast, one of the victims who had previously tried to escape is now shown dead to the crowd, ensuring that the victims do not try to escape early on. After another story, two victims named Sergio and Renata are forced to get married after one of the studs, Guido and Signora Vaccari forcefully masturbate them. The ceremony is interrupted when the Duke fondles several victims and prostitutes, with the studs and collaborators laughing at the display. At the end, Sergio and Renata are forced to fondle each other and the men rape them to stop them from having sex with each other. During this, the Magistrate engages with the Duke in three-way intercourse.

On another day, the victims are forced to get naked and act like dogs. When one of the victims, Lamberto, refuses, the Magistrate whips him and tortures Susanna, the President&#x27;s daughter, by tricking her into eating a slice of polenta containing nails.

===Circle of Shit / ===

Signora Maggi relates her troubled childhood and her coprophilia. As she tells her story, the President notices that Rinaldo, has an erection and fondles him while Guido, uses a female victim&#x27;s hand to masturbate. She also explains how she killed her mother over a dispute about her prostitution and Renata cries, remembering the murder of her own mother. The Duke, sexually excited at the sound of her cries, begins verbally abusing her. The Duke orders the guards and studs to undress her. During this, she begs God for death and the Duke punishes her by defecating on the floor and forcing her to eat his feces with a spoon. The President leaves to masturbate. Later, at a mock wedding reception for the Magistrate and Sergio, the victims are presented with a meal of human feces, which the studs, prostitutes and masters eat without question. During a search for the victim with the most beautiful buttocks, Franco is picked and promised instant death. This is quickly revealed to be a cruel form of psychological abuse by the Bishop, who spares him on the promise of a far more painful death in the near future.

===Circle of Blood / ===

Later, there is a Black Mass-like wedding between the studs and the men of power while the latter are dressed in drag. The men angrily order the victims to laugh, but they are too grief-stricken to do so. The Pianist and Signora Vaccari tell dark jokes to make the victims laugh. The wedding ceremony ensues with each man of power exchanging rings with a stud. After the wedding, the Bishop consummates the marriage and receives intense and passionate anal sex from Guido. The Bishop then leaves to examine the captives in their rooms, where they start systematically betraying each other: Claudio reveals that Graziella is hiding a photograph, Graziella reveals that Eva and Antiniska are having a secret sexual affair. Victim Umberto is appointed to replace Ezio, who is shot to death for having sex with one of the staff and revealing himself to be a communist.

Toward the end, the remaining victims are called out to determine which of them will be punished. Graziella is spared due to her betrayal of Eva, and Rino is spared due to his submissive relationship with the Duke. Those who are called are given a blue ribbon and sentenced to a painful death, while those who have not been called, as long as they keep collaborating with the libertines, can hope to return home. The victims huddle together and cry and pray in the bathroom. They are then taken outside and raped, tortured and murdered through methods such as branding, hanging, scalping, burning and having their tongues and eyes cut out, as each libertine takes his turn to watch as a voyeur. The soldiers shake hands and bid each other farewell. The Pianist, looking out an open window, suddenly realises with horror what atrocities are being committed and, climbing out, throws herself to her death.

Two young soldiers, Bruno and Claudio, who had witnessed and collaborated in all the atrocities, dance a simple waltz together; Claudio asks the name of Bruno&#x27;s girlfriend back at home, to which he replies &quot;Marguerita&quot;.

==Cast and characters==
Masters
*The Duke (played by Paolo Bonacelli and dubbed by Giancarlo Vigorelli); tall, strongly built, bearded, chauvinistic, very sadistic and a fanatic fascist; enjoys tormenting female victims with verbal abuse and degrading them, his favorite victims being Renata and Fatimah. Highly sexually potent. Shows &quot;loving&quot; feelings for the male victim Rino and allows him to live at the end. Likes to talk about fascist and misanthropic philosophy.
* The Bishop (played by Giorgio Cataldi and dubbed by Giorgio Caproni); the Duke&#x27;s extremely sadistic brother. Writes down several victims&#x27; names for punishment. May have a soft spot for Graziella, and is in an apparently affectionate relationship with one of the studs. Likes to torture and mock-execute people.
* The Magistrate (played by Umberto Paolo Quintavalle and dubbed by Aurelio Roncaglia); mustachioed bully who enjoys sadomasochism more than the President; fit and balding; enjoys abusing the victims, yet shows joy from being sodomized. Very strict and cruel.
* The President (played by Aldo Valletti and dubbed by Marco Bellocchio); scrawny, weak, and crude. He enjoys dark and punning humor and painful penetration to himself and others. He is passionate about anal sex even engaging in sodomy with any female, but refusing to have vaginal intercourse with them.

Daughters
* Tatiana Mogilansky – Magistrate&#x27;s daughter married with the President. A victim of the bullying of the collaborationists and the studs. Once at the mansion is forced to be naked at all times. Raped and killed at the end.
* Susanna Radaelli – President&#x27;s daughter married with the Duke. Victim of the collaborationists and the Magistrate. Raped at the end by collaborator Claudio (in a lost or deleted scene also by Bruno), and immediately after that is killed by hanging.
* Giuliana Orlandi – Duke&#x27;s younger daughter married with the Bishop. Whipped by the Bishop and then killed at the end. Is forced to remain completely naked at all times just like the other daughters. In a lost or deleted scene, she is raped by Fabrizio and by victim-turned-collaborator Umberto and is shot.
* Liana Acquaviva – Duke&#x27;s elder daughter married with the Magistrate. Like the other daughters is required to be completely naked for all 120 days. Raped by one of the studs and killed in the end, in a lost or deleted scene in an electric chair.

Storytellers
* Signora Castelli, played by Caterina Boratto; a prideful, cruel prostitute who jokes about horrible instances. Tells stories during the Circle of Blood.
* Signora Maggi, played by Elsa De Giorgi; a coprophiliac who finds no shame in mooning others or even defecating in front of them. Committed matricide for a nobleman. Tells stories during the Circle of Shit.
* Signora Vaccari, played by and dubbed by Laura Betti, voice used in French dub); lively and polite, she was molested as a very young child, but enjoyed it. Tells stories during the Circle of Manias.
* The Pianist, played by ; soft-spoken, she plays continuously during the day, but is secretly very distressed at the horrors around her. Commits suicide during the final day because she couldn&#x27;t witness any more horrors.

Studs
* Rinaldo Missaglia – Like the Duke is strongly built, chauvinistic and very sadistic. Has relations with the President and enjoys tormenting the victims with him. He is maybe the cruelest of the studs, his only competition being Efisio, given his rather extreme brutality and sadism.
* Giuseppe Patruno – Very cruel and depraved. Has relations with the Magistrate and marries him near the end of the film alongside Efisio and Rinaldo. Although he undeniably sadistic, he is maybe the calmest of the Studs.
* Guido Galletti – Friends with Giuseppe and Efisio. Enjoys degrading and humiliating the victims, with Fatimah being of a favourite of his, even at one point using her hands to feel up his penis. Has relations with the Bishop
* Efisio Etzi – A quiet but extremely cruel guard. He is just as depraved as the Masters and has relations with the Duke. Enjoys raping and assaulting female victims especially and takes immense pleasure in the final massacres. 

Collaborators
* Claudio Troccoli – A teenage but cruel guard, the most depraved of the collaborators. Very sadistic.

==Production==
===Conception===

Pasolini&#x27;s writing collaborator Sergio Citti had originally been attached to direct the intended adaptation of the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot;. During the creation of the first drafts of the script, Pasolini appealed to several of his usual collaborators, among them Citti, Claudio Masenza, Antonio Troisi and specially Pupi Avati.

While collaborating with Citti on the script, Pasolini was compelled to transpose the setting of &quot;Salò&quot; from 18th-century France (as depicted in de Sade&#x27;s original book) to the last days of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime in the Republic of Salò in the spring of 1944. Salò is a toponymical metonymy for the Italian Social Republic (RSI) (because Mussolini ruled from this northern town rather than from Rome), which was a puppet state of Nazi Germany. While writing the script, it was decided between Citti and Pasolini that the latter would direct the project, as Citti had planned to write a separate project after completing &quot;Salò&quot;. Pasolini noted his main contribution to Citti&#x27;s original screenplay as being its &quot;Dante-esque structure&quot;, which Pasolini felt had been de Sade&#x27;s original intention with the source material.

In the film, almost no background is given on the tortured subjects and, for the most part, they almost never speak. Pasolini&#x27;s depiction of the victims in such a manner was intended to demonstrate the physical body &quot;as a commodity... the annulment of the personality of the Other.&quot; Specifically, Pasolini intended to depict what he described as an &quot;anarchy of power&quot;, in which sexual acts and physical abuse functioned as metaphor for the relationship between power and its subjects. Aside from this theme, Pasolini also described the film as being about the &quot;nonexistence of history&quot; as it is seen from Western culture and Marxism. 

Interior design was chosen to feature paintings and art by artists such as Severini, Duchamp and Feininger. Pasolini also stated that the four fascist libertines were written as highly educated characters and were to refer to themes brought up by, among others, Blanchot, Nietzsche and Klossowski. 

====Trilogy of death====
In contrast to his &quot;Trilogy of Life&quot; (&quot;Il Decameron&quot;, &quot;I racconti di Canterbury&quot; and &quot;Il fiore delle Mille e una notte&quot;), Pasolini initially planned &quot;The 120 days of Sodom&quot; and &quot;Salò&quot; as separate stories, but noting similarity between both concepts – and based on their experiences in the Republic of Salò – conceived the idea of &quot;Salò or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;. Pasolini established that the violent scenes in &quot;Salò&quot; were symbolic and reduced the romanticism of his previous films, although knowing that once the film was premiered would be considered as damned. As a continuation, Pasolini planned to make a biographical film about the life of child murderer Gilles de Rais, but was murdered himself before &quot;Salò&quot;″s release.

===Casting===
Initially, Ninetto Davoli was chosen to play Claudio, a young collaborationist, but due to legal problems he had to decline, the role being replaced by Claudio Troccoli, a young man who had a similarity to Davoli in his first films. Pupi Avati, being the writer, is not officially accredited also due to legal problems. Most of the actors of the cast, although they were natural performers, were non-professionals with minimal or no prior on-camera acting experience. Many of them were models, cast for their willingness to appear naked on-screen.

Franco Merli was considered like a prototype of the Pasolinian boy. Ezio Manni remembers during filming: &quot;The same with Franco Merli, the guy chosen for having the most beautiful butt. When they reward him by holding the gun to his head, he suddenly protested, he couldn’t handle that scene. And the assistant director had to go and give him a hug.&quot;

Pasolini regular Franco Citti was to play one of the soldiers&#x27; studs, but he did not appear. Laura Betti was also going to play Signora Vaccari, but also because of legal problems and prior commitments to &quot;Novecento&quot; declined the role, though she doubled the voice of Hélène Surgère in post-production.

Uberto Paolo Quintavalle (the Magistrate) was a writer; he knew Pasolini working on the newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;. He was chosen for the role because he had all &quot;the characteristics of a decadent intellectual&quot;.

Aldo Valletti (the President) was a friend of Pasolini from the time of &quot;Accattone&quot;. Giorgio Cataldi (the bishop), another friend of Pasolini, was a clothes seller in Rome.

===Filming===
Several outdoor scenes were filmed in Villa Aldini, a neoclassical building on the hills of Bologna. The interiors were shot in near Castelfranco Emilia. The noble hall of the building and the courtyard were filmed in the Cinecittà studios. The town on the Reno replaces the fictional location in Marzabotto. Other scenes were filmed in Grand Hotel a Villa Feltrinelli in Gargano.

The shooting, carried out mainly in the 16th-century Villa Gonzaga-Zani in Villimpenta in the spring of 1975, was difficult and involved scenes of homophilia, coprophagia and sadomasochism. The acts of torture in the courtyard caused some of the actors to suffer abrasions and burns. Actress Hélène Surgère described the film shoot as &quot;unusual&quot;, with nearly 40 actors being on set at any given time, and Pasolini shooting &quot;enormous&quot; amounts of footage. She also noted the mood on the set as &quot;paradoxically jovial and immature&quot; in spite of the content. In-between working, the cast shared large meals of risotto and also had football games played against the crew of Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Novecento&quot;, which was being filmed nearby. It also marked the reconciliation between the then 34-year-old Bertolucci and his old mentor after several disagreements following Pasolini&#x27;s criticism of &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972) and his failure to defend it from drastic censorship measures. During the soccer match against the crew of &quot;Novecento&quot; both directors supported their teams, except that while Bertolucci did it from the bench, Pasolini played directly on the field. The crew of &quot;Novecento&quot; wore a purple shirt with phosphorescent bands to distract the opponents and had lined up, passing them off as engineers, two players from the youth team of Calcio Parma. The &quot;Salò&quot; crew lost 5 to 2 and Pasolini, furious, left the field before the end shouting: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t read anything anymore, that guy!&quot; to Bertolucci.

During production, some reels were stolen and the thieves demanded a ransom for their return. Using doubles, the same scenes were reshot but from a different angle. At the trial for Pasolini&#x27;s murder, it was hypothesized that Pasolini was told the film reels were discovered in Ostia Lido. He was led there by Pelosi, the accused, and fell victim to an ambush, where he was murdered.

===Post-production===
====Musical score====
The original music corresponds to Ennio Morricone interpreted at the piano by Arnaldo Graziosi. Other non-original music was Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; in &quot;Veris leta facies&quot; at the nearly end of the film during &quot;Circle of Blood&quot;. Other music was several Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s pieces Preludes Op.28 nº 17 and nº4 and Valses Op. 34 nº 2 in La minor.

==== Dubbing ====
Like most Italian films of the time, &quot;Salò&quot; was shot MOS (without direct sound), with all dialogue and foley effects dubbed in post-production. The controversy surrounding the production dissuaded the actors playing the Masters to return to loop their lines, so they were all re-dubbed by other (uncredited) actors. French actress Hélène Surgère (Vaccari) had her dialogue dubbed by Laura Betti.

====Alternative endings====
Pasolini was undecided on what type of conclusion the film should have, to the point of having conceived and shot four different endings: the first was a shot of a red flag in the wind with the words &quot;Love You&quot;, but it was abandoned by the director because he thought it &quot;too pompous&quot; and &quot;prone to the ethics of psychedelic youth&quot;, which he detested. The second showed all the actors, other than the four gentlemen, the director and his troupe perform a wild dance in a room of the villa furnished with red flags and the scene was filmed with the purpose of using it as a background scene during the credits, but was discarded because it appeared, in the eyes of Pasolini, chaotic and unsatisfactory. Another final scene, discovered years later and which was only in the initial draft of the script, showed, after the torture&#x27;s end, the four gentlemen walk out of the house and drawing conclusions about the morality of the whole affair. Finally, keeping the idea of dance as the summation of carnage, Pasolini chose to mount the so-called final &quot;Margherita&quot;, with the two young blackshirts dancing.

==Release==
&quot;Salò&quot; premiered at the Paris Film Festival on 23 November 1975, three weeks following Pasolini&#x27;s death. In Italy, the film was initially rejected for screening by the Italian censorship, but received approval on 23 December 1975. The approval, however, was withdrawn three weeks after the film&#x27;s Italian release in January 1976 and it was formally banned. Worldwide distribution for the film was supplied by United Artists. In the United States, however, the film was given a limited release via Zebra Releasing Corporation on 3 October 1977.

===Censorship===
&quot;Salò&quot; has been banned in several countries, because of its graphic portrayals of rape, torture and murder—mainly of people thought to be younger than eighteen years of age. The film remains banned in several countries and sparked numerous debates among critics and censors about whether or not it constituted pornography due to its nudity and graphic depiction of sexual acts.

The film was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in January 1976. It was first screened at the Old Compton Street Cinema Club in Soho, London in 1977, in an uncut form and without certification from BBFC secretary James Ferman; the premises were raided by the Metropolitan Police after a few days. A cut version prepared under Ferman&#x27;s supervision, again without formal certification, was subsequently screened under cinema club conditions for some years. In 2000, in an uncut form, the film was finally passed for theatrical and video distribution in the United Kingdom.

The film was not banned in the United States and received a limited release in October 1977; it was, however, banned in Ontario, Canada. In 1994, an undercover policeman in Cincinnati, Ohio, rented the film from a local gay bookstore and then arrested the owners for &quot;pandering&quot;. A large group of artists, including Martin Scorsese and Alec Baldwin, and scholars signed a legal brief arguing the film&#x27;s artistic merit; the Ohio state court dismissed the case because the police violated the owners&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights, without reaching the question of whether the film was obscene.

It was banned in Australia in 1976 for reasons of indecency. After a 17-year-long ban, the Australian Classification Board passed the film with an R-18+ (for 18 and older only) uncut for theatrical release in July 1993. However, the Australian Classification Review Board overturned this decision in February 1998 and banned the film outright, for &quot;offensive cruelty with high impact, sexual violence and depictions of offensive and revolting fetishes&quot;. The film was then pulled from all Australian cinemas. &quot;Salò&quot; was resubmitted for classification in Australia in 2008, only to be rejected once again. The DVD print was apparently a modified version, causing outrage in the media over censorship and freedom of speech. In 2010, the film was submitted again and passed with an R18+ rating. According to the Australian Classification Board media release, the DVD was passed due to &quot;the inclusion of 176 minutes of additional material which provided a context to the feature film.&quot; The media release also stated that &quot;The Classification Board wishes to emphasise that this film is classified R18+ based on the fact that it contains additional material. Screening this film in a cinema without the additional material would constitute a breach of classification laws.&quot; The majority opinion of the board stated that the inclusion of additional material on the DVD &quot;facilitates wider consideration of the context of the film which results in the impact being no more than high.&quot; This decision came under attack by FamilyVoice Australia (formerly the Festival of Light Australia), the Australian Christian Lobby and Liberal Party of Australia Senator Julian McGauran, who tried to have the ban reinstated, but the Board refused. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on 8 September 2010.

In New Zealand, the film was originally banned in 1976. The ban was upheld in 1993. In 1997, special permission was granted for the film to be screened uncut at a film festival. In 2001, the DVD was finally passed uncut with an &#x27;R18&#x27; rating.

===Reception===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 70% approval rating based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; will strike some viewers as irredeemably depraved, but its unflinching view of human cruelty makes it impossible to ignore.&quot;

Director Michael Haneke named the film his fourth-favorite film when he voted for the 2002 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll. Director Catherine Breillat and critic Joel David also voted for the film. David Cross, Gaspar Noé, and Korn frontman Jonathan Davis have named it one of their favorite films. Rainer Werner Fassbinder also cited it as one of his 10 favorite films. A 2000 poll of critics conducted by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named it the 89th-greatest film of the 20th century. Director John Waters said, &quot;&quot;Salo&quot; is a beautiful film...it uses obscenity in an intelligent way...and it&#x27;s about the pornography of power.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;Roland Barthes noted that in spite of all its objectionable elements (he pointed out that any film that renders Sade real and fascism unreal is doubly wrong), this film should be defended because it &#x27;refuses to allow us to redeem ourselves.&#x27; It&#x27;s certainly the film in which Pasolini&#x27;s protest against the modern world finds its most extreme and anguished expression. Very hard to take, but in its own way an essential work.&quot;

The film&#x27;s reputation for pushing boundaries has led some critics to criticize or avoid it; the &quot;Time Out&quot; film guide, for example, deemed the film a &quot;thoroughly objectionable piece of work&quot;, adding that it &quot;offers no insights whatsoever into power, politics, history or sexuality.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film a mixed review awarding it a score of 2.5/4, stating, &quot;despite moments of undeniably brilliant insight, is nearly unwatchable, extremely disturbing, and often literally nauseous&quot;.

Upon the film&#x27;s United States release, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Salo&quot; is, I think, a perfect example of the kind of material that, theoretically, anyway, can be acceptable on paper but becomes so repugnant when visualized on the screen that it further dehumanizes the human spirit, which is supposed to be the artist&#x27;s concern.&quot; In 2011 Roger Ebert wrote that he owned the film since its release on LaserDisc but had not watched it, citing the film&#x27;s transgressive reputation. In 2011, David Haglund of &quot;Slate&quot; surveyed five film critics and three of them said that it was required viewing for any serious critic or cinephile. Haglund concluded that he still would not watch the film.

===Home media===
The Criterion Collection first released the film in 1993 on LaserDisc, following with a DVD release in 1998. In 2011, The Criterion Collection released a newly restored version on Blu-ray and DVD in conjunction with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a two-disc release with multiple interviews collected on the accompanying second disc.

==Critical analysis==
&quot;Salò&quot; has received critical analysis from film scholars, critics and others for its converging depictions of sexual violence and cross-referencing of historical and sociopolitical themes. Commenting on the film&#x27;s prevalent sexual themes, horror film scholar Stephen Barber writes: &quot;The core of &quot;Salò&quot; is the anus, and its narrative drive pivots around the act of sodomy. No scene of a sex act has been confirmed in the film until one of the libertines has approached its participants and sodomized the figure committing the act. The filmic material of &quot;Salò&quot; is one that compacts celluloid and feces, in Pasolini&#x27;s desire to burst the limits of cinema, via the anally resonant eye of the film lens.&quot; Barber also notes that Pasolini&#x27;s film reduces the extent of the storytelling sequences present in de Sade&#x27;s &quot;The 120 Days of Sodom&quot; so that they &quot;possess equal status&quot; with the sadistic acts committed by the libertines.

Pasolini scholar Gian Annovi notes in the book &quot;Pier Paolo Pasolini: Performing Authorship&quot; (2007) that &quot;Salò&quot; is stylistically and thematically marked by a &quot;link between Duchamp&#x27;s Dada aesthetics and the perverse dynamics of desire&quot;, which, according to Annovi, became artistic points of interest for Pasolini in the early developments of &quot;Salò&quot;.

Dallas Marshall for Film Inquiry wrote in an article from 2021 that &quot;Salò is his [Pasolini&#x27;s] strongest diatribe against consumerism&quot;, and other critics have brought up that the film is to be seen as symbolism; a metaphor for the modern society, capitalism, and especially consumerism, i.e how &quot;those in power can make people consume crap (ads, commercials, etc) and those of the people who resist die, and the majority passively obeys and goes along with the system, and a few will collaborate with the rulers&quot;. The Film Inquiry article also mentions this metaphor: 
&quot;Much like the citizens of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the prisoners were eating up the bullshit of dictators. But it goes deeper than that because one of the aspects of modern society that Pasolini had a great disdain for was mass consumerism. The man viewed consumerism, especially that of processed foods, to be pesticide on the human soul and eating literal excrement. He yearned for the days of classical beauty and good food that nourished the body. He viewed the modern world as a perversion and was thoroughly disgusted with its trajectory.&quot; The BBFC notes that the film &quot;is intended as a critique of both fascism and consumerism&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Salò&quot; has earned a reputation among some film scholars for being the &quot;sickest film of all time&quot;, with some citing it as an early progenitor of the extreme cinema subgenre, alongside the American film &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (1972).

Film scholar Matthias Frey notes that the cross-section between the film&#x27;s thematic content and graphic visuals has resulted in it being considered both a horror film as well as an art film:

In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 65th-scariest film ever made.

In 2010, the Toronto International Film Festival placed it at no. 47 on its list of &quot;The Essential 100 films&quot;.

<doc id="28624" wikidata="Q408663" url="?curid=28624" title="Selenocysteine">
<text>Selenocysteine (symbol Sec or U, in older publications also as Se-Cys) is the 21st proteinogenic amino acid. Selenoproteins contain selenocysteine residues. Selenocysteine is an analogue of the more common cysteine with selenium in place of the sulfur.

Selenocysteine is present in several enzymes (for example glutathione peroxidases, tetraiodothyronine 5′ deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, formate dehydrogenases, glycine reductases, selenophosphate synthetase 2, methionine-&quot;R&quot;-sulfoxide reductase B1 (SEPX1), and some hydrogenases). It occurs in all three domains of life, including important enzymes (listed above) present in humans.

Selenocysteine was discovered in 1974 by biochemist Thressa Stadtman at the National Institutes of Health.

==Chemistry==
Selenocysteine is the Se-analogue of cysteine. It is rarely encountered outside of living tissue (nor is it available commercially) because of its high susceptiblility to air-oxidation. More common is the oxidized derivative selenocystine, which has an Se-Se bond. Both selenocysteine and selenocystine are white solids. The Se-H group is more acidic (p&quot;K&quot;a = 5.43) than the thiol group; thus, it is deprotonated at physiological pH.

== Structure ==
Selenocysteine has the same structure as cysteine, but with an atom of selenium taking the place of the usual sulfur. It has a selenol group. Like other natural proteinogenic amino acids, cysteine and selenocysteine have chirality in the older / notation based on homology to - and -glyceraldehyde. In the newer &quot;R&quot;/&quot;S&quot; system of designating chirality, based on the atomic numbers of atoms near the asymmetric carbon, they have &quot;R&quot; chirality, because of the presence of sulfur or selenium as a second neighbor to the asymmetric carbon. The remaining chiral amino acids, having only lighter atoms in that position, have &quot;S&quot; chirality.)

Proteins which contain a selenocysteine residue are called selenoproteins. Most selenoproteins contain a single selenocysteine residue. Selenoproteins that exhibit catalytic activity are called selenoenzymes.

== Biology ==
Selenocysteine has a lower reduction potential than cysteine. These properties make it very suitable in proteins that are involved in antioxidant activity.

Although it is found in the three domains of life, it is not universal in all organisms. Unlike other amino acids present in biological proteins, selenocysteine is not coded for directly in the genetic code. Instead, it is encoded in a special way by a UGA codon, which is normally the &quot;opal&quot; stop codon. Such a mechanism is called translational recoding and its efficiency depends on the selenoprotein being synthesized and on translation initiation factors. When cells are grown in the absence of selenium, translation of selenoproteins terminates at the UGA codon, resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional enzyme. The UGA codon is made to encode selenocysteine by the presence of a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in the mRNA. The SECIS element is defined by characteristic nucleotide sequences and secondary structure base-pairing patterns. In bacteria, the SECIS element is typically located immediately following the UGA codon within the reading frame for the selenoprotein. In Archaea and in eukaryotes, the SECIS element is in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the mRNA and can direct multiple UGA codons to encode selenocysteine residues.

Unlike the other amino acids, no free pool of selenocysteine exists in the cell. Its high reactivity would cause damage to cells. Instead, cells store selenium in the less reactive oxidized form, selenocystine, or in methylated form, selenomethionine. Selenocysteine synthesis occurs on a specialized tRNA, which also functions to incorporate it into nascent polypeptides.

The primary and secondary structure of selenocysteine-specific tRNA, tRNASec, differ from those of standard tRNAs in several respects, most notably in having an 8-base-pair (bacteria) or 10-base-pair (eukaryotes) acceptor stem, a long variable region arm, and substitutions at several well-conserved base positions. The selenocysteine tRNAs are initially charged with serine by seryl-tRNA ligase, but the resulting Ser-tRNASec is not used for translation because it is not recognised by the normal translation elongation factor (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF1A in eukaryotes).

Rather, the tRNA-bound seryl residue is converted to a selenocysteine residue by the pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzyme selenocysteine synthase. In eukaryotes and archaea, two enzymes are required to convert tRNA-bound seryl residue into tRNA selenocysteinyl residue: PSTK (&quot;O&quot;-phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase) and selenocysteine synthase. Finally, the resulting Sec-tRNASec is specifically bound to an alternative translational elongation factor (SelB or mSelB (or eEFSec)), which delivers it in a targeted manner to the ribosomes translating mRNAs for selenoproteins. The specificity of this delivery mechanism is brought about by the presence of an extra protein domain (in bacteria, SelB) or an extra subunit (SBP2 for eukaryotic mSelB/eEFSec) which bind to the corresponding RNA secondary structures formed by the SECIS elements in selenoprotein mRNAs.

Selenocysteine is decomposed by the enzyme selenocysteine lyase into -alanine and selenide.

, 136 human proteins (in 37 families) are known to contain selenocysteine (selenoproteins).

Selenocysteine derivatives γ-glutamyl-&quot;Se&quot;-methylselenocysteine and &quot;Se&quot;-methylselenocysteine occur naturally in plants of the genera &quot;Allium&quot; and &quot;Brassica&quot;.

== Applications ==
Biotechnological applications of selenocysteine include use of 73Se-labeled Sec (half-life of 73Se = 7.2 hours) in positron emission tomography (PET) studies and 75Se-labeled Sec (half-life of 75Se = 118.5 days) in specific radiolabeling, facilitation of phase determination by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction in X-ray crystallography of proteins by introducing Sec alone, or Sec together with selenomethionine (SeMet), and incorporation of the stable 77Se isotope, which has a nuclear spin of and can be used for high-resolution NMR, among others.

<text>A supervolcano is a volcano that has had an eruption with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 8, the largest recorded value on the index. This means the volume of deposits for such an eruption is greater than .

Supervolcanoes occur when magma in the mantle rises into the crust but is unable to break through it. Pressure builds in a large and growing magma pool until the crust is unable to contain the pressure and ruptures. This can occur at hotspots (for example, Yellowstone Caldera) or at subduction zones (for example, Toba).

Large-volume supervolcanic eruptions are also often associated with large igneous provinces, which can cover huge areas with lava and volcanic ash. These can cause long-lasting climate change (such as the triggering of a small ice age) and threaten species with extinction. The Oruanui eruption of New Zealand&#x27;s Taupō Volcano (about 25,600 years ago) was the world&#x27;s most recent VEI-8 eruption.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;supervolcano&quot; was first used in a volcanic context in 1949.
 Its origins lie in an early 20th-century scientific debate about the geological history and features of the Three Sisters volcanic region of Oregon in the United States. In 1925, Edwin T. Hodge suggested that a very large volcano, which he named Mount Multnomah, had existed in that region. He believed that several peaks in the Three Sisters area were remnants of Mount Multnomah after it had been largely destroyed by violent volcanic explosions, similarly to Mount Mazama. In his 1948 book &quot;The Ancient Volcanoes of Oregon&quot;, volcanologist Howel Williams ignored the possible existence of Mount Multnomah, but in 1949 another volcanologist, F. M. Byers Jr., reviewed the book, and in the review, Byers refers to Mount Multnomah as a &quot;supervolcano&quot;.

More than fifty years after Byers&#x27; review was published, the term &quot;supervolcano&quot; was popularised by the BBC popular science television program &quot;Horizon&quot; in 2000, referring to eruptions that produce extremely large amounts of ejecta.

The term &quot;megacaldera&quot; is sometimes used for caldera supervolcanoes, such as the Blake River Megacaldera Complex in the Abitibi greenstone belt of Ontario and Quebec, Canada.

Though there is no well-defined minimum explosive size for a &quot;supervolcano&quot;, there are at least two types of volcanic eruptions that have been identified as supervolcanoes: large igneous provinces and massive eruptions.

== Large igneous provinces ==

Large igneous provinces, such as Iceland, the Siberian Traps, Deccan Traps, and the Ontong Java Plateau, are extensive regions of basalts on a continental scale resulting from flood basalt eruptions. When created, these regions often occupy several thousand square kilometres and have volumes on the order of millions of cubic kilometers. In most cases, the lavas are normally laid down over several million years. They release large amounts of gases.

The Réunion hotspot produced the Deccan Traps about 66 million years ago, coincident with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The scientific consensus is that an asteroid impact was the cause of the extinction event, but the volcanic activity may have caused environmental stresses on extant species up to the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Additionally, the largest flood basalt event (the Siberian Traps) occurred around 250 million years ago and was coincident with the largest mass extinction in history, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, although it is unknown whether it was solely responsible for the extinction event.

Such outpourings are not explosive, though lava fountains may occur. Many volcanologists consider Iceland to be a large igneous province that is currently being formed. The last major outpouring occurred in 1783–84 from the Laki fissure, which is approximately long. An estimated of basaltic lava was poured out during the eruption (VEI 4).

The Ontong Java Plateau has an area of about , and the province was at least 50% larger before the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus broke away.

== Massive explosive eruptions ==
Volcanic eruptions are classified using the volcanic explosivity index. It is a logarithmic scale, and an increase of one in VEI number is equivalent to a tenfold increase in volume of erupted material. VEI 7 or VEI 8 eruptions are so powerful that they often form circular calderas rather than cones because the downward withdrawal of magma causes the overlying rock mass to collapse into the empty magma chamber beneath it.

=== Known super eruptions ===
Based on incomplete statistics, at least 60 VEI 8 eruptions have been identified.
== Media portrayal ==
* &quot;Nova&quot; featured an episode &quot;Mystery of the Megavolcano&quot; in September 2006 examining such eruptions in the last 100,000 years.
* &quot;Supervolcano&quot; is the title of a British-Canadian television disaster film, first released in 2005. It tells a fictional story of a supereruption at Yellowstone.
* In the 2009 disaster film &quot;2012&quot;, a supereruption of Yellowstone is one of the events that contributes to a global cataclysm.
* The 2025 political thriller &quot;Paradise&quot; takes place after an eruption of a fictional Antarctic supervolcano and subsequent megatsunami, causing the United States federal government and other prominent individuals to relocate to an underground city in Colorado.

<text>The Single European Sky (SES) is a European Commission initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management system through a series of actions carried out in four different levels (institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with the aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity, safety, efficiency and environmental impact.
== Background ==

Air traffic management in the European Union is currently undertaken by member states, co-operating through EUROCONTROL, an intergovernmental organisation that includes most of the European countries.

European air spaces are some of the busiest in the world, and the current system of air traffic management allegedly suffers from several parameters, such as using national borders in the sky, and having large areas of airspace reserved for national military use when in fact they may not be needed. This has created &#x27;an outdated patchwork of airspace blocs and inefficient flight paths [which] impose significant financial and environmental costs on the sector.&#x27; For example, airplanes are often forced to &#x27;circle the skies burning fuel when traffic controllers go on strike or are at capacity&#x27;. On average, planes fly 49 kilometres (30.4 miles) longer than strictly necessary.

=== Advantages ===

The Single European Sky is hoped to benefit airspace users by ensuring the safe and efficient utilisation of airspace and the air traffic management system within and beyond the EU.
* Airspace efficiency: Airspace management is planned to move away from the current domination by national borders to the use of &#x27;functional airspace blocks&#x27; the boundaries of which will be designed to maximise the efficiency of the airspace.
* Safety, capacity, management efficiency: Within the airspace, air traffic management, while continuing to have safety as its primary objective, will also be driven by the requirements of the airspace user and the need to provide for increasing air traffic. The aim is to use air traffic management that is more closely based on desired flight patterns leading to greater safety (by preventing congestion), efficiency and capacity. The SES aims to triple capacity, cut 10% in flight times, and halve cancellations and delays.
* emissions and fuel cost cuts: According to the European Commission and the aviation industry itself, the SES could cut aviation&#x27;s emissions by up to 10%, or 50 million tonnes. According to IATA, the SES would reduce airlines&#x27; annual fuel costs by 5.5 billion euros.
* Crisis management: The SES would be able to manage transport disruptions (such as the 2010 Icelandic volcano eruption), overcrowding (as was happening in 2019), as well as collapses in air travel demand (as happened due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020).
* Management cost reduction and job creation: The SES would require far fewer air traffic controllers, who have high salaries, thus substantially cutting personnel costs by about 50%; the number of control centres might be reduced from about 60 to about 20. Meanwhile, the development of Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) technology could create 328,000 jobs across Europe. By comparison, the 27 member states systems employed a little under 58,000 workers (including 16,900 air traffic controllers) in 2010.
* Innovative coordination: The SES would stimulate coordination on innovation in areas such as sustainability.
* Formation flying: The SES would enable formation flying, including Airbus&#x27; fello&#x27;fly project, which will save energy and benefit from an updraft.

=== Disadvantages ===
* ATC job losses: The SES would threaten the jobs of many air traffic controllers, because fewer would be needed to manage a pan-European sky.
* Security and sovereignty: Some EU member states, mostly larger ones, have expressed certain objections to relinquishing their current systems, primarily relating to national security and sovereignty concerns. For example, the SES could create problems concerning territorial sovereignty, such as over Gibraltar; Brexit seems to have removed this problem, however (see below).

== History ==
=== Origins (1999–2004) ===
After the Prodi Commission took office in September 1999, Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio launched efforts to structurally reform air traffic management across Europe, as she and many others had concluded that Eurocontrol was incapable of effectively carrying out its duties, particularly its decision-making and its failure to implement agreements. By the end of 1999, the European Commission had obtained the consent of all EU Transport Ministers for the &#x27;creation of a single European sky&#x27;, encompassing structural ATM integration and reform, and established a high level group of senior civil and military air traffic authorities representing the member states to prepare concrete policy proposals.

After the high level group had completed its report in late 2000, the Commission used its recommendations to develop legislative proposals for regulating the SES. In October 2001, the European Commission adopted proposals for a Single European Sky, to create a Union regulator for air traffic management within the countries forming the European Union, Norway and Switzerland. The European Union regulator was supposed to merge upper European airspaces, currently divided into national zones. It was proposed to organise this airspace uniformly, with air traffic control areas based on operational efficiency, instead of national borders. Also, there were plans to integrate civil and military air traffic management. The framework regulation that sketched the working methods of the SES, and specific regulations on air navigation, airspace and equipment, were adopted on 11 December 2003, and entered into force as Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 (Service Provision Regulation) on 20 April 2004.

There are discussions about enlarging the initiative to cover the Balkan and Mediterranean countries.

=== Gibraltar issue (2000–2020) ===
One report from the British Parliament, dated 2000, reported that Spain blocked the inclusion of Gibraltar Airport in the Single European Sky, meaning the whole package was suspended. Due to Brexit, formally completed on 31 January 2020, this stumbling block was removed.

=== SES-I (2004–2009) ===
The first SES legislation (SES-I) has been viewed as &#x27;a real breakthrough&#x27;, as is stimulated progress in harmonisation in air navigation service providers (ANSPs), the establishment of national supervisory authorities and EU competences over certification of these services. However, progress was slow in the next two years; the establishment of functional airspace blocks (FABs) was disorganised, little progress was made in improving cost efficiency, growing air traffic threatened capacity, and with tackling climate change emerging as a political priority, European aviation&#x27;s emissions had to be mitigated. In response to strong demands from the industry, EU member states and other stakeholders, the Barroso Commission appointed a new high level group to develop a more detailed regulatory framework in November 2006. The group published its report in July 2007; it contained 10 recommendations, including making the EU the primary regulator of European aviation in order to set performance targets, safety requirements, introduce economic regulation of ATM services, incentives for ANSPs to achieve their objectives, and streamlining the implementation of FABs. Eurocontrol would provide the EU with technical support for regulations, safety regulation would be delegated to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and member states would be urged to hurry up with their commitments to implement the defragmentation of airspaces.

=== SES-II (2009–2012) ===

On 21 October 2009, a revision of the SES regulations called SES-II was adopted, which entered into force on 4 December 2009.
Focus is here on four areas:
#The existing Single Sky legislation is sharpened to deal with performance and environmental challenges.
#The Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) programme is to provide the future technology.
#The competence of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is to be extended to aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services.
#The &#x27;action plan for airport capacity, efficiency and safety&#x27; is to be implemented thus providing ground capacity.

The SES-II aimed to merge 36 national airspaces into 9 Functional Airspace Block (FABs) in order to provide better performance, ultimately 3 years later on 4 December 2012.

The air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption caused an acceleration to merge member states&#x27; air traffic control systems into the Single European Sky, and the immediate creation of a crisis co-ordination group to handle future transport disruptions. On 2 December 2010, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries agreed to form the FABEC (Functional Airspace Block Europe Central), the third FAB to be created after the Dano-Swedish and Anglo-Irish block. The FABs were supposed to enter into effect by 2012, but delays were expected due to protests from ATC labour unions. The FAB CE, consisting of Austria, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, was formed in 2011. By 26 October 2012, only the Anglo-Irish and Dano-Swedish FABs had been fully implemented, while the other 7 FABs were still in various stages of development; the deadline for the full realisation of the Single European Sky on 4 December 2012 was missed.

=== SES 2+ (2013–2018) ===
On 10 June 2013, the European Commission presented its plan &quot;B&quot; to speed up the implementation process of SES. The so-called SES 2+ is a package of measure which aim at challenging the current situation with state owned monopolies responsible for providing air navigation services. At the same time, transport workers&#x27; union ETF announced mobilising its members to protest against the suggested package. Negotiations on SES 2+ stalled in the Council in 2015.

In 2017, the European Court of Auditors determined that the functional airspace blocks have failed to defragment European airspace as they have not been fully implemented, with aircraft still being serviced by a different air navigation provider in each member state with different rules and requirements. This was due to a &quot;lack of commitment on the part of the member states&quot;.

=== Amended SES 2+ (2019–present) ===
By 2019, nothing of the plan had yet been officially realised, adding an extra 6 billion euros in costs, and 11.6 million megatonnes of excess emissions for that year alone. In September 2019, 21 aviation organisations including Airlines for Europe (A4E), AIRE, ACI Europe, CANSO, ERA and IATA, signed an agreement in Brussels to urge the creation of an SES, and to work together with EU institutions and member states to achieve it. The Commission appointed 15 experts in the field to form a Wise Person&#x27;s Group to assess the current situation and future needs.

After Brexit was formally completed on 31 January 2020 (eliminating UK objections and the Gibraltar issue), and the COVID-19 pandemic put the aviation sector into an existential crisis, the European Commission made a new proposal for a Single European Sky on 22 September 2020. It used the expert group&#x27;s recommendations to amend the 2013 proposal&#x27;s text, and introduced new measures; separately, it also drafted a proposal to amend the EASA Basic Regulation. Instead of relying on top-down regulation, which appeared not to have worked previously, the Commission stimulated voluntary alliances between so-called air traffic service providers. Airlines for Europe supported the proposal, but stressed the importance of &#x27;enhanced governance structure&#x27; to ensure its success. Meanwhile, the FABEC and FAB CE zones, jointly accounting for 8.6 million flights (over 75% of all European air traffic) in 2019, agreed to formalise and intensify their cooperation in June 2020.

<text>In physics, sputtering is a phenomenon in which microscopic particles of a solid material are ejected from its surface, after the material is itself bombarded by energetic particles of a plasma or gas. It occurs naturally in outer space, and can be an unwelcome source of wear in precision components. However, the fact that it can be made to act on extremely fine layers of material is utilised in science and industry—there, it is used to perform precise etching, carry out analytical techniques, and deposit thin film layers in the manufacture of optical coatings, semiconductor devices and nanotechnology products. It is a physical vapor deposition technique.

==Physics==
When energetic ions collide with atoms of a target material, an exchange of momentum takes place between them.

These ions, known as &quot;incident ions&quot;, set off collision cascades in the target. Such cascades can take many paths; some recoil back toward the surface of the target. If a collision cascade reaches the surface of the target, and its remaining energy is greater than the target&#x27;s surface binding energy, an atom will be ejected. This process is known as &quot;sputtering&quot;. If the target is thin (on an atomic scale), the collision cascade can reach through to its back side; the atoms ejected in this fashion are said to escape the surface binding energy &quot;in transmission&quot;.

The average number of atoms ejected from the target per incident ion is called the &quot;sputter yield&quot;. The sputter yield depends on several things: the angle at which ions collide with the surface of the material, how much energy they strike it with, their masses, the masses of the target atoms, and the target&#x27;s surface binding energy. If the target possesses a crystal structure, the orientation of its axes with respect to the surface is an important factor.

The ions that cause sputtering come from a variety of sources—they can come from plasma, specially constructed ion sources, particle accelerators, outer space (e.g. solar wind), or radioactive materials (e.g. alpha radiation).

A model for describing sputtering in the cascade regime for amorphous flat targets is Thompson&#x27;s analytical model. An algorithm that simulates sputtering based on a quantum mechanical treatment including electrons stripping at high energy is implemented in the program TRIM.

Another mechanism of physical sputtering is called &quot;heat spike sputtering&quot;. This can occur when the solid is dense enough, and the incoming ion heavy enough, that collisions occur very close to each other. In this case, the binary collision approximation is no longer valid, and the collisional process should be understood as a many-body process. The dense collisions induce a heat spike (also called thermal spike), which essentially melts a small portion of the crystal. If that portion is close enough to its surface, large numbers of atoms may be ejected, due to liquid flowing to the surface and/or microexplosions. Heat spike sputtering is most important for heavy ions (e.g. Xe or Au or cluster ions) with energies in the keV–MeV range bombarding dense but soft metals with a low melting point (Ag, Au, Pb, etc.). The heat spike sputtering often increases nonlinearly with energy, and can for small cluster ions lead to dramatic sputtering yields per cluster of the order of 10,000. For animations of such a process see &quot;Re: Displacement Cascade 1&quot; in the external links section.

Physical sputtering has a well-defined minimum energy threshold, equal to or larger than the ion energy at which the maximum energy transfer from the ion to a target atom equals the binding energy of a surface atom. That is to say, it can only happen when an ion is capable of transferring more energy into the target than is required for an atom to break free from its surface.

This threshold is typically somewhere in the range of ten to a hundred eV.

&quot;Preferential sputtering&quot; can occur at the start when a multicomponent solid target is bombarded and there is no solid state diffusion. If the energy transfer is more efficient to one of the target components, or it is less strongly bound to the solid, it will sputter more efficiently than the other. If in an AB alloy the component A is sputtered preferentially, the surface of the solid will, during prolonged bombardment, become enriched in the B component, thereby increasing the probability that B is sputtered such that the composition of the sputtered material will ultimately return to AB.

==Electronic sputtering== 
The term &quot;electronic sputtering&quot; can mean either sputtering induced by energetic electrons (for example in a transmission electron microscope), or sputtering due to very high-energy or highly charged heavy ions that lose energy to the solid, mostly by electronic stopping power, where the electronic excitations cause sputtering. Electronic sputtering produces high sputtering yields from insulators, as the electronic excitations that cause sputtering are not immediately quenched, as they would be in a conductor. One example of this is Jupiter&#x27;s ice-covered moon Europa, where a MeV sulfur ion from Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere can eject up to 10,000 H2O molecules.

==Potential sputtering==

In the case of multiple charged projectile ions a particular form of electronic sputtering can take place that has been termed &quot;potential sputtering&quot;. In these cases the potential energy stored in multiply charged ions (i.e., the energy necessary to produce an ion of this charge state from its neutral atom) is liberated when the ions recombine during impact on a solid surface (formation of hollow atoms). This sputtering process is characterized by a strong dependence of the observed sputtering yields on the charge state of the impinging ion and can already take place at ion impact energies well below the physical sputtering threshold. Potential sputtering has only been observed for certain target species and requires a minimum potential energy.

==Etching and chemical sputtering==
Removing atoms by sputtering with an inert gas is called &quot;ion milling&quot; or &quot;ion etching&quot;.

Sputtering can also play a role in reactive-ion etching (RIE), a plasma process carried out with chemically active ions and radicals, for which the sputtering yield may be enhanced significantly compared to pure physical sputtering. Reactive ions are frequently used in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) equipment to enhance the sputter rates. The mechanisms causing the sputtering enhancement are not always well understood, although the case of fluorine etching of Si has been modeled well theoretically.

Sputtering observed to occur below the threshold energy of physical sputtering is also often called chemical sputtering. The mechanisms behind such sputtering are not always well understood, and may be hard to distinguish from chemical etching. At elevated temperatures, chemical sputtering of carbon can be understood to be due to the incoming ions weakening bonds in the sample, which then desorb by thermal activation. The hydrogen-induced sputtering of carbon-based materials observed at low temperatures has been explained by H ions entering between C-C bonds and thus breaking them, a mechanism dubbed &quot;swift chemical sputtering&quot;.

==Applications and phenomena==

Sputtering only happens when the kinetic energy of the incoming particles is much higher than conventional thermal energies (≫ 1 eV). When done with direct current (DC sputtering), voltages of 3-5 kV are used. When done with alternating current (RF sputtering), frequencies are around the 14 MHz range.

===Sputter cleaning===
Surfaces of solids can be cleaned from contaminants by using physical sputtering in a vacuum. Sputter cleaning is often used in surface science, vacuum deposition and ion plating. In 1955 Farnsworth, Schlier, George, and Burger reported using sputter cleaning in an ultra-high-vacuum system to prepare ultra-clean surfaces for low-energy electron-diffraction (LEED) studies. Sputter cleaning became an integral part of the ion plating process. When the surfaces to be cleaned are large, a similar technique, plasma cleaning, can be used. Sputter cleaning has some potential problems such as overheating, gas incorporation in the surface region, bombardment (radiation) damage in the surface region, and the roughening of the surface, particularly if &quot;over done.&quot; It is important to have a &quot;clean&quot; plasma in order to not continually recontaminate the surface during sputter cleaning. Redeposition of sputtered material on the substrate can also give problems, especially at high sputtering pressures. Sputtering of the surface of a compound or alloy material can result in the surface composition being changed. Often the species with the least mass or the highest vapor pressure is the one preferentially sputtered from the surface.

===Film deposition===

Sputter deposition is a method of depositing thin films by sputtering that involves eroding material from a &quot;target&quot; source onto a &quot;substrate&quot;, e.g. a silicon wafer, solar cell, optical component, or many other possibilities. Resputtering, in contrast, involves re-emission of the deposited material, e.g. SiO2 during the deposition also by ion bombardment.

Sputtered atoms are ejected into the gas phase but are not in their thermodynamic equilibrium state, and tend to deposit on all surfaces in the vacuum chamber. A substrate (such as a wafer) placed in the chamber will be coated with a thin film. Sputtering deposition usually uses an argon plasma because argon, a noble gas, will not react with the target material.

=== Sputter damage ===
Sputter damage is usually defined during transparent electrode deposition on optoelectronic devices, which is usually originated from the substrate&#x27;s bombardment by highly energetic species. The main species involved in the process and the representative energies can be listed as (values taken from):

* Sputtered atoms (ions) from the target surface (~10 eV), the formation of which mainly depends on the binding energy of the target material;
* Negative ions (originating from the carrier gas) formed in the plasma (~5–15 eV), the formation of which mainly depends on the plasma potential;
* Negative ions formed at the target surface (up to 400 eV), the formation of which mainly depends on the target voltage;
* Positive ions formed in the plasma (~15 eV), the formation of which mainly depends on the potential fall in front of a substrate at floating potential;
* Reflected atoms and neutralized ions from the target surface (20–50 eV), the formation of which mainly depends on the background gas and the mass of the sputtered element.

As seen in the list above, negative ions (e.g., O− and In− for ITO sputtering) formed at the target surface and accelerated toward the substrate acquire the largest energy, which is determined by the potential between target and plasma potentials. Although the flux of the energetic particles is an important parameter, high-energy negative O− ions are additionally the most abundant species in plasma in case of reactive deposition of oxides. However, energies of other ions/atoms (e.g., Ar+, Ar0, or In0) in the discharge may already be sufficient to dissociate surface bonds or etch soft layers in certain device technologies. In addition, the momentum transfer of high-energy particles from the plasma (Ar, oxygen ions) or sputtered from the target might impinge or even increase the substrate temperature sufficiently to trigger physical (e.g., etching) or thermal degradation of sensitive substrate layers (e.g. thin film metal halide perovskites).

This can affect the functional properties of underlying charge transport and passivation layers and photoactive absorbers or emitters, eroding device performance. For instance, due to sputter damage, there may be inevitable interfacial consequences such as pinning of the Fermi level, caused by damage-related interface gap states, resulting in the formation of Schottky-barrier impeding carrier transport. Sputter damage can also impair the doping efficiency of materials and the lifetime of excess charge carriers in photoactive materials; in some cases, depending on its extent, such damage can even lead to a reduced shunt resistance.

===Etching===
In the semiconductor industry sputtering is used to etch the target. Sputter etching is chosen in cases where a high degree of etching anisotropy is needed and selectivity is not a concern. One major drawback of this technique is wafer damage and high voltage use.

===For analysis===
Another application of sputtering is to etch away the target material. One such example occurs in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), where the target sample is sputtered at a constant rate. As the target is sputtered, the concentration and identity of sputtered atoms are measured using mass spectrometry. In this way the composition of the target material can be determined and even extremely low concentrations (20 μg/kg) of impurities detected. Furthermore, because the sputtering continually etches deeper into the sample, concentration profiles as a function of depth can be measured.

===In space===
Sputtering is one of the forms of space weathering, a process that changes the physical and chemical properties of airless bodies, such as asteroids and the Moon. On icy moons, especially Europa, sputtering of photolyzed water from the surface leads to net loss of hydrogen and accumulation of oxygen-rich materials that may be important for life. Sputtering is also one of the possible ways that Mars has lost most of its atmosphere and that Mercury continually replenishes its tenuous surface-bounded exosphere.

===Optics===
Due to its adaptability with a wide range of materials, Sputtering is used to create various types of coatings that enhance the performance of optical components. Anti-reflective coatings are applied to lenses and optical instruments to minimize light reflection and increase light transmission, which improves clarity and reduces glare. Sputtering is also used to deposit reflective coatings on mirrors, ensuring high reflectivity and durability for applications such as telescopes, cameras, and laser systems.

<doc id="28630" wikidata="Q555730" url="?curid=28630" title="Satchel Paige">
<text>Leroy Robert &quot;Satchel&quot; Paige (July 7, 1906 – June 8, 1982) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played in Negro league baseball and Major League Baseball (MLB). His career spanned five decades and culminated with his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

A right-handed pitcher, Paige first played for the semi-professional Mobile Tigers from 1924 to 1926. He began his professional baseball career in 1926 with the Chattanooga Black Lookouts of the Negro Southern League and became one of the most famous and successful players from the Negro leagues. On town tours across the United States, Paige would sometimes have his infielders sit down behind him and then routinely strike out the side.

At age 42 in 1948, Paige made his debut for the Cleveland Indians; to this day, this makes him the oldest debutant in National League or American League history. Additionally, Paige was 59 years old when he played his last major league game, which is also a record that stands to this day. Paige was the first black pitcher to play in the American League and was the seventh black player to play in Major League Baseball. Also in 1948, Paige became the first player who had played in the Negro leagues to pitch in the World Series; the Indians won the Series that year. He played with the St. Louis Browns from 1951 to 1953, representing the team in the All-Star Game in 1952 and 1953. He played his last professional game on June 21, 1966, for the Peninsula Grays of the Carolina League, two weeks shy of 60. In 1971, Paige became the first electee of the Negro League Committee to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Date of birth==
While Satchel Paige was playing baseball, many ages and birthdates were reported, ranging from 1900 to 1908. Paige himself was the source of many of these dates. His actual birthdate, July 7, 1906, was determined in 1948 when Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck traveled to Mobile, Alabama, and accompanied Paige&#x27;s family to the County Health Department to obtain his birth certificate. Paige&#x27;s birth certificate is displayed in his autobiography.

In 1959, Paige&#x27;s mother told a reporter that he was 55 rather than 53, saying she knew this because she wrote it down in her Bible. Paige wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Seems like Mom&#x27;s Bible would know, but she ain&#x27;t ever shown me the Bible. Anyway, she was in her nineties when she told the reporter that, and sometimes she tended to forget things.&quot;

==Early life==
Paige was born Leroy Robert Page to John Page, a gardener, and Lula Page (née Coleman), a domestic worker, in a section of Mobile, Alabama, known as Down the Bay. Lula and her children changed the spelling of their name from Page to Paige in the mid 1920s, just before the start of Satchel&#x27;s baseball career. Lula said, &quot;Page looked too much like a page in a book,&quot; whereas Paige explained, &quot;My folks started out by spelling their name &#x27;Page&#x27; and later stuck in the &#x27;i&#x27; to make themselves sound more high-tone.&quot; The introduction of the new spelling coincided with the death of Paige&#x27;s father, and may have suggested a desire for a new start.

According to Paige, his nickname originated from childhood work toting bags at the train station. He said he was not making enough money at a dime a bag, so he used a pole and rope to build a contraption that allowed him to cart up to four bags at once. Another kid supposedly yelled, &quot;You look like a walking satchel tree.&quot; A different story was told by boyhood friend and neighbor Wilber Hines, who said he gave Paige the nickname after he was caught trying to steal a bag. At the age of 10, Paige was playing &quot;top ball&quot;, which was what got him into baseball. &quot;Top ball&quot; was a kids&#x27; game that used sticks and bottle caps instead of baseballs and bats to play a variation of the diamond sport. Satchel&#x27;s mother, Lula, would even comment on how Paige would rather &quot;play baseball than eat. It was always baseball, baseball.&quot;

On July 24, 1918, just seventeen days after his 12th birthday, Paige was sentenced to six years—or until his 18th birthday, whichever came first—at the Alabama Reform School for Juvenile Negro Law-Breakers in Mount Meigs, Alabama, owing to his truancy in school along with his tendency to steal.

The person who taught Paige to pitch while in reform school was the Reverend Moses Davis. It was Davis, who was also a trustee of the school, who devoted the long hours coaching the boys in baseball, and it was he who struck the deal with the sporting-goods store in Montgomery to secure the team&#x27;s first uniforms. Davis was African American, as was the entire teaching staff at Mount Meigs, including the school&#x27;s founder, Cornelia Bowen, a graduate of Tuskegee Institute. Paige was released from the institution in December 1923, seven months short of his 18th birthday. He summed up his years of incarceration: &quot;I traded five years of freedom to learn how to pitch. At least I started my real learning on the Mount. They were not wasted years at all. It made a real man out of me.&quot;

After his release, Paige played for several Mobile semi-pro teams. He joined the semi-pro Mobile Tigers, for which his brother Wilson was already pitching. He also pitched for a semi-pro team named the &quot;Down the Bay Boys&quot;, and he recalled an incident in the ninth inning of a 1–0 ballgame when his teammates made three consecutive errors, loading the bases for the other team with two outs. Angry, Paige said he stomped around the mound, kicking up dirt. The fans started booing him, so he decided that &quot;somebody was going to have to be showed up for that.&quot; He called in his outfielders and had them sit down in the infield. With the fans and his own teammates howling, Paige struck out the final batter, winning the game.

==Negro leagues==

===Chattanooga and Birmingham: 1926–1929===
A former friend from Mobile, Alex Herman, was the player/manager for the Chattanooga White Sox of the minor Negro Southern League. In 1926 he discovered Paige and offered to pay him $250 per month, of which Paige would collect $50 with the rest going to his mother. He also agreed to pay Lula Paige a $200 advance, and she agreed to the contract.

The local newspapers—the &quot;Chattanooga News&quot; and &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot;—recognized from the beginning that Paige was special. In April 1926, shortly after his arrival, he recorded nine strikeouts over six innings against the Atlanta Black Crackers. Partway through the 1927 season, Paige&#x27;s contract was sold to the Birmingham Black Barons of the major Negro National League (NNL). According to Paige&#x27;s first memoir, his contract was for $450 per month, but in his second he said it was for $275.

Pitching for the Black Barons, Paige threw hard but was wild and awkward. In his first big game in late June 1927, against the St. Louis Stars, Paige incited a brawl when his fastball hit the hand of St. Louis catcher Mitchell Murray. Murray then charged the mound and Paige raced for the dugout, but Murray flung his bat and struck Paige above the hip. The police were summoned, and the headline of the &quot;Birmingham Reporter&quot; proclaimed a &quot;Near Riot.&quot; Paige improved and matured as a pitcher with help from his teammates, Sam Streeter and Harry Salmon, and his manager, Bill Gatewood. He finished the 1927 season 7–1 with 69 strikeouts and 26 walks in 89 innings.

Over the next two seasons, Paige went 12–5 and 10–9 while recording 176 strikeouts in 1929. (Several sources credit his 1929 strikeout total as the all-time single-season record for the Negro leagues, though there is variation among the sources about the exact number of strikeouts.) On April 29 of that season he recorded 17 strikeouts in a game against the Cuban Stars, which exceeded what was then the major league record of 16 held by Noodles Hahn and Rube Waddell. Six days later he struck out 18 Nashville Elite Giants, a number that was tied in the white majors by Bob Feller in 1938. Due to his increased earning potential, Barons owner R. T. Jackson would &quot;rent&quot; Paige out to other ball clubs for a game or two to draw a decent crowd, with both Jackson and Paige taking a cut.

===Cuba, Baltimore, and Cleveland: 1929–1931===
Abel Linares offered Paige $100 per game to play winter ball for the Santa Clara team in the Cuban League. Gambling on baseball games in Cuba was such a huge pastime that players were not allowed to drink alcohol, so they could stay ready to play. Paige—homesick for carousing, hating the food, despising the constant inspections and being thoroughly baffled by the language—went 6–5 in Cuba. He left Cuba abruptly before the end of the season, with several stories told about the circumstances. Paige told one version in which the mayor of a small hamlet asked him, in Spanish, if he had intentionally lost a particular game. Paige, not understanding a word the man said, nodded and smiled, thinking the man was fawning over him, and then had to flee from the furious mayor. Another version, also told by Paige, says that when he called on an attractive local girl at her home, she and her family interpreted his attentions as an official engagement and sent the police to enforce it, leading Paige to flee the island with police in pursuit. A third version, told by the general manager of the Santa Clara Leopards, says that he left Cuba in haste after legal charges were brought against him regarding an amorous incident with &quot;a young lady from the provincial mulatto bourgeoisie.&quot;

When Paige returned to the United States, he and Jackson revived their practice of renting him out to various teams. In the spring of 1930, Jackson leased him to the Baltimore Black Sox, who had won the 1929 American Negro League championship led by their bowlegged third baseman Jud &quot;Boojum&quot; Wilson. Paige, as a Southerner, found that he was an outsider on the Black Sox, and his teammates considered him a hick. Moreover, he was the team&#x27;s number two pitcher behind Laymon Yokely, and Paige did not like being overshadowed.

In midsummer Paige returned to Birmingham, where he pitched well the rest of the summer, going 7–4. In September he was leased to the Chicago American Giants of the NNL for a home-and-home series with the Houston Black Buffaloes of the Texas–Oklahoma League. Paige won one and lost one in the series and then returned to Birmingham.

By the spring of 1931, the Depression was taking its toll on the Negro leagues, and the Black Barons had temporarily disbanded. Few teams could afford Paige, but Tom Wilson, who was moving the Nashville Elite Giants to Cleveland as the Cleveland Cubs, thought he could. Playing in the same city as a white major league team, Paige recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d look over at the Cleveland Indians&#x27; stadium, called League Park... All season long it burned me, playing there in the shadow of that stadium. &quot;It didn&#x27;t hurt my pitching, but it sure didn&#x27;t do me any good.&quot;

===Pittsburgh, California, and North Dakota: 1931–1936===

In June 1931, the Crawford Colored Giants, an independent club owned by Pittsburgh underworld figure Gus Greenlee, made Paige an offer of $250 a month. On August 6, Paige made his Crawford debut against their hometown rivals, the Homestead Grays. Entering the game in the fourth inning, Paige held the Grays scoreless and had six strikeouts and no walks in five innings of relief work to get the win.

In September, Paige joined a Negro all-star team organized by Tom Wilson, called the Philadelphia Giants, to play in the California Winter League. This was the first of nine winters that he played in a league that provided ongoing competition between elite black and white baseball players, including major and minor league players. On October 24 Paige won his first California game 8–1, allowing five hits and striking out 11, including Babe Herman four times. He finished the winter with a 6–0 record and 70 strikeouts in 58 innings.

In 1932, Greenlee signed Josh Gibson, Oscar Charleston and Ted &quot;Double Duty&quot; Radcliffe away from Cumberland Posey&#x27;s Homestead Grays to assemble one of the finest baseball clubs in history. Paige took the mound when the Crawfords opened the season on April 30 in their newly built stadium, Greenlee Field, the first completely black-owned stadium in the country. Paige lost the opener to the New York Black Yankees in a pitching duel with Jesse &quot;Mountain&quot; Hubbard, but he got even with them by beating them twice that season, including Paige&#x27;s first Negro league no-hitter in July. Paige went 10–4, allowing 3.19 runs per game and striking out 92 in 132 innings.

In the midst of the Depression, Cum Posey&#x27;s new East–West League had collapsed by mid-season, and Greenlee was able to obtain many of the best players in black baseball. By the end of the season, Greenlee had signed to contracts Cool Papa Bell, John Henry Russell, Leroy Matlock, Jake Stephens, &quot;Boojum&quot; Wilson, Jimmie Crutchfield, Ted Page, Judy Johnson, and Rap Dixon. With the Crawfords playing five future Hall of Famers, many Negro league historians regard the 1930s Crawfords as the greatest team in Negro league history.

The next season, Greenlee organized a new Negro National League, which survived for 16 years. Despite Greenlee&#x27;s efforts to control his biggest star, Paige followed his own schedule and was often late to games that he was scheduled to pitch. In August, he jumped the Crawfords, accepting an offer from Neil Churchill&#x27;s North Dakota semi-pro team, the Bismarcks (sometimes known as the &quot;Bismarck Churchills&quot; today), of $400 and a late model car for just one month&#x27;s work. It was Paige&#x27;s first experience playing with an integrated team in the United States. He helped Bismarck beat their local rivals in Jamestown, who were also featuring a Negro league ace pitcher, Barney Brown. Paige was unapologetic when he returned to Pittsburgh in September to help the Crawfords win the second-half championship. Paige was snubbed by other Negro league players and fans when he was not selected for the first ever East–West All-Star Game.

The 1934 season was perhaps the best of Paige&#x27;s career, as he went 14–2 in league games while allowing 2.16 runs per game, recording 144 strikeouts, and giving up only 26 walks. On July 4, Paige threw his second no-hitter, this time against the Homestead Grays. He struck out 17, and only a first-inning walk to future Hall of Famer Buck Leonard and an error in the fourth inning prevented it from being a perfect game. Leonard, unnerved by the rising swoop of the ball, repeatedly asked the umpire to check the ball for scuffing. When the umpire removed one ball from play, Paige hollered, &quot;You may as well thrown &#x27;em all out &#x27;cause they&#x27;re all gonna jump like that.&quot;

&quot;The Denver Post&quot; conducted an annual baseball tournament (sometimes known as the &quot;Little World Series&quot;) that attracted semi-pro and independent professional teams from across the country. In 1934 it was open, for the first time, to black players. Greenlee leased Paige to the Colored House of David, a prominent barnstorming team of white men who represented a religious commune and wore beards. Their manager was Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander. Paige pitched shutouts in his first two starts, striking out 14 and 18. The final, championship game was his third start in five days and he faced the Kansas City Monarchs—at the time an independent, barnstorming team—who were participating in the tournament with a lineup augmented by Negro league stars Turkey Stearnes and Sam Bankhead. Paige faced Chet Brewer before a crowd of 11,120. Paige won the pitchers&#x27; duel 2–1, striking out 12 Monarchs for a tournament total of 44 strikeouts in 28 innings. The 1934 tournament was Paige&#x27;s first major exposure in front of the white press.

Paige received his first East–West All Star Game selection in 1934. Playing for the East, Paige came in during the sixth inning with a man on second and the score tied 0–0, and proceeded to strike out Alec Radcliffe and retire Turkey Stearnes and Mule Suttles on soft fly balls. The East scored one run in the top of the eighth and Paige held the West scoreless the rest of the way, giving him his first All-Star Game victory. 27 years after winning the second-ever East-West All-Star Game, Paige was also the winning pitcher of the 1961 East-West Game, the next to last in the series.

Despite an outstanding season, Paige had a strong competitor for best Negro league pitcher of 1934, the 21-year-old Slim Jones of the Philadelphia Stars, who went 22–3 in league games. In September, a four-team charity benefit doubleheader was played at Yankee Stadium, with the second game featuring a faceoff between Paige and Jones. Paige recalled driving all night from Pittsburgh and parking near the stadium, then falling asleep in the car. A batboy found and woke him, and he got into uniform just in time for his scheduled start. In a game that was sometimes described as the greatest game in Negro league history, Paige and Jones battled to a 1–1 tie that was called because of darkness. A rematch was scheduled, and this time Paige and the Crawfords beat Jones and the Stars 3–1.

That fall, Paige faced off against major league star Dizzy Dean, who that season had won 30 regular season games plus two more in the World Series, in several exhibition games. In Cleveland, Paige struck out 13 while beating Dean 4–1, although for that game Dean was playing with a minor league team. Later, while playing in the California Winter League, Paige faced Dean in front of 18,000 fans in Los Angeles, with Dean&#x27;s team including major league stars like Wally Berger. The two teams battled for 13 innings, with Paige&#x27;s team finally winning 1–0. Bill Veeck, future owner of the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, and Chicago White Sox, was watching the game and many years later described it as &quot;the greatest pitchers&#x27; battle I have ever seen.&quot; Paige and Dean would continue to barnstorm against each other until 1945. Later, when Dean was a sports columnist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, he called Paige &quot;the pitcher with the greatest stuff I ever saw.&quot;

In the spring of 1935, Greenlee refused Paige&#x27;s request to raise his $250 per month salary, so Paige decided to return to Bismarck for the same $400 per month and late model used car that he got before. Churchill added other Negro league players to the team—pitchers Barney Morris, and Hilton Smith, catcher Quincy Trouppe, and pitcher/catcher Double Duty Radcliffe. Paige dominated the competition, with a 29–2 record, 321 strikeouts, and only 16 walks. In Wichita, Ray &quot;Hap&quot; Dumont was establishing a new national baseball tournament, the National Baseball Congress. Dumont invited 32 semi-pro teams, paying $1,000 for Paige and his Bismarck teammates to attend. The tournament was held at Lawrence–Dumont Stadium in Wichita, Kansas and offered a $7,000 purse. Churchill added yet another Negro league star to his team—Chet Brewer, the Kansas City Monarchs&#x27; ace pitcher. Bismarck swept the tournament in seven straight games. Paige won the four games he started, pitched in relief in a fifth game, and struck out 60 batters—a record that still held 74 years later.
In September, Paige could not return to the NNL because he was banned from the league for the 1935 season for jumping to the Bismarck team. J. L. Wilkinson, owner of the independent Kansas City Monarchs, signed Paige on a game-by-game basis through the end of the season.

That winter, a northern California promoter, Johnny Burton, hired Paige to front a team called the &quot;Satchel Paige All-Stars&quot;, in a game to be held on February 7, 1936, in Oakland against a white all-star squad. The opposing team included a number of major league players out of the Bay Area, including Ernie Lombardi, Augie Galan, Cookie Lavagetto, and Gus Suhr, as well as Pacific Coast League star Joe DiMaggio, who was making his last stop as a minor leaguer before joining the New York Yankees. Other than Negro league catcher, Ebel Brooks, Paige&#x27;s team was composed of local semi-pro players. Despite the imbalance in talent, Paige kept the game to a 1–1 tie through nine innings, striking out 12 and giving up one run on three hits. In the bottom of the tenth inning, he struck out two more, then gave up a single to Dick Bartell, bringing up DiMaggio. Bartell stole second on the first pitch, then went to third on a wild pitch. DiMaggio then hit a hard hopper to the mound that Paige deflected; DiMaggio beat the second baseman&#x27;s throw to drive in the winning run. A Yankee scout watching the game wired the club that day a report that read, &quot;DiMaggio everything we&#x27;d hoped he&#x27;d be: Hit Satch one for four.&quot;

In 1936, Paige returned to Pittsburgh where Greenlee acquiesced to Paige&#x27;s salary demands and gave him a $600-per-month contract, by far the highest in the Negro leagues. In games for which complete box scores are available, Paige went 5–0, allowed 3.21 runs per game, and struck out 47 in 47 innings. At the end of the season, Tom Wilson arranged with the other NNL owners to assemble an all-star team that would enter the lucrative &quot;Denver Post&quot; tournament. The team included Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Leroy Matlock, Buck Leonard, Felton Snow, Bill Wright and Sammy Hughes. They swept the tournament in seven games to win the $5,000 prize, with Paige winning three of them. In the title game against an overmatched semi-pro team from Borger, Texas, Paige pitched a 7–0 shutout, striking out 18. The Negro league all-stars then barnstormed, playing a series against a team of major leaguers led by Rogers Hornsby. One match-up featured Paige facing the 17-year-old Bob Feller, who had just finished a half-season with the Cleveland Indians. Each pitched three innings and gave up one hit, with Feller striking out eight and Paige seven. Later in the game, the Negro league team pulled out a win.

===Dominican Republic: 1937===
In the spring of 1937 the Crawfords were training in New Orleans, and Paige was approached by Dr. José Enrique Aybar, dean of the University of Santo Domingo, deputy of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s national congress and director of the Dragones, a baseball team operated by Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic. Aybar hired Paige to act as an agent for Trujillo in recruiting other Negro league players to play for &quot;Los Dragones.&quot; Aybar gave Paige $30,000 to hire as many players as he could. Paige recruited five of his Crawfords teammates—Cool Papa Bell, Leroy Matlock, Sam Bankhead, Harry Williams and Herman Andrews—as well as Josh Gibson, who had recently been traded to the Homestead Grays. Other Dominican teams were also recruiting Negro league players. Greenlee and his fellow owners banned Paige and the other jumpers from the organized Negro leagues, but failed to dissuade the players.

In the Dominican Republic, the American players were shadowed by armed guards. Although the purpose of the guards was to protect the players, the players were fearful that Trujillo would unleash them in anger if his team lost the championship. The season ended with an eight-game series between the two top teams, Paige&#x27;s Dragones of &quot;Ciudad Trujillo&quot; (as Trujillo had renamed the capital city of Santo Domingo) and the Águilas Cibaeñas of Santiago. The Dragones won the first four, with Paige contributing two of them. The Águilas came back to win the next two and still had a chance to win the championship if they won the final two games. In Paige&#x27;s memoirs, he recalled finishing the game with two shutout innings to hold onto a 6–5 win while soldiers looked on &quot;like a firing squad.&quot; In reality, however, Paige did not enter the game until there was one out in the ninth inning, with his team leading 8–3. He proceeded to give up three runs on three hits before he got the third out on a great throw by Bankhead. Paige had an excellent season overall, however, leading the league with an 8–2 record.

Paige and the other players returning from the Dominican Republic faced a Negro league ban for jumping their teams. In response, they formed a barnstorming team called &quot;Trujillo&#x27;s All-Stars&quot;, which was later known as the &quot;Satchel Paige All-Stars.&quot; Wilkinson evaded the ban by having promoter Ray Dean schedule games between the All-Stars and the House of David. In August, the All-Stars won the &quot;Denver Post&quot; tournament. In late September, Paige faced a team of Negro league all-stars at the Polo Grounds. Despite striking out eight and allowing only two runs, he lost when the opposing pitcher, Johnny &quot;Schoolboy&quot; Taylor, tossed a no-hitter. A week later a rematch was held at Yankee Stadium, and this time Paige beat Taylor handily.

===Mexico: 1938===
In 1938, Greenlee, who still held Paige&#x27;s NNL contract, again made an unsuccessful attempt to sign Paige. Greenlee then sold his contract to the Newark Eagles for $5,000, but they could not sign him either. Paige instead went to play in the Mexican League.

Jorge Pasquel, a Mexican baseball executive and businessman, and his four brothers wanted the Mexican League to compete with the major leagues. Their plan to do that was to hire the best Negro league players who were ignored by the big leagues, then raid big league teams and field integrated clubs in the name of international baseball. With this goal, they hired Paige for $2,000 per month to play for the moribund Club Agrario of Mexico City, to create a rivalry for Club Azules of Veracruz, a powerhouse bunch led by Martín Dihigo. Back in the states, Greenlee, out $5,000, declared Paige &quot;banned forever from baseball.&quot;

Pitching in Venezuela, Paige felt pain in his right shoulder. After he arrived in Mexico, the pain developed into the first major injury of his career. He tried to pitch through the pain, and managed to beat Dihigo in their first match-up in early September, allowing one run in eight innings. Two weeks later they faced off again, and this time Paige could barely lift his arm. He managed to go six-plus innings in a game that Paige&#x27;s team ultimately lost 10–3. One sportswriter wrote that Paige looked like a &quot;squeezed lemon.&quot;

Paige returned to his hotel room. He recalled that the next morning, &quot;My stomach got sick with the pain that shot up my right arm. Sweat popped out all over me. The pain wouldn&#x27;t quit. I tried lifting my arm. I couldn&#x27;t. I just sat there, sweating, hurting enough to want to cry, getting sicker in the stomach and getting scared—real scared. My arm. I couldn&#x27;t lift it.&quot; He was examined by physicians in Mexico and in the United States; one expert told him that he would never pitch again.

===Kansas City Travelers: 1939===
With his arm injured, Paige suddenly found himself unemployable. He looked for work as a manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner was willing to give him a chance to play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.

Managed by Newt Joseph, the team also included Byron &quot;Mex&quot; Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, &quot;Everybody&#x27;d heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could to get the ball up to the plate and get it over, maybe even for a strike. But even that made my arm ache like a tooth was busting every time I threw. And the balls I was throwing never would fool anybody in the Negro leagues, not without a fast ball to go with them.&quot;

Sometime that summer Paige&#x27;s fast ball returned. Paige&#x27;s catcher, Frazier &quot;Slow&quot; Robinson, recalled that one afternoon Paige told him, &quot;You better be ready because I&#x27;m ready today.&quot; Paige then surprised him when, with Robinson expecting a lob, Paige &quot;threw that baseball so hard that he knocked the mitt off my hand.&quot; Modern sports medicine specialists suggest that Paige suffered from a partially torn rotator cuff in his shoulder caused by repetitive stress. Paige&#x27;s recovery was assisted by the Monarch&#x27;s long-time trainer, Frank &quot;Jewbaby&quot; Floyd, who was sent by Wilkinson to work with Paige. Floyd worked with massage, hot and cold water, ointments, and chiropractic. He had Paige rest his arm by pitching fewer innings and playing other positions.

By late fall his team was playing well against major Negro league teams. On September 22, 1939, in the second game of a double-header against the powerful American Giants, Paige won a 1–0 game, striking out 10 men in the seven innings before the game was called on account of darkness. Buck O&#x27;Neil, who had batted against Paige in 1935 and 1936 and faced him again in a game against the parent Monarchs, recalled a dropoff in speed but an improvement in deception. &quot;He could still throw hard. Not as hard as he had thrown, but you&#x27;re talkin&#x27; about somebody thrown&#x27; ninety-eight, a hundred miles an hour. But now he&#x27;s throwin&#x27; maybe ninety—which is still more than the average guy ... He was the best and, actually, he was so deceptive! You&#x27;d look at that big ol&#x27; slow arm movin&#x27; and—&quot;chooo&quot;—that ball&#x27;s just right by you. And then he&#x27;d come up and throw you a change of pace and, oh, man.&quot;

===Puerto Rico: 1939–40===
In just one season, Paige left his mark on Puerto Rican baseball. He arrived in Puerto Rico in late October, four weeks after the start of the 1939–40 winter season, and joined the &quot;Brujos de Guayama&quot; (the Guayama Witch Doctors). The town of Guayama is widely known for its Santería, Palo, and other spiritualist religious practices. In a legendary game in Guayama, Paige walked off the mound because he saw a ghost standing next to him.

A team that featured shortstop Perucho Cepeda and outfielder Tetelo Vargas, the Guayama Witch Doctors were the 1938–39 champions. In September 1939, they had won the semi-pro baseball &quot;World Series&quot; in Puerto Rico against the Duncan Cementeers. On November 5, Paige pitched a shutout against rival Santurce, which featured player-manager Josh Gibson, by a lopsided score of 23–0.

In a December game against Mayagüez, Paige set a league record by striking out 17. He ended the season with a 19–3 record, a 1.93 ERA, and 208 strikeouts in 205 innings. The 19 wins and 208 strikeouts set league single-season records that have never been broken. Paige helped his team win the league championship playoff series, winning two games against the San Juan Senadores.

Puerto Rican pitcher Ramón Bayron recalled, &quot;It took special eyes to see his pitches.&quot; Luis Olmo, who later played with the Brooklyn Dodgers, described Paige that winter as &quot;the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

===Kansas City Monarchs: 1940–1947===

Paige returned to the Travelers for the 1940 season. Abe and Effa Manley, owners of the Newark Eagles, still claimed that they still held the rights to Paige&#x27;s Negro league contract, and retaliated against Wilkinson by signing players from Wilkinson&#x27;s Negro American League. In late June, the NNL and NAL leaders met to discuss the situation and reached an agreement that allowed Paige to advance to the Kansas City Monarchs and let the Manleys keep the players they had recruited in violation of the inter-league rules. Late in the 1940 season, Paige was promoted to the Monarchs. On September 12, Paige made his debut with the Monarchs against the American Giants and pitched a five-inning darkness-shortened complete game. The Monarchs won 9–3 and Paige struck out ten.

Because of Paige&#x27;s strong gate appeal, there was considerable demand by outside teams to lease Paige&#x27;s services to pitch for a single game. With infrequent league games, Wilkinson booked Paige to pitch for small-town teams or other Negro league teams at rates ranging from a third of the total receipts to a fixed fee $250 to $2,000 per game, plus expenses. Wilkinson purchased a Douglas DC-3 airplane just to ferry Paige around to these outside appearances. Because of the larger gate when Paige pitched, the Monarchs&#x27; owners could also insist on a larger share of the receipts from their road games. Wilkinson and Paige each kept a share of the fees. By the early 1940s, Paige&#x27;s estimated annual earnings were $40,000, which was four times the pay of the average player on the major league New York Yankees and nearly matched the pay of their top star, Joe DiMaggio.

Hoping for some publicity for Paige, who had received relatively little coverage while pitching in the hinterlands with the Travelers, Wilkinson arranged for Paige to pitch on opening day of 1941 for the New York Black Yankees. Appearing in front of a crowd of 20,000 fans at Yankee Stadium, Paige pitched a complete game, 5–3 victory, striking out eight. As intended, the contest brought considerable coverage from both the black and white media, including a pictorial by &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Paige took over the role of ace pitcher for the Monarchs, while Hilton Smith, their former ace, dropped to number two pitcher and sometimes was relegated to relieving Paige. Because of Paige&#x27;s ability to draw a crowd, he would often be scheduled to start a game and pitch for three innings, with Smith or another teammate assigned to pitch the last six. In addition to Smith, Paige&#x27;s teammates included first baseman Buck O&#x27;Neil, shortstop and manager Newt Allen, and center fielder Willard Brown. In 1941, the Monarchs won their third consecutive Negro American League championship. Though no standings were published, according to historian John Holway, they had a 24–6 team record for a winning percentage of .800, placing them five games ahead of the second-place New Orleans/St. Louis Stars.

On August 1, 1941, Paige made his first appearance in the East–West All Star Game in five years, collecting 305,311 votes, 40,000 more than the next highest player, Buck Leonard. Paige entered the game at the start of the eighth inning with the East leading 8–1 and pitched the last two innings. The only hit he gave up was a slow roller to the NNL&#x27;s new starting catcher, the Baltimore Elite Giants&#x27; Roy Campanella.

With America&#x27;s entrance into World War II, Dizzy Dean came out of retirement, forming an all-star team consisting of recently drafted white major league and minor league players. On May 24, Dean faced Paige and the Monarchs in an exhibition game at Wrigley Field, the first time a black team ever played at Wrigley. The Monarchs defeated Dean&#x27;s All-Stars 3–1 in front of a crowd of 29,775. On May 31, Paige teamed up with the Homestead Grays to face Dean&#x27;s All-Stars again before 22,000 fans at Griffith Stadium. The Grays won 8–1, with Paige striking out seven (including Washington Senators star Cecil Travis) in five innings of work.

In the 1942 East-West All-Star Game, Paige entered in the top of the seventh with the score tied 2–2. Pitching the last three innings, he allowed three runs on five hits and was charged with the loss in the 5–2 game.

====1942 Negro World Series====
The Monarchs won the Negro American League pennant again in 1942. For the first time since 1927, the champions of the two leagues, Kansas City and Washington/Homestead, met in the Negro World Series. Paige started game one in Washington and pitched five shutout innings. The Monarchs scored their first run in the top of the sixth. In the bottom of the frame, Jack Matchett relieved Paige and finished the game, with Kansas City adding seven more runs to win 8–0.

Game two was played two days later in Pittsburgh, and a highlight was Paige&#x27;s dramatic showdown with Josh Gibson. In the bottom of the sixth, Paige relieved starter Hilton Smith with the Monarchs ahead 2–0. In the seventh inning, he gave up three singles and faced Gibson with the bases loaded and two outs. Gibson fouled off the first two pitches, then whiffed on the third. When Paige told the story in his autobiography, he mythologized the story. According to Paige, the strikeout came in the ninth inning with a one-run lead, and he walked the three batters ahead of Gibson in order to face him. The mythical version was retold by Buck Leonard and Buck O&#x27;Neil in their memoirs. In the actual game, the Monarchs added three runs in the top of the eighth to take a 5–0 lead, then Paige gave up four in the bottom of the frame to make it 5–4. The Monarchs added another three in the top of the ninth and won 8–4.

After two days rest, Paige started game three, which was played in Yankee Stadium. Paige gave up two runs in the first and was pulled after two innings. Matchett pitched the remainder of the game, which the Monarchs won, 9–3, giving them a 3–0 lead in the series. The next series game was played a week later in Kansas City. When the injury-plagued Grays brought in star players from other teams, including pitcher Leon Day, second baseman Lenny Pearson, and outfielder Ed Stone of the Newark Eagles and shortstop Bus Clarkson of the Philadelphia Stars, the Monarchs played under protest. Day and Paige both pitched complete games, with Paige giving up four runs on eight hits and Day giving up one run on five hits for a Grays victory. The Monarchs&#x27; protest was upheld and the game was disallowed. Game four took place in Shibe Park in Philadelphia, and Paige was scheduled to start, but he did not show up until the fourth inning. According to his autobiography, Paige was delayed in Lancaster, Pennsylvania by an arrest for speeding. The Grays had taken a 5–4 lead, and Paige immediately entered the game. In the remainder of the game, he did not allow a hit or a run and struck out six, while the Monarchs&#x27; hitters scored two runs in the seventh to take the lead and three more in the eighth to win, 9–5, and sweep the series. Paige had pitched in all four official games in the Series (as well as one unofficial one), going 16 innings, striking out 18, and giving up eight hits and six runs.

====1943–1946====

Paige was the West&#x27;s starting pitcher in the 1943 East-West All-Star Game, played before a record 51,723 fans in Comiskey Park. He pitched three scoreless innings without giving up a hit, struck out four, walked one, and was credited as the winning pitcher in the West&#x27;s 2–1 victory. As a batter, he hit a double to lead off the bottom of the third, then was lifted for a pitch runner to &quot;thunderous applause.&quot;

World War II caused a large number of baseball players to be inducted into military service. Among Paige&#x27;s Kansas City teammates, Connie Johnson, Buck O&#x27;Neil, and Ted Strong entered military service that year, and Willard Brown followed them the following season. Paige&#x27;s Selective Service records show that during the war his draft status evolved from 1-A (available to be drafted) to 2-A (&quot;deferred in support of national health, safety, or interest&quot;) to the final 4-A (too old for service, even though when he registered he gave a birth date of 1908, two years younger than his actual birth date). Paige continued to play, and the available statistics show a slip in performance in 1943, with a 6–8 record and a 4.59 run average (his highest average since 1929) reported for the Monarchs. The Monarchs&#x27; string of four straight pennants ended, as the Negro American League title was captured by the Birmingham Black Barons in 1943 and 1944 and by the Cleveland Buckeyes in 1945. In 1944, Paige won six games while striking out 85 batters with a 0.72 ERA.

Before the 1944 East-West All-Star Game—black baseball&#x27;s most lucrative event—Paige grabbed headlines when he demanded that the owners contribute the receipts to the war relief fund, threatening a player strike if they did not accede. The owners were able to turn the other players and fans against Paige, however, when they revealed that Paige had received $800 for participating in the 1943 game (in contrast to the $50 paid to the other players) and had demanded an extra cut for the 1944 game as well. Paige was removed from the roster and the strike was averted when the owners agreed to raise the player payments (the East&#x27;s team accepted $200 each, while the West&#x27;s players agreed to $100).

In 1946, many of the Monarchs&#x27; players, including Willard Brown, Connie Johnson, Buck O&#x27;Neil, Ford Smith, and Ted Strong, returned from military service, and the team led the NAL in both the first and second halves, capturing the league pennant. O&#x27;Neil led the league in batting average, Brown in home runs, Johnson in wins, and Paige in total run average.

====1946 Negro World Series====
The Monarchs faced the Newark Eagles in the 1946 Negro World Series. The first game was played at the Polo Grounds and Hilton Smith started for the Monarchs. The Monarchs held a 1–0 lead in the bottom of the sixth, when Smith walked Larry Doby to lead off the inning, and Paige was called in to relieve. Paige struck out Monte Irvin and Lenny Pearson, but Doby stole second and Paige gave up a single to Johnny Davis, which tied the game. In the top of the seventh, the Monarchs got the lead back when Paige hit a single, advanced to second on an error, and scored on a hit by Herb Souell. Paige shut down the Eagles for the rest of the game, striking out eight and allowing four hits over four innings, and was credited with the win.

Two days later, Paige came into the second game in a similar situation as the first, but the result was quite different. Ford Smith started the game for the Monarchs, and he had a 4–1 lead entering the bottom of the seventh. After allowing two runs and with Irvin on first, Paige was brought in to protect the 4–3 lead. This time, however, Paige gave up four hits before the end of the inning, and four runs crossed the plate. Paige finished the game, but was charged with the loss in the 7–4 game.

The next two games were played in Kansas City, and the Monarchs won game three, getting a complete game from Jim LaMarque. Ted Alexander started game four, but gave way to Paige in the top of the sixth with the Monarchs trailing 4–1. Paige gave up three runs on three hits in the sixth, including a home run to Irvin. He went on to finish the game, giving up one more run in the seventh, and the Monarchs lost 8–1.

Kansas City won the fifth game and Newark won the sixth. For the deciding game seven, Paige was missing. Buck O&#x27;Neil believed Paige was meeting with Bob Feller about their upcoming barnstorming tour. With Ford Smith pitching, the Monarchs lost 3–2, and the Eagles claimed the championship.

====Barnstorming with Feller: 1946–1947====
In late 1946, Bob Feller organized the first barnstorming tour to use airplanes to travel from site to site. His tour has been described as &quot;the most ambitious baseball undertaking since John McGraw and Charles Comiskey dreamed up their round-the-world junket in 1913.&quot; For his team, Feller recruited all-stars from both major leagues. As his main opponent, he asked Paige to head a team of Negro league all-stars.

Feller&#x27;s team included 1946 American League batting champion, Mickey Vernon, at first base, Johnny Beradino at second, Phil Rizzuto at shortstop, and Ken Keltner at third. The outfielders were Jeff Heath, Charlie Keller, and Sam Chapman; after the World Series was over, National League batting champion Stan Musial would also join the tour. Catching was shared by Jim Hegan and Frankie Hayes. In addition to Feller, the pitching staff included Bob Lemon, Dutch Leonard, Johnny Sain, Spud Chandler, and Fred Hutchinson.

With help from J.L. Wilkinson and Tom Baird, Paige assembled a team that included first baseman Buck O&#x27;Neil, second baseman Hank Thompson, shortstops Chico Renfroe and Artie Wilson, third basemen Howard Easterling and Herb Souell, outfielders Gene Benson and Johnny Davis, catcher Quincy Trouppe, and pitchers Barney Brown, Gentry Jessup, Rufus Lewis, Hilton Smith, and Neck Stanley.

Feller scheduled 35 games in 31 cities in 17 states, all to be played in 27 days. The tour would require 13,000 miles of travel. Several same-day multi-city doubleheaders were to be played. Feller leased two DC-3 airplanes, with &quot;Bob Feller All-Stars&quot; painted on one fuselage and &quot;Satchel Paige All-Stars&quot; on the other. While Feller&#x27;s team would face several other opponents, the majority of the games were against Paige&#x27;s team. Feller and Paige would start each game whenever possible and usually pitch one to five innings.

The first game was played at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh on September 30, two days after the end of the major league season and one day after the final game of the Negro World Series. Paige and Feller each pitched three innings and left the game with the score tied 1–1. Feller struck out three and gave up two hits, while Paige struck out four and gave up only one hit. Paige&#x27;s team broke the tie in the seventh inning when Hank Thompson walked and stole second and Souell drove him home with a single up the middle.

Over the next six days, Feller&#x27;s team won games in Youngstown, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati, New York, and Newark, before Paige&#x27;s team won a second game in New York. Paige pitched five shutout innings in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 27,462. After the game they flew to Baltimore, where that same evening Paige&#x27;s team beat Feller&#x27;s. The next day, Paige&#x27;s team won again in Columbus. From there, Feller&#x27;s team won games in Dayton, Ohio, Richmond, Indiana, Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Wichita, Kansas. They then played two games in Kansas City, with Paige&#x27;s team winning the first game on a three-run walk-off home run by Johnny Davis, and Feller&#x27;s team winning the second. After that series, Feller&#x27;s team continued on to Denver and California, while most of Paige&#x27;s team left the tour. Paige, however, continued on to California where he joined a lesser team, Chet Brewer&#x27;s Kansas City Royals, which was scheduled to play Feller&#x27;s All-Stars.

Paige faced Feller in Los Angeles and in San Diego and lost both games. Another scheduled match-up was cancelled when Paige filed a lawsuit against Feller, claiming that Feller had not paid some of the money he was owed. Overall, Feller had pitched 54 innings against Paige&#x27;s team and given up 15 runs, an average of 2.50 per nine innings. Paige had pitched 42 innings and allowed 18 runs, or 3.86 per nine innings.

After the 1947 season, Feller organized another all-star team for a barnstorming tour. This time, Paige was not invited to tour with him, with Feller opting to play more games in the South against white opponents. Paige did face Feller twice, however, while playing with Chet Brewer&#x27;s Kansas City Royals in Los Angeles. In the first game, on October 15, both pitchers went four innings. Feller gave up four hits and one walk and struck out two, while Paige gave up just two hits and one walk and struck out seven. Nevertheless, Paige took the loss when he gave up a run in the fourth when Keltner singled and later scored on a sacrifice fly by Heath. On October 19, they again faced each other in front of a crowd of 12,000-plus. Both pitchers went five innings. Paige allowed three hits and no walks, and struck out eight, including Ralph Kiner twice. He left the game with a 1–0 lead, but Feller&#x27;s team came back in the late innings to win 2–1.

==American and National League==
===Cleveland Indians===
On July 7, 1948, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck brought Paige in to try out with Indians player-coach Lou Boudreau. On that same day, his 42nd birthday, Paige signed his first major league contract, for $40,000 for the three months remaining in the season, becoming the first black pitcher in the American League and the seventh black big leaguer overall. On July 9, 1948, Paige became the oldest man ever to debut in the National League or American League, at the age of 42 years and two days. When asked about his age, he would reply &quot;If someone asked you how old you were and you didn&#x27;t know your age, how old would you think you were?&quot; With the St. Louis Browns beating the Indians 4–1 in the bottom of the fourth inning, Boudreau pulled his starting pitcher, Bob Lemon, and sent Paige in. Paige, not knowing the signs and not wanting to confuse his catcher, pitched cautiously. Chuck Stevens lined a ball to left field for a single. Jerry Priddy bunted Stevens over to second. Up next was Whitey Platt, and Paige decided to take command. He threw an overhand pitch for a strike and one sidearm for another strike. Paige then threw his &quot;Hesitation Pitch&quot; (see &quot;pitching style&quot; section below), which surprised Platt so much that he threw his bat 40 feet up the third base line. Browns manager Zack Taylor bolted from the dugout to talk to umpire Bill McGowan about the pitch, claiming it was a balk, but McGowan let it stand as a strike. Paige then got Al Zarilla to fly out to end the inning. The next inning, he gave up a leadoff single, but with his catcher having simplified his signals, Paige got the next batter to hit into a double play, followed by a pop fly. Larry Doby pinch-hit for Paige the following inning.
Paige got his first big league victory on July 15, 1948, the night after he pitched in an exhibition game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in front of 65,000 people in Cleveland&#x27;s Municipal Stadium. It came at Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park. The Indians were up 5–3 and the bases were loaded in the sixth inning of the second game of a double header. He got Eddie Joost to fly out to end the inning, but gave up two runs the next inning when Ferris Fain doubled and Hank Majeski hit a home run. Paige buckled down and gave up only one more hit the rest of the game, getting five of the next six outs on fly balls.

Longtime Chicago Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse once said with amusement that Paige &quot;threw a lot of pitches that were not quite &#x27;legal&#x27; and not quite &#x27;illegal. American League President Will Harridge eventually ruled the hesitation pitch illegal and stated that if Paige threw it again, it would be called a balk. Paige said, &quot;I guess Mr. Harridge did not want me to show up those boys who were young enough to be my sons.&quot;

On August 3, 1948, with the Indians one game behind the Athletics, Boudreau started Paige against the Washington Senators in Cleveland. The 72,562 people that saw the game set a new attendance record for a major league night game. Although a nervous Paige walked two of the first three batters and gave up a triple to Bud Stewart to fall behind 2–0, by the time he left in the seventh, the Indians were up 4–2 and held on to give him his second victory. His next start was at Comiskey Park in Chicago. 51,013 people paid to see the game, but many thousands more stormed the turnstiles and crashed into the park, overwhelming the few dozen ticket-takers. Paige went the distance, shutting out the White Sox, 5–0, debunking the assumption that nine innings of pitching was now beyond his capabilities.

The Indians were in a heated pennant race on August 20, 1948. Coming into the game against the White Sox, Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden and Sam Zoldak had thrown shutouts to run up a 30-inning scoreless streak, 11 shy of the big league record. 201,829 people had come to see his last three starts. For this game in Cleveland, 78,382 people came to see Paige, a full 6,000 more people than the previous night game attendance record. Paige went the distance, giving up two singles and one double for his second consecutive three hit shutout. At that point in the season, Paige was 5–1 with an astoundingly low 1.33 ERA. He made one appearance in the 1948 World Series. He pitched for two-thirds of an inning in Game Five while the Indians were trailing the Boston Braves. Paige gave up a sacrifice fly to Warren Spahn, got called for a balk, and got Tommy Holmes to ground out to shortstop Lou Boudreau. The Indians won the series in six games.

Paige ended the 1948 season with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 2 shutouts, 43 strikeouts, 22 walks and 61 base hits allowed in 72 innings. There was some discussion of Paige possibly winning the Rookie of the Year Award. While technically a &quot;rookie&quot; to the majors, the 20-plus-year veteran Paige regarded such an idea with disdain and considered rejecting the award if it were to be given. The issue proved moot, as both versions of the award (by Major League Baseball and by &quot;Sporting News&quot;) were given to other players. The year 1949 was not nearly as good for Paige as 1948. He ended the season with a 4–7 record and was 1–3 in his starts with a 3.04 ERA. After the season, with Veeck selling the team to pay for his divorce, the Indians gave Paige his unconditional release.

===St. Louis Browns===

Penniless, Paige returned to his barnstorming days after being released from the Indians. When Veeck bought an 80% interest in the St. Louis Browns he soon signed Paige. In his first game back in the major leagues, on July 18, 1951, against the Washington Senators, Paige pitched six innings of shutout baseball until the seventh when he gave up three runs. He ended the season with a 3–4 record and a 4.79 ERA.

In 1952, Rogers Hornsby took over as manager of the Browns, and despite past accusations of racism, Hornsby was less hesitant to use Paige than Boudreau was four years before. Paige was so effective that when Hornsby was fired by Veeck, his successor Marty Marion seemed not to want to risk going more than three games without using Paige in some form. By July 4, with Paige having worked in 25 games, Casey Stengel named him to the American League All-Star team, making him the first black pitcher on an AL All-Star team. The All-Star game was cut short after five innings due to rain and Paige never got in. Stengel resolved to name him to the team the following year. Paige finished the year 12–10 with a 3.07 ERA for a team that lost ninety games.

Stengel kept his word and named Paige to the 1953 All-Star team despite Paige not having a very good year. Paige ended the year with a disappointing 3–9 record. Paige was released after the season when Veeck sold the Browns.

===Hiatus from the Major Leagues===
Paige once again returned to his barnstorming days. Then, on August 14, 1955, Paige signed a contract with the Greensboro Patriots of the Carolina League.

Veeck once again came to Paige&#x27;s rescue when, after taking control of the Phillies&#x27; Triple-A farm team, the Miami Marlins of the International League, he signed Paige to a contract for $15,000 and a percentage of the gate. Paige finished the season 11–4 with an ERA of 1.86 with 79 strikeouts and only 28 walks. This time, when Veeck left the team, Paige was allowed to stay on, for two more years.

In 1957, the Marlins finished in sixth place, but Paige had a 10–8 record with 76 strikeouts versus 11 walks and 2.42 ERA. The following year, Paige finished 10–10, saying that he would not return to Miami in 1959. In 1959, Paige returned to his barnstorm roots and signed a pitching contract with the Havana Cuban Stars who were owned by Dempsey Hovland. Paige was in and out of baseball, pitching sporadically, over the next decade.

At the age of 55, in 1961, Paige signed on with the Triple-A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, pitching 25 innings, striking out 19 and giving up eight earned runs. He failed to record a single decision in his stint with the Beavers.

===Kansas City Athletics===
In 1965, Kansas City Athletics owner Charles O. Finley signed Paige, 59 at the time, for one game. On September 25, against the Boston Red Sox, Finley invited several Negro league veterans, including Cool Papa Bell, to be introduced before the game. Paige was in the bullpen, sitting on a rocking chair, being served coffee by a &quot;nurse&quot; between innings. He started the game by getting Jim Gosger out on a pop foul. The next man, Dalton Jones, reached first and went to second on an infield error, but was thrown out trying to reach third on a pitch in the dirt. Carl Yastrzemski doubled and Tony Conigliaro hit a fly ball to end the inning. The next six batters went down in order, including a strikeout of Bill Monbouquette. In the fourth inning, Paige took the mound, to be removed according to plan by Haywood Sullivan. He walked off to a standing ovation from the small crowd of 9,289. The lights dimmed and, led by the PA announcer, the fans lit matches and cigarette lighters while singing &quot;The Old Gray Mare&quot;.

===The end===
In 1966, Paige continued to tour the country pitching exhibition games. On June 19, 1966, Paige took the mound for the Carolina League&#x27;s Peninsula Grays against the Greensboro Yankees in a three-inning exhibition stint, not allowing a hit. Grays General Manager Marshall Fox decided to let the nearly-sixty-year-old legend pitch in a real game, which Satchel did two days later, drawing a much larger-than-usual crowd of 3,118 to War Memorial Stadium. Again facing Greensboro, Paige started the game and pitched two innings, allowing two runs on five hits, before giving way to scheduled starter (and future big-leaguer) Steve Mingori. Notably, the Grays opted to use their back-up catcher Bruce Lowell that night, and not their regular man behind the plate, future Hall of Famer Johnny Bench.

==Pitching style==
The spectacle of watching Paige pitch was made all the more entertaining by the expansive pitching repertoire he developed over the years. In his early years, Paige was known as a pure fastball pitcher. He experimented with releasing pitches from a variety of arm angles in that time, something he would build upon later as he added more pitches to the mix. In 1933, while he was playing integrated baseball in Bismarck, North Dakota, &quot;The Bismarck Tribune&quot; reported that Paige used &quot;a tricky delayed delivery with great effectiveness,&quot; something that would later become known as Paige&#x27;s famous &quot;hesitation pitch&quot;.
The idea came to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he&#x27;d swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn&#x27;t come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, stopping for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn&#x27;t get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.
In 1934, before a barnstorming match-up, Dizzy Dean was heard on the radio saying that &quot;Satchel Paige has no clue how to throw a curve.&quot; In actuality, Paige had been practicing and perfecting his curveball in secret for many years. When Dean came up to bat, Satchel Paige struck him out with nothing but curveballs—officially adding the pitch to his repertoire. Paige could throw a variety of curveballs at different speeds and arm angles.

In late 1939, after Paige had recovered from the severe arm injury that jeopardized his career, he re-designed his pitching repertoire to take better care of his arm. He still had an exceptional fastball but he did away with his fast curve, deciding to only throw slow curves from that point forward. He learned to throw a knuckleball from Cool Papa Bell, a pitch which he reportedly perfected in regards to its movement, but could not always fully control. He also added a &quot;slow sinker&quot; and used his hesitation pitch more frequently. Along with these additions to his repertoire, Paige made greater use of his sidearm and submarine releases, which both made him a more deceptive pitcher and lessened the strain on his pitching arm.
As Paige got older, he had to rely more and more on his offspeed pitches. By the time he finally got to play in the major leagues, he threw a seemingly endless variety of pitches, all of which moved. He was especially known for his tailing fastball, slow curve, hesitation pitch, a fantastic change-up, and a highly effective eephus pitch. He had unique trick pitches with unique names. Besides calling his fast ball &quot;Long Tom,&quot; he possessed trick pitches with names such as the &quot;Whipsy-Dipsy-Do,&quot; the &quot;Midnight Creeper,&quot; and &quot;the Wobbly Ball.&quot; He reportedly could deceive batters by throwing fastballs with a curveball wrist action, and vice versa. Pitching this way allowed Paige to be a highly effective pitcher, even into his fifties.

==Post-playing career==
After the 1957 season, Paige went to the Mexican state of Durango to appear in a United Artists movie, &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum and Julie London. Paige played Sgt. Tobe Sutton, a hard-bitten cavalry sergeant of the Buffalo Soldiers.

Late in 1960, Paige began collaborating with writer David Lipman on his autobiography, which was published by Doubleday in April 1962, and ran to three printings.

In 1968, Paige assumed the position of deputy sheriff in Jackson County, Missouri, with the understanding that he need not bother to actually come to work in the sheriff&#x27;s office. The purpose of the charade was to set up Paige with political credentials. Soon after, he ran for a Missouri state assembly seat with the support of the local Democratic club against incumbent Representative Leon Jordan. Jordan defeated Paige by the margin of 1,870 votes to 382 (83–17%).

In 1968, Paige reached out to all twenty MLB teams at the time to try and join one of them on the active roster in order to reach the 158 days required to qualify for the five-year minimum for the pension. On August 12, Atlanta Braves owner William Bartholomay agreed to sign him as an adviser. On February 26, 1969, the league and the players&#x27; association altered the pension requirements, with one of the requirements stating that any player that had played at least four years could qualify for the pension, including players that had played during 1959. At any rate, Paige worked the year as an assistant trainer.

Bowie Kuhn replaced William Eckert as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1969. In the wake of Ted Williams&#x27; 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech urging the induction of Negro leaguers, and on the recommendation of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America, Kuhn empowered a ten-man committee to sift through hundreds of names and nominate the first group of four Negro league players to go to the Hall of Fame. Because Paige pitched in Peninsula in 1966, he would not have been eligible for enshrinement until 1971, as players have to be out of professional baseball for at least five years before they can be elected. All of the men on the committee agreed that Paige had to be the first Negro league player to get elected. On February 9, 1971, Kuhn announced that Paige would be the first member of the Negro wing of the Hall of Fame. Because many in the press saw the suggestion of a &quot;Negro wing&quot; as separate-but-equal and denounced Major League Baseball for the idea, by the time that Paige&#x27;s induction came around on August 9, Kuhn convinced the owners and the private trust of the Hall of Fame that there should be no separate wing after all. It was decided that all who had been chosen and all who would be chosen would get their plaques in the &quot;regular&quot; section of the Hall of Fame.

Paige took a job with the Tulsa Oilers minor league team in 1973 as their pitching coach. During the mid-to-late 1970s he finally slowed down his traveling, making only occasional personal appearances at mostly minor league stadiums and banquets.

In 1980, Paige was named vice-president of the Triple-A Springfield Cardinals, although it was mostly an honorary position.

Paige was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2001.

==Personal life==
On October 26, 1934, Paige married his longtime girlfriend Janet Howard. They separated a few years later and she served Paige with divorce papers while he was walking onto the field during a game at Wrigley Field. At his court date, on August 4, 1943, Paige&#x27;s divorce was finalized with him paying a one time payment of $1,500 plus Howard&#x27;s $300 attorney&#x27;s fees.

Paige married Lucy Maria Figueroa during his time playing in Puerto Rico in 1940, but because he was not divorced from his first wife, the marriage to Figueroa was not legal.

In 1946 or 1947, Paige married LaHoma Jean Brown. Paige and LaHoma had seven children together; LaHoma also had a daughter from an earlier marriage.

==Death==
Paige died of a heart attack after a power failure at his home in Kansas City on June 8, 1982. He is buried on Paige Island in the Forest Hill Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City.

==Legacy==

In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, writing for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, named Paige as the hardest thrower in the history of baseball. He based this, in part, on the fact that: &quot;Joe DiMaggio would say that Paige was the best he ever faced. Bob Feller would say that Paige was the best he ever saw. Hack Wilson would say that the ball looked like a marble when it crossed the plate. Dizzy Dean would say that Paige&#x27;s fastball made his own look like a changeup.&quot; Posnanski further noted that for most of his career, Satchel Paige threw nothing but fastballs. Nothing. Oh, he named them different names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable for the better part of 15 years. One pitch. It&#x27;s a lot like Mariano Rivera, except he wasn&#x27;t doing it for one inning at a time. He was pitching complete games day after day. That had to be some kind of incredible fastball. ... [he was] perhaps the most precise pitcher in baseball history—he threw ludicrously hard. And he also threw hundreds and hundreds of innings.

Hall of Famer Charlie Gehringer, who faced Paige at the peak of his career, said &quot;I never hit against anybody better.&quot;

The episode &quot;The Ballad of Satchel Paige&quot; from the Chicago-based &quot;Destination Freedom&quot; radio anthology series was broadcast by station WMAQ on May 15, 1948.

On May 31, 1981, the ABC made-for-television movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back: The Story of Leroy &#x27;Satchel&#x27; Paige&quot; aired, starring Louis Gossett Jr. as Paige, Beverly Todd as Lahoma, and former baseball pro Bubba Phillips as Coach Hardy. Paige was paid $10,000 for his story and technical advice. The film was based on the 1962 book, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Pitch Forever&quot;. In August, with great difficulty because of health problems, he attended a reunion of Negro league players held in Ashland, Kentucky, that paid special tribute to him and Cool Papa Bell. Attending the reunion were Willie Mays, Buck Leonard, Monte Irvin, Judy Johnson, Chet Brewer, Gene Benson, Bob Feller and Happy Chandler.

In 1996, Paige was portrayed by Delroy Lindo in the HBO made-for-television film &quot;Soul of the Game&quot;.

In 1999, he ranked Number 19 on &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

On July 28, 2006, a statue of Satchel Paige was unveiled in Cooper Park, Cooperstown, New York commemorating the contributions of the Negro leagues to baseball.

<text>Samuel M. Raimi ( ; born October 23, 1959) is an American filmmaker. He is best known for directing the first three films in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise (1981–present) and the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–2007). He also directed the superhero movie &quot;Darkman&quot; (1990), the revisionist western &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (1995), the neo-noir crime thriller &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998), the supernatural thriller &quot;The Gift&quot; (2000), the supernatural horror &quot;Drag Me to Hell&quot; (2009), the Disney fantasy &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013), and the Marvel Studios film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022).

His films are known for their highly dynamic visual style, inspired by comic books and slapstick comedy. He founded the production companies Renaissance Pictures in 1979 and Ghost House Pictures in 2002. Raimi has also produced several successful television series, including &quot;&quot;, its spin-off &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot; starring long time friend and collaborator Bruce Campbell reprising his role in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise.

==Early life==
Raimi was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to a Conservative Jewish family. He is a son of merchants Celia Barbara (née Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi. His ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Hungary. His younger brother Ted is an actor, and his older brother Ivan is a screenwriter and physician. His older sister, Andrea Raimi Rubin, is a court reporter. Another older brother, Sander, died at 15 in an accidental drowning in Israel; Raimi has said that the trauma knitted the remaining family closer together and &quot;colored everything he&#x27;s done for the rest of his life&quot;. Raimi also mentioned that Sander first introduced him to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, igniting his love for comics.

Raimi graduated from Groves High School and later went on to attend Michigan State University and later Università Bocconi in Milan, Italy, where he studied English but left after three semesters to film &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;.

==Career==
===Film===
Raimi became fascinated with making films when his father brought a movie camera home one day. He began to make Super 8 movies with his friend Bruce Campbell, whom he met in 1975. In college, he teamed up with his brother&#x27;s roommate Robert Tapert and Campbell to shoot &quot;Within the Woods&quot; (1978), a 32-minute horror film which raised $375,000, as well as his debut feature film &quot;It&#x27;s Murder!&quot;. During that time, he also shot the seven-minute short film &quot;Clockwork&quot; (1978), starring Scott Spiegel (who had appeared in &quot;Within the Woods&quot;) and Cheryl Guttridge. Through family, friends, and a network of investors, Raimi was able to finance production of the highly successful horror film &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981), which became a cult hit and effectively launched Raimi&#x27;s career.

He began work on his third film &quot;Crimewave&quot; (1985), which he co-wrote with the then-unknown Coen brothers, shortly after. Intended as a live-action comic book, the film was unsuccessful, partly due to unwanted studio intervention. Raimi then returned to the horror genre with the seminal &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; (which added slapstick humor to the over the top horror, showcasing his love of the Three Stooges). With his brother Ivan Raimi (and crediting himself as Celia Abrams), Sam Raimi also wrote &quot;Easy Wheels&quot; (1989), which parodied the Outlaw biker film genre. A long-time comic book buff, he then attempted to adapt &quot;The Shadow&quot; into a movie, but was unable to secure the rights, so he created his own super-hero, &quot;Darkman&quot; (1990). The film was his first major studio picture, and was commercially successful, spawning two sequels. Through it he was still able to secure funding for &quot;Evil Dead III&quot;, which was retitled &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; and largely steered away from horror towards fantasy and comedy elements. &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;, the final movie in the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; trilogy, commercially underperformed, yet on video became a cult classic.

In the 1990s, Raimi moved into other genres, directing such films as the western &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; (starring Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman), the critically acclaimed crime thriller &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; (1998) (starring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton), and the romantic drama &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; (1999) (starring Kevin Costner).

Raimi achieved great critical and commercial success with the blockbuster &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002), which was adapted from the comic book series of the same name. The movie grossed over US$800 million worldwide, spawning two sequels: &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, both directed by Raimi and each grossing approximately $800 million. After the completion of the third &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, he planned on producing two more sequels (although Sony Pictures planned three sequels) but could not find a satisfactory script. In 2022, reflecting on &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, Raimi told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;It was a very painful experience for me. I wanted to make a Spider-Man movie to redeem myself for that. [The aborted] &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; — that was really what that was about. I wanted to go out on a high note. I didn&#x27;t want to just make another one that pretty much worked. I had a really high standard in my mind. And I didn&#x27;t think I could get that script to the level that I was hoping for by that start date.&quot; He, along with Marc Webb, were both brought on as creative consultants for Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, directed by Jon Watts.

Raimi frequently collaborates with Joel and Ethan Coen, beginning when Joel was one of the editors of &quot;Evil Dead&quot;. The Coens co-wrote &quot;Crimewave&quot; and &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; with Raimi in the mid-1980s (though &quot;Hudsucker&quot; was not produced for almost a decade). Raimi made cameo appearances in &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;, and with Joel Coen in &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;. The Coen brothers gave Raimi advice on shooting in snow for &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, based on their experiences with &quot;Fargo&quot;.

He worked in front of the camera in &quot;The Stand&quot; as a dimwitted hitman, John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Body Bags&quot; as a murdered gas station attendant, and &quot;Indian Summer&quot; in what is perhaps his biggest role as a bumbling assistant to Alan Arkin. The film was written by his childhood friend, writer-director Mike Binder, and shot at the camp that they both attended when they were younger. Raimi also produced the entire English-language &quot;The Grudge&quot; franchise, based on the original Japanese films.

According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Raimi had expressed an interest in directing a film version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the prequel to the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. In 2008, Guillermo del Toro was selected as the director, with Peter Jackson as the executive producer. Raimi may direct &quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot;, the next film based on the &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; CIA character created by Tom Clancy for Paramount Pictures. Disney also approached him to direct &quot;W.I.T.C.H.: The Movie&quot;, based on the popular comic.

Blizzard Entertainment announced on July 22, 2009, that Raimi would be directing a film adaptation of the &quot;Warcraft&quot; video game series, but at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that he would not be the director.

On September 23, 2009, he became the producer for the British supernatural thriller &quot;Refuge&quot;, which is directed by Corin Hardy and published by Mandate Pictures. He will produce the remake of the Danish thriller &quot;The Substitute&quot;, which will be directed by Scott Derrickson under his new label Spooky Pictures. Raimi produced with his company Ghost House Pictures the British thriller flick &quot;Burst 3D&quot;, directed by Neil Marshall.

Raimi directed &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, which was released on March 8, 2013, by Walt Disney Pictures and grossed $493 million worldwide. He said he would not be directing the planned sequel.

On December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new film version of &quot;The Shadow&quot; for Columbia Pictures. On October 16, 2007, Raimi stated that: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any news on &quot;The Shadow&quot; at this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we&#x27;ve got the rights to &quot;The Shadow&quot;. I love the character very much and we&#x27;re trying to work on a story that&#x27;ll do justice to the character.&quot;

Raimi, along with Bruce Campbell and Rob Tapert, produced the remake of Raimi&#x27;s &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. First-time feature filmmaker Fede Álvarez wrote and directed, and Diablo Cody was also brought in to revise/rewrite the script. Raimi confirmed plans to write &quot;Evil Dead 4&quot; with his brother; it was later specified that this film would be &quot;Army of Darkness 2&quot;. Álvarez revealed that Raimi would direct the sequel to &quot;Army of Darkness&quot;. However, in a 2014 interview, Bruce Campbell announced that &quot;Army of Darkness 2&quot; is not happening, saying &quot;It&#x27;s all internet b.s. There&#x27;s no reality whatsoever. These random comments slip out of either my mouth, or Sam Raimi&#x27;s mouth, next thing you know, we&#x27;re making a sequel.&quot;

On February 26, 2016, it was confirmed that Raimi is attached to direct the upcoming film &quot;World War 3&quot; for Warner Bros. The film will be based on a possible future inspired by the book &quot;The Next 100 Years&quot; by George Friedman.

On February 16, 2017, it was reported that Raimi will be directing a thriller about the Bermuda Triangle for Skydance Media, with the script being written by Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard.

By January 29, 2018, Raimi was set to direct the first in the movie adaptations of Patrick Rothfuss&#x27;s Kingkiller Chronicle series, &quot;The Name of the Wind&quot;, with Rothfuss and Lin-Manuel Miranda serving as executive producers.

On February 5, 2020, it was announced that Raimi was in talks with Marvel Studios to direct &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot;, and Raimi confirmed his involvement in April 2020. This marked Raimi&#x27;s return to the superhero film genre after more than 15 years following &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; in 2007 and his first feature film directorial effort since 2013&#x27;s &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful.&quot;

===Television===
In addition to film, Raimi has worked in television, producing such series as &quot;&quot; and its spin-off &quot;&quot;, both featuring his younger brother Ted Raimi and long-time friend Bruce Campbell, &quot;American Gothic&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra 2525&quot;, &quot;M.A.N.T.I.S.&quot;, &quot;13: Fear Is Real&quot;, &quot;Young Hercules&quot;, and &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;. In 2008, Raimi executive produced a syndicated TV series called &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;, based on Terry Goodkind&#x27;s best-selling &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot; fantasy series. He also executive produced the Starz original television series &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He directed the pilot episode of &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot; for Starz.

==Personal life==
Since 1993, Raimi has been married to Gillian Greene, daughter of Canadian actor Lorne Greene. They have five children; their three eldest, daughter Emma Rose and sons Lorne and Henry, appeared as extras in &quot;Drag Me to Hell&quot; and during the final battle in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;.

===Political donations===
In 1995, Raimi donated $450 to the campaign of then-Republican Senator Arlen Specter. In 2002, he donated $1,000 to Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. During the 2004 election cycle, Raimi donated $900 to Republican President George W. Bush.

<text>The Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA) is an Adventist Protestant Christian denomination which is distinguished by its observance of Saturday, the seventh day of the week in the Christian (Gregorian) and the Hebrew calendar, as the Sabbath, its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ, and its annihilationist soteriology. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century, and it was formally established in 1863. Among its co-founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.

Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common evangelical Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive eschatological teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church emphasizes diet and health, including adhering to Jewish dietary law, advocating vegetarianism, and its holistic view of human nature—i.e., that the body, soul, and spirit form one inseparable entity. The church holds the belief that &quot;God created the universe, and in a recent six-day creation made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.&quot; Marriage is defined as a lifelong union between a man and a woman. The second coming of Christ and resurrection of the dead are among official beliefs.

The world church is governed by a General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, with smaller regions administered by divisions, unions, local conferences, and local missions. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is &quot;one of the fastest-growing and most widespread churches worldwide&quot;, with a worldwide baptized membership of over 22 million people. , it was the twelfth-largest Protestant religious body in the world and the sixth-largest highly international religious body. It is ethnically and culturally diverse and maintains a missionary presence in over 215 countries and territories. The church operates over 7,500 schools including over 100 post-secondary institutions, numerous hospitals, and publishing houses worldwide, a humanitarian aid organization known as the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and tax-exempt businesses such as Sanitarium, the proceeds of which contribute to the church&#x27;s charitable and religious activities.

==History==
The Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest of several Adventist groups which arose from the Millerite movement of the 1840s in upstate New York, a phase of the Second Great Awakening. William Miller predicted on the basis of Daniel 8:14–16 and the &quot;day-year principle&quot; that Jesus Christ would return to Earth between the spring of 1843 and the spring of 1844. In the summer of 1844, Millerites came to believe that Jesus would return on October 22, 1844, understood to be the biblical Day of Atonement for that year. Miller&#x27;s failed prediction became known as the &quot;Great Disappointment&quot;.

Hiram Edson and other Millerites came to believe that Miller&#x27;s calculations were correct, but that his interpretation of Daniel 8:14 was flawed as he assumed Christ would come to cleanse the world. These Adventists came to the conviction that Daniel 8:14 foretold Christ&#x27;s entrance into the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary rather than his Second Coming. Over the next few decades this understanding of a sanctuary in heaven developed into the doctrine of the investigative judgment, an eschatological process that commenced in 1844, in which every person would be judged to verify their eligibility for salvation and God&#x27;s justice will be confirmed before the universe. This group of Adventists continued to believe that Christ&#x27;s second coming would continue to be imminent, however they resisted setting further dates for the event, citing Revelation 10:6, &quot;that there should be time no longer.&quot;

===Development of Sabbatarianism===
As the early Adventist movement consolidated its beliefs, the question of the biblical day of rest and worship was raised. The foremost proponent of Sabbath-keeping among early Adventists was Joseph Bates. Bates was introduced to the Sabbath doctrine through a tract written by Millerite preacher Thomas M. Preble, who in turn had been influenced by Rachel Oakes Preston, a young Seventh Day Baptist. This message was gradually accepted and formed the topic of the first edition of the church publication &quot;The Present Truth&quot;, which appeared in July 1849.

===Organization and recognition===
For about 20 years, the Adventist movement consisted of a small, loosely knit group of people who came from many churches and whose primary means of connection and interaction was through James White&#x27;s periodical &quot;The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald&quot;. They embraced the doctrines of the Sabbath, the heavenly sanctuary interpretation of Daniel 8:14, conditional immortality, and the expectation of Christ&#x27;s premillennial return. Among its most prominent figures were Joseph Bates, James White, and Ellen G. White. Ellen White came to occupy a particularly central role; her many visions and spiritual leadership convinced her fellow Adventists that she possessed the gift of prophecy.

On May 21, 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was officially founded in Battle Creek, Michigan. The denominational headquarters were later moved from Battle Creek to Takoma Park, Maryland, where they remained until 1989. The General Conference headquarters then moved to its current location in Silver Spring, Maryland.

In the 1870s, the denomination turned to evangelism through missionary work and revivals, tripling its membership to 16,000 by 1880 and establishing a presence beyond North America during the late 19th century. The denomination&#x27;s rapid growth continued, with 75,000 members in 1901. By that time, the denomination operated two colleges, a medical school, a dozen academies, 27 hospitals, and 13 publishing houses. By 1945, the church estimated that it had 210,000 members in the US and Canada, along with 360,000 members who lived in other parts of the world; the church&#x27;s budget was $29 million and the number of students who were enrolled in the church&#x27;s schools was 140,000.

==Beliefs==

The church first published its beliefs and doctrines in Battle Creek, Michigan in 1872, as a brief statement which was titled &quot;A Synopsis of Our Faith&quot;. The church experienced challenges as it formed its core beliefs and doctrines, especially as a number of the early Adventist leaders came from churches that held to some form of Arianism (Ellen G. White was not one of them). This, along with some of the movement&#x27;s other theological views, led conservative evangelical Protestants to regard it as a cult. According to Adventist scholars, the teachings and writings of White ultimately proved influential in shifting the church from largely semi-Arian roots towards Trinitarianism. Adventists, for the most part, credit her with bringing the Seventh-day Adventist church into a more comprehensive awareness of the Godhead during the 1890s. The Adventist Church adopted Trinitarian theology early in the 20th century and began to dialogue with other Protestant groups toward the middle of the century, eventually gaining wide recognition as a Protestant church. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; recognized the Seventh-day Adventist church as &quot;the fifth-largest Christian communion worldwide&quot; in its January 22, 2015 issue.

Although her husband claimed that her visions did not support the Trinitarian creed, her writings reveal a growing awareness on the &quot;mystery of the Godhead&quot;. After continued Bible study, and after a decades-long debate, the denomination eventually concluded that Scripture explicitly teaches the belief in the existence of a triune God, and it affirmed that biblical view in the non-credal 28 Fundamental Beliefs.

However, mainstream scholars are still not convinced that Ellen White was a Nicene Trinitarian. In her writing, she mentions a ceremony in heaven where Jesus was recognized in front of the heavenly host, to be equal with the Father, which Satan disapproved of (as explained in her book &quot;Spirit of Prophecy Vol. 1&quot;).

The official teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination are expressed in its 28 Fundamental Beliefs. This statement of beliefs was originally adopted by the General Conference in 1980, with an additional belief (number 11) being added in 2005. Almost all of the 28 Fundamental Beliefs are the same as other evangelical Protestant denominations. The Adventist beliefs that evangelicals consider heterodoxy is worshiping God on Saturday, the gift of prophecy by Ellen G. White and the sanctuary doctrine.

The church believes God created Earth in six days and rested on the seventh day, Saturday. The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes in baptizing new members by immersion. It believes the Bible to be the most important book. They believe when humans die, that they remain asleep until they are brought back to life. Eternal life is given to people who accept Jesus as their Savior. The church believes that one receives salvation through only Jesus. It believes that the investigative judgment will take place in heaven before Jesus returns to earth. The church believes in the Apocalypse of John which will bring on the Second Coming of Jesus.

==Culture and practices==
===Sabbath activities===

Part of Friday might be spent in preparation for the Sabbath; for example, preparing meals and tidying homes. Adventists may gather for Friday evening worship to welcome in the Sabbath, a practice often known as vespers.

====Worship service====
The major weekly worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with Sabbath School which is a structured time of small-group bible study at church. Adventists make use of an officially produced &quot;Sabbath School Lesson&quot;, which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter.

After a brief break, the community joins together again for a church service that follows a typical evangelical format, with a sermon as a central feature. Corporate singing, Scripture readings, prayers and an offering, including tithing (money collection), are other standard features. The instruments and forms of worship music vary greatly throughout the worldwide church.

====Holy Communion====
Adventist churches usually practice open communion four times a year. It commences with a foot washing ceremony, known as the &quot;Ordinance of Humility&quot;, based on the Gospel account of John 13. The Ordinance of Humility is meant to emulate Christ&#x27;s washing of his disciples&#x27; feet at the Last Supper and to remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. Participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together. After its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, which consists of unleavened bread and unfermented grape juice.

===Health and diet===


Since the Seventh-day Adventist Church began in the 1860s, it has advocated its members to eat a vegetarian diet, particularly the consumption of kosher foods described in , meaning abstinence from pork, rabbit, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as &quot;unclean&quot;. The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco and illegal drugs. In addition, some Adventists avoid processed foods and caffeine.

The pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals and meat alternatives into the Western diet. John Harvey Kellogg started the meat alternative movement by creating Protose at Battle Creek Sanitarium, which was later sold through mail order by Battle Creek Food Company. The Battle Creek Food Company mostly manufactured meat alternatives for the guests at Battle Creek Sanitarium. Will Keith Kellogg and John Harvey Kellogg invented corn flakes at Battle Creek Sanitarium, by putting stale wheat berry between rollers and baking it. It was later served to the sanitarium guests. The Kellogg brothers also invented bran flakes and Rice Krispies. Later in 1906, Will Keith Kellogg founded the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company in Battle Creek, Michigan. Special Foods founded in Worthington, Ohio, in 1939, manufactured nut meat substitutes. After World War II, it changed its name to Worthington Foods. Worthington Foods introduced two canned meat alternatives in 1949: Soyloin Steaks and Meatless Wieners. In 1960, it bought the rights to manufacture and market Battle Creek Foods Company products after John Harvey Kellogg died. In 1975, it released its frozen soy-based meatless foods nationwide. In both Australia and New Zealand, Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company owned by the church manufactures such brands as So Good, Up &amp; Go and Weet-Bix.

The Adventist Health Studies indicate that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research concludes that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists&#x27; social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan. Dan Buettner named Loma Linda, California a &quot;Blue Zone&quot; of longevity, and attributes that to the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists and their health practices. The 96,000 adults who participated in the Adventist Health Studies-2 from 2001 to 2007 were 30 to 112 years old, and lived in Canada and the United States. The study revealed 8% were vegans, 28% were ovo/lacto-vegetarians, 10% were pesco-vegetarians, 6% semi-vegetarian and 48% non-vegetarian. 98.9% of the participants were non-smokers and 93.4% abstained from drinking alcohol. Those who were vegetarian had a much lower risk of obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Adventists who were vegetarian had a lower risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, lung cancer and prostate cancer, compared to non-vegetarians. Those who were vegan had a lower body mass index, compared to vegetarians and meat eaters.

Adventists&#x27; clean lifestyles were recognized by the U.S. military in 1954 when 2,200 Adventists volunteered to serve as human test subjects in Operation Whitecoat, a biodefense medical research program whose stated purpose was to defend troops and civilians against biological weapons.

===Marriage===
The Adventist definition of marriage is a lawfully binding lifelong commitment between a man and a woman. The Church Manual professes the belief that marriage originated as an institution from the biblical story of Adam and Eve and that their union should be used as the pattern for all other marriages.

Adventists hold that marriage is a divine institution established by God during the events of the Book of Genesis prior to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden. They believe that God celebrated the union of Adam and Eve and that the concept of marriage was one of the first gifts of God to man, and that it is &quot;one of the two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of Paradise.&quot;

The Old and New Testament texts are interpreted by some Adventists to teach that wives should submit to their husbands in marriage.

Adventists hold that heterosexual marriages are the only biblically ordained grounds for sexual intimacy. Adventists do not perform same-sex marriages, and individuals who are openly homosexual cannot be ordained, but may hold church office and membership if they are not actively pursuing same-sex relationships. Current church policy states that openly homosexual (and &quot;practicing&quot;) persons are to be welcomed into the church services and treated with the love and kindness afforded any human being.

===Ethics and sexuality===
The Seventh-day Adventist Church opposes abortion, believing it can have long-term negative effects on both the individuals involved and society as a whole. In an official statement on the &quot;Biblical View of Unborn Life&quot;, the church declared that an unborn child is considered by God to be a living individual. However, there are circumstances where the mother&#x27;s life is at risk and Seventh-day Adventist hospitals will perform emergency abortions.

Adventists encourage sexual abstinence for both men and women before marriage. The church disapproves of extra-marital cohabitation. Adventists oppose homosexual activities and relationships, citing the belief that scripture makes no accommodation for homosexuality.

The Adventist church has released official statements in relation to other ethical issues such as euthanasia (against active euthanasia but permissive of passive withdrawal of medical support to allow death to occur), birth control (in favor of it for married couples if used correctly, but against abortion as birth control and premarital sex in any case) and human cloning (against it if the technology could result in defective births or abortions).

===Dress and entertainment===

Adventists have traditionally held socially conservative attitudes regarding dress and entertainment. These attitudes are reflected in one of the church&#x27;s fundamental beliefs:

Accordingly, Adventists are opposed to practices such as body piercing and tattoos and refrain from the wearing of jewelry, including such items as earrings and bracelets. Some also oppose the displaying of wedding bands, although banning wedding bands is not the position of the General Conference. In 1986, the North American Division permitted the wearing of wedding rings. Before that, it was a source of friction, since Adventists overseas have worn wedding rings for many decades.

Conservative Adventists avoid certain recreational activities which are considered to be a negative spiritual influence, including dancing, rock music and secular theatre. However, major studies conducted from 1989 onwards found that a majority of North American church youth reject some of these standards.

On June 29, 2000, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists adopted a resolution on gambling. The church encourages its members not to gamble and it will not accept funding from it.

===Youth ministry===
Missionary work with children and youth begins with the Adventurer club. The Adventurer curriculum is for children aged between 4–9 and it is divided into 6 classes which are little lamb, early bird, sunbeam, builder and helping hand. Each class builds on the previous class. The curriculum is structured in way that will interest, challenge, and provide successful experiences for children. The curriculum is divided into 5 sections which are, Basic, My God, Myself, My Friends and My World which help children to meet the objectives of the curriculum. The objectives of the Adventurer Curriculum are: to develop a Christ-like character; to experience the joy and satisfaction of doing things well; to express their love for Jesus in a natural way; to learn good sportsmanship and strengthen their ability to get along with others; to discover their God-given abilities and to learn how to use them to benefit self and serve others; to discover God&#x27;s world; to improve their understanding of what makes families strong; to develop parental support for the training of children. The club engages in witnessing, community work so as to share the love of Jesus.

Pathfinders is a club for 5th to 10th grade (up to 12th in the Florida Conference) boys and girls. It is similar to and based partly on the Scouting movement. Pathfinders exposes young people to such activities as camping, community service, personal mentorship, and skills-based education, and trains them for leadership in the church. Yearly &quot;Camporees&quot; are held in individual Conferences, where Pathfinders from the region gather and participate in events similar to Boy Scouts&#x27; Jamborees.

After a person enters 9th grade, they are eligible to join Teen Leadership Training within Pathfinders. In the 11th grade, typically after being a member of a club, they can become a Pathfinder or Adventurer staff member and begin the &quot;Master Guide&quot; program (similar to Scout Master) which develops leaders for both Adventurers and Pathfinders.

==Organization==

===Structure and polity===
The Seventh-day Adventist church is governed by a form of representation which resembles the presbyterian system of church organization. Four levels of organization exist within the world church.
# The local church is the foundation level of organizational structure and is the public face of the denomination. Every baptized Adventist is a member of a local church and has voting powers within that church.
# Directly above the local church is the &quot;local conference&quot;. The local conference is an organization of churches within a state, province or territory (or part thereof) which appoints ministers, owns church land and organizes the distribution of tithes and payments to ministers.
# Above the local conference is the &quot;union conference&quot; which embodies a number of local conferences within a larger territory.
# The highest level of governance within the church structure is the General Conference which consists of 13 &quot;Divisions&quot;, each assigned to various geographic locations. The General Conference is the church authority and has the final say in matters of conjecture and administrative issues. The General Conference is headed by the office of President. The General Conference head office is in Silver Spring, Maryland, United States.

Each organization is governed by a general &quot;session&quot; which occurs at certain intervals. This is usually when administrative decisions are made. The president of the General Conference, for instance, is elected at the General Conference Session every five years. Delegates to a session are appointed by organizations at a lower level. For example, each local church appoints delegates to a conference session.

Tithes collected from church members are not used directly by the local churches, but are passed upwards to the local conferences which then distribute the finances toward various ministry needs. Employees are compensated &quot;on the basis of the church remuneration policy and practice in effect in the location or country in which they reside&quot;.

The Church Manual gives provisions for each level of government to create educational, healthcare, publishing, and other institutions that are seen within the call of the Great Commission.

===Church officers and clergy===
The ordained clergy of the Adventist church are known as ministers or pastors. Ministers are neither elected nor employed by the local churches, but instead are appointed by the local Conferences, which assign them responsibility over a single church or group of churches. Ordination is a formal recognition bestowed upon pastors and elders after usually a number of years of service. In most parts of the world, women may not be given the title &quot;ordained&quot;, although some are employed in ministry, and may be &quot;commissioned&quot; or &quot;ordained-commissioned&quot;. However, beginning in 2012, some unions adopted policies of allowing member conferences to ordain without regard to gender.

A number of lay offices exist within the local church, including the ordained positions of elder and deacon. Elders and deacons are appointed by the vote of a local church business meeting or elected committees. Elders serve a mainly administrative and pastoral role, but must also be capable of providing religious leadership (particularly in the absence of an ordained minister). The role of deacons is to assist in the smooth functioning of a local church and to maintain church property.

===Ordination of women===
In 1990, at their General Conference Session leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church prevented the ordination of women. They voted 1,173 against and 377 in favor. Those who supported ordaining women were from Europe and North America, while those from Africa, Asia and South America were strongly against. Five years later, it turned down a request by the North American Division that its local conferences be allowed to ordain women.

On July 29, 2012, the Columbia Union Conference, which has its headquarters in Maryland voted 80 percent in favor of ordaining women. On August 19, 2012, the Pacific Union Conference, which has its headquarters in California voted 79 percent to 21 percent in favor of ordaining women. The world leaders of the church were disappointed with the actions of the two conferences and considered their actions not in harmony with the world church. In 2012, there were 320 women pastors in the church, while in North America there are 120 women pastors and 4,100 male pastors. In 2013, the Southeastern California Conference voted for the first time a woman as president.

In July 8, 2015, leaders who represented the Seventh-day Adventist Church voted at their General Conference Session in San Antonio, Texas, against the ordination of women becoming pastors. They voted 1,381 against and 977 in favor. Western Adventists who are against the ban say it is keeping them from functioning in this culture, while those who support the ban get their reason for opposing from the Bible. Adventists in North America, Europe and a few other areas have been ordaining women as pastors. Women are banned from leading local conferences, they also can not create or close churches. Ted N. C. Wilson, who was re-elected for a second five-year term as president, voted no, while former president Jan Paulsen voted yes.


===Membership===
The Seventh-day Adventist Church is one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing organizations, primarily from membership increases in developing nations. Today much of the church membership reside outside of the United States, with large numbers in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Every 30.33 seconds a new member is baptized into one of the 13 divisions of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
In 2006, over 25 million people worshiped weekly in Seventh-day Adventist churches around the world. In 2011, it was reported that the Seventh-day Adventist Church was the fastest-growing church in the United States. Released data showed the membership growing by 2.5% in North America, a rapid clip for that part of the world, where many Christian denominations are declining. On the church’s 150th anniversary in April 2013, there were over 17,000,000 members. In 2013, it was reported that the church lost one in three members over a fifty year period. For every 100 people the church gains, it loses 43 members. The reason why people leave the church is because of marital issues and unemployment. In 2015, the church was the most racially diverse denomination in the United States. The ratio was 37 percent white, 32 percent black, 15 percent Hispanic, 8 percent Asian and 8 percent another or mixed. In 2017, the church had members in almost every country and territory in the world, except for Brunei, Comoros, Djibouti, Falkland Islands, Iran, Jersey, Maldives, Monaco, Somalia and Tokelau. In 2019, the Seventh-day Adventist Church had 21,000,000 baptized members around the world.

In 2020, church officials reported the lowest membership increase in 16 years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Seventh-day Adventist Church added only 803,000 members, the last time annual membership growth dropped below 1 million was in 2004. In 2021, the Seventh-day Adventist Church had 1.2 million members worshiping in Canada and the United States.

==Adventist mission==
Started in the late 19th century, Adventist mission work today reaches people in over 200 countries and territories. Adventist mission workers seek to preach the gospel, promote health through hospitals and clinics, run development projects to improve living standards, and provide relief in times of calamity.

Missionary outreach of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is aimed not only at non-Christians but also at Christians from other denominations. Adventists believe that Christ has called his followers in the Great Commission to reach the whole world. Adventists are cautious, however, to ensure that evangelism does not impede or intrude on the basic rights of the individual. Religious liberty is a stance that the Adventist Church supports and promotes.

===Education===

Globally, the Adventist Church operates 7,598 schools, colleges and universities, with a total enrollment of more than 1,545,000 and a total teaching staff of approximately 80,000. It operates the second largest school system in the world; only larger is the Roman Catholic Church school system.

===Medical===


Their largest medical school and hospitals in North America are Loma Linda University, Loma Linda University Medical Center and AdventHealth Orlando. Throughout the world, the Seventh-day Adventist Church runs a wide network of hospitals, clinics, lifestyle centers, and sanitariums. These play a role in the church&#x27;s health message and worldwide missions outreach.

AdventHealth is the largest not-for-profit Protestant health care provider in the United States. It operates 53 hospitals in nine states.

===Humanitarian aid and the environment===
For over 50 years, the church has been active in humanitarian aid through the work of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). ADRA works as a non-sectarian relief agency in 125 countries and areas of the world. ADRA has been granted General Consultative Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Worldwide, ADRA employs over 4,000 people to help provide relief in crises as well as development in situations of poverty.

The church embraces an official commitment to the protection and care of the environment as well as taking action to avoid the dangers of climate change: &quot;Seventh-day Adventism advocates a simple, wholesome lifestyle, where people do not step on the treadmill of unbridled over-consumption, accumulation of goods, and production of waste. A reformation of lifestyle is called for, based on respect for nature, restraint in the use of the world&#x27;s resources, reevaluation of one&#x27;s needs, and reaffirmation of the dignity of created life.&quot;

===Media===

Adventists have long been proponents of media-based ministries. Traditional Adventist evangelistic efforts consisted of street missions and the distribution of tracts such as &quot;The Present Truth&quot;, which was published by James White as early as 1849. Until J. N. Andrews was sent to Switzerland in 1874, Adventist global efforts consisted entirely of the posting of tracts such as White&#x27;s to various locations.

In the last century, these efforts have also made use of media such as radio and television. The first of these was H. M. S. Richards&#x27; radio show &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot;, which was initially broadcast in Los Angeles in 1929. Since then, Adventists have been on the forefront of media evangelism; &quot;It Is Written&quot;, founded by George Vandeman, was the first religious program to air on color television in March 1965 and the first major Christian ministry to utilize satellite uplink technology. Amazing Facts was founded in 1965 by Joe Crews in Baltimore as a radio ministry. Amazing Facts broadcasts &quot;Bible Answers Live&quot; each Sunday where listeners phone or email Bible questions which are answered live. Today the &quot;Hope Channel&quot;, the official television network of the church which launched in October 2003, operates 8+ international channels broadcasting 24 hours a day on cable, satellite, and the Web.

 In 1971, Adventist World Radio was founded and rented in Portugal its first shortwave radio station. It later constructed its own shortwave radio station on Guam. Adventist World Radio covers earth in over 100 languages with shortwave radio, podcasts and 1,700+ AM/FM radio stations. 

SDA evangelists such as Doug Batchelor, Mark Finley and Dwight Nelson have undertaken a number of international satellite-broadcast live evangelistic events, addressing audiences in up to 40 languages simultaneously.

In 2016, the Church released the film &quot;Tell the World&quot;.

===Publishing===

The Adventist Church owns and operates 58 publishing companies around the world, in about 136 languages. The major number are in the Trans-European Division (TED), and Inter-European Division (EUD). In 2014, Review and Herald Publishing Association merged with Pacific Press Publishing Association. The Review and Herald board voted 153-to-66 in favor of the merger and the board of Pacific Press voted 42-to-1 in favor of the merger. Review and Herald Publishing Association had been in Hagerstown, Maryland, since 1983. From 2013 to 2014, Review and Herald Publishing Association lost almost US$2 million. Formerly its revenue in 1985 was $45.8 million and dropped to $21.8 million in 2013. Pacific Press had also lost much revenue. Pacific Press Publishing Association was in Mountain View, California from 1904 to 1983. It moved to Nampa, Idaho, to reduce the cost of living for new employees.

===Ecumenical activity===

The Adventist Church generally opposes the ecumenical movement, although it supports some of the other goals of ecumenism. The General Conference has released an official statement concerning the Adventist position with respect to the ecumenical movement, which contains the following paragraph:

: Should Adventists cooperate ecumenically? Adventists should cooperate insofar as the authentic gospel is proclaimed and crying human needs are being met. The Seventh-day Adventist Church wants no entangling memberships and refuses any compromising relationships that might tend to water down her distinct witness. However, Adventists wish to be &quot;conscientious cooperators&quot;. The ecumenical movement as an agency of cooperation has acceptable aspects; as an agency for the organic unity of churches, it is much more suspect.

While not being a member of the World Council of Churches, the Adventist Church has participated in its assemblies in an observer capacity.

==Criticism==

The Adventist Church has received criticism along several lines, including what some claim are heterodox doctrines, Ellen G. White and her status within the church, and alleged exclusivist issues.

===Doctrines===
Several teachings that have come under scrutiny are the annihilationist view of hell, the investigative judgment (and a related view of the atonement), and the Sabbath. Critics such as evangelical Anthony Hoekema (who felt that Adventists were more in agreement with Arminianism) argued that some Adventist doctrines were heterodox. In addition, Hoekema also claimed that Adventist doctrine suffers from legalism.

While critics such as Hoekema have classified Adventism as a sectarian group on the basis of its atypical doctrines, it has been accepted as more mainstream by Protestant evangelicals since its meetings and discussions with evangelicals in the 1950s. Billy Graham invited Adventists to be part of his crusades after &quot;Eternity&quot;, a conservative Christian magazine edited by Donald Barnhouse, asserted in 1956 that Adventists are Christians. He also later stated, &quot;They are sound on the great New Testament doctrines including grace and redemption through the vicarious offering of Jesus Christ &#x27;once for all. Walter Martin, who is considered by many to be the father of the counter-cult apologetics movement within evangelicalism, authored &quot;The Truth About Seventh-day Adventists&quot; (1960) which marked a turning point in the way Adventism was viewed: &quot;It is perfectly possible to be a Seventh-day Adventist and be a true follower of Jesus Christ despite heterodox concepts&quot;.

Later on, Martin planned to write a new book on Seventh-day Adventism, with the assistance of Kenneth R. Samples. Samples subsequently authored &quot;From Controversy to Crisis: An Updated Assessment of Seventh-day Adventism&quot;, which upholds Martin&#x27;s view &quot;for that segment of Adventism which holds to the position stated in QOD, and further expressed in the Evangelical Adventist movement of the last few decades.&quot; However, Samples also claimed that &quot;Traditional Adventism&quot; appeared &quot;to be moving further away from a number of positions taken in QOD&quot;, and at least at Glacier View seemed to have &quot;gained the support of many administrators and leaders&quot;.

===Ellen G. White and her status===
Ellen G. White&#x27;s status as a modern-day prophet has also been criticized. In the &quot;Questions on Doctrine&quot; era, evangelicals expressed concern about Adventism&#x27;s understanding of the relationship of White&#x27;s writings to the inspired canon of Scripture. The Adventist fundamental beliefs maintain that &quot;the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested&quot;.

A common criticism of Ellen White, widely popularized by Walter T. Rea, Ronald Numbers, and others, is the claim of plagiarism from other authors. An independent lawyer specializing in plagiarism, Vincent L. Ramik, was engaged to undertake a study of Ellen G. White&#x27;s writings during the early 1980s and concluded that they were &quot;conclusively &quot;. When the plagiarism charge ignited a significant debate during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Adventist General Conference commissioned a major study by Dr. Fred Veltman. The ensuing project became known as the &quot;Life of Christ&#x27; Research Project&quot;. Veltman examined 15 randomly selected chapters of The Desire of Ages for evidence of literary dependence and concluded, &quot;On an average we may say that 31.4 percent of the DA text is dependent to some extent on literary sources.&quot; The results are available at the General Conference Archives. Dr. Roger W. Coon, David J. Conklin, Dr. Denis Fortin, King and Morgan, and Morgan, among others, undertook the refutation of the accusations of plagiarism. At the conclusion of his report, Ramik states:

It is impossible to imagine that the intention of Ellen G. White, as reflected in her writings and the unquestionably prodigious efforts involved therein, was anything other than a sincerely motivated and unselfish effort to place the understandings of Biblical truths in a coherent form for all to see and comprehend. Most certainly, the nature and content of her writings had but one hope and intent, namely, the furthering of mankind&#x27;s understanding of the word of God. Considering all factors necessary in reaching a just conclusion on this issue, it is submitted that the writings of Ellen G. White were conclusively unplagiaristic.
===Exclusivism===
Critics have alleged that certain Adventist beliefs and practices are exclusivist in nature, and they point to the Adventist claim to be the &quot;remnant church&quot;, and the traditional Protestant association of Roman Catholicism with &quot;Babylon&quot;. These attitudes are said to legitimize the proselytising of Christians from other denominations. In response to such criticisms, Adventist theologians have stated that the doctrine of the remnant does not preclude the existence of genuine Christians in other denominations but is concerned with institutions.

==Offshoots and schisms==
Throughout the denomination&#x27;s history, several groups have left the church and formed their own movements.

Following World War I, a group known as the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement was formed as a result of the actions of L. R. Conradi and certain European church leaders during the war, who decided that it was acceptable for Adventists to take part in said war. Those who opposed this stand and refused to participate in the war were declared &quot;disfellowshipped&quot; by their local Church leaders at the time. When the Church leaders from the General Conference came and admonished the local European leaders after the war to try to heal the damage, and bring the members together, it met with resistance from those who had suffered under those leaders. Their attempts at reconciliation failed after the war, and the group became organized as a separate church at a conference held on July 14–20, 1925. The movement was officially incorporated in 1949.

In 2005, in another attempt to examine and resolve what its German leaders had done, the mainstream church apologized for its failures during World War II, stating that they deeply regret&#x27; any participation in or support of Nazi activities during the war by the German and Austrian leadership of the church.&quot;

In the Soviet Union, the same issues produced the group known as the True and Free Seventh-day Adventists. This also formed as the result of a schism within the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Europe during World War I over the position its European church leaders took on having its members join the military or keep the Sabbath. The group remains active today (2010) in the former republics of the Soviet Union.

Well-known but distant offshoots are the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization and the Branch Davidians, themselves a schism within the larger Davidian movement. The Davidians formed in 1929, following Victor Houteff, after he published his book &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Rod&quot;, which was rejected as heretical. A succession dispute after Houteff died in 1955 led to the formation of two groups, the original Davidians and the Branches. Later, another ex-Adventist, David Koresh, led the Branch Davidians until he died in the 1993 siege at the group&#x27;s headquarters near Waco, Texas.

==Cultural influence==
&quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot; depicts the life of Adventist conscientious objector and Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Doss. &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; is based on a novel about Seventh-day Adventist physician John Harvey Kellogg, director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. &quot;A Cry in the Dark&quot;, a film about the death of Azaria Chamberlain, features the prejudice her parents faced due to misconceptions about their religion. Many other forms of media include mentions of Seventh-day Adventism.

Many country postal services around the world have created postage stamps honoring the Seventh-day Adventist Church, or an individual member. In 2020, Iraqi Post released a set of eight commemorative stamps to honor the Christian churches in the country. The set included a photograph of the Baghdad Seventh-day Adventist Church.

<text>Scroll Lock (⤓ or ⇳) is a lock key (typically with an associated status light) on most IBM-compatible computer keyboards. Depending on the operating system, it may be used for different purposes, and applications may assign functions to the key or change their behavior depending on its toggling state. The key is not frequently used, and therefore some reduced or specialized keyboards lack altogether.

Pressing performs the same function as pressing . This behavior is a remnant of the original IBM PC keyboards, which did not have a dedicated  key. Instead, they assigned the Pause function to and the Break function to .

==Function==
===Window scrolling===
The key is meant to lock all scrolling techniques and is a vestige of the original IBM PC keyboard. In its original design, was intended to modify the behavior of the arrow keys. When the mode is on, the arrow keys scroll the contents of a text window instead of moving the cursor. In this usage, is a toggling lock key like Num Lock or Caps Lock, which have a state that persists after the key is released.

Today, this particular use of is rare. Modern programs honoring this behavior include Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Image-Line FL Studio, IBM Lotus Notes, Forté Agent, Renoise, Cakewalk by BandLab, and LibreOffice Calc.

Some text editors (such as Notepad++, Microsoft Visual Studio) exhibit similar behavior when the arrow keys are used with  pressed.

Most GUI environments neglect , which means scrolling must be accomplished with a mouse, using means such as scrollbars or scroll wheels, or an &quot;autoscroll&quot; feature activated by the middle mouse button (which may be part of the scroll wheel). In some instances, + in conjunction with the arrow keys can enable scrolling.

Some web browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer support a caret browsing mode which can be toggled by . While the window scrolling behavior with caret navigation disabled (the default) is similar to that suggested for Scroll Lock, enabling caret navigation will enable a cursor scrolling behavior as if Scroll Lock were disabled.

===Console scrolling===
Pressing the key in the Linux console while the text is scrolling through the screen freezes the console output (but not input) during which no further text is sent to the screen, while the program continues running as usual, or become blocked at the syscall when too much data prevented from reaching the terminal caused the tty&#x27;s output queue to become full and the tty file descriptor is not using non-blocking I/O. When is pressed again, the screen is unfrozen and all text generated during the freeze is displayed at once and the program continues to run normally. This allows the user to pause the display and read long log messages that scroll through the screen too quickly to read, such as when the system is booting up (provided the keyboard driver has already been loaded). Unless configured otherwise or in raw mode, (DC3 in ASCII) and (DC1 in ASCII) can be used instead of Scroll Lock in Unix-like systems to freeze and unfreeze the tty output respectively.

This behavior emulates the Hold Screen key or similar flow control mechanisms on computer terminal hardwares.

The behavior should be distinguished from pressing the Pause key during POST or under DOS, which, by default, has the effect of temporarily halting the running process.

On the FreeBSD system console, the key not only pauses output, but additionally enables scrolling: after pressing , one can use and to scroll up or down. Pressing again disables this mode and moves back to the bottom of the output. The Linux console implemented this behaviour by using and , not requiring to be active; this behavior has been removed due to a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14390). The NetBSD console can be scrolled either with / or by pressing then / .

===Boot diagnostics===
In Multiuser DOS, System Manager, and REAL/32, activating during boot will always enter a special diagnostic mode, where the operating system and loaded device drivers will display detailed status and debugging information about themselves and their interaction with the operating system, sometimes up to several screenfulls per loaded driver. Automatic scrolling is suspended for as long as remains activated.

DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provides a CONFIG.SYS directive named codice_1 to change the Scroll Lock status on the fly. Activating during boot will enter a DIAG mode as well, wherein some special drivers may display more verbose messages, but in contrast to the situation under the Multiuser DOS family normal DOS drivers do not typically display additional information. The operating system, however, will temporarily suspend any automatic timeouts (codice_2) in CONFIG.SYS trace (codice_3) and / single-stepping modes for as long as is active.

===Debugging===
In the Microsoft Windows NT family starting with Windows 2000, a debugging feature can be enabled, that allows the user to manually crash the system, generating a memory dump for analysis of the current state of the operating system. This can be accomplished by setting the REG_DWORD registry key codice_4 to codice_5. Once set, the user can hold the key and tap the key twice to trigger a Blue Screen of Death.

In Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0, pauses the running program in the integrated development environment, as does its alias .

===Copy and paste===
In conjunction with the alternative DOS keyboard and console drivers FreeKEYB and K3PLUS, also serves as part of a copy &amp; paste facility between applications. Compared to the standard keyboard driver KEYB these drivers offer several extensions including an extended keystroke buffer with key stacking facility, macro recorder, and a second cursor called CopyCursor, which can be invoked on demand (by default on pressing or the middle mouse button) and freely move on the screen using the cursor keys or the mouse, even outside the area reachable by the standard cursor in the running application. Once invoked, pressing (or the left mouse button) the characters under the CopyCursor can be stuffed, one after another, into the keyboard buffer, from where they will be read by the running application as emulated key (or Alt Numpad) input, thereby typically showing up at the location of the standard cursor. The CopyCursor will move to the next screen position after each (or backwards with each ). Normal keyboard input is possible while the CopyCursor is enabled, and the user can switch between the two cursors by toggling the hotkey again. Pressing or exits the CopyCursor, so that, on its next invocation, it will show up at the position of the standard cursor again rather than at its previous location. If the screen contents are scrolled, the position of the CopyCursor will move accordingly until reaching the display limits. With activated, keypresses will still reach the normal keystroke buffer, while CopyCursor input will be stacked up internally for later use in a second queue, dynamically maintained within the extended keystroke buffer. Thereby, it is possible to &quot;collect&quot; selected screen output from different programs and spool out the data much later while within yet another application by toggling off again. It is also possible to use this as input into the macro recorder for later use as scrap macro. Since this is an integral part of these keyboard drivers, it is fully transparent to running software and therefore works with virtually any DOS program, including at the command prompt, temporary shelled programs, and task switchers.

===Other uses===
IBM PC documentation called an &quot;inactive key&quot;. When &quot;PC Magazine&quot; asked an executive of keyboard manufacturer Key Tronic about the key&#x27;s purpose in a 1983 interview, he replied &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but we put it on ours, too.&quot;

The indicator light is sometimes used for other purposes such as a keyboard layout indicator in some Linux distributions or other applications, because doing so is less likely to cause problems than manipulating other keys/lights.

Keyboard, video, mouse switches (KVM) often use the Scroll Lock key on the keyboard connected to the KVM switch for selecting between computers. On KVM switches with On-screen display (OSD), a &quot;double click&quot; of the Scroll Lock key often brings up the OSD, allowing the user to select the desired computer from a list or access the configuration menu of the KVM. Some models, especially those without an OSD, switch to the input corresponding to the number key pressed after Scroll Lock, or in the case of some two-port switches, the up and down arrow keys. Simple models with only two or four inputs may immediately switch to the next input following a double press of the Scroll Lock key.
==Scroll Lock on keyboards without a Scroll Lock key==
Laptops and keyboards without a physical key may have a second function on another key that acts as if a key is activated. 

Some common methods are:
* or on certain Dell laptops.
* or on certain Lenovo laptops.

<text>Some familiar household synthetic polymers include: Nylons in textiles and fabrics, Teflon in non-stick pans, Bakelite for electrical switches, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in pipes, etc. The common PET bottles are made of a synthetic polymer, polyethylene terephthalate. The plastic kits and covers are mostly made of synthetic polymers like polythene, and tires are manufactured from polybutadienes. However, due to the environmental issues created by these synthetic polymers which are mostly non-biodegradable and often synthesized from petroleum, alternatives like bioplastics are also being considered. They are however expensive when compared to the synthetic polymers.

<doc id="28639" wikidata="Q28354" url="?curid=28639" title="Stop codon">
<text>In molecular biology, a stop codon (or termination codon) is a codon (nucleotide triplet within messenger RNA) that signals the termination of the translation process of the current protein. Most codons in messenger RNA correspond to the addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain, which may ultimately become a protein; stop codons signal the termination of this process by binding release factors, which cause the ribosomal subunits to disassociate, releasing the amino acid chain.

While start codons need nearby sequences or initiation factors to start translation, a stop codon alone is sufficient to initiate termination.

== Properties ==
=== Standard codons ===
In the standard genetic code, there are three different termination codons:

=== Alternative stop codons ===
There are variations on the standard genetic code, and alternative stop codons have been found in the mitochondrial genomes of vertebrates, &quot;Scenedesmus obliquus&quot;, and &quot;Thraustochytrium&quot;.

=== Reassigned stop codons ===
The nuclear genetic code is flexible as illustrated by variant genetic codes that reassign standard stop codons to amino acids.

=== Translation ===
In 1986, convincing evidence was provided that selenocysteine (Sec) was incorporated co-translationally. Moreover, the codon partially directing its incorporation in the polypeptide chain was identified as UGA also known as the opal termination codon. Different mechanisms for overriding the termination function of this codon have been identified in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes. A particular difference between these kingdoms is that cis elements seem restricted to the neighborhood of the UAG codon in prokaryotes while in eukaryotes this restriction is not present. Instead such locations seem disfavored albeit not prohibited. 

In 2003, a landmark paper described the identification of all known selenoproteins in humans: 25 in total. Similar analyses have been run for other organisms.

The UAG codon can translate into pyrrolysine (Pyl) in a similar manner.

=== Genomic distribution ===
Distribution of stop codons within the genome of an organism is non-random and can correlate with GC-content. For example, the &quot;E. coli&quot; K-12 genome contains 2705 TAA (63%), 1257 TGA (29%), and 326 TAG (8%) stop codons (GC content 50.8%). Also the substrates for the stop codons release factor 1 or release factor 2 are strongly correlated to the abundance of stop codons. Large scale study of bacteria with a broad range of GC-contents shows that while the frequency of occurrence of TAA is negatively correlated to the GC-content and the frequency of occurrence of TGA is positively correlated to the GC-content, the frequency of occurrence of the TAG stop codon, which is often the minimally used stop codon in a genome, is not influenced by the GC-content.

=== Recognition ===
Recognition of stop codons in bacteria have been associated with the so-called &#x27;tripeptide anticodon&#x27;, a highly conserved amino acid motif in RF1 (PxT) and RF2 (SPF). Even though this is supported by structural studies, it was shown that the tripeptide anticodon hypothesis is an oversimplification.

== Nomenclature ==
Stop codons were historically given many different names, as they each corresponded to a distinct class of mutants that all behaved in a similar manner. These mutants were first isolated within bacteriophages (T4 and lambda), viruses that infect the bacteria &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Mutations in viral genes weakened their infectious ability, sometimes creating viruses that were able to infect and grow within only certain varieties of &quot;E. coli&quot;.

=== &quot;amber&quot; mutations () ===

They were the first set of nonsense mutations to be discovered, isolated by Richard H. Epstein and Charles Steinberg and named after their friend and graduate Caltech student Harris Bernstein, whose last name means &quot;amber&quot; in German (&quot;cf.&quot; Bernstein).

Viruses with amber mutations are characterized by their ability to infect only certain strains of bacteria, known as amber suppressors. These bacteria carry their own mutation that allows a recovery of function in the mutant viruses. For example, a mutation in the tRNA that recognizes the amber stop codon allows translation to &quot;read through&quot; the codon and produce a full-length protein, thereby recovering the normal form of the protein and &quot;suppressing&quot; the amber mutation.
Thus, amber mutants are an entire class of virus mutants that can grow in bacteria that contain amber suppressor mutations. Similar suppressors are known for ochre and opal stop codons as well.

tRNA molecules carrying unnatural aminoacids have been designed to recognize the amber stop codon in bacterial RNA. This technology allows for incorporation of orthogonal aminoacids (such as p-azidophenylalanine) at specific locations of the target protein.

=== &quot;ochre&quot; mutations () ===
It was the second stop codon mutation to be discovered. Reminiscent of the usual yellow-orange-brown color associated with amber, this second stop codon was given the name of &quot;ochre&quot;, an orange-reddish-brown mineral pigment.

Ochre mutant viruses had a property similar to amber mutants in that they recovered infectious ability within certain suppressor strains of bacteria. The set of ochre suppressors was distinct from amber suppressors, so ochre mutants were inferred to correspond to a different nucleotide triplet. Through a series of mutation experiments comparing these mutants with each other and other known amino acid codons, Sydney Brenner concluded that the amber and ochre mutations corresponded to the nucleotide triplets &quot;UAG&quot; and &quot;UAA&quot;.

=== &quot;opal&quot; or &quot;umber&quot; mutations () ===
The third and last stop codon in the standard genetic code was discovered soon after, and corresponds to the nucleotide triplet &quot;UGA&quot;.

To continue matching with the theme of colored minerals, the third nonsense codon came to be known as &quot;opal&quot;, which is a type of silica showing a variety of colors. Nonsense mutations that created this premature stop codon were later called opal mutations or umber mutations.

== Mutations and disease ==
=== Nonsense ===
Nonsense mutations are changes in DNA sequence that introduce a premature stop codon, causing any resulting protein to be abnormally shortened. This often causes a loss of function in the protein, as critical parts of the amino acid chain are no longer assembled. Because of this terminology, stop codons have also been referred to as nonsense codons.

=== Nonstop ===

A nonstop mutation, also called a stop-loss variant, is a point mutation that occurs within a stop codon. Nonstop mutations cause the continued translation of an mRNA strand into what should be an untranslated region. Most polypeptides resulting from a gene with a nonstop mutation lose their function due to their extreme length and the impact on normal folding. Nonstop mutations differ from nonsense mutations in that they do not create a stop codon but, instead, delete one. Nonstop mutations also differ from missense mutations, which are point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause replacement by a different amino acid. Nonstop mutations have been linked with many inherited diseases including endocrine disorders, eye disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

== Hidden stops ==

Hidden stops are non-stop codons that would be read as stop codons if they were frameshifted +1 or −1. These prematurely terminate translation if the corresponding frame-shift (such as due to a ribosomal RNA slip) occurs before the hidden stop. It is hypothesised that this decreases resource wastage on nonfunctional proteins and the production of potential cytotoxins. Researchers at Louisiana State University propose the &quot;ambush hypothesis&quot;, that hidden stops are selected for. Codons that can form hidden stops are used in genomes more frequently compared to synonymous codons that would otherwise code for the same amino acid. Unstable rRNA in an organism correlates with a higher frequency of hidden stops.
However, this hypothesis could not be validated with a larger data set.

Stop-codons and hidden stops together are collectively referred as stop-signals. Researchers at University of Memphis found that the ratios of the stop-signals on the three reading frames of a genome (referred to as translation stop-signals ratio or TSSR) of genetically related bacteria, despite their great differences in gene contents, are much alike. This nearly identical genomic-TSSR value of genetically related bacteria may suggest that bacterial genome expansion is limited by their unique stop-signals bias of that bacterial species.

== Translational readthrough ==
Stop codon suppression or translational readthrough occurs when in translation a stop codon is interpreted as a sense codon, that is, when a (standard) amino acid is &#x27;encoded&#x27; by the stop codon. Mutated tRNAs can be the cause of readthrough, but also certain nucleotide motifs close to the stop codon. Translational readthrough is very common in viruses and bacteria, and has also been found as a gene regulatory principle in humans, yeasts, bacteria and drosophila. This kind of endogenous translational readthrough constitutes a variation of the genetic code, because a stop codon codes for an amino acid. In the case of human malate dehydrogenase, the stop codon is read through with a frequency of about 4%. The amino acid inserted at the stop codon depends on the identity of the stop codon itself: Gln, Tyr, and Lys have been found for the UAA and UAG codons, while Cys, Trp, and Arg for the UGA codon have been identified by mass spectrometry. Extent of readthrough in mammals have widely variable extents, and can broadly diversify the proteome and affect cancer progression.

== Use as a watermark ==
In 2010, when Craig Venter unveiled the first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA he described how his team used frequent stop codons to create watermarks in RNA and DNA to help confirm the results were indeed synthetic (and not contaminated or otherwise), using it to encode authors&#x27; names and website addresses.
