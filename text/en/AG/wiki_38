<text>The Year of Living Dangerously is a 1982 romantic drama film directed by Peter Weir and co-written by Weir and David Williamson. It was adapted from Christopher Koch&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;. The story is about a love affair set in Indonesia during the overthrow of President Sukarno. It follows a group of foreign correspondents in Jakarta during the weeks leading up to the attempted coup by the 30 September Movement in 1965. The film is considered one of the last in the Australian New Wave genre.

The film stars Mel Gibson as Australian journalist Guy Hamilton, and Sigourney Weaver as British Embassy officer Jill Bryant. It also stars Linda Hunt as a Chinese-Australian man with dwarfism, Billy Kwan, Hamilton&#x27;s local photographer contact, a role for which Hunt won the 1983 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The film was shot in both Australia and the Philippines and includes Australian actors Bill Kerr as Colonel Henderson and Noel Ferrier as Wally O&#x27;Sullivan.

It was banned from being shown in Indonesia until 2000, after the forced resignation of coup-leader and political successor Suharto in 1998. The title &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; is a quote which refers to a famous Italian phrase used by Sukarno: &quot;vivere pericolosamente&quot;, meaning &quot;living dangerously&quot;. Sukarno used the line for the title of his Indonesian Independence Day speech of 1964.

==Plot==
Guy Hamilton, a novice foreign correspondent for an Australian TV network, arrives in Jakarta on assignment. He meets the close-knit members of the foreign correspondent community, including journalists from the UK, the US, and New Zealand; diplomatic personnel; and Billy Kwan, a photo-journalist and outlier in the journalist community. A Chinese Australian man with dwarfism, high intelligence, and moral seriousness, Kwan is deeply involved with and concerned for the people of Jakarta and their tribulations, even regularly providing for a destitute woman and her young son. Guy is initially unsuccessful as a journalist because his predecessor, tired of life in Indonesia, had departed without introducing Guy to his contacts. He receives limited sympathy from the journalist community, which competes for scraps of information from Sukarno&#x27;s regime, the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and the conservative, Muslim-dominated Indonesian military. However, Billy takes a liking to Guy and arranges interviews for him with key political figures.

Billy introduces Guy to Jill Bryant, a beautiful young assistant at the British embassy. Billy and Jill are close friends, yet Billy subtly manipulates her encounters with Guy. Since she is returning to the UK shortly, Jill initially resists Guy&#x27;s attentions, but eventually they fall in love. When Jill discovers that the Chinese communists are arming the PKI in preparation for civil war, she passes this information to Guy, informing him that all foreigners will be in danger. She advises him to leave the country, but he uses the information to write about the communist rebellion that will occur when the arms shipment reaches Jakarta. Upset with Guy&#x27;s lack of discretion and concerned it will lead back to Jill as the informant, Billy and Jill cut off contact with Guy; he is left with the American journalist Pete Curtis and his own assistant and driver Kumar, who is secretly a member of the PKI. Kumar, however, remains loyal to Guy, and tries to open his eyes to all that is going on.

After the boy Billy had been caring for becomes ill and dies, Billy becomes despondent and disillusioned over Sukarno&#x27;s failure to meet the needs of the Indonesian people. He hangs a banner with &quot;Sukarno feed your people&quot; from the Hotel Indonesia to express his outrage, but he is thrown from the window by security men and dies in Guy&#x27;s arms. His death is also witnessed by Jill. Still pursuing his civil war scoop, Guy attempts to access the presidential palace where, having learned of the communist shipment, the army generals have taken over and unleashed executions. Struck down by an army officer, Guy suffers a serious eye injury. Resting alone in Billy&#x27;s bungalow, Guy recalls a passage from the Bhagavad Gita, &quot;all is clouded by desire&quot;, which Billy had recited to him. Kumar visits him and tells him about the failed coup attempt. Risking permanent damage to his eye, a bandaged Guy implores Kumar to drive him to the airport, where he boards the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Jill.

==Production==
===Development===
A number of filmmakers were interested in buying the rights to Christopher Koch&#x27;s novel including Phillip Noyce. It was Peter Weir who was successful. Koch wrote an early draft but Weir was unhappy with it. Alan Sharp wrote three more drafts, then David Williamson was brought on to do several more drafts. Koch later came back on to work on some of the voice over, although he never spoke with Peter Weir. Koch later claimed that the final script was &quot;55% Williamson/Weir, and 45% Koch&quot;.

The film was originally backed by the South Australian Film Corporation and the Australian Film Commission, with international distribution arranged by MGM/UA Entertainment Company. However, the SAFC then dropped out and Weir&#x27;s agent suggested MGM provide the entire $6 million budget themselves, which is what happened. It was by far the most ambitious Australian film undertaken at the time and was one of the first co-productions between Australia and a Hollywood studio.

===Casting===

Dancer David Atkins was originally cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir began to feel that the relationship between his character and Mel Gibson&#x27;s was not working so he decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. He asked for her to audition and decided to cast her. Weir said on casting Hunt, &quot;I never would have started out looking for a woman, [...] But from the moment I saw her test, I knew she was appropriate.&quot;
To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened &quot;her hair and dye[d] it black[,] wore padding around her waist, shaved her eyebrows, and carried something in her shirt pocket.&quot; In her 1986 interview with &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine, Hunt agreed with the interviewer&#x27;s remarks that Billy Kwan &quot;is supra-personal [with] layers of sexual ambiguity[.]&quot;

===Filming===
Although originally set to be filmed in Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so the bulk of the film was shot in the Philippines, in Manila&#x27;s Quiapo district and the Banaue Rice Terraces. Weir said, &quot;All slums look alike, after all.&quot; Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. The crew moved to Sydney in early April 1982 during its fifth week of the six-week Philippine shoot with only a few small scenes remaining. Filming in Australia took another six weeks.

Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing is really going to happen. I mean, if they meant to kill us, why send a note?&quot;

Gibson described his character Guy, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s not a silver-tongued devil. He&#x27;s kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me.&quot;

===Music===
The original score is by Maurice Jarre, and contains several period pieces, such as &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; by Little Richard, and &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis.
The theme music, for which it is best-known, is &quot;L’Enfant&quot; by Vangelis.

The character Billy Kwan has an appreciation of classical music, including a piece from &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; by Richard Strauss.

==Release==
&quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; opened in Australia on 16 December 1982 at Sydney’s Pitt Centre.
The film was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival attended by Weir, Gibson and Weaver to promote it, where it was well received by audiences and critics. Gibson attended the festival during a break from filming &quot;The Bounty&quot; in London.

===Home media===
The film was released for sale or rental in Australia on VHS in 1984 and on LaserDisc in 1985 with a runtime of 117-minute cut.
Warner Bros. released &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; in the United States on DVD in June 2000 with a theatrical trailer as the sole extra feature. In 2002 it was issued on DVD in Australia.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in Australia on 17 December 1982. Filmed on a budget of $6 million, &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; grossed $2,898,000 at the box office in Australia.

The film opened in the United States via limited release on 21 January 1983 before receiving a wide release on 18 February 1983. In its limited release opening weekend in the US, the film earned $35,000 from one theatre. When released nationwide, the film ranked thirteenth in the box office grossing $1,716,040 on 690 theatres during the Presidents&#x27; Day weekend. In its sixth weekend since its limited opening (however, second nationwide release weekend), &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; made $1.2 million in 679 theatres (a total of $3,469,305 over that period), rising to eleventh. It then made $932,370 on its seventh weekend (third nationwide) a 25.7% drop, and $802,753 on its eighth weekend across 290 screens—both finishing thirteenth.
After 49 weeks in theatres, the film would finish with a box office gross of $10.3 million.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 88% rating based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Both a smart, suspenseful tale of intrigue and a sweeping romance, &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; features excellent performances from Mel Gibson as a journalist and Sigourney Weaver as a staffer at the British Embassy in Jakarta during the political unrest in Indonesia.&quot; Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and praised Hunt&#x27;s performance: &quot;Billy Kwan is played, astonishingly, by a woman—Linda Hunt, a New York stage actress who enters the role so fully that it never occurs to us that she is not a man. This is what great acting is, a magical transformation of one person into another&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby praised Gibson&#x27;s performance: &quot;If this film doesn&#x27;t make an international star of Mr. Gibson (&quot;Gallipoli&quot;, &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;), then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence&quot;.

However, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;But in his attempt to blend his preoccupations with the plot of C. J. Koch&#x27;s 1978 novel, Weir has perhaps packed too much imagery and information into his movie ... The plot becomes landlocked in true-life implausibilities; the characters rarely get a hold on the moviegoer&#x27;s heart or lapels&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold described the film as &quot;a grievously flawed yet compelling tale of political intrigue, certainly a triumph of atmosphere if not of coherent dramatization&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine called the film &quot;an annoying failure because it fritters away so many rich opportunities&quot;.

Weir was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival and Hunt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

<text>Thoinot Arbeau is the anagrammatic pen name of French cleric Jehan Tabourot (March 17, 1520 – July 23, 1595). Tabourot is most famous for his &quot;Orchésographie&quot;, a study of late sixteenth-century French Renaissance social dance. He was born in Dijon and died in Langres.

==&quot;Orchésographie&quot; and other work==
&quot;Orchésographie&quot;, first published in Langres, 1589, provides information on social ballroom behaviour and on the interaction of musicians and dancers. It is available online in facsimile and in plain text. There is an English translation by Mary Stewart Evans, edited by Julia Sutton, in print with Dover Publications. It contains numerous woodcuts of dancers and musicians and includes many dance tabulations in which extensive instructions for the steps are lined up next to the musical notes, a significant innovation in dance notation at that time. &quot;Orchésographie&quot; was partly written as a rebuttal of Calvinist treatises published at the time which argued that dance was an immoral and vain pastime.

He also published on astronomy: &quot;Compot et Manuel Kalendrier, par lequel toutes personnes peuvent facilement apprendre et sçavoir le cours du Soleil et de la Lune et semblablement les festes fixes et mobiles que l’on doit célébrer en l’Eglise, suyvant la correction ordonné par notre Saint Pére Grégoire XIII&quot; [...Calendar, by which all people can easily learn and know the course of the Sun and of the Moon and similarly, the festivals with fixed and moveable dates which one celebrates in Church, according to the correction ordained by our Father Saint Gregory XIII], Langres: Jehan des Preyz, 1582, (cited in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie des sciences, arts et belles-lettres de Dijon&quot;, I (Dijon: Académie de Dijon, 1924), 107).

Thoinot Arbeau was translated into English as &quot;Orchesography&quot; by Cyril W. Beaumont in 1925, and in a modern edition in 1967.

The pavane &quot;Belle qui tiens ma vie&quot; was arranged by Leo Delibes for his incidental music for Victor Hugo&#x27;s play &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot;. 
Other sections were arranged or quoted by Saint-Saens (in the &quot;ballet&quot; from Ascanio) and Peter Warlock (in his Capriol Suite) 

&quot;Branle de l&#x27;Official&quot; provided the tune for the 20th century English Christmas carol &quot;Ding Dong Merrily on High&quot;.

<text>The Temple in Jerusalem, or alternatively the Holy Temple (; , ), refers to the two religious structures that served as the central places of worship for Israelites and Jews on the modern-day Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. According to the Hebrew Bible, the First Temple was built in the 10th century BCE, during the reign of Solomon over the United Kingdom of Israel. It stood until , when it was destroyed during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem. Almost a century later, the First Temple was replaced by the Second Temple, which was built after the Neo-Babylonian Empire was conquered by the Achaemenid Persian Empire. While the Second Temple stood for a longer period of time than the First Temple, it was likewise destroyed during the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

Projects to build the hypothetical &quot;Third Temple&quot; have not come to fruition in the modern era, though the Temple in Jerusalem still features prominently in Judaism. As an object of longing and a symbol of future redemption, the Temple has been commemorated in Jewish tradition through prayer, liturgical poetry, art, poetry, architecture, and other forms of expression.

Outside of Judaism, the Temple (and today&#x27;s Temple Mount) also carries a high level of significance in Islam and Christianity. One of the early Arabic names for Jerusalem is Bayt al-Maqdis, which preserves the memory of the Temple. The Temple Mount is home to two monumental Islamic structures, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, which date to the Umayyad period. The site, known to Muslims as the &quot;Al-Aqsa Mosque compound&quot; or &quot;Haram al-Sharif,&quot; is considered the third-holiest site in Islam. The Christian New Testament and tradition hold that important events in Jesus&#x27; life took place in the Temple, and the Crusaders attributed the name &quot;Templum Domini&quot; (&quot;Temple of the Lord&quot;) to the Dome of the Rock.

== Etymology ==
The Hebrew name given in the Hebrew Bible for the building complex is either &quot;Mikdash&quot; (), as used in Exodus, or simply &quot;Bayt&quot; / &quot;Beit Adonai&quot; (), as used in 1 Chronicles.

In rabbinic literature, the temple sanctuary is called &quot;Beit HaMikdash&quot; (), meaning, &quot;The Holy House&quot;, and only the Temple in Jerusalem is referred to by this name. In classic English texts, however, the word &quot;Temple&quot; is used interchangeably, sometimes having the strict connotation of the Temple precincts, with its courts (), while at other times having the strict connotation of the Temple Sanctuary (). While Greek and Hebrew texts make this distinction, English texts do not always do so.

Jewish rabbi and philosopher Maimonides gave the following definition of &quot;Temple&quot; in his &quot;Mishne Torah&quot; (Hil. &quot;Beit Ha-Bechirah&quot;):
They are enjoined to make, in what concerns it (i.e. the building of the Temple), a holy site and an inner-sanctum, and where there is positioned in front of the holy site a certain place that is called a &#x27;Hall&#x27; (). The three of these places are called &#x27;Sanctuary&#x27; (). They are [also] enjoined to make a different partition surrounding the Sanctuary, distant from it, similar to the screen-like hangings of the court that were in the wilderness. All that which is surrounded by this partition, which, as noted, is like the court of the Tabernacle, is called &#x27;Courtyard&#x27; (), whereas all of it together is called &#x27;Temple&#x27; () [].

==First Temple==
The Hebrew Bible says that the First Temple was built by King Solomon, completed in 957 BCE. According to the Book of Deuteronomy, as the sole place of Israelite &quot;korban&quot; (sacrifice), the Temple replaced the Tabernacle constructed in the Sinai under the auspices of Moses, as well as local sanctuaries, and altars in the hills. This Temple was sacked a few decades later by Shoshenq I, Pharaoh of Egypt.

Although efforts were made at partial reconstruction, it was only in 835 BCE when Jehoash, King of Judah, in the second year of his reign invested considerable sums in reconstruction, only to have it stripped again for Sennacherib, King of Assyria . The First Temple was totally destroyed in the Siege of Jerusalem by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE.

==Second Temple==
According to the Book of Ezra, construction of the Second Temple was called for by Cyrus the Great and began in 538 BCE, after the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire the year before. According to some 19th-century calculations, work started later, in April 536 BCE and was completed on 21 February, 515 BCE, 21 years after the start of the construction. This date is obtained by coordinating Ezra 3:8–10 (the third day of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the Great) with historical sources. The accuracy of these dates is contested by some modern researchers, who consider the biblical text to be of later date and based on a combination of historical records and religious considerations, leading to contradictions between different books of the Bible and making the dates unreliable. The new temple was dedicated by the Jewish governor Zerubbabel. However, with a full reading of the Book of Ezra and the Book of Nehemiah, there were four edicts to build the Second Temple, which were issued by three kings: Cyrus in 536 BCE (Ezra ch. 1), Darius I of Persia in 519 BCE (ch. 6), and Artaxerxes I of Persia in 457 BCE (ch. 7), and finally by Artaxerxes again in 444 BCE (Nehemiah ch. 2).

According to classical Jewish sources, another demolition of the Temple was narrowly avoided in 332 BCE when the Jews refused to acknowledge the deification of Alexander the Great of Macedonia, but Alexander was placated at the last minute by astute diplomacy and flattery. 

After Jerusalem came under Seleucid rule, Antiochus III attempted to introduce the Greek pantheon into the temple. A rebellion ensued and was brutally crushed, but no further action by Antiochus was taken. When Antiochus IV Epiphanes assumed the Seleucid thrown he immediately attempted to enforce universal Hellenization once again. During this time, several incidents considered offensive under traditional Jewish practice occurred in the temple, to include erecting a statute of Zeus and the sacrifice of pigs. This led to a two year civil war in Judea in which traditionalist rebels led by Mattathias fought against both Seleucid forces and the Hellenized Judean forces who administered Judea in Antiochus&#x27;s name. After the rebels successfully overthrew Seleucid rule, Mattathias&#x27; son Judah Maccabee re-dedicated the temple in 164 BCE, giving rise to the celebration of Hanukkah.

During the Roman era, Pompey entered (and thereby desecrated) the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE, but left the Temple intact. In 54 BCE, Crassus looted the Temple treasury.

Around 20 BCE, the building was renovated and expanded by Herod the Great, and became known as Herod&#x27;s Temple. It was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE during the Siege of Jerusalem. During the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Romans in 132–135 CE, Simon bar Kokhba and Rabbi Akiva wanted to rebuild the Temple, but bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt failed and the Jews were banned from Jerusalem (except for Tisha B&#x27;Av) by the Roman Empire. The emperor Julian allowed the Temple to be rebuilt, but the Galilee earthquake of 363 ended all attempts ever since.

==Al-Aqsa and the Third Temple==
By the 7th century, the site had fallen into disrepair under Byzantine rule. After the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in the 7th century during the Rashidun Caliphate, a mosque was built by caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (reigned 634–644 CE) who first cleared the site of debris and then erected a mihrab and simple mosque on the same site as the present mosque. This first mosque construction was known as Masjid al-&#x27;Umari. During the Umayyad caliphate, the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ordered a renovation of the Islamic mosque, constructing the Dome of the Rock, on the Temple Mount. The mosque has stood on the mount since 691 CE; the Jami Al-Aqsa. It has been renovated several times since, including during the Abbasid, Fatimid, Mamluk, and Ottoman eras.

==Archaeological evidence==

Archaeological excavations have found remnants of both the First Temple and the Second Temple. Among the artifacts of the First Temple are dozens of ritual immersion pools in this area surrounding the Temple Mount, as well as a large square platform identified by architectural archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer as likely being built by King Hezekiah as a gathering area in front of the Temple.

Concrete finds from the Second Temple include the Temple Warning inscriptions and the Trumpeting Place inscription, two surviving pieces of the Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount. The Temple Warning inscriptions forbid the entry of pagans to the Temple, a prohibition also mentioned by the 1st century CE historian Josephus. These inscriptions were on the wall that surrounded the Temple and prevented non-Jews from entering the temple&#x27;s courtyard. The Trumpeting Place inscription was found at the southwest corner of Temple Mount, and is believed to mark the site where the priests used to declare the advent of Shabbat and other Jewish holidays.

Ritual objects used in the temple service were carried off and many are likely located in museum collections, in particular, that of the Vatican Museums.

==Location==
There are three main theories as to where the Temple stood: where the Dome of the Rock is now located, to the north of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Asher Kaufman), or to the east of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Joseph Patrich of the Hebrew University).

The exact location of the Temple is a contentious issue, as questioning the exact placement of the Temple is often associated with Temple denial. Since the Holy of Holies lay at the center of the complex as a whole, the Temple&#x27;s location is dependent on the location of the Holy of Holies. The location of the Holy of Holies was even a question less than 150 years after the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction, as detailed in the Talmud. Chapter 54 of the Tractate Berakhot states that the Holy of Holies was directly aligned with the Golden Gate, which, assuming the current gate follows the same course as the now buried Herodian gate, would have placed the Temple slightly to the north of the Dome of the Rock, as Kaufman postulated. However, chapter 54 of the Tractate Yoma and chapter 26 of the Tractate Sanhedrin assert that the Holy of Holies stood directly on the Foundation Stone, which agrees with the traditional view that the Dome of the Rock stands on the Temple&#x27;s location.

==Physical layout==

===First Temple===
The Temple of Solomon, or First Temple, consisted of four main elements:
*the Great or Outer Court, where people assembled to worship;
*the Inner Court or Court of the Priests;
:and the Temple building itself, with
*the larger Holy Place (&quot;hekhal&quot;), called the &quot;greater house&quot; and the &quot;temple&quot; and
*the smaller &quot;inner sanctum&quot;, known as the Holy of Holies or &quot;Kodesh HaKodashim&quot;.

===Second Temple===
In the case of the last and most elaborate structure, the Herodian Temple, the structure consisted of the wider Temple precinct, the restricted Temple courts, and the Temple building itself:
*Temple precinct, located on the extended Temple Mount platform, and including the Court of the Gentiles
*Court of the Women or &quot;Ezrat HaNashim&quot;
*Court of the Israelites, reserved for ritually pure Jewish men
*Court of the Priests, whose relation to the Temple Court is interpreted in different ways by scholars
*Temple Court or &quot;Azarah&quot;, with the Brazen Laver (&quot;kiyor&quot;), the Altar of Burnt Offerings (&quot;mizbe&#x27;ah&quot;), the Place of Slaughtering, and the Temple building itself

The Temple edifice had three distinct chambers:
*Temple vestibule or porch (&quot;ulam&quot;)
*Temple sanctuary (&quot;hekhal&quot; or &quot;heikal&quot;), the main part of the building
*Holy of Holies (&quot;Kodesh HaKodashim&quot; or &quot;debir&quot;), the innermost chamber
According to the Talmud, the Women&#x27;s Court was to the east and the main area of the Temple to the west. The main area contained the butchering area for the sacrifices and the Outer Altar on which portions of most offerings were burned. An edifice contained the &quot;ulam&quot; (antechamber), the &quot;hekhal&quot; (the &quot;sanctuary&quot;), and the Holy of Holies. The sanctuary and the Holy of Holies were separated by a wall in the First Temple and by two curtains in the Second Temple. The sanctuary contained the seven branched candlestick, the table of showbread and the Incense Altar.

The main courtyard had thirteen gates. On the south side, beginning with the southwest corner, there were four gates:
*The Upper Gate (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaElyon&quot;)
*The Kindling Gate (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaDelek&quot;), where wood was brought in
*The Gate of Firstborns (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaBechorot&quot;), where people with first-born animal offerings entered
*The Water Gate (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaMayim&quot;), where the Water Libation entered on Sukkot/the Feast of Tabernacles

On the north side, beginning with the northwest corner, there were four gates:
*The Gate of Jeconiah (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar Yechonyah&quot;), where kings of the Davidic line enter and Jeconiah left for the last time to captivity after being dethroned by the King of Babylon
*The Gate of the Offering (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaKorban&quot;), where priests entered with &quot;kodshei kodashim&quot; offerings
*The Women&#x27;s Gate (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaNashim&quot;), where women entered into the &quot;Azara&quot; or main courtyard to perform offerings
*The Gate of Song (&quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaShir&quot;), where the Levites entered with their musical instruments.

The Hall of Hewn Stones (Hebrew: לשכת הגזית &quot;Lishkat haGazit&quot;), also known as the Chamber of Hewn Stone, was the meeting place, or council-chamber, of the Sanhedrin during the Second Temple period (6th century BCE – 1st century CE). The Talmud deduces that it was built into the north wall of the Temple in Jerusalem, half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access both to the temple and to the outside. The chamber is said to have resembled a basilica in appearance, having two entrances: one in the east and one in the west.

On the east side was the Gate of Nicanor, between the Women&#x27;s Courtyard and the main Temple Courtyard, which had two minor doorways, one on its right and one on its left. On the western wall, which was relatively unimportant, there were two gates that did not have any name.

The Mishnah lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the Temple: Holy of Holies; Sanctuary; Vestibule; Court of the Priests; Court of the Israelites; Court of the Women; Temple Mount; the walled city of Jerusalem; all the walled cities of the Land of Israel; and the borders of the Land of Israel.

The Talmud speaks also of important presents which Queen Helena of Adiabene gave to the Temple at Jerusalem. &quot;Helena had a golden candlestick made over the door of the Temple,&quot; to which statement is added that when the sun rose its rays were reflected from the candlestick and everybody knew that it was the time for reading the Shema&#x27;. She also made a golden plate on which was written the passage of the Pentateuch which the Kohen read when a wife suspected of infidelity was brought before him. In the Jerusalem Talmud, tractate Yoma iii. 8 the candlestick and the plate are confused.

==Temple services==

The Temple was the place where offerings described in the course of the Hebrew Bible were carried out, including daily morning and afternoon offerings and special offerings on Sabbath and Jewish holidays. Levites recited Psalms at appropriate moments during the offerings, including the Psalm of the Day, special psalms for the new month, and other occasions, the Hallel during major Jewish holidays, and psalms for special sacrifices such as the &quot;Psalm for the Thanksgiving Offering&quot; (Psalm 100).

As part of the daily offering, a prayer service was performed in the Temple which was used as the basis of the traditional Jewish (morning) service recited to this day, including well-known prayers such as the Shema, and the Priestly Blessing. The Mishna describes it as follows:
In addition to the sacrifices, the Temple was considered a special location for prayer to God:
==In the Talmud==
Seder Kodashim, the fifth order, or division, of the Mishnah (compiled between 200 and 220 CE), provides detailed descriptions and discussions of the religious laws connected with Temple service including the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service. Tractates of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid).

In the Babylonian Talmud, all the tractates have Gemara – rabbinical commentary and analysis – for all their chapters; some chapters of Tamid, and none on Middot and Kinnim. The Jerusalem Talmud has no Gemara on any of the tractates of Kodashim.

The Talmud (Yoma 9b) describes traditional theological reasons for the destruction: &quot;Why was the first Temple destroyed? Because the three cardinal sins were rampant in society: idol worship, licentiousness, and murder… And why then was the second Temple – wherein the society was involved in Torah, commandments and acts of kindness – destroyed? Because gratuitous hatred was rampant in society.&quot;

==Role in contemporary Jewish services==
Part of the traditional Jewish morning service, the part surrounding the Shema prayer, is essentially unchanged from the daily worship service performed in the Temple. In addition, the Amidah prayer traditionally replaces the Temple&#x27;s daily &quot;tamid&quot; and special-occasion &quot;Mussaf&quot; (additional) offerings (there are separate versions for the different types of sacrifices). They are recited during the times their corresponding offerings were performed in the Temple.

The Temple is mentioned extensively in Orthodox services. Conservative Judaism retains mentions of the Temple and its restoration, but removes references to the sacrifices. References to sacrifices on holidays are made in the past tense, and petitions for their restoration are removed. Mentions in Orthodox Jewish services include:

*A daily recital of Biblical and Talmudic passages related to the korbanot (sacrifices) performed in the Temple &quot;(See korbanot in siddur)&quot;.
*References to the restoration of the Temple and sacrificial worships in the daily Amidah prayer, the central prayer in Judaism.
*A traditional personal plea for the restoration of the Temple at the end of private recitation of the Amidah.
*A prayer for the restoration of the &quot;house of our lives&quot; and the shekhinah (divine presence) &quot;to dwell among us&quot; is recited during the Amidah prayer.
*Recitation of the Psalm of the day; the psalm sung by the Levites in the Temple for that day during the daily morning service.
*Numerous psalms sung as part of the ordinary service make extensive references to the Temple and Temple worship.
*Recitation of the special Jewish holiday prayers for the restoration of the Temple and their offering, during the Mussaf services on Jewish holidays.
*An extensive recitation of the special Temple service for Yom Kippur during the service for that holiday.
*Special services for Sukkot (Hakafot) contain extensive (but generally obscure) references to the special Temple service performed on that day.

The destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av. Three other minor fasts (Tenth of Tevet, 17th of Tammuz, and Third of Tishrei), also mourn events leading to or following the destruction of the Temple. There are also mourning practices which are observed at all times, for example, the requirement to leave part of the house unplastered.

==Recent history==
The Temple Mount, along with the entire Old City of Jerusalem, was captured from Jordan by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War, allowing Jews once again to visit the holy site. Jordan had occupied East Jerusalem and the Temple Mount immediately following Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence on May 14, 1948. Israel officially unified East Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount, with the rest of Jerusalem in 1980 under the Jerusalem Law, though United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared the Jerusalem Law to be in violation of international law. The Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, based in Jordan, has administrative control of the Temple Mount.

==In other religions==

===Christianity===
According to Matthew 24:2, Jesus predicts the destruction of the Second Temple. This idea, of the Temple as the body of Christ, became a rich and multi-layered theme in medieval Christian thought (where Temple/body can be the heavenly body of Christ, the body of the Church, and the Eucharistic body on the altar).

===Islam===
The Temple Mount bears significance in Islam as it acted as a sanctuary for the Hebrew prophets and the Israelites. Islamic tradition says that a temple was first built on the Temple Mount by Solomon, the son of David. After the destruction of the second temple, it was rebuilt by the second Rashidun Caliph, Omar, which stands until today as Al-Aqsa Mosque. Traditionally referred to as the &quot;Farthest Mosque&quot; (&quot;al-masjid al-aqṣa&#x27; &quot;literally &quot;utmost site of bowing (in worship)&quot; though the term now refers specifically to the mosque in the southern wall of the compound which today is known simply as &quot;al-haram ash-sharīf&quot; &quot;the noble sanctuary&quot;), the site is seen as the destination of Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey, one of the most significant events recounted in the Quran and the place of his ascent heavenwards thereafter (&quot;Mi&#x27;raj&quot;). Muslims view the Temple in Jerusalem as their inheritance, being the followers of the last prophet of God and believers in every prophet sent, including the prophets Moses and Solomon. To Muslims, Al-Aqsa Mosque is not built on top of the temple, rather, it is the Third Temple, and they are the true believers who worship in it, whereas Jews and Christians are disbelievers who do not believe in God&#x27;s final prophets Jesus and Muhammad.

In Islam, Muslims are encouraged to visit Jerusalem and pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque. There are over forty hadith about Al-Aqsa Mosque and the virtue of visiting and praying in it, or at least sending oil to light its lamps. In a hadith compiled by Al-Tabarani, Bayhaqi, and Suyuti, the Prophet Muhammad said, &quot;A prayer in Makkah (Ka’bah) is worth 1,000,000 times (reward), a prayer in my mosque (Madinah) is worth 1,000 times and a prayer in Al-Aqsa Sanctuary is worth 500 times more reward than anywhere else.&quot; Another hadith compiled by imams Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu Dawud expounds on the importance of visiting the holy site. In another hadith the prophet Muhammad said, &quot;You should not undertake a special journey to visit any place other than the following three Masjids with the expectations of getting greater reward: the Sacred Masjid of Makkah (Ka’bah), this Masjid of mine (the Prophet’s Masjid in Madinah), and Masjid Al-Aqsa (of Jerusalem).&quot;

According to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University, Jerusalem (i.e., the Temple Mount) has the significance as a holy site/sanctuary (&quot;haram&quot;) for Muslims primarily in three ways, the first two being connected to the Temple. First, Muhammad (and his companions) prayed facing the Temple in Jerusalem (referred to as &quot;Bayt Al-Maqdis&quot;, in the Hadiths) similar to the Jews before changing it to the Kaaba in Mecca sixteen months after arriving in Medina following the verses revealed (Sura 2:144, 149–150). Secondly, during the Meccan part of his life, he reported to have been to Jerusalem by night and prayed in the Temple, as the first part of his otherworldly journey (Isra and Mi&#x27;raj).

Imam Abdul Hadi Palazzi, leader of Italian Muslim Assembly, quotes the Quran to support Judaism&#x27;s special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, &quot;The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples&quot;. He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures in Islam. He claims that the Quran &quot;expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims&quot;.

==Building a Third Temple==


Ever since the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction, a prayer for the construction of a Third Temple has been a formal and mandatory part of the thrice-daily Jewish prayer services. However, the question of whether and when to construct the Third Temple is disputed both within the Jewish community and without; groups within Judaism argue both for and against construction of a new Temple, while the expansion of Abrahamic religion since the 1st century CE has made the issue contentious within Christian and Islamic thought as well. Furthermore, the complicated political status of Jerusalem makes reconstruction difficult, while Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock have been constructed at the traditional physical location of the Temple.

In 363 CE, the Roman emperor Julian had ordered Alypius of Antioch to rebuild the Temple as part of his campaign to strengthen non-Christian religions. The attempt failed, with contemporary accounts mentioning divine fire falling from Heaven but also perhaps due to sabotage, an accidental fire, or an earthquake in Galilee.

The Book of Ezekiel prophesies what would be the Third Temple, noting it as an eternal house of prayer and describing it in detail.

==In media==
A journalistic depiction of the controversies around the Jerusalem Temple was presented in the 2010 documentary &quot;Lost Temple&quot; by Serge Grankin. The film contains interviews with religious and academic authorities involved in the issue. German journalist Dirk-Martin Heinzelmann, featured in the film, presents the point of view of Prof. Joseph Patrich (the Hebrew University), stemming from the underground cistern mapping made by Charles William Wilson (1836–1905).

<text>The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is an American spy fiction television series produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Television and first broadcast on NBC. The series follows secret agents Napoleon Solo, played by Robert Vaughn, and Illya Kuryakin, played by David McCallum, who work for a secret international counterespionage and law-enforcement agency called U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement). The series premiered on September 22, 1964, and completed its run on January 15, 1968. The program was part of the spy-fiction craze on television, and by 1966 there were nearly a dozen imitators. Several episodes were successfully released to theaters as B movies or double features. There was also a spin-off series, &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, a series of novels and comic books, and merchandising.

With few recurring characters, the series attracted many high-profile guest stars. Props from the series are exhibited at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum and at the museums of the Central Intelligence Agency and other US intelligence agencies. The series won the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Show in 1966.

Originally, co-creator Sam Rolfe (of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; fame) wanted to leave the meaning of U.N.C.L.E. ambiguous so it could refer to either &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; or the United Nations. Concerns by the MGM legal department about using &quot;U.N.&quot; for commercial purposes caused U.N.C.L.E. to become an acronym for the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. Each episode had a spurious &quot;We wish to thank&quot; acknowledgement to U.N.C.L.E. in the end titles.
==Background==
The series consists of 105 episodes originally broadcast between 1964 and 1968, produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
and Arena productions. The first season was produced in black-and-white, the remaining in colour.

The first episode was broadcast on September 22, 1964, as part of the Tuesday night NBC lineup, but moved to Monday nights, a half hour earlier, the following January.

Ian Fleming contributed to the series after being approached by co-creator Norman Felton. According to the book &quot;The James Bond Films&quot;, Fleming proposed two characters, Napoleon Solo and April Dancer (later appearing on the spin-off series &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;). The original name for the show was &quot;Ian Fleming&#x27;s Solo.&quot; Robert Towne, Sherman Yellen, and Harlan Ellison later wrote scripts for the series. Author Michael Avallone, who wrote the first original novelization based upon the series (see below), is sometimes incorrectly cited as the show&#x27;s creator.

Originally, Solo was the focus of the series, but David McCallum as Russian agent Illya Kuryakin drew so much enthusiasm from fans, the agents became a team.

==Premise==

The series centered on a two-man troubleshooting team working for multi-national secret intelligence agency U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement): American Napoleon Solo (Robert Vaughn), and Russian Illya Kuryakin (David McCallum). Leo G. Carroll played Alexander Waverly, the British chief of the organization. Barbara Moore joined the cast as Lisa Rogers in the final season.

The series, though fictional, achieved such cultural prominence that props, costumes, documents, and a video clip are in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum&#x27;s exhibit on spies and counterspies. Similar exhibits are held by the museum of the Central Intelligence Agency.

=== Thrush ===
U.N.C.L.E.&#x27;s primary adversary was Thrush (named WASP in the pilot film). The original series never divulged whom or what Thrush represented, nor was it ever used as an acronym. The novels written by David McDaniel explain that it stands for &quot;Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity&quot;, described as having been founded by Colonel Sebastian Moran after the death of Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls in the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. But in a second season episode, guest star Jessie Royce Landis plays a character who claims that she founded Thrush. Producer Felton always insisted that Thrush was not an acronym and stood for nothing.

Thrush&#x27;s aim was to conquer the world. Thrush was considered so dangerous an organization that even governments who were ideologically opposed to each other – such as the United States and the Soviet Union – had cooperated in forming and operating the U.N.C.L.E. organization. Similarly, when Solo and Kuryakin held opposing political views, the friction between them in the story was held to a minimum. Although executive producer Norman Felton and Ian Fleming conceived Napoleon Solo, it was the producer Sam Rolfe who created the global U.N.C.L.E. hierarchy, and he included the Soviet agent, Illya Kuryakin. Unlike the CIA or the British SIS (Secret Intelligence Service), U.N.C.L.E. was a global organization of agents from many countries and cultures.

===Innocent character=== 
The creators decided an innocent character would be featured in each episode, giving the audience someone with whom to identify. Despite many changes over four seasons, &quot;innocents&quot; remained a constant – from a suburban housewife in the pilot, &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot; (film version: &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot;), to those kidnapped in the final episode, &quot;The Seven Wonders of the World Affair&quot;.

==Episodes==
===&quot;Solo&quot; – the pilot===

Filmed in color from late November to early December 1963, with locations at a Lever Brothers soap factory in California, the television pilot made as a 70-minute film was originally titled &quot;Ian Fleming&#x27;s Solo&quot; and later shortened to &quot;Solo&quot;. However, in February 1964 a law firm representing &quot;James Bond&quot; producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli demanded an end to the use of Fleming&#x27;s name in connection with the series and an end to the use of the name and character &quot;Solo&quot;, &quot;Napoleon Solo&quot; and &quot;Mr. Solo&quot;. At that time filming was underway for the &quot;Bond&quot; film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, in which Martin Benson was playing a supporting character named &quot;Mr. Solo&quot;, being an American Mafia boss murdered by Auric Goldfinger. The claim was the name &quot;Solo&quot; had been sold to them by Fleming, and Fleming could not use it again. Within five days Fleming had signed an affidavit that nothing in the Solo pilot infringed any of his Bond characters, but the threat of legal action resulted in a settlement in which the name Napoleon Solo could be kept but the title of the show had to change. Coincidentally, the TV series debuted only a few days after the Sept. 17, 1964 U.K. release of the &quot;Goldfinger&quot; movie with its &quot;Mr. Solo&quot; character, though U.S. release would not occur until 1965.

The role of the head of U.N.C.L.E. in the pilot was Mr. Allison, played by Will Kuluva, rather than Mr. Waverly, played by Leo G. Carroll, and David McCallum&#x27;s Illya Kuryakin only had a brief role. Revisions to some scenes were shot for television, including those needed to feature Leo G. Carroll. The pilot episode was reedited to 50 minutes to fit a one-hour time slot, converted to black-and-white, and shown on television as &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot;.

Additional color sequences with Luciana Paluzzi were shot in April 1964, and then added to the pilot for MGM to release it outside the United States as a B movie titled &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot;. This premiered in Hong Kong in November 1964. The extra scenes were reedited to tone down their sexuality, and then used in the regular series in the episode &quot;The Four-Steps Affair&quot;.

Beyond extra scenes for the feature film, and revised scene shots and edits made for the television episode, there are other differences among the three versions of the story. Before the show went into full production there was concern from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that the name of Thrush for the pilot&#x27;s international criminal organization sounded too much like SMERSH, the international spy-killing organization in Fleming&#x27;s Bond series. The studio suggested Raven, Shark, Squid, Vulture, Tarantula, Snipe, Sphinx, Dooom, and Maggot (the last used in early scripts). Although no legal action took place, the name &quot;WASP&quot; was used in the feature version &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot;. The original pilot kept &quot;Thrush&quot; (presumably since it was not intended to be released to the public in that version). Felton and Rolfe pushed for the reinstatement of &quot;Thrush&quot;. It turned out that WASP could not be used, since Gerry Anderson&#x27;s British television series &quot;Stingray&quot; was based on an organization called W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol). By May 1964, Thrush was retained for the television episode edit of the pilot. Despite this, WASP was used by the feature film in Japan in late 1964, and it was left in the American release in 1966.

Another change among the three versions of the pilot story was the cover name for the character of Elaine May Donaldson. In the original pilot it was Elaine Van Nessen; in the television version and the feature version it was Elaine Van Every. Illya Kuryakin&#x27;s badge number is 17 in the pilot, rather than 2 during the series, and Solo&#x27;s hair, after new footage was added, changed back and forth from a slicked back style to the less severe style he wore throughout the series.

With the popularity of the show and the spy craze, &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot; and the second U.N.C.L.E. feature &quot;The Spy with My Face&quot; were released in the United States as an MGM double feature in early 1966.

===Season 1===

The show&#x27;s first season was in black-and-white. Rolfe created a kind of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; world, where mundane everyday life would intersect with the looking-glass fantasy of international espionage which lay just beyond. The U.N.C.L.E. universe was one where the weekly &quot;innocent&quot; would get caught up in a series of fantastic adventures, in a battle of good and evil.

U.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City was most-frequently entered by a secret passage in Del Floria&#x27;s Tailor Shop. Another entrance was through The Masque Club. Mr. Waverly had his own secret entrance, hinted at in the episode &quot;The Mad, Mad Tea Party Affair&quot;. The episodes were largely filmed on the MGM back lot. The same building with an imposing exterior staircase was used for episodes set throughout the Mediterranean area and Latin America, and the same dirt road lined with eucalyptus trees on the back lot in Culver City stood in for virtually every continent of the globe. The episodes followed a naming convention where each title was in the form of &quot;The ***** Affair&quot;, such as &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot;, &quot;The Mad, Mad, Tea Party Affair&quot;, and &quot;The Waverly Ring Affair&quot;, etc. The only exception was &quot;Alexander the Greater Affair&quot;. The first season episode &quot;The Green Opal Affair&quot; establishes that U.N.C.L.E. uses the term &quot;affair&quot; to refer to its different missions.

Rolfe endeavored to make the implausible elements in the series seem not only feasible but entertaining. In the series, frogmen emerge from wells in Iowa, shootouts occur between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH agents in a crowded Manhattan theater, and top-secret organizations are hidden behind innocuous brownstone facades. The series began to dabble in spy-fi, beginning with &quot;The Double Affair&quot; in which a THRUSH agent, made to look like Solo through plastic surgery, infiltrates a secret U.N.C.L.E. facility where an immensely powerful weapon called &quot;Project Earthsave&quot; is stored; according to the dialogue, the weapon was developed to protect against a potential alien threat to Earth. &quot;The Spy with My Face&quot; was the theatrical film version of this episode.

In its first season &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; competed against &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; on CBS and Walter Brennan&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The Tycoon&quot; on ABC. Due to bad writing, the ratings were poor and it faced cancellation. But NBC switched it to Monday nights where it found a receptive audience. The success of the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; also created a huge interest in spy entertainment which greatly benefitted the series. During this time producer Norman Felton told Alan Caillou and several of the series writers to make the show more tongue-in-cheek.

===Seasons 2–4===

Switching to color, &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; continued to enjoy huge popularity. When Rolfe left the show at the conclusion of the first season, David Victor became the new showrunner. Over the next three seasons, five different showrunners would supervise the &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; franchise, and each one took the show in a direction that differed considerably from that of the first season. In an attempt to emulate the success of ABC&#x27;s mid-season hit &quot;Batman&quot;, which had proved hugely popular with its debut in early 1966, &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; moved swiftly towards self-parody and slapstick. In contrast to other seasons, the fourth and final season had a recurring female character, Lisa Rogers, played by Barbara Moore in ten episodes.

During the third season the producers made a conscious decision to increase the level of humor. This new direction resulted in a severe Nielsen ratings drop, and again nearly resulted in the show&#x27;s cancellation. It was renewed for a fourth season and an attempt was made to go back to serious storytelling, but the ratings never recovered and &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; was finally cancelled midway through the season.

==Spin-off: &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;==
The series was popular enough to generate a spin-off series, &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1966–67) The &quot;girl&quot; was first introduced during &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; episode &quot;The Moonglow Affair&quot; (February 25, 1966) and was then played by Mary Ann Mobley. The spin-off series ran for one season, starring Stefanie Powers as agent &quot;April Dancer&quot;, a character name credited to Ian Fleming; and Noel Harrison as agent Mark Slate (who had been played substantially differently by actor Norman Fell in the pilot). There was some crossover between the two shows, and Leo G. Carroll played Mr. Waverly in both programs, becoming the second actor in American television to star as the same character in two separate series.

==Reunion TV movie==

A reunion telefilm, &quot;Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; subtitled &quot;The Fifteen Years Later Affair,&quot; was broadcast on CBS in America on April 5, 1983, with Vaughn and McCallum reprising their roles, and Patrick Macnee replacing Leo G. Carroll, who had died in 1972, as the head of U.N.C.L.E. A framed picture of Carroll appeared on his desk. The film included a tribute to Ian Fleming via a cameo appearance by an unidentified secret agent with the initials &quot;JB&quot;. The part was played by George Lazenby, driving James Bond&#x27;s trademark vehicle, an Aston Martin DB5. One character, identifying him, says that it is &quot;just like &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;&quot;, which was Lazenby&#x27;s only Bond film.

The film, written by Michael Sloan and directed by Ray Austin, briefly filled in the missing years. THRUSH had been put out of business, and the escape of its leader from prison begins the story. Solo and Kuryakin, who had retired, are recalled by U.N.C.L.E. to recapture the escapee and defeat THRUSH once and for all. Rather than reuniting the agents and recapturing their chemistry, however, the film has the agents separated and paired with younger agents. Like most similar reunion films, this production was considered a trial balloon for a possible new series which never materialized.

Although some personnel from the original series were involved (like composer Gerald Fried and director of photography Fred Koenekamp), the film was not produced by MGM but by Michael Sloan Productions in association with Viacom Productions.

==Theme music==

The theme music, written by Jerry Goldsmith, changed slightly each season. Goldsmith provided only three original scores and was succeeded by Morton Stevens, who composed four scores for the series. After Stevens, Walter Scharf did six scores, and Lalo Schifrin did two.

Gerald Fried was composer from season two through the beginning of season four, and rearranged the theme twice. The final composers were Robert Drasnin, Nelson Riddle, and lastly Richard Shores. Drasnin also scored episodes of &quot;&quot;, as did Schifrin, Scharf, and Fried. Riddle&#x27;s score for the two-part episode &quot;The Concrete Overcoat Affair&quot; was so loathed by executive producer Norman Felton that he never hired the composer again, although the music did get tracked into other third-season episodes and the film version.

The music reflected the show&#x27;s changing seasons. Goldsmith, Stevens, and Scharf composed dramatic scores in the first season using brass, unusual time signatures and martial rhythms. Gerald Fried and Robert Drasnin opted for a lighter approach in the second, employing jazz flute, harpsichords and bongos. By the third season, the music, like the show, had become more camp, exemplified by a faster R&amp;B organ and saxophone riff version of the theme. The fourth season&#x27;s attempt at seriousness was duly echoed by Richard Shores&#x27; somber scores.

==Guest stars and other actors==

Apart from Solo, Kuryakin, and Waverly, few recurring characters appeared on the show with any regularity. As a result, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; featured many high-profile guest performers during its three-and-a-half-year run.

William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy appeared together in a 1964 episode, &quot;The Project Strigas Affair&quot;, a full two years before &quot;Star Trek&quot; premiered. Shatner played a heroic civilian recruited for an U.N.C.L.E. mission, and Nimoy played the villain&#x27;s henchman. The villain was portrayed by Werner Klemperer. James Doohan appeared in multiple episodes, each time as a different character.

Barbara Feldon played an U.N.C.L.E. translator eager for field work in &quot;The Never-Never Affair&quot;, one year before becoming one of the stars of &quot;Get Smart.&quot; Robert Culp played the villain in 1964&#x27;s &quot;The Shark Affair&quot;. Leigh Chapman appeared in a recurring role as Napoleon Solo&#x27;s secretary, Sarah, for several episodes in 1965.

Woodrow Parfrey appeared five times as a guest performer, although he never received an opening-title credit. Usually cast as a scientist, he played the primary villain in one episode, &quot;The Cherry Blossom Affair&quot;. Another five-time guest star was Jill Ireland, who at the time was married to David McCallum. Ricardo Montalbán appeared in two episodes as the primary villain. &quot;The Five Daughters Affair&quot; featured a cameo appearance by Joan Crawford. Janet Leigh and Jack Palance appeared in &quot;The Concrete Overcoat Affair&quot; and Sonny and Cher made an appearance in the third season episode &quot;The Hot Number Affair&quot;. Other notable guest stars included: Richard Anderson, Eve Arden, Martin Balsam, Whitney Blake, Joan Blondell, Lloyd Bochner, Judy Carne, Roger C. Carmel, Ted Cassidy, Joan Collins, Walter Coy, Yvonne Craig, Broderick Crawford, Joan Crawford, Kim Darby, Albert Dekker, Ivan Dixon, Chad Everett, Anne Francis, Harold Gould, Grayson Hall, Pat Harrington Jr., James Hong, Allen Jenkins, Patsy Kelly, Richard Kiel, Marta Kristen, Elsa Lanchester, Martin Landau, Angela Lansbury, Herbert Lom, Julie London, Jack Lord, Lynn Loring, Jan Murray, Leslie Nielsen, William Marshall, Eve McVeagh, Carroll O&#x27;Connor, Susan Oliver, David Opatoshu, Leslie Parrish, Eleanor Parker, Slim Pickens, Vincent Price, Dorothy Provine, Cesar Romero, Charles Ruggles, Kurt Russell, Telly Savalas, Barbara Shelley, Nancy Sinatra, Sharon Tate, Guthrie Thomas, Terry-Thomas, Rip Torn, Fritz Weaver, and Elen Willard (in her last acting appearance).

==Gadgets==
===Communications devices===

The characters in the series had a range of useful spy equipment, including handheld satellite communicators. A catchphrase often heard was &quot;Open Channel D&quot; when agents used their pocket radios; these were originally disguised as cigarette packs, later as cigarette cases, and still later as fountain pens. One of the original pen communicator props is now in the museum of the CIA. Replicas have been made over the years for other displays, and this is the second-most-identifiable prop from the series (closely following the U.N.C.L.E. Special pistol).

===U.N.C.L.E. car===
A few of the third- and fourth-season episodes featured an &quot;U.N.C.L.E. car&quot;, which was a modified Piranha Coupe, a plastic-bodied concept car based on the Chevrolet Corvair chassis built in limited numbers by the custom car designer Gene Winfield. The U.N.C.L.E. car had been lost after the end of the TV series, but it was found in Colorado during the early 1980s, and it was restored to original condition by Oscar-winning special effects artist Robert Short of California.

===Weaponry===

One prop, designed by the toy designer Reuben Klamer often referred to as &quot;The Gun&quot;, drew so much attention that it actually spurred considerable fan mail, and was often so addressed. Internally designated the &quot;U.N.C.L.E. Special&quot;, it was a modular semi-automatic firearm weapon. The basic pistol could be converted into a longer-range carbine by attaching a long barrel, an extendable shoulder stock, a telescopic sight, and an extended magazine. In this &quot;carbine mode&quot;, the pistol could fire on full automatic. This capability brought authorities to the set to investigate reports that the studio was illegally manufacturing machine guns. They threatened to confiscate the prop guns and it took a tour of the prop room to convince them that these were actually &quot;dummy&quot; pistols incapable of firing live ammunition. The actual pistol used as the prop was the Mauser Model 1934 Pocket Pistol, but it was unreliable, it jammed constantly, and it was dwarfed by the carbine accessories. It was soon replaced by the larger and more-reliable Walther P38.

The long magazine was actually a standard magazine with a dummy extension, but it inspired several small-arms manufacturers to begin making long magazines for various pistols. While many of these continue to be available 40 years later, long magazines were not available for the P38 for some years.

THRUSH had a range of weaponry of its own, much of them only in the development stage before being destroyed by the heroes. A notable item was the infrared sniperscope, enabling villains to aim gunfire in total darkness. The prop was built from a U.S. Army-surplus M1 carbine, with a vertical foregrip and barrel compensator, and using army-surplus infrared scopes. The infrared special effect was achieved using a searchlight to illuminate the target. The viewfinder image was a negative version of the film. When the scopes were switched on a pulsing chirp sound effect was used. The fully equipped carbines were seen only once, in &quot;The Iowa Scuba Affair&quot;. After that, a mockup of the scope was used to make handling easier.

German small arms were well represented in the series. Not only were P38s frequently seen (both as the U.N.C.L.E. Special and in standard configuration), but also the Luger pistol. In the pilot episode &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot;, Illya Kuryakin is carrying a M1911 pistol. The Mauser C96 and MP 40 machine pistols were favored by opponents. U.N.C.L.E. also used the MP 40. Beginning in the third season, both U.N.C.L.E and THRUSH agents used rifles that were either the Spanish CETME or the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 (based on the CETME).

==Feature films==

===Theatrical releases of episodes===

&quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; rated so highly in America and the UK that MGM and the producers decided to film extra footage (often more adult to evoke Bond films) for two of the first season episodes and release them to theaters after they had aired on TV. The episodes with the extra footage that made it to theaters were the original pilot, &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot;, retitled &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot; and &quot;The Double Affair&quot; retitled as &quot;The Spy with My Face&quot;. Both had added sex and violence, new sub-plots and guest stars not in the original TV episodes. They were released in early 1966 as an &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; double-feature program first run in neighborhood theaters, bypassing the customary downtown movie palaces which were still thriving in the mid-1960s and where new films usually played for weeks or months before coming to outlying screens.

A selling point to seeing these films theatrically was that they were being shown in color, at a time when most people had only black-and-white TVs (and indeed the two first-season episodes that were expanded to feature length, while filmed in color, had only been broadcast in black-and-white). The words &quot;in color&quot; featured prominently on the trailers, TV spots, and posters for the film releases. The episodes used to make U.N.C.L.E. films were not included in the packages of television episodes screened outside the United States.

Subsequent two-part episodes, beginning with the second season premiere, &quot;Alexander the Greater Affair&quot;, retitled &quot;One Spy Too Many&quot; for its theatrical release, were developed into one complete feature film with only occasional extra sexy and violent footage added to them, sometimes as just inserts. In the case of &quot;One Spy Too Many,&quot; a subplot featuring Yvonne Craig as an U.N.C.L.E. operative carrying on a flirtatious relationship with Solo was also added to the film; Craig does not appear in the television episodes.

The later films were not released in America, only overseas, but the first few did well in American theaters and remain one of the rare examples of a television show released in paid theatrical engagements. With the exception of the two-part episode &quot;The Five Daughters Affair&quot;, shown as part of Granada Plus&#x27;s run of the series, the episodes which became films have never aired on British television.

The films in the series:
* &quot;To Trap a Spy&quot; (1964)
* &quot;The Spy with My Face&quot; (1965)
* &quot;One Spy Too Many&quot; (1966)
* &quot;One of Our Spies Is Missing&quot; (1966)
* &quot;The Spy in the Green Hat&quot; (1966)
* &quot;The Karate Killers&quot; (1967)
* &quot;The Helicopter Spies&quot; (1968)
* &quot;How to Steal the World&quot; (1968)

===2015 remake===

A film adaptation of the television series was produced by Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment, and was released in 2015. Directed by Guy Ritchie, the film stars Armie Hammer, Henry Cavill, and Hugh Grant as Kuryakin, Solo, and Waverly, respectively. Filming began in September 2013, and the film was released on August 14, 2015. The film received mixed reviews.

==In other media==

===Soundtrack albums===

Although album recordings of the series had been made by Hugo Montenegro and many orchestras cover versions of the title theme, it wasn&#x27;t until 2002 that the first of three double-disc albums of original music from the series were released through &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; (FSM).

===Comic books===

Several comic books based on the series were published. In the US, there was a Gold Key Comics series which ran for twenty-two issues. Entertainment Publishing released an eleven-issue series of one- and two-part stories from January 1987 to September 1988 that updated U.N.C.L.E. to the 1980s, while largely ignoring the reunion TV film. A two-part comics story, &quot;The Birds of Prey Affair&quot;, was put out by Millennium Publications in 1993, which showcased the return of a smaller, more-streamlined version of THRUSH, controlled by Dr. Egret, who had melded with the Ultimate Computer. The script was written by Mark Ellis and Terry Collins, with artwork by Nick Choles, and transplanted the characters into the 1990s.

Two &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; strips were originated for the British market in the 1960s (some Gold Key material was also reprinted), the most notable for &quot;Lady Penelope&quot; comic, which launched in January 1966. This was replaced by a &quot;Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; strip in January 1967. &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; also featured in the short-lived title &quot;Solo&quot; (published between February and September 1967) and some text stories appeared in &quot;TV Tornado&quot;.

In 2015–2016, DC Comics launched &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, a crossover with its &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; series.

===Novels===
Two dozen novels were based upon &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and published between 1965 and 1968. Unhampered by television censors, the novels were generally grittier and more violent than the televised episodes. The series sold in the millions, and was the largest TV-novel tie-in franchise until surpassed by &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Volumes 10–15 and 17 of the series were only published in the United States.

Whitman Publishing published three hardcover novels aimed at young readers: &quot;The Affair of the Gunrunners&#x27; Gold&quot; and &quot;The Affair of the Gentle Saboteur&quot; by Brandon Keith, and &quot;The Calcutta Affair&quot; by George S. Elrick. 

A children&#x27;s storybook was written by Walter B. Gibson entitled &quot;The Coin of El Diablo Affair&quot;.

The digest-sized &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E. Magazine&quot; featured original novella continuing the adventures of Solo and Kuryakin. Published under the house name &quot;Robert Hart Davis&quot;, they were written by such authors as John Jakes, Dennis Lynds, and Bill Pronzini. 24 issues, which also offered original crime and spy-fiction short stories and novelettes, and occasional SF and fantasy reprints under the title &quot;Department of Lost Stories&quot;, ran monthly from February 1966 to January 1968. An additional novella entitled &quot;The Vanishing City Affair&quot; was advertised on page 140 of the January 1968 issue for the proposed (but never published) February 1968 issue. It is as yet unconfirmed, however, if this novella was shelved for possible future release elsewhere or if it was ever written at all.

===TV Annuals===
There have been four TV Annuals published in UK between 1967 and 1970 by World Distributors which features written stories and reprint of a Gold Key Comics story which were never published in the UK.

==Home media==
MGM/UA Home Video released eight volumes, featuring two episodes each, on home video on September 25, 1991. 

In November 2007, after coming to an agreement with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, Time Life released a 41 DVD set (region 1) for direct order, with sales through stores scheduled for fall 2008. An earlier release by Anchor Bay, allegedly set for 2006, was apparently scuttled because of a dispute over the rights to the series with Warner Home Video.

On October 21, 2008, the Time-Life set was released to retail outlets in Region 1 (North America) in a special all-seasons box set contained within a small briefcase. The complete-series set consists of 41 DVDs, including two discs of special features included exclusively with the box set. Included in the set was the &quot;Solo&quot; pilot episode, as well as one of the films, &quot;One Spy Too Many&quot;. Paramount Pictures and CBS Home Entertainment released &quot;Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; to DVD in Region 1 on March 3, 2009.

On August 23, 2011, Warner Archive Collection released &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 8-Movie Collection&quot; on DVD via its &quot;manufacture on demand&quot; service. On November 4, 2014, Warner Home Video released the complete series set on DVD in Region 1 in a new repackaged version. On August 4, 2015, Warner Home Video released an individual release of season 1 on DVD in Region 1. Season 2 was released on February 2, 2016.

On March 26, 2012, Fabulous Films released &quot;Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; on Region 2 DVD.

===Merchandise===
Licensed merchandise included Gilbert action figures, Aurora plastic model kits, lunch boxes, and toy guns.

An example of this, the Louis Marx &quot;Target Gun Set&quot;, a dart-gun shooting-game released in the form of a quasi-playset, is built around the setting of U.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City. Art on the cardboard stand displays both the U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH logos, and a half-dozen soft plastic figures per &quot;side&quot; were provided, including Solo, Kuryakin and Waverly. The game measures ; the figures, at , represent one of the few attempts Marx made at supplementing its 6-inch figure line. The U.N.C.L.E. figures are cast in blue, except for a single (unnamed) figure in tan; THRUSH agents are cast in gray. Marx was released an arcade game licensed under &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

Corgi Toys produced a die-cast toy model of the &quot;Thrushbuster&quot;, an Oldsmobile 88, with figures of &#x27;Napoleon Solo&#x27; and &#x27;Illya Kuryakin&#x27; which popped in and out of the car windows firing guns by pressing down on a model periscope protruding through the roof.

==&quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; in popular culture==
===Television and film===
&quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (which replaced &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot;) in its premiere episode Jan. 22, 1968, one week after the final episode of &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; aired during the cocktail party sketch has Man From Uncle as the punch line of the final joke, prompting Leo G. Carroll in a cameo as the bartender to pull out a radio pen and say into it, &quot;Kuryakin, get over here fast. I think I&#x27;ve found THRUSH headquarters at last!&quot;

MGM&#x27;s 1966 production &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot; contains a scene in which Paul Lynde dresses up as a woman so that he can follow Doris Day, whom he suspects is an enemy agent, into the Ladies&#x27; Room. As he makes his way through a crowded party, he passes the bar —- at which Robert Vaughn is standing in evening dress. The musical score strikes up the Man from U.N.C.L.E. theme as Napoleon Solo gives the Lynde character a bemused once-over.

In 1967, MGM released a theatrical &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short produced and directed by Chuck Jones titled &quot;The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R.&quot; paid homage to the show, with Jerry as a secret agent JERRY-AKIN 00 1/7&quot;, [a pun on both Illya Kuryakin and James Bond] tasked with the mission of retrieving a sizeable stash of cheese from the villainous Tom Thrush (portrayed by Tom).

References to the show in popular culture began during its original broadcast when it was parodied in an episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; fittingly titled &quot;The Man from My Uncle&quot;. References in other television shows have continued over the years, including a 2010 episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot; called &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;. It has also been referenced in other television shows including &quot;Get Smart&quot; and &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;.

The TV show &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; (1963–1966) also used CRUSH as the name of the evil spy organization, spoofing THRUSH in two episodes. In the season two episode &quot;006 3/4&quot;, Tim finds a distress note from Agent 006 of Top Secret, who is being tracked by CRUSH. Top Secret asks Tim to assist Agent 004, to save 006. In the season three episode &quot;Butterball&quot; Uncle Martin must rescue Tim who is kidnapped by Butterball.

A 1966 episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot; was titled &quot;The Girl from AUNTIE&quot;. AUNTIE was the name used by Mad Magazine in its parody of the Man From U.N.C.L.E. — it was said to stand for &quot;Association for Unbelievably Nauseating Television and Idiotic Entertainment&quot;.

In a 1966 episode of the sitcom &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot; titled &quot;Say UNCLE&quot;, the young twins are fans of &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and become convinced that their father Jim is a secret agent. In one scene, they watch Jim emerge from a tailor shop similar to Del Floria&#x27;s. Another man entering the shop asks Jim for a match, and Jim gives him his matchbook. The boys are astonished, because the other man is David McCallum, identified in the ending credits as Illya Kuryakin; they believe their father has just passed a secret message to the &quot;real-life&quot; Illya Kuryakin. The scene ends with the &quot;U.N.C.L.E&quot; scene transition: the action freezes and goes out of focus.

It was also referenced in Glad commercials in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which starred the &quot;Man from GLAD&quot;, a trenchcoat-wearing agent who flew around in his combination boat/helicopter demonstrating Glad products to suburban housewives and saving the day.

In 1970, a &quot;secret agent&quot; theme was used by Australian confectionery manufacturer Allen&#x27;s to market their Anticol cough lozenges, with TV commercials running under the title &quot;The Man From A.N.T.I.C.O.L.&quot;, featuring agent &quot;Napoleon Brandy&quot; combatting illnesses being spread by the agents of S.L.A.S.H.

In a late 1986 episode of &quot;The A-Team&quot;, Robert Vaughn – who had been added to the show&#x27;s cast as mysterious retired agent for the show&#x27;s final season, as part of an effort to revive flagging ratings – was reunited with guest star David McCallum, in an episode entitled &quot;The &#x27;Say U.N.C.L.E.&#x27; Affair&quot;. This story paid homage to &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,&quot; complete with chapter titles, the word &quot;affair&quot; in the title, the phrase &quot;Open Channel D&quot;, similar scene transitions, and much mention of Vaughn&#x27;s and McCallum&#x27;s respective characters having once worked closely together as agents. But in this story, McCallum&#x27;s agent had turned villainous, selling out to the enemy and now capturing Vaughn to try to find out the whereabouts of a Soviet jet fighter.

Beginning in 2003, McCallum starred in the CBS television series &quot;NCIS&quot; as Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard, M.D., a medical examiner. During the episode &quot;The Meat Puzzle&quot; (season 2, episode 13), as an inside joke, Naval Criminal Investigation Service agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) is asked, &quot;What did Ducky look like when he was younger?&quot; Gibbs responds, &quot;Illya Kuryakin&quot;. The photo supposedly of a younger Ducky is actually a promotional photo from McCallum&#x27;s &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; days. Additionally, in season 20, episode 21 -Kompromat, when asked about Soviet defector Ilya Sokolov, Ducky explains how Sokolov took a fake name after his defection, choosing &quot;something from an old television show… Kuryakin, Ivan Kuryakin.&quot;

On the fifth episode of the fourth season of &quot;Mad Men&quot; (2010), &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;, as Sally Draper is watching an episode of the show at a sleepover, she is caught by her friend&#x27;s mother absent-mindedly masturbating (apparently to David McCallum&#x27;s Illya) while staring at the television. The episode shown is approximately correct for the year and month (March 1965) the &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode is set in.

&quot;Ben Elton: The Man from Auntie&quot; was a British television comedy series written and performed by Ben Elton. The title of the series was a play on words of both the American spy series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and &quot;Auntie&quot;, an informal name for the BBC.

A scene from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; is shown in the HBO biographical film &quot;Temple Grandin&quot;. In an early scene from the film, Claire Danes, who played Grandin in the film, repeated a line from the episode &quot;The Gazebo in the Maze Affair&quot;: &quot;Would you like for me to open the gate?&quot;.

The TV show was mentioned in the 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. There&#x27;s a scene where Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is told by casting agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) that due to Dalton playing the heavy in weekly television, he&#x27;ll get typecasting to play the heavy in other media.

A colorful whip pan shot, similar to the TV show scene transitions, appears in &quot;Kill Bill Vol. 1&quot; before the ticket-to-Okinawa and ticket-to-Japan scenes. Chapter Four is also titled &quot;The MAN From Okinawa&quot;.

===Comic books===

The 1965–1969 comic book series &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; (The Higher United Nations Defense Enforcement Reserves) (Tower Comics), a strange combination of secret agents and superheroes, was inspired by the success of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot;.

The Marvel Universe spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Marvel Universe terror society Hydra (both created in 1965) were inspired by the &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; television program.

&quot;The Man from R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E.&quot; was a &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; parody in Archie Comics published in 1966–1967. The comic portrayed Archie and the gang as a group of high-tech spies, as part of world-defense organization P.O.P. (an acronym for Protect our Planet). Their chief enemy was a counter-group known as C.R.U.S.H. (a spoof on THRUSH but whose acronym was never explained). Although Reggie, Veronica and Moose were initially cast as C.R.U.S.H. agents, they later became members of P.O.P. All the characters also had undefined acronyms for names (A.R.C.H.I.E., B.E.T.T.Y., etc.). R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E. stood for &quot;Really Impressive Vast Enterprise for Routing Dangerous Adversaries, Louts, Etc.&quot;

===Music===
Musical examples include the song &quot;Man Called Uncle&quot; from Elvis Costello&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Get Happy!!&quot; and an Argentinian funk duo who took the name Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas honoring the fictitious spy. Alma Cogan paid a similar tribute to the Russian agent in her single &quot;Love Ya Illya&quot;, released in 1966 under the pseudonym &quot;Angela and the Fans&quot;. In the 1980s, Martin Newell penned &quot;Ilya Kuryakin Looked at Me&quot;; the song was later covered by The Jennifers. The Jamaican Rocksteady singer Hopeton Lewis made an instrumental song called &quot;Napoleon Solo&quot;. It was also the name of a Danish 2 Tone band. Space–surf band Man or Astro-man? covered the theme song for their 1994 EP &quot;Astro Launch&quot;. Man or Astro-man are instrumental, not surf however. The British trip-hop group Unkle derive their name from the show. The name of the series is also mentioned in the 1979 song &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot; by English musician Tony Banks off the album of the same name.

===Video games===
The protagonist in the spy-fi video games &quot;The Operative: No One Lives Forever&quot; (2000) and &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot; (2002) works for an organization known as U.N.I.T.Y. The villains in both games work for an organization known as H.A.R.M. In the first game the main character (Cate Archer) overhears two H.A.R.M. guards talking about how they thought &quot;Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; was a good show.

The video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; (2007) has an achievement referencing the show, named &quot;The Man From P.U.N.C.T.U.R.E.&quot;

<text>Taiwanese cuisine ( or ) is a popular style of food with several variations, including Chinese and that of Taiwanese indigenous peoples, with the earliest cuisines known of being the indigenous ones. With over a hundred years of historical development, southern Fujian cuisine has had the most profound impact on mainstream Taiwanese cuisine but it has also been influenced by Hakka cuisine, the cuisines of the &quot;waishengren&quot; (people of other provinces), and Japanese cuisine.

Taiwan&#x27;s cuisine is tied to its history of colonization and modern politics makes the description of Taiwanese cuisine difficult. As Taiwan developed economically fine dining became increasingly popular. Taiwanese cuisine has significant regional variations.

Night markets in Taiwan form a significant part of the food culture. Vegetarian and vegan food are very common. Taiwanese cuisine is popular around the world with some items like bubble tea and Taiwanese fried chicken becoming global phenomena.

==History==

According to Katy Hui-wen Hung, &quot;Taiwanese food history is as murky as Taiwanese politics&quot;. This is because Taiwanese cuisine is intricately tied to patterns of migration and colonization. Local and international Taiwanese cuisine, including its history, is a politically contentious topic. Taiwan&#x27;s complex and diverse identity makes Taiwanese cuisine difficult to define. Tense political relations between Taiwan and China also complicate the history.

The history of Taiwanese cuisine began with the cuisine of the aboriginal peoples of the islands of Taiwan. In the 16th century Fujianese and Hakka communities immigrated to Taiwan and brought their cuisines with them. Due to this part of its heritage Taiwanese cuisine is often considered as a part of regional Chinese cuisine. Early European influences came from the Dutch, Spanish, and Portuguese.

Due to the period of Japanese rule, Taiwanese cuisine was also strongly influenced by Japanese &quot;washoku&quot; and &quot;yōshoku&quot;. During Japanese rule Japanese dishes and foodways such as bento, sashimi, rice balls, and miso soup were introduced to Taiwanese cuisine.

After WWII, the Kuomintang retreat to Taiwan brought along many Chinese cuisines outside the province of Fujian or Southeast China. After that, the dishes from China especially Guangdong, Chaoshan, Shanghai, Sichuan and Beijing could be easily found in Taiwan.

According to Taiwanese chef Fu Pei-mei, authentic Chinese culinary traditions were properly preserved in Taiwan. This claim to authenticity, common among Fu&#x27;s generation, was in part due to the Kuomintang&#x27;s Chinese nationalist political messaging which extended well beyond cuisine. The authenticity of regional Chinese cuisine in Taiwan has been challenged. Some sources trace the origin of instant noodles to Taiwan&#x27;s jisi noodles, in particular a variation deep-fried in pork fat to be later boiled in water before serving introduced by the Qingji Ice Dessert Parlor in 1951. Following the commercialization of instant noodles Taiwanese companies including Uni-President. In 1973 Wei Lih Food Industrial introduced the first packaged instant noodle meant to be consumed &quot;dry&quot; (without soup or with soup on the side).

The Tatung electric steamer was introduced in the 1960s and became a staple of Taiwanese home and restaurant kitchens. The widespread adoption of the food court during the 20th century formalized more traditional hawkers and vendors. Food courts also became an important part of the malls and shopping centers which proliferated across Taiwan.

In 2002, the accession of Taiwan to the World Trade Organization forced Taiwanese farmers to compete with global markets. Many responded by shifting from staple crops to high end and niche produce primarily for local consumption. Agrotourism was also more widely adopted, with visitors to farms often being served and/or taught how to prepare dishes with the products from the farms.

In the early 21st century, ideas about sustainability and local food became more prominent in Taiwanese culinary and agricultural circles. An increased emphasis has been placed on understanding the history of food as well as incorporating indigenous foodways into mainstream Taiwanese cuisine.

=== Ingredients and culture ===


Common ingredients of Taiwanese cuisine are pork, seafood, chicken, rice, and soy. Traditionally, rice formed the basis of most Taiwanese diets. Before the Japanese colonial period, most rice grown in Taiwan was long-grained indica rice. The Japanese introduced short-grained japonica rice which quickly changed both the farming and eating patterns of the Taiwanese. Due to Japanese influence, the Taiwanese generally prefer rice that is plump, aromatic, slightly firm, and sweet. Differences between the Taiwanese and Japanese rice preferences are demonstrated by differences in their cuisine with Taiwan&#x27;s more flavorful and aggressive cooking methods calling for highly aromatic rice while the Japanese prefer a more subtle and pure taste and smell. During the Japanese Colonial period, Taiwanese cuisine was divided. High-end restaurants, or wine houses, served Chinese cuisine such as Peking duck, shark fin with bird&#x27;s nest soup, and braised turtle to the colonial elite. In the meantime, those without wealth or connections primarily ate rice, porridge, pickled vegetables, and sweet potato leaves. Cooking oil was considered a luxury and was only used for special occasions.

Taiwan&#x27;s cuisine has also been influenced by its geographic location. Living on a crowded island, the Taiwanese had to look aside from the farmlands for sources of protein. As a result, seafood figures prominently in their cuisine. This seafood encompasses many different things, from large fish such as tuna and grouper, to sardines and even smaller fish such as anchovies. Crustaceans, squid, and cuttlefish are also eaten. Milkfish is the most popular fish in Taiwanese cuisine; it is valued for its versatility as well as its tender meat and economical price.

Beef is less common than other proteins, and some Taiwanese (particularly the elderly generation) still refrain from eating it. This stems from traditional reluctance toward slaughtering precious cattle needed for agriculture, and an emotional attachment and feeling of gratitude and thanks to the animals traditionally used for very hard labor. However, due to influences from the influx of Chinese in the 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan. American food aid in the decades following WWII which primarily consisted of wheat, beef, and processed meats like Spam permanently changed the Taiwanese diet with wheat-based noodles, breads, and dumplings taking a more central role in the cuisine. Rice consumption in Taiwan reached a height of 80-90 kilograms per person per year in the 1960s and 1970s before falling as consumers shifted consumption to wheat-based foods. However, the Taiwanese still consume a large quantity of rice, particularly brown rice and exotic varieties like black, purple, and red rice. Recently rice consumption in Taiwan has enjoyed a renaissance with both growers and consumers devoting the level of care and attention to the rice that is given to high-value crops like tea.

Dumplings were a minor part of Taiwanese cuisine until the expansion in wheat consumption following WWII. Dumplings and dumpling like foods (such as xiaolongbao which is actually a small steamed bun because its wrapper contains yeast) are very popular in modern Taiwanese cuisine with most combining Chinese and Taiwanese influences. In Taiwan dumplings are often paired with hot and sour soup.

Because of the island&#x27;s sub-tropical location, Taiwan has an abundant supply of various fruit, such as papayas, starfruit, melons, and citrus fruit. A wide variety of tropical fruits, imported and native, are also enjoyed in Taiwan. Other agricultural products in general are rice, corn, tea, pork, poultry, beef, fish and other fruits and vegetables. Fresh ingredients in Taiwan are readily available from markets.

In many of their dishes, the Taiwanese have shown their creativity in their selection of spices. Typical spice mixes in Taiwanese cuisine are five spice powder and hujiaoyan (literally pepper salt; a mixture of white pepper, salt, MSG, and sugar). Taiwanese cuisine relies on an abundant array of seasonings for flavor: soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, fermented black beans, pickled radish, pickled mustard greens, peanuts, chili peppers, cilantro (sometimes called Chinese parsley) and a local variety of basil (). Widespread use of sugar is part of the legacy of Taiwan&#x27;s commercial sugar industry.

Taiwanese black vinegar has more in common with Worcestershire sauce than other black vinegars and is considered an outlier among black vinegars. Its base is sticky rice which is then aged with other ingredients in clay pots. It is used as a condiment and seasoning. Kong Yen is the largest producer of Taiwanese black vinegar. According to &quot;Bon Appetit&quot;, compared to Chinese black vinegars it is &quot;simpler, fruitier, and cleaner.&quot; Taiwanese soy paste is a soy sauce based paste thickened with rice flour and sugar. Taiwanese mayonnaise is made with both egg whites and egg yolks and is sweetened.

An important part of Taiwanese cuisine is &quot;xiaochi&quot; (小吃), substantial snacks along the lines of Spanish tapas or Levantine meze. The Taiwanese &quot;xiaochi&quot; has gained much reputation internationally. Many travelers go to Taiwan just for xiǎochī. The most common place to enjoy xiǎochī in Taiwan is in a night market. Each night market also has its famous xiǎochī. Moreover, the Taiwanese xiǎochī has entered more &quot;refined&quot; eating environments. Nowadays, Taiwanese xiǎochī can be found in luxury and high-end restaurants. These restaurants use higher quality ingredients and creative presentations, reinventing dishes whilst keeping the robust flavors. The prices usually jump by twice the price or even higher in the restaurants. The Taiwanese government supports the Taiwanese xiǎochī and has held national xiǎochī events in Taiwan regularly.

Grilling is an important part of Taiwanese cuisine with many Taiwanese grilling at home and street side grills being a ubiquitous feature of night markets. &quot;Rechao&quot; () is a style of Taiwanese cuisine that uses a wok to stir fry food. &quot;Rechao&quot; establishments create settings for numerous Taiwanese to connect with each other as they dine and converse.

Roadside banquet chefs are ubiquitous in Taiwan; these small (often single-person) catering firms provide on-location cooking for wedding banquets and other celebrations often held on the roadside. During the COVID-19 pandemic these chefs saw a significant downturn in business due to the lack of people hosting large traditional functions, especially those around the Lunar New Year. The banquet industry returned after the pandemic but have faced criticism for a lack of innovation and the repetition of traditional dishes.

===Vegetarianism and veganism===
Vegetarian restaurants are commonplace in Taiwan with a wide variety of dishes, mainly due to the influence of Buddhism and other syncretistic religions like I-Kuan Tao. These vegetarian restaurants vary in style from all-you-can-eat to pay-by-the-weight and the regular order-from-a-menu. Vegetarian restaurants and foods are often marked with a left-facing swastika.

In the 21st century, Taiwan has seen a rise in non-religious vegetarians, especially among the young. There has also been a rise in veganism with concerns about animal welfare, personal health, environmental sustainability, and climate change driving both trends. Taiwan&#x27;s traditional vegetarian products companies have also expanded into the booming fake meat market. The traditional culinary use of fake meat in Taiwan has given Taiwanese companies an edge and Taiwan is now a market leader in the fake meat sector. Taiwanese companies do a significant amount of export business, particularly in the European, North American, and Southeast Asian markets. Hung Yang Foods, one of the largest producers of fake meat products, does 80% of their business overseas with their products being stocked in 90% of Australian supermarkets.

In 2023, there were approximately 6,000 vegetarian restaurants in Taiwan.

== Regional specialties ==
== Typical dishes ==
There is a type of outdoor barbecue called . To barbecue in this manner, one first builds a hollow pyramid up with dirt clods. Next, charcoal or wood is burnt inside until the temperature inside the pyramid is very high (the dirt clods should be glowing red). The ingredients to be cooked, such as taro, yam, or chicken, are placed in cans, and the cans are placed inside the pyramid. Finally, the pyramid is toppled over the food until cooked.

Many non-dessert dishes are usually considered snacks, not entrees; that is, they have a similar status to Cantonese dim sum or Spanish tapas. Such dishes are usually only slightly salted, with many vegetables accompanying the main meat or seafood item.

== Desserts ==
* Aiyu jelly – a gelatinous dessert made from the seeds of a creeping fig, &quot;Ficus pumila var. awkeotsang&quot;. Served on ice.
* () – an ice cream made of taro root paste.
* Tshuah-ping (also known as &quot;Baobing&quot;) – a Taiwanese shaved ice dessert very common in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
* Xue-bing (雪花冰) - also called &quot;xue hua bing,&quot; translated to &quot;snow ice,&quot; &quot;snowflake ice,&quot; or &quot;shaved snow.&quot; This is different from baobing/tshuah-ping in that the base mixture for the ice is creamy (milk is generally added, but it can be dairy or plant based), the ice itself often has a flavor dissolved in (milk, taro, chocolate, coffee, etc.), the texture of the shaved snow is very fine, and it melts near-instantaneously, upon contact. The ice for this is typically cylindrical, and the shaved snow comes out of the machine in ruffled ribbons. Some additional common toppings include but are not limited to: sweetened condensed milk, mangoes, sweetened red beans, sweetened mung beans, boba pearls, or taro.
* Bubble tea, aka boba milk tea; also known as pearl milk tea - chewy tapioca balls added to milk tea.
* Traditional cakes are not always of the same composition depending on the flavor. There is the moon cake which has a thick filling usually made from lotus seed paste or sweetened red bean paste and surrounded by a relatively thin (2–3 mm) crust and may contain yolks from salted duck eggs. It is traditionally eaten during the festival for lunar worship and moon watching. Mooncakes are offered between friends or on family gatherings while celebrating the festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the four most important Chinese festivals.

:There are other cakes that can mix salty ingredients with sweet ones to create a balance while enjoying these delicacies with tea. The crust could be shiny from applying a layer of egg yolk before putting in the oven, or not in that case it is often whiter and the crust has more layers.
* Grass jelly () – (&quot;Mesona procumbens&quot;) Served hot or cold.
* Moachi (), a soft rice cake like Japanese daifuku mochi. Flavors of the fillings can vary, ranging from all kinds of beans to nuts.
* Pineapple cake ()- a square short crust pie filled with pineapple filling. One of Taiwan&#x27;s best known dessert pastries and souvenir of choice.
* Chhau-a-koe – Cakes made with a dough from glutinous rice flour and combine with a ground cooked paste of &quot;Gnaphalium affine&quot; or &quot;Mugwort&quot; to give it a unique flavor and green color. The dough is commonly filled with ground meat or sweet bean pastes.
* Douhua (豆花) - Soft tofu served with syrup and toppings such as peanuts, adzuki beans, tapioca, and mung beans. Served hot or cold.
* Chocolate - Taiwan&#x27;s cocoa production is centered in Pingtung in Southern Taiwan. As of 2020 approximately 200-300 acres was under cultivation in Pingtung supporting around 30 chocolate making companies. Taiwan is one of the few mature chocolate making countries to also be a cocoa producer.

== Night market dishes ==
Taiwan&#x27;s best-known snacks are present in the night markets, where street vendors sell a variety of different foods, from finger foods, drinks, sweets, to sit-down dishes. In these markets, one can also find fried and steamed meat-filled buns, oyster-filled omelets, refreshing fruit ices, and much more. Aside from snacks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts, night markets also have vendors selling clothes, accessories, and offer all kinds of entertainment and products. Street vendors used to be common across Taiwan but due to increasing regulations and health safety concerns are now primarily found at night markets and food courts. Taiwanese food courts incorporate ideas from traditional night markets a well as importing ideas from the United States and Japan. Food courts have become ubiquitous across Taiwan. Many night market dishes can now be found outside night markets.

In 2014, The Guardian called Taiwan&#x27;s night markets the &quot;best street food markets in the world&quot;. Some, such as Shilin Night Market, have become as popular with tourists than they are with locals leading to complaints that they have lost a measure of their authentic flavor though commercialization.
* Various drinks are also often sold, ranging from bubble tea stands to various juice and tea stands.
* Crêpes - Adapted from the original French version, a thin cooked pancake, it has a much crispier texture, rather like a cracker. They were popular in the early 2000s.
* Fruit or bean smoothies - milk or ice is blended on the spot with fresh papaya, mango, watermelon, azuki bean, or mung bean.
* Fried glutinous rice balls - slightly sweet.

== Food of the Taiwanese Aborigines ==

Taiwan&#x27;s food and food culture is very much diversified and largely influenced by the exodus of Han people. However, one part of the Taiwanese food culture that remains integral is that of the Taiwanese indigenous people. Though indigenous populations only make up approximately 1.5% of Taiwan&#x27;s overall population, it is notable that their foods eaten and ways of preparation are distinguishable from the more typical Chinese-influenced cuisine.

The aborigines&#x27; diet very much depends on nature. With profuse vegetation and wild animals, the aborigines were natural hunter-gatherers. Essentially, much of what Aborigines ate depended on their environment – that is, whether they lived in coastal or mountainous areas. Tribes like Amis, Atayal, Saisiyat and Bunun hunt what they can, and gather what they cultivate. On the other hand, tribes like the Yamis and the Thao have fish as a predominant source of food. Most foods consisted of millet, taro, sweet potato, wild greens and game like boar and rat. This is in contrast to the main foods eaten by the Han, which consisted of rice and chicken.

Game meats for those living in the mountainous areas include deer, and flying squirrel intestines, a delicacy as regarded by the Bunun people. Another is &#x27;stinky&#x27; meat – that is, &#x27;maggoty game&#x27; that has begun to rot, which is then barbecued, fried, seasoned with garlic and ginger then served with spicy sauce.

The Amis, apart from meat, had much greens to eat, largely due to the belief that anything a cow ate, was also edible by humans. The Bununs, who are primarily hunters of wild animals, would dine on stone-grilled pork, boar, deer, and hog roast. The Yami tribe, located off Taitung coast, fed on many types of fish, including the prized &#x27;flying fish&#x27; (or Alibangbang). A speciality includes rice, mixed with river fish and wild vegetables, served in large bamboo trunks.

Apart from being a staple-food, millet was always produced as wine. Not just for drinking, millet wine played an important role in being used as offerings during festivals, births and weddings. Millet wines are all made in the homes of the Aborigines. Sticky rice is put into a wooden steamer after being soaked in water. Once cooled, the rice is put into a pot of water, then pulled out and combined with rice yeast. After four or five days of being placed in a large jar, the rice is placed in a sieve or rice bag, whilst the alcoholic liquid drips out and is stored away.

Also important to the Indigenous Taiwanese people&#x27;s cuisine are the sweet potato and taro, favored for their perennial nature and low maintenance. The cultivation of root vegetables rather than typical seedling plants was notably prominent, with archaeological evidence suggesting as early as fourth millennium BC, from the Dapenkeng site, in Guanyin Mountain, New Taipei City.

Given the versatility of both vegetables, they were usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and stews. Without the need for advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: &#x27;the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are cut into pieces eight inches long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the bulbs grow and are ripe about the end of June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.&#x27; The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like &#x27;Meet Fresh&#x27; (or 鮮芋仙).

Due to the absence of contemporary culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas stovetops and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavors together, yet preserve the original flavors. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.

Taiwanese indigenous cuisine incorporates certain flavors that are distinct from Han Chinese-influenced cuisine. Mountain peppercorns (&quot;shan hujiao&quot; in Chinese or &quot;magao,&quot; derived from the Atayal term &quot;maqaw)&quot; are one of these distinctive ingredients. 

A cookbook published in 2000 by the CIP and National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism, listed some foods of the main Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes, showing the Aborigines&#x27; adherence and passion for natural foods.
* Amis Nation: Alivongvong (meat and sticky rice dumpling packed in leaves) (阿里鳳鳳); Stir-fried wild vegetables
* Atayal Nation: Grilled meat on stone (石板烤肉); Langying (steamed sticky rice cake) (朗應)
* Bunun Nation: Bunun millet cake (布農粿); Millet rice (小米飯)
* Paiwan Nation: Millet Qinafu (millet and pork meat-ball) (小米奇那富); Jinbole (Sorghum and pork dumpling packed in a banana leaf) (金伯樂)
* Puyuma Nation: Yinafei mountain cake (以那馡山地粿); Fried wild rat with basil (九層野鼠)
* Rukai Nation: Qinabu (taro and meat dumpling) (奇那步); Grilled boar
* Saisiyat Nation: Grilled boar with papaya (木瓜拌山豬肉); Assorted wild flowers (野花拼盤); Cassava and spareribs soup (樹薯排骨湯)
* Tsou Nation: Bamboo cooked rice (竹筒飯); Banana cake (香蕉糕)
* Yami Nation: Boiled taro and crab (芋泥加蟹肉); Grilled fish Steamed dried fish (蒸魚乾)

===Modern Aboriginal cuisine===
It seems that an interest in Taiwanese indigenous cuisine gained traction in the media in the mid-1990s, developing alongside increasing governmental action to protect and recognize Taiwanese indigenous peoples. There are restaurants around Taipei that keep the spirit of Indigenous cuisine alive. Whilst chefs in such restaurants often tweak traditional recipes to suit contemporary tastebuds, emphasis of natural foods is still extant. The annual Indigenous Peoples Healthy Cuisine and Innovative Beverage Competition, partly sponsored by the Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Tourism Bureau provides prize money to contestants who creatively use traditional indigenous ingredients in healthy ways. Other similar competitions are held by local governments (such as Kaohsiung City). In Tainan, indigenous people may sell their food at the Cha Ha Mu Aboriginal Park. Such trends are all to promote the wonderful taste of Aboriginal Taiwanese cuisine. The cultural value of indigenous dishes and ingredients has become more widespread among non-indigenous people, but there are many implications with this growth in recent years. Cultivating or foraging for traditional ingredients is often limited on the small plots of land that are legally owned by indigenous people. Some urban Pangcah/Amis people have resorted to foraging without permission on others&#x27; land.

During the martial law period indigenous culture was repressed by the government, despite this indigenous cuisine became a part of Taiwan&#x27;s national identity.

Silaw is an Amis dish of pickled pork.

The importance of wild greens to aboriginal cuisine is being increasingly appreciated. Wild greens refers to both wild plants found in the forest and to those same plants cultivated in domestic gardens. Rinari, in rural Pingtung County, is an aboriginal restaurant of national significance whose twenty seats are notoriously hard to secure. Rinari primarily serves Rukai cuisine.

==Beverages==
The Taiwanese drink less alcohol per capita than neighboring South Koreans and Japanese. This is believed to be because approximately half of Taiwan&#x27;s population does not possess the necessary gene to successfully metabolize alcohol. During the Japanese colonial period the production of alcoholic beverages was industrialized and in 1922, production of alcohol was monopolized by the colonial authorities. Modern Taiwanese drinking culture and beverage production is still influenced by the Japanese colonial period.

===Beer===

Beer is a popular beverage in Taiwan. Taiwan both imports and produces a wide variety of beers from mass market lagers to niche craft ales. Some of the well-developed brands include Long Chuan (龍泉), Le Blé d&#x27;Or (金色三麥), Jolly Brewery+Restaurant (卓莉手工醸啤酒泰食餐廳), North Taiwan Brewing (北台灣麥酒) and Taihu Brewing (臺虎精釀).

===Coffee===
The first coffee plants on Taiwan were imported by the British to Tainan in 1884 with the first significant small scale cultivation taking place in New Taipei City&#x27;s Sanxia District. Tainan remains the heart of Taiwanese coffee culture.

During the Japanese colonial period between 1895 and 1945, coffee plantations were set up in Taiwan. Coffee, like other colonial introductions, was regarded as a sign of modernity. It was often made using a siphon, and tended to be strong and bitter. Production reached a peak in 1941 following the introduction of arabica coffee plants by the Japanese colonial authorities.

More recently, Starbucks&#x27; outlets in Taiwan have introduced local drinkers to espresso-based milk beverages, which are often milder than the brews traditionally served there. Domestic production is still small, but of high quality; imported beans account for the vast majority of coffee sold in Taiwan. In 2016, domestic production was 900 tons while 30,000 tons was imported. That year, a Taiwanese, Berg Wu, won the World Barista Championship; the victory helped bring to attention Taiwan&#x27;s substantial involvement in coffee culture. 

By 2020, there were more than 15,000 coffee shops in Taiwan, including Starbucks, Taiwanese coffee shop chains, convenience stores, and independent outlets. During that year, average coffee consumption surpassed average tea consumption for the first time. By 2024, a significant percentage of specialty coffee shops were roasting their own beans, and tourists had started visiting Taiwan specifically to go &quot;cafe hopping&quot;. Taiwan had become the third-largest coffee consumer per capita in Asia, and the average Taiwanese person was drinking 177 cups of coffee per year.

===Kaoliang liquor===
Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor is one of the most popular brands of kaoliang liquor in Taiwan. As its name indicates, it is produced on the island of Kinmen. The mainstays of the range are the standard 58 percent and 38 percent alcohol bottlings. Kinmen&#x27;s kaoliang production traces its roots back to the Chinese Civil War when Chinese nationalist general Hu Lien encouraged Kinmenese farmers to grow sorghum to produce hard liquor as importing alcohol from Taiwan caused financial strain. Kaoliang liquor has become an integral part of Kinmen&#x27;s economy and plays a significant role in the culture of Kinmen.

Yusan Kaoliang Chiew () is produced by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation. It is named after the highest mountain in Taiwan, Yushan. One of the most notable products in the range is an &quot;X.O.&quot; kaoliang aged for five years in tanks before bottling.

Matsu Tunnel 88 Kaoliang Liquor () is produced by the Matsu Distillery in Nangan Township, Lienchiang County. The name is derived from the name of an abandoned military tunnel called Tunnel 88 which the distillery took over as storage space for their kaoliang and aged rice wine. All of the distillery&#x27;s aged kaoliangs are stored in the tunnel for at least five years.

===Rum===
Commercial rum production was introduced into Taiwan along with commercial sugar production during the Japanese colonial period. Rum production continued under the ROC however it was neglected by Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation which held the national liquor monopoly. The industry diversified after democratization and the de-monopolization of the Taiwanese alcoholic beverage industry.

===Tea===

Taiwanese tea is considered among the best in the world and the country has a unique tea culture.

===Whisky===

Taiwan has a young but thriving whisky industry buoyed by a massive domestic market for whisky, especially single malt scotch. Taiwan is the only whisky market which drinks more single malt whisky than blended whisky.

===Wine===

Independent winemaking was illegal in Taiwan for a long time due to the monopoly granted to the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation. Independent winemakers became legal in 2002 and in 2014, a Taiwanese wine won its first gold medal at an international competition. In 2019, a red wine from Taichung was awarded a gold medal at the 25th Vinalies Internationales in France. Two of the most acclaimed wineries are Domaine Shu Sheng and Weightstone Vineyard Estate &amp; Winery. Although it was once largely lost, Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous winemaking culture is staging a comeback.

===Sake===
Sake consumption started during the Japanese colonial period. The first sake was made in Taiwan in 1914, the largest contemporary domestic brand is Yuchun produced by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation. A number of smaller producers also exist with an emphasis placed on unique products made with local rice. Taiwan also imports large amounts of sake from Japan. Its proximity and the volume of the trade allows merchants in Taiwan to stock fresh and limited production sake which is not widely available elsewhere outside Japan.

==Fine dining==

Fine dining in Taiwan is often of a mixed identity. For example, wedding banquets in Taiwan typically feature Japanese sashimi as the first course with traditional Taiwanese and Chinese dishes following. In the 21st century, indigenous ingredients, dishes, and techniques have made their way into high end restaurants.

In 2018, La Liste listed 10 restaurants in Taiwan among the world&#x27;s 1,000 best.

The Michelin Guide began reviewing restaurants in Taipei in 2018 and Taichung in 2020. The 2020 Michelin awarded stars to 30 restaurants in Taiwan, four in Taichung and 26 in Taipei. With three stars, the Cantonese restaurant Le Palais is the country&#x27;s highest rated restaurant. The 2020 list also bestowed the Bib Gourmand on 54 restaurants in Taipei and 21 in Taichung. The expansion of the Michelin Guide to Taiwan increased international recognition for Taiwanese restaurants. In 2023, the Michelin Guide was expanded to Tainan and Kaohsiung.

There are significant differences between the fine dining scenes in Taipei and Taichung. In Taichung, an emphasis is placed on ceremony with large tables and private rooms common, a premium is also placed on parking with restaurants having more than 100 parking spaces. This is due in part to Taichung&#x27;s strong small and medium enterprises as well as a multitude of informal recreational and fraternal organizations. In Taipei, fine dining restaurants and tables are generally smaller with most customers being couples or small groups, in general, service is less formal than in Taichung. In Taipei, there is more international influence in the fine dining scene while Taichung retains a strong affinity with traditional dishes. In the 2010s, fine dining restaurants which more closely followed international trends proliferated in Taichung. Lanshu Chen was particularly important in gaining Taichung international recognition.

==Foreign cuisine in Taiwan==

===Fusion===
Fusion cuisine is very popular in Taiwan. Many Taiwanese dishes are a result of cultural fusion, such as the Taiwanese version of pastel de nata which are a legacy of Portuguese colonialism in neighboring Macao.

===Italian===
Italian cuisine has been popular in Taiwan for a long time, but the country had few authentic Italian restaurants and even fewer Italian chefs until the late 1990s and early 2000s. Due to the financial crisis of 2007–08, a large number of Italians emigrated from Italy to healthier economies. This led to a rapid increase in both the number of Italian restaurants and the number of Italian expats in Taiwan. While most restaurants follow the traditional Italian course style, the meal proportions are influenced by Italian-American cuisine. Taiwanese diners have become increasingly passionate and discerning about Italian cuisine. Michael de Prenda was one of the innovators of Italian cuisine in Taiwan, starting multiple restaurants, a market, and a farm.

==== Pizza ====
Pizza is one of the most popular foods in Taiwan. The first pizza restaurant opened in the 1970s and the industry grew rapidly in the 2000s driven by an increasing demand for quality Italian and American style pizza from an affluent younger generation which had spent time abroad and brought back a taste for it.

Chain pizza restaurants like Pizza Hut and Domino&#x27;s Pizza are known for running promotional pizzas with outrageous toppings like spicy hotpot, cilantro and century egg with pig&#x27;s blood, beef and kiwi, glutinous rice, ramen, and stinky tofu in an attempt to get national and international publicity. Pizza Hut entered the Taiwanese market in 1986 and Domino&#x27;s followed in the late 1980s. In 2022, each company had more than 150 stores in Taiwan.

===Indian===
Historically overseas Chinese from India would travel to Taiwan to learn cooking. Indian restaurants existed in Taiwan, but overall the cuisine was slow to catch on.

Indian food became popular in Taiwan in the 2000s. The number of Indian restaurants has grown along with the growth of the Indian and larger South Asian community in Taiwan, however, most customers in Indian restaurants are local with Indian food also being found in university cafeterias and other institutional settings.

===Russian===
Along with the fleeing KMT came White Russian refugees who had sought shelter from the Russian Revolution in China. George Elsner founded the first Russian restaurant, The Café Astoria, in Taiwan in 1949. The Café Astoria was a center of Russian expat life in Taiwan during its early years. Chiang Ching-kuo and his Russian wife, Faina Vakhreva, often brought their children with them to eat there. Elsner died stateless in Taiwan.

===Nordic===
Nordic haute cuisine is popular in Taiwan&#x27;s major cities, with restaurants offering both authentic Nordic cuisine and Nordic cuisine adapted to local ingredients and tastes.

===Hong Kong===
The increase in immigration from Hong Kong following the pro-democracy protests brought an increased focus on Hong Kong cuisine, along with a fusion between Hong Kong and Taiwan cuisines. Taiwan is considered a safe haven for Hongkongers, with many opening shops and restaurants to serve food they were unable to find in Taiwan, or which they did not feel was up to Hong Kong standards.

===Japanese===
Taiwan, in particularly Taipei, is regarded as having some of the best Japanese food outside of Japan. This is due to the legacy of Japanese colonialism as well as ongoing cultural and commercial exchange.

====Ramen====
Ramen restaurants in Taiwan often create unique and outlandish ramen dishes including durian, whole giant isopod, crocodile leg, and whole frog.

===Burmese===
Burmese and Chinese Burmese restaurants are primarily located in the Little Burma section of Taipei. Chinese Burmese immigration to Taiwan began in the 1950s.

===Chinese===
In the decades since the KMT&#x27;s retreat, these regional dishes have evolved and become part of Taiwanese cuisine.

According to Taiwanese chef Fu Pei-mei, authentic Chinese culinary traditions were properly preserved in Taiwan. This claim to authenticity, common among Fu&#x27;s generation, was in part due to the Kuomintang&#x27;s Chinese nationalist political messaging which extended well beyond cuisine. The authenticity of regional Chinese cuisine in Taiwan has been challenged.

===Singaporean===
Taiwan has a significant Singaporean community. In 2020, the Taichung-based JL Studio from Singaporean chef Jimmy Lim Tyan Yaw was awarded a second Michelin star, becoming the highest rated Singaporean restaurant in the world.

==Taiwanese cuisine abroad==

Taiwanese cuisine has a global presence. Taiwanese chefs have been extremely successful abroad cooking both Taiwanese and international cuisine. Well known chefs include André Chiang.

===Culinary diplomacy===
Along with its semiconductor industry, Taiwan&#x27;s cuisine is one of its most prominent aspects internationally. Taiwan has used culinary diplomacy to bolster its tourism sector and to conduct diplomacy in countries with which it has limited official ties. In 2010, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Economic Affairs launched a £20-million culinary diplomacy campaign called &quot;All in Good Taste: Savor the Flavors of Taiwan&quot;. It promoted Taiwanese venues internationally, sponsored chefs, hosted food festivals and competitions, and emphasized elements such as bubble tea, oyster omelette, and Taiwan&#x27;s night markets. Since 2010, the ministry has sent chefs abroad to promote Taiwanese cuisine.

==== Banquets ====
State banquets have formed an important part of Taiwanese diplomacy since the era of one-party rule by the KMT. General Tso&#x27;s chicken was invented by the KMT&#x27;s head chef Peng Chang-kuei in the 1950s to feed visiting American military dignitaries.

The banquets are meant to present a message to guests and as such dishes and styles have varied over the years under different administrations. There has been an increasing emphasis on serving Taiwanese ingredients cooked in a distinctly Taiwanese style.

===United States===
Taiwanese immigrant restaurateurs were largely responsible for the shift of American Chinese food from Cantonese-focused cuisine to diverse cuisine featuring dishes from many regions in China. The immigration of Taiwanese chefs to the United States began in the 1950s. At the time, cooks in Taiwan were trained in traditional Chinese regional cooking as this fit the chosen identity of the KMT. Taiwanese restaurateurs changed the food landscape of many American cities, including New York City, and pioneered innovations such as picture menus and food delivery. Many of the immigrants to the United States during this period had been born in China and fled to Taiwan with the retreating KMT, particularly former residents of the Dachen Islands who had been evacuated in 1955.

Traditionally, Taiwanese food has been hard to differentiate from Chinese and Japanese food abroad, since many Taiwanese chefs cooked simplified or westernized versions of traditional Taiwanese, Japanese, or Chinese dishes. In 2018, there was a rapid growth in the number of authentic Taiwanese restaurants in New York City and across the country, which coincided with an increased interest in regional Chinese food and in Taiwan itself. Some object to the politically fraught inclusion of Taiwanese cuisine under the banner of regional Chinese food and point out that it is inaccurate.

Taiwanese American cuisine is emerging as a full cuisine in its own right. Myers + Chang in Boston was one of the first restaurants to explicitly describe their food as such. In 2018, James Beard Award-winning chef Stephanie Izard opened a Taiwanese snack/dessert shop in Chicago. Taiwanese cuisine has a significant presence in the San Francisco Bay Area. Most Taiwanese restaurants in the Bay Area are located in the suburbs. Increasing interest in authentic Taiwanese food is coming from ex-pats and second generation Taiwanese Americans.

A Taiwanese American cookbook, &quot;First Generation&quot;, was published by Frankie Gaw in 2022. In 2023, Cathy Erway published &quot;Win Son Presents: A Taiwanese American Cookbook&quot;.

Kato by Chef Jon Yao is a Michelin starred restaurant serving Taiwanese food in Los Angeles.

==Culinary education==
Historically, culinary education was informal with apprentices learning from a master for many years before they practice the craft on their own. The first college level course in cooking was implemented in 1986 at Danshui Technical College.

===Culinary schools===
* Danshui Technical College
* National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism

==Events==
The main cooking show in Taiwan is the Taiwan Culinary Exhibition (TCE). In 2023, the TCE was held at the Taipei World Trade Center the and featured four areas &quot;Gourmet Tastes, Culinary Exploration, Government Pavilion, and Exotic Foods.&quot;

<text>Thai cuisine (, , ) is the national cuisine of Thailand.

Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with aromatics and spicy heat. The Australian chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines, Thai cooking is &quot;about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord it&#x27;s got to have a smooth surface but it doesn&#x27;t matter what&#x27;s happening underneath. Simplicity isn&#x27;t the dictum here, at all.&quot;

Traditional Thai cuisine loosely falls into four categories: &quot;tom&quot; (boiled dishes), &quot;yam&quot; (spicy salads), &quot;tam&quot; (pounded foods), and &quot;kaeng&quot; (curries). Deep-frying, stir-frying and steaming are methods introduced from Chinese cuisine.

In 2011, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the &quot;World&#x27;s 50 Best Foods&quot;, an online poll of 35,000 people worldwide by &quot;CNN Travel&quot;. Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country: tom yum kung (4th), pad thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and nam tok mu (36th).

==History==

===Historical influences===

Thai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand&#x27;s neighbors, especially Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Malaysia and Indonesia, have influenced one another over the course of many centuries.

According to the Thai monk Venerable Buddhadasa Bhikku&#x27;s writing, ‘India&#x27;s Benevolence to Thailand’, Thai cuisine was influenced by Indian cuisine. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use spices in their food in various ways from Indians. Thais also obtained the methods of making herbal medicines from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of the family Guttiferae, panika or harsinghar, phikun or &quot;Mimusops elengi&quot; and bunnak or the rose chestnut etc. were brought from India. According to the book &quot;Mae Khrua Hua Pa&quot; (first published in 1908) by Lady Plian Bhaskarawongse, she found that Thai cuisine had a strong gastronomical cultural line from Sukhothai (1238–1448) through Ayuttthaya (1351–1767) and Thonburi period (1767–1782) vis-à-vis Siamese governmental officers&#x27; daily routines (such as royal cooking) and their related cousins. Thai food during the Thonburi period tended to be more similar to that from the Ayutthaya period, except the addition of Chinese food resulted from her prosperous international trade.

Western influences, starting in 1511 when the first diplomatic mission from the Portuguese arrived at the court of Ayutthaya, have created dishes such as &quot;foi thong&quot;, the Thai adaptation of the Portuguese fios de ovos, and &quot;sangkhaya&quot;, where coconut milk replaces cow&#x27;s milk in making a custard. These dishes were said to have been brought to Thailand in the 17th century by Maria Guyomar de Pinha, a woman of mixed Japanese-Portuguese-Bengali ancestry who was born in Ayutthaya, and became the wife of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adviser to King Narai. The most notable influence from the West must be the introduction of the chili pepper from the Americas in the 16th or 17th century. It, and rice, are now two of the most important ingredients in Thai cuisine. During the Columbian Exchange, Portuguese and Spanish ships brought new foodstuffs from the Americas including tomatoes, corn, papaya, pea eggplants, pineapple, pumpkins, culantro, cashews, and peanuts.

===Regional variations===

Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and ethnicity on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with Shan State in Burma, northern Laos, and also with Yunnan Province in China, whereas the cuisine of Isan (northeastern Thailand) is similar to that of Southern Laos, and by Vietnamese cuisine to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of coconut milk and fresh turmeric, has that in common with Indian, Malaysian, and Indonesian cuisine.

Thai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main regions of Thailand:
* Bangkok: cuisine of the Bangkok metropolitan area, with Teochew and Portuguese influences. In addition, as a capital city, Bangkok cuisine is sometimes influenced by more dedicated royal cuisine. Tastes and looks of food in Bangkok have changed somewhat over time as they have been influenced by other cuisines such as Asian, European or Western countries.
* Central Thai: cuisine of the flat and wet central rice-growing plains, site of the former Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, and the Dvaravati culture of the Mon people from before the arrival of Siamese in the area. Coconut milk is one of major ingredients used in Central Thai cuisine. 
* Isan or Northeastern Thai: cuisine of the more arid Khorat Plateau, influenced by the culture of Laos and also by Khmer cuisine.
* Northern Thai: cuisine of the cooler valleys and forested mountains of the Thai highlands, once ruled by the former Lanna Kingdom and home of Lannaese, the majority of northern Thailand. This cuisine shares many ingredients with Isan.
* Southern Thai: cuisine of the Kra Isthmus which is bordered on two sides by tropical seas, with its many islands and including the ethnic Malay, former Sultanate of Pattani in the deep south. The complex curries, food preparation techniques and usage of chillies and spices in Southern Thai cuisine form a great influence on the whole cuisine in general.

=== Royal cuisine ===
In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the cosmopolitan palace cuisine of the Ayutthaya kingdom (1351–1767 CE). Its refinement, cooking techniques, presentation, and use of ingredients were of great influence to the cuisine of the central Thai plains. Thai royal cuisine has been influenced by the Khmer royal cuisine through the Khmer palace cooks brought to the Ayutthaya Kingdom during its conquests of the Khmer Empire. Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the Rattanakosin Era onwards.

Typically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex and delicate.

La Loubère, an envoy from France during the reign of King Narai, recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. What makes Thai Royal cuisine different food is its beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.

There are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as &quot;ranchuan&quot; curry, &quot;nam phrik long ruea&quot;, &quot;matsaman&quot; curry, rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or &quot;khao chae&quot;, spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.

Thai chef McDang, himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction. He maintains that the only difference between the food of the palace and that of the common people is the former&#x27;s elaborate presentation and better ingredients.

==Serving==
Thai food was traditionally eaten with the hand while seated on mats or carpets on the floor or coffee table in upper middle class families, customs still found in more traditional households. Today, however, most Thais eat with a fork and spoon. Tables and chairs were introduced as part of a broader Westernization drive during the reign of King Mongkut, Rama IV. The fork and spoon were introduced by King Chulalongkorn after his return from a tour of Europe in 1897 CE.

Important to Thai dining is the practice of &quot;khluk&quot;, mixing the flavors and textures of different dishes with the rice from one&#x27;s plate. The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth. A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table. It is common practice for both the Thais and the hill tribe peoples who live in Lanna and Isan to use sticky rice as an edible implement by shaping it into small, and sometimes flattened, balls by hand (and only the right hand by custom) which are then dipped into side dishes and eaten.

Chopsticks were foreign utensils to most ethnic groups in Thailand with the exception of the Thai Chinese, and a few other cultures such as the Akha people, who are recent arrivals from Yunnan Province, China. Traditionally, the majority of ethnic Thai people ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at Chinese, Japanese, or Korean restaurants. Stir-fried noodle dishes such as drunken noodles, &quot;pad see ew&quot;, and pad thai, and curry-noodle dishes such as &quot;khanom chin nam ngiao&quot;, are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.

Thai meals typically consist of rice (&quot;khao&quot; in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (&quot;khrueang chim&quot;) is the most crucial component of any Thai meal. &quot;Khrueang chim&quot;, considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy chili sauce or relish called &quot;nam phrik&quot; (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called &quot;lon&quot;. The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy &quot;tom yam&quot; or a mellow &quot;tom chuet&quot;), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the &quot;kaeng&quot; prefix), a deep-fried dish, and a stir-fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.

In most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces (&quot;nam chim&quot;) and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include &quot;phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik&quot; (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes, sweet chili sauce, sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as &quot;khao kha mu&quot; (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole Thai peppers and raw garlic are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a garnish, especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the &quot;khanom chin&quot; (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy Thai curry or stir-fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.

When time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or more smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called &quot;khao rat kaeng&quot; (), or for short &quot;khao kaeng&quot; (). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing an order at these places, Thais will state if they want the food served as separate dishes or together on one plate with rice (&quot;rat khao&quot;). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made &quot;rice curry&quot; dishes on their menu for single customers.

==Ingredients==

Thai cuisine, as a whole, features many different ingredients (&quot;suan phasom&quot;; ), and ways of preparing food. Thai chef McDang characterises Thai food as having &quot;intricacy, attention to detail, texture, color, and taste.

Thai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemongrass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain &quot;Borassus&quot; palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat, lamb, and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais in Southern Thailand. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s. Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish play an important role in the diet of Thai people. In 2006 the per capita consumption of fish was 33.6 kg. Anna Leonowens (of &quot;The King and I&quot; fame) observed in her book &quot;The English Governess at the Siamese Court&quot; (1870):

&quot;The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its &quot;platoo&quot;, a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer&#x27;s bowl of rice.&quot;
Freshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the giant river prawn, need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature. Aquaculture of species such as Nile tilapia, catfish, tiger prawns, and blood cockles, now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand.

=== Rice, noodles and starches ===

Like most other Asian cuisines, rice is the staple grain of Thai cuisine. According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same: &quot;khao&quot;. As in many other rice eating cultures, to say &quot;eat rice&quot; (in Thai &quot;kin khao&quot;, ) means to eat food.
Rice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is &quot;kin khao rue yang?&quot; ().

Thai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice. That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.

Non-glutinous rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) is called &quot;khao chao&quot; (). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling jasmine rice (&quot;&quot;). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the patchwork of paddy fields that blanket Thailand&#x27;s central plains. Once the rice is steamed or cooked, it is called &quot;khao suai&quot; (). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for congee, of which there are three main varieties: &quot;khao tom&quot; (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish), &quot;khao tom kui&quot; (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or &quot;chok&quot; (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).

Other varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include: sticky rice (&quot;khao niao&quot;), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Thai Red Cargo rice, an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and is slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.

Noodles in Thailand are usually made from the flour of rice, wheat, or mung bean. Perhaps one of the oldest type of noodle in Thailand is &quot;khanom chin&quot;, which is a fresh type of rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with toppings like green curry (&quot;kaeng khiao wan&quot;) with chicken or in green papaya salad (&quot;som tam&quot;). Other noodle varieties were subsequently introduced by Chinese migrants to Thailand, as is testified by their Sino-Thai name &quot;kuaitiao&quot; (; ). The three most common rice varieties of &quot;kuaitiao&quot; are &quot;sen yai&quot; () wide flat noodles, &quot;sen lek&quot; () narrow flat noodles, and &quot;sen mi&quot; ; or rice vermicelli), which are round and thin. A fourth popular variety, &quot;bami&quot; (; ) is made from egg and wheat flour and is usually sold fresh. &quot;Bami&quot; are similar to the Teochew &quot;mee pok&quot;. A fifth type, &quot;wun sen&quot; (; ), called cellophane noodles or glass noodles in English, are thin round noodles made from mung bean flour which are sold dried. Lastly, and least common in noodle shops, are &quot;silver needle noodles&quot; &quot;kiam-i&quot; (), a somewhat thick round rice noodle similar in size and shape to bean sprouts. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like pad thai or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.

Rice flour (&quot;paeng khao chao&quot;) and tapioca flour (&quot;paeng man sampalang&quot;) are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.

===Pastes and sauces===
An ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is &quot;nam pla&quot;, a clear fish sauce that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is &quot;pla ra&quot;. It is more pungent than &quot;nam pla&quot;, and, in contrast to &quot;nam pla&quot;, which is a clear liquid, &quot;pla ra&quot; is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a &quot;som tam&quot; (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. &quot;Kapi&quot;, Thai shrimp paste, is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called &quot;nam phrik kapi&quot;, in rice dishes such as &quot;khao khluk kapi&quot; and it is indispensable for making Thai curry pastes. &quot;Tai pla&quot; is a pungent sauce used in the southern Thai cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the short mackerel (&quot;pla thu&quot;). It is one of the main condiments of &quot;kaeng tai pla&quot; curry and is also used to make &quot;nam phrik tai pla&quot;. Far removed from the nearest sea, from northern Thailand comes &quot;nam pu&quot;, a thick, black paste made by boiling mashed rice-paddy crabs for hours. It is used as an ingredient for certain northern Thai salads, curries, and chili pastes. It too has a strong and pungent flavor.


&quot;Nam phrik&quot; are Thai chili pastes, similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian sambals. Each region has its own special versions. The words &quot;nam phrik&quot; are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called &quot;nam chim&quot;. Thai curry pastes are normally called &quot;phrik kaeng&quot; or &quot;khrueang kaeng&quot; (lit. curry ingredients), but some people also use the word &quot;nam phrik&quot; to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called &quot;phrik kaeng phet&quot; or &quot;khrueang kaeng phet&quot; in Thai, but also &quot;nam phrik kaeng phet&quot;. Both &quot;nam phrik&quot; and &quot;phrik kaeng&quot; are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a mortar and pestle. Some &quot;nam phrik&quot; are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is &quot;nam phrik num&quot;, a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called &quot;nam phrik phao&quot; is often used as an ingredient in &quot;tom yam&quot; or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy &quot;jam&quot; on bread, or served as a dip with prawn crackers. The dry &quot;nam phrik kung&quot;, made with pounded dried shrimp (&quot;kung haeng&quot;), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat Simon de la Loubère observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for &quot;nam phrik&quot; with &quot;pla ra&quot; and onions in &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot;, an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691.

The soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially) loanwords from the Teochew dialect: &quot;si-io dam&quot; (black soy sauce), &quot;si-io khao&quot; (light soy sauce), &quot;si-io wan&quot; (sweet soy sauce), and &quot;taochiao&quot; (fermented whole soy beans). &quot;Namman hoi&quot; (oyster sauce) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.

Satay is also common in Thailand, grilled or skewered meat served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce made from roasted or fried peanuts.

===Vegetables, herbs and spices===
Thai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of kaffir lime leaves (&quot;bai makrut&quot;) appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour &quot;tom yam&quot;) or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai lime (&quot;manao&quot;) is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with galangal (&quot;kha&quot;) and lemongrass (&quot;takhrai&quot;), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh Thai basil, distinctively redolent of cloves, and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as green curry. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include &quot;phak chi&quot;, (coriander or cilantro leaves), &quot;rak phak chi&quot; (cilantro/coriander roots), spearmint (&quot;saranae&quot;), holy basil (&quot;kaphrao&quot;), ginger (&quot;khing&quot;), turmeric (&quot;khamin&quot;), fingerroot (&quot;krachai&quot;), culantro (&quot;phak chi farang&quot;), pandanus leaves (&quot;bai toei&quot;), and Thai lemon basil (&quot;maenglak&quot;). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include &quot;phong phalo&quot; (five-spice powder), &quot;phong kari&quot; (curry powder), and fresh and dried peppercorns (&quot;phrik thai&quot;). Northern Thai &quot;larb&quot; uses a very elaborate spice mix, called &quot;phrik lap&quot;, which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon.

Besides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as &quot;cha-om&quot;, the young feathery leaves of the &quot;Acacia pennata&quot; tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads. Banana leaves are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in &quot;ho mok pla&quot;, a spicy steamed pâté or soufflé made with fish and coconut milk. Banana flowers are also used in Thai salads or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the neem tree (&quot;sadao&quot;) are also eaten blanched. &quot;Phak lueat&quot; (leaves from the &quot;Ficus virens&quot;) are cooked in curries, and &quot;bai makok&quot; (from the &quot;Spondias mombin&quot;) can be eaten raw with a chili paste.

Five main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about ) and is known as the hottest chili: &quot;phrik khi nu suan&quot; (&quot;garden mouse-dropping chili&quot;). The slightly larger chili &quot;phrik khi nu&quot; (&quot;mouse-dropping chili&quot;) is the next hottest. The green or red &quot;phrik chi fa&quot; (&quot;sky pointing chili&quot;) is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large &quot; phrik yuak&quot;, which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies: &quot;phrik haeng&quot; are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.

Other typical ingredients are the several types of eggplant (&quot;makhuea&quot;) used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized &quot;makhuea phuang&quot; and the egg-sized &quot;makhuea suai&quot;, often also eaten raw. Although broccoli is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in &quot;phat phak ruam&quot; (stir fried mixed vegetables) and &quot;rat na&quot; (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand, khana is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are &quot;thua fak yao&quot; (yardlong beans), &quot;thua ngok&quot; (bean sprouts), &quot;no mai&quot; (bamboo shoots), tomatoes, cucumbers, &quot;phak tam lueng&quot; (&quot;Coccinia grandis&quot;), &quot;phak kha na&quot; (Chinese kale), &quot;phak kwangtung&quot; (choy sum), sweet potatoes (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of squash, &quot;phak krathin&quot; (&quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;), &quot;sato&quot; (&quot;Parkia speciosa&quot;), &quot;tua phū&quot; (winged beans) and &quot;khaophot&quot; (corn).

Among the green, leafy vegetables and herbs that are usually eaten raw in a meal or as a side dish in Thailand, the most important are: &quot;phak bung&quot; (morning glory), &quot;horapha&quot; (Thai basil), &quot;bai bua bok&quot; (Asian pennywort), &quot;phak kachet&quot; (water mimosa), &quot;phak kat khao&quot; (Chinese cabbage), &quot;phak phai&quot; (praew leaves), &quot;phak kayang&quot; (rice paddy herb), &quot;phak chi farang&quot; (culantro), &quot;phak tiu&quot; (&quot;Cratoxylum formosum&quot;), &quot;phak &quot;phaai&quot;&quot; (yellow burr head) and &quot;kalamplī&quot; (cabbage). Some of these leaves are highly perishable and must be used within a couple of days.

Several types of mushroom (&quot;het&quot;) also feature in Thai cuisine such as straw mushrooms (&quot;het fang&quot;), shiitake (&quot;het hom&quot;), and white jelly fungus (&quot;het hu nu khao&quot;).

Flowers are also commonly used ingredients in many Thai dishes, either as a vegetable, such as &quot;dok khae&quot; (&quot;Sesbania grandiflora&quot;) and &quot;huapli&quot; (the flower bud of the banana), or as a food coloring, such as with the blue-colored &quot;dok anchan&quot; (the flowers of the &quot;Clitoria ternatea&quot;, which can also be eaten raw or fried).

===Fruits===
Fresh fruit forms a large part of the Thai diet, and are customarily served after a meal as dessert. The Scottish author John Crawfurd, sent on an embassy to Bangkok in 1822, writes in his account of the journey:

&quot;The fruits of Siam, or at least of the neighbourhood of Bangkok, are excellent and various, surpassing, according to the experience of our party (...) those of all other parts of India.&quot; The Siamese themselves consume great quantities of fruit, and the whole neighbourhood of Bangkok is one forest of fruit trees.

Fruit is not only eaten on its own, but often served with spicy dips made from sugar, salt, and chilies. Fruits feature in spicy salads such as &quot;som tam&quot; (green papaya salad) and &quot;yam som-o&quot; (pomelo salad), in soups with tamarind juice such as &quot;tom khlong&quot; and &quot;kaeng som&quot;, and in Thai curries such as &quot;kaeng khanun&quot; (jackfruit curry), &quot;kaeng phet pet yang&quot; (grilled duck curry with pineapple or grapes), and &quot;kaeng pla sapparot&quot; (fish and pineapple curry). Fruits are also used in certain Thai chili pastes, such as in &quot;nam phrik long rue&quot; made with &quot;madan&quot; (a close relative of the mangosteen), and &quot;nam phrik luk namliap&quot;, salted black Chinese olive chilli paste.

Although many of the exotic fruits of Thailand may have been sometimes unavailable in Western countries, Asian markets now import such fruits as rambutan and lychees. In Thailand one can find papaya, jackfruit, mango, mangosteen, langsat, longan, pomelo, pineapple, rose apples, durian, Burmese grapes and other native fruits. Chanthaburi in Thailand each year holds the &quot;World Durian Festival&quot; in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand and a quarter of the world production. The &quot;Langsat Festival&quot; is held each year in Uttaradit on weekends in September. The &quot;langsat&quot; (&quot;Lansium parasiticum&quot;), for which Uttaradit is famous, is a fruit that is similar in taste to the longan.

From the coconut comes coconut milk, used both in curries and desserts, and coconut oil. The juice of a green coconut can be served as a drink and the young flesh is eaten in either sweet or savory dishes. The grated flesh of a mature coconut is used raw or toasted in sweets, salads and snacks such as &quot;miang kham&quot;. Thais not only consume products derived from the nut (actually a drupe), but they also make use of the growth bud of the palm tree as a vegetable. From the stalk of the flowers comes a sap that can be used to make coconut vinegar, alcoholic beverages, and sugar. Coconut milk and other coconut-derived ingredients feature heavily in the cuisines of central and southern Thailand. In contrast to these regions, coconut palms do not grow as well in northern and northeastern Thailand, where in wintertime the temperatures are lower and where there is a dry season that can last five to six months. In northern Thai cuisine, only a few dishes, most notably the noodle soup &quot;khao soi&quot;, use coconut milk. In the southern parts of northeastern Thailand, where the region borders Cambodia, one can again find dishes containing coconut. It is also here that the people eat non-glutinous rice, just as in central and southern Thailand, and not glutinous rice as they do in northern Thailand and in the rest of northeastern Thailand.

Apples, pears, peaches, grapes, and strawberries, which do not traditionally grow in Thailand and in the past had to be imported, have become increasingly popular in the last few decades since they were introduced to Thai farmers by the Thai Royal Projects, starting in 1969, and the Doi Tung Project since 1988. These temperate fruit grow especially well in the cooler, northern Thai highlands, where they were initially introduced as a replacement for the cultivation of opium, together with other crops such as cabbages, tea, and arabica coffee.

===Food controversies===

====Agricultural chemicals====

According to the Thai government&#x27;s &quot;The Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (2012–2016)&quot;, Thailand is number one in the world in the application of chemicals in agriculture. The report stated that, &quot;The use of chemicals in the agricultural and industrial sectors is growing while control mechanisms are ineffective making Thailand rank first in the world in the use of registered chemicals in agriculture.&quot;

The Thai Pesticide Alert Network (ThaiPAN), a food safety advocacy group, annually tests Thai farm produce for contamination. In their June 2019 report, the group found that of 286 samples, 41% of produce was found to contain unsafe levels of chemicals. The group surveyed both wet markets and retail stores across the nation. Contaminants were found in 44% of samples from retail stores, and 39% of samples from wet markets. Vegetables with the highest levels of contamination were Chinese mustard greens, kale, hot basil, parsley, chilis, and cauliflower. Fruits with the highest contamination were tangerines, rose apples, guavas, and grapes. Contamination levels decreased from 2018, when 46% of samples were found to be contaminated, and 2016, when more than 50% of tested produce was found to be unsafe.

In prior years, &quot;Q-Mark&quot; goods showed a higher prevalence of contamination, 61.5%, than they did during ThaiPAN&#x27;s March 2016 survey, 57%. Q-Mark is Thailand&#x27;s National Bureau of Agricultural Commodity and Food Standards (ACFS) mark of quality.

In a survey of hydroponically-grown vegetables, ThaiPAN, in late-2017, tested 30 hydroponic vegetables purchased at Thai fresh markets and supermarkets. Of 30 vegetables tested, 19 contained noxious chemical levels above maximum limits. Three samples were contaminated, but at levels below the legal maximum. Eight samples were free of harmful chemicals.

On 22 October 2019, the 26-member National Hazardous Substances Committee (NHSC) changed paraquat, glyphosate, and chlorpyrifos from Type 3 toxic substances to Type 4, effectively prohibiting their production, import, export, or possession. Their use will be prohibited as of 1 December 2019. On 27 November 2019, the NHSC amended that timetable, moving the date for the ban of paraquat and chlorpyrifos to 1 June 2020. They lifted the ban on glyphosate with restrictions on usage: glyphosate will be used only on six major crops: corn, cassava, sugarcane, rubber, oil palms, and fruit. It is not permitted in watershed areas and other sensitive environment zones, and farmers must submit proof of use including the type of crops and the size of their farms when purchasing glyphosate. Industry Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit, who chairs the NHSC, said the committee reached its decision after reviewing information provided by the Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Public Health. NCHS member Jirapon Limpananon, chair of the Pharmacy Council of Thailand, announced her resignation from the NCHS Wednesday night following the meeting.

====Misrepresentation====
* In September 2016, a shipment of pork labelled &quot;halal&quot;—a permissible food for Muslims—was delivered to a hotel in Krabi Province. The Central Islamic Committee of Thailand (CICOT) denounced the use of a halal-certified logo on pork, saying it will take legal action against people responsible. The committee found the halal label to be fake. Under Thai laws, CICOT is responsible for certifying halal products.
* A survey of the quality of fish sauce sold across Thailand reported that just over one-third of the samples were not up to standards set by the Public Health Ministry. The three-year survey, from 2012 to 2015, involved 1,121 samples of fish sauce sold under 422 brands from 245 manufacturers. Of the total analysed, 410 samples, or 36.5 percent, did not meet the standard. The major reasons for the substandard fish sauce were low nitrogen readings and the ratio of glutamic acid to nitrogen either higher or lower than the required standards.

==Representative dishes==

Whereas many Thai dishes are now familiar in the West, the vast majority are not. In many of the dishes below, different kinds of protein, or combinations of protein, are interchangeable as the main ingredient. Beef (&quot;nuea&quot;), chicken (&quot;kai&quot;), pork (&quot;mu&quot;), duck (&quot;pet&quot;), tofu (&quot;taohu&quot;), fish (&quot;pla&quot;), prawns or shrimp (&quot;kung&quot;), crab (&quot;pu&quot;), shellfish (&quot;hoi&quot;), or egg (&quot;khai&quot;) can, for example, all be used as main ingredients for &quot;kaeng phet&quot; (red curry). Thus &quot;kaeng phet kai&quot; is red curry with chicken and &quot;kaeng phet mu&quot; is red curry made with pork.

===Breakfast dishes===

Khao chao (; ), breakfast dishes, for Thais are limited. Very often, a Thai breakfast can consist of the same dishes with rice which are also eaten for lunch or dinner. Single dishes such as fried rice, noodle soups, and steamed rice with something simple such as an omelette, fried/grilled pork or chicken, or a stir fry with vegetables, are commonly sold for breakfast from street stalls as a quick take-out.

The following dishes are viewed as being specific breakfast dishes but they can also be found at any other moment of the day:

===Central Thai shared dishes===
Ahan Phak Klang (; ) is most often eaten with the non-glutinous jasmine rice. Due to the extensive, centuries-long contact between Ayutthaya Kingdom and Khmer Empire, the flavour principles of many Central Thai dishes, such as sour fish soups, stews and coconut-based curries, including steamed curries, are almost identical to that of Cambodian cuisine, with the notable exception of Central Thai dishes containing much more chilli and sugar.

* &quot;Chuchi pla kaphong&quot; – snapper in &quot;chuchi&quot; curry sauce (thick red curry sauce)

* &quot;Yam pla duk fu&quot; – crispy fried catfish with a spicy, sweet-and-sour, green mango salad.

===Northeastern shared dishes===

Ahan Isan (; ) generally features dishes similar to those found in Laos, as Isan people historically have close ties with Lao culture and speak a language that is generally mutually intelligible with the Lao language. The staple food of Isan is glutinous rice and most of the Isan food is spicy and cooked with local ingredients found on the farms all through northeastern Thailand. Isan people primarily get their income from farming. Rice, sugar cane, pineapple, potato, and rubber are all farmed in this region.

* &quot;Kaeng khae hoi&quot; (snail curry) – &quot;Kaeng khae hoi&quot; or &quot;kaeng khao khua hoi&quot; requires the same ingredients as kaeng khae except for using snails instead of chicken. Roasted ground rice thickens the liquid.

* &quot;Yam phak kum dong&quot; (pickled phak kum leaf) – The greens of phak kum have to be pickled for at least three days the same way as pickling mustard greens (phak kat). This recipe calls for roasted dried chilies.
* &quot;Nam tok mu&quot; – made with pork (mu) or beef (nuea) and somewhat identical to &quot;Lap&quot;, except that the pork or beef is cut into thin strips rather than minced.
* &quot;No o&quot; (pickled bamboo shoots) – No o refers to bamboo shoots that have a strong smell by the process of quick pickling (2–3 days). Some recipes pickle the shoots with the peels and take off the peel just before boiling. Boiling should be rather long for a good result.
* &quot;Namphrik maeng chon&quot; (mola crickets and chili dip) – This kind of chili dish is rather dry and very thick. Use fresh chilies of any kind. Other kinds of edible insects or larvae can be used instead of mola crickets which will be called by the name of the insects used as the main ingredients such as wasp, grasshopper, or bee larvae (namphrik to, namphrik taen and namphrik phueng).
* &quot;Khai mot daeng&quot; – ant eggs – clean and high in protein nutrients. Red ants eat mango leaves so their bodies taste like a squirt of lime, but their fresh eggs are fatty and sweet.

* &quot;Nam phrik pla – fish chili sauce&quot; – Namphrik pla or fish chili sauce can be a little thick or thin depending on the amount of liquid from the boiling fish one puts in it. Grilled fish can be used instead of boiled fish. Any kinds of fresh chilies can be used from mild to the hottest kinds to suit one&#x27;s taste. It goes well with water clover, tips of lead tree greens, or crispy eggplant.
* &quot;Nam phrik ong&quot; – resembling a thick Bolognese sauce, it is made with dried chilies, minced pork, fermented soy beans, and tomato; eaten with steamed and raw vegetables, and sticky rice.

===Southern shared dishes===


Ahan Phak Tai (; ) shares certain dishes with the cuisine of northern Malaysia. Southern Thais, just like the people of central Thailand to the north, and the people of Malaysia to the south, eat non-glutinous rice as their staple food.

* &quot;Kaeng matsaman&quot; – known in English as &quot;Massaman curry&quot;, is an Indian-Malay style curry of stewed beef containing roasted dried spices, such as coriander seeds, that are rarely found in other Thai curries. In 2011 CNNGo ranked massaman as number one in an article titled World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods.
* &quot;Kaeng som&quot; (southern Thai name) or &quot;kaeng lueang&quot; (central Thai name) – a sour curry with fish, vegetables or fruit, deriving its acidity from the use of tamarind juice.

* &quot;Bai liang phat khai&quot; – or &quot;Gnetum gnemon&quot; is native to Southeast Asia. It is widely used in Thai. &quot;Bai liang&quot; tastes sweet and a bit greasy, not rank and bitter like other species. It is commonly eaten as a vegetable with chili sauce and used to make a variety of dishes such as stir-fry with red curry. A popular dish is stir-fried with eggs called &quot;Bai liang phat khai&quot;.

==Desserts and sweets==

===Ice cream===
Ice cream was introduced to Thailand during the reign of King Rama V when the first ice cream machine was imported to Thailand. Ice cream in the second half of the 19th century was made of coconut water blended with ice. At first, ice could not be produced in Thailand. That led to importing ice from Singapore. Ice cream was then an upper-class treat, but over time ice cream became more widely available and the product was improved by replacing coconut water with coconut milk.

There were two types of ice cream in Thailand. First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream &quot;tube&quot; was born during the reign of Rama VII. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice cream cold. Eventually, ice cream was manufactured and sold in small cups.

According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, &quot;aitim tat&quot; (; &quot;cut ice cream&quot;), was very popular 30 years ago (1986). It came in rectangular bars of various flavors, sliced into pieces by the vendor, who then inserted two wooden sticks into the pieces to use as holders. &quot;Aitim tat&quot; was made from milk, coconut milk, flour, sugar, and artificial flavour. The price was one or two baht, depending on the size.

The Pop Company in the 1970s set up the first ice-cream manufacturing plant in Thailand. The company used a duck logo, resulting it the nickname &quot;aitim tra pet&quot; (; &quot;duck brand ice cream&quot;). It was sold in front of Chaloemchai Theater. Its most popular offering was called &quot;banana split&quot;, with three flavors of ice cream, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.

==Beverages==
Khrueang duem (; )
* &quot;Cha yen&quot; – Thai iced tea.
* &quot;Krating Daeng&quot; – an energy drink and the origin of Red Bull.
* &quot;Nam maphrao&quot; – the juice of a young coconut, often served inside the coconut.
* &quot;Nam matum&quot; – a refreshing and healthy drink made from the fruit of the Bael tree.
* &quot;Nom yen&quot; – a drink made from sala syrup and hot milk.
* &quot;Oliang&quot; – a sweet Thai black iced coffee.
* &quot;Lao Khao&quot; – a traditional distilled spirits, since Ayutthaya period, which perhaps give origin to Okinawa liquor called Awamori.
* &quot;Satho&quot; – a traditional rice wine from the Isan region.
* &quot;Nam bai bua bok&quot; – A refreshing and healthy drink is made from the green leaf of the &quot;Centella asiatica&quot;.

Other alcoholic beverages from Thailand include Hong Thong, Phraya, Regency, Mekhong and Sang Som. Several brands of beer are brewed in Thailand; the two most prominent brands are Singha and Chang.

==Insects==

Edible insects, whole or in chili paste and as ingredients in fortified products, are common in Thailand. Some claim that Thailand is the world leader in edible insects. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that there are about 20,000 cricket farms alone in 53 of Thailand&#x27;s 76 provinces.

A wide range of insects are eaten in Thailand, especially in Isan and in the north. Many markets in Thailand sell deep-fried grasshoppers, crickets (&quot;ching-rit&quot;), bee larvae, silkworm (&quot;non mai&quot;), ant eggs (&quot;khai mot&quot;) and termites. The culinary creativity even extends to naming: one tasty larva, which is also known under the name &quot;bamboo worm&quot; (&quot;non mai phai&quot;, &quot;Omphisa fuscidentalis&quot;), is colloquially called &quot;express train&quot; (&quot;rot duan&quot;) due to its appearance.

Most insects reportedly taste fairly bland when deep-fried. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the &quot;maeng da&quot; or &quot;maelong da na&quot; (&quot;Lethocerus indicus&quot;) has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very ripe gorgonzola cheese. This giant water bug is famously used in a chili dip called &quot;nam phrik maeng da&quot;. Ant eggs and silkworms are eaten boiled in a soup in Isan, or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand.

==Street food, food courts, and market food==
The street food culture of much of Southeast Asia was introduced by Chinese immigrants during the late 19th century. As a result, many Thai street foods are derived from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine. Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the early 1960s, when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the street food culture, and by the 1970s, it had &quot;displaced home-cooking.&quot;

The quality and choice of street food in Thailand is world-renowned. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best street food cities in the world, and even called the street food capital of the world. The website VirtualTourist says: &quot;Few places in the world, if any, are as synonymous with street food as Thailand. For the variety of locations and abundance of options, we selected Bangkok, Thailand, as our number one spot for street food. Bangkok is notable for both its variety of offerings and the city&#x27;s abundance of street hawkers.&quot;

There is scarcely a Thai dish that is not sold by a street vendor or at a market somewhere in Thailand. Some specialize in only one or two dishes; others offer a complete menu that rival that of restaurants. Some sell only pre-cooked foods, while others make food to order. Foods that are made to order tend to be dishes that can be quickly prepared: quick stir fries with rice, such as &quot;phat kaphrao&quot; (spicy basil-fried minced pork, chicken, or seafood) or &quot;phat khana&quot; (stir fried gailan) and quick curries such as &quot;pladuk phat phet&quot; (catfish fried with red curry paste).

Noodles are a popular street food item as they are mainly eaten as a single dish. Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles (&quot;khanom chin&quot;), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand, you will see &quot;som tam&quot; (green papaya salad) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken, but if the shop does not sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet &quot;roti&quot;, a thin, flat fried dough envelope, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The &quot;roti&quot; is similar to the Malay &quot;roti canai&quot; and Singaporean &quot;roti prata&quot;, and the stalls are often operated by Thai Muslims. Sweets snacks, collectively called &quot;khanom&quot;, such as &quot;tako&quot; (coconut cream jelly), &quot;khanom man&quot; (coconut cassava cake), and &quot;khanom wun&quot; (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as &quot;khanom bueang&quot; and &quot;khanom krok&quot; (somewhat similar to Dutch &quot;poffertjes&quot;), are made to order.

In the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling &quot;kap klaem&quot; (&quot;drinking food&quot;). Popular &quot;kap klaem&quot; dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness. &quot;Salapao&quot;, steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed &quot;baozi&quot;, are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.

Food markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.

The dishes sold at wet markets in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and foam food containers, to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.

==Vegetarianism in Thailand==

Although the Vegetarian Festival is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand&#x27;s population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand. All traditionally made Thai curries, for instance, contain shrimp paste, and fish sauce is used as salt in many Thai dishes. At shops and restaurants that specifically cater to vegetarians, substitutes for these ingredients are used. Meat dishes are also commonly part of the alms offered to Buddhist monks in Thailand, as vegetarianism is not considered obligatory in Theravada Buddhism, but having an animal killed specifically to feed Buddhist monks is prohibited.

In most towns and cities, traditional Buddhist vegetarian fare, without any meat or seafood products of any kind and also excluding certain strong tasting vegetables and spices, is sold at specialized vegetarian restaurants which can be recognized by a yellow sign with in Thai script the word &quot;che&quot; () or &quot;ahan che&quot; () written on it in red. These restaurants serve what can be regarded as vegan food. Many Indian restaurants of the sizable Thai-Indian community will also have vegetarian dishes on offer, due to the fact that vegetarianism is held as an ideal by many followers of the Hindu faith. Indian vegetarian cuisine can incorporate dairy products and honey. Due to the increased demand for vegetarian food from foreign tourists, many hotels, guesthouses and restaurants that cater to them will now also have vegetarian versions of Thai dishes on their menu. Pescatarians would have very few problems with Thai cuisine due to the abundance of Thai dishes which only contain fish and seafood as their source of animal protein.

==Culinary diplomacy==
Thai cuisine only became well-known worldwide from the 1960s on, when Thailand became a destination for international tourism and US troops arrived in large numbers during the Vietnam War. The number of Thai restaurants went up from four in the 1970s London to between two and three hundred in less than 25 years. The earliest attested Thai restaurant in the United States, &quot;Chada Thai&quot;, opened its doors in 1959 in Denver, Colorado. It was run by the former newspaper publisher Lai-iad (Lily) Chittivej. The oldest Thai restaurant in London, &quot;The Bangkok Restaurant&quot;, was opened in 1967 by Mr and Mrs Bunnag, a former Thai diplomat and his wife, in South Kensington.

The global popularity of Thai cuisine is seen as an important factor in promoting tourism, and also increased exports of Thailand&#x27;s agricultural sector. From the 2000s, it was developed as a deliberate gastrodiplomacy. The Thaksin administration (2001–2006) launched the &quot;Kitchen of the World&quot; campaign early in its tenure to promote Thai cuisine internationally, with a yearly budget of 500 million baht. It provided loans and training for restaurateurs seeking to establish Thai restaurants overseas; established the &quot;Thai Select&quot; certification program which encouraged the use of ingredients imported from Thailand; and promoted integration between Thai investors, Thai Airways, and the Tourism Authority of Thailand with Thai restaurants overseas.

The &quot;Global Thai&quot; program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously. By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.

The program was explained in &quot;Thailand: Kitchen of the World&quot;, an e-book published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: &quot;In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide.&quot;

The Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Commerce offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different &quot;master restaurant&quot; types—from fast food to elegant—which investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan. Concomitantly, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants.

One survey conducted in 2003 by the Kellogg School of Management and Sasin Institute showed that Thai cuisine ranked fourth when people were asked to name an ethnic cuisine, after Italian, French, and Chinese cuisine. When asked &quot;what is your favourite cuisine?&quot;, Thailand&#x27;s cuisine came in at sixth place, behind the three aforementioned cuisines, and Indian and Japanese cuisine.

In June 2009, the Tourism Authority of Thailand organised a conference to discuss these matters at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre in Bangkok. TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said, &quot;This conference was long overdue. The promotion of Thai cuisine is one of our major niche-market targets. Our figures show that visitors spent 38.8 billion baht on eating and drinking last year, up 16% over 1997.&quot;

In the list of the &quot;World&#x27;s 50 most delicious foods&quot;, compiled by CNN in 2011, &quot;som tam&quot; stands at place 46, &quot;nam tok mu&quot; at 19, &quot;tom yam kung&quot; at 8, and massaman curry stands on first place as most delicious food in the world. In a reader&#x27;s poll held a few months later by CNN, &quot;Nam tok mu&quot; came in at 36, Thai fried rice at 24, green curry at 19, &quot;massaman&quot; curry at 10, and Thai &quot;som tam&quot;, pad thai, and &quot;tom yam kung&quot; at six, five, and four.

In 2012, the British &quot;Restaurant Magazine&quot; included Nahm Bangkok of chef David Thompson in its yearly list of The World&#x27;s 50 Best Restaurants.

==Awards==
Thai chefs of the Thailand Culinary Academy took second place in the Gourmet Team Challenge (Practical) of the FHC China International Culinary Arts Competition 14 in Shanghai, China on 14–16 November 2012. They won the IKA Culinary Olympic 2012 competition held in Erfurt, Germany between 5–10 October 2012, where they received four gold and one silver medal.

In 2011, the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef in the Northwestern United States, was presented to Andy Ricker of restaurant &quot;Pok Pok&quot; in Portland, Oregon, and for Best Chef in the Southwestern United States to Saipin Chutima of restaurant &quot;Lotus of Siam&quot; in Winchester, Nevada.

===Michelin stars===
Three restaurants that specialize in Thai cuisine, but are owned by non-Thai chefs, have received Michelin stars:

* 2002 – 2011 &quot;Nahm&quot; in London, run by chef David Thompson
* 2009 – &quot;Kiin Kiin&quot; in Copenhagen, run by chef Henrik Yde-Andersen and Lertchai Treetawatchaiwong
* 2015 – &quot;Pok Pok NY&quot; in New York City, run by chef Andy Ricker

==Culinary tours and cooking courses==

Culinary tours of Thailand have gained popularity in recent years. Alongside other forms of tourism in Thailand, food tours have carved a niche for themselves. Many companies offer culinary and cooking tours of Thailand and many tourists visiting Thailand attend cooking courses offered by hotels, guesthouses and cooking schools.

==Governmental interventions==
The Thai government believes that a substandard Thai restaurant meal served abroad &quot;...sabotages the country&#x27;s reputation.&quot; To ensure the quality of Thai food abroad, the government has over the years initiated a series of programs designed to create universal standards for Thai food.

In 2003 the Ministry of Finance sent officials to the US to award certificates to deserving restaurants. On their return the project was abandoned.

Soon thereafter, the Ministry of Labor created &quot;Krua Thai Su Krua Lok&quot; (&#x27;Thai kitchen goes global&#x27;). Its centerpiece was a 10-day Thai cooking course for those who wanted to prepare Thai food overseas. The effort was short-lived.

After some officials had a bad Thai meal abroad, in 2013 the Yingluck administration had the idea of standardising Thai food everywhere. The National Food Institute (NFI) came up with a program called &quot;Rod Thai Tae&quot; (&#x27;authentic Thai taste&#x27;). A parallel effort was called the &quot;Thai Delicious&quot; project.

===Thai Delicious project===
Thailand&#x27;s National Innovation Agency (NIA), a public organization under the Thai Ministry of Science and Technology, spearheaded a 30 million baht (US$1 million), effort by the government to:

* Develop Thai recipes with &quot;authentic taste&quot; and establish them as standard recipes
* Develop biosensor equipment to analyze and evaluate taste and flavors
* Develop institutional food (ready-to-cook products) based on the standardized recipes to meet the demand for Thai food in foreign countries
* Provide a food certification service as well as training for local and foreign chefs working in Thai restaurants worldwide

The agency has posted 11 &quot;authentic&quot; recipes for &quot;tom yam kung&quot; (&quot;nam sai&quot;), &quot;tom yam kung&quot; (&quot;nam khon&quot;), pad thai, Massaman curry, &quot;kaeng khiao wan&quot; (green curry), &quot;kaeng lueang&quot; (southern Thai sour curry), &quot;golek&quot; chicken sauce, &quot;khao soi&quot;, &quot;sai ua&quot; (northern Thai sausage), &quot;nam phrik num&quot; (green pepper chili paste), and &quot;nam phrik ong&quot; (northern Thai chili paste). These recipes were featured at a gala dinner promoting &quot;Authentic Thai Food for the World&quot;, held at the Plaza Athénée Hotel Bangkok on 24 August 2016 at which Thailand&#x27;s Minister of Industry was the honored guest. By 2020, Thai Delicious plans to post over 300 Thai food recipes.

To determine authenticity, Thai researchers developed the &quot;e-delicious machine&quot;, described as &quot;...an intelligent robot that measures smell and taste in food ingredients through sensor technology in order to measure taste like a food critic.&quot; The machine evaluates food by measuring its conductivity at different voltages. Readings from 10 sensors are combined to produce a chemical signature. Because the machine cannot judge taste, the food is compared with a standard derived from a database of popular preferences for each dish. For tom yam, the spicy soup flavored with Kaffir lime leaves and coriander, researchers posted notices at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, requesting 120 tasters. The tasters—students, university staff, and area workers—were paid a few baht for their opinions. They were served 10 differently prepared soups and rated each one. The winning soup was declared the standard, and its chemical characteristics were programmed into the machine. When testing food, the machine returns a numerical score from one to 100. A score lower than 80 is deemed &quot;not up to standard&quot;. The machine cost about US$100,000 to develop. Restaurants that follow officially sanctioned recipes can affix a &quot;Thai Delicious&quot; logo to their menus. Each machine sold for 200,000 baht. This project was shelved.

The Thai Delicious project has been criticized, the main rationale being that &quot;Standardisation is the enemy of Thai food.&quot; Some observers think, however, that the quality of Thai food, at least in the US, is declining with its increased popularity, a state of affairs that Thai Delicious aims to fix.

In August 2018, Thailand&#x27;s Ministry of Commerce kicked off a project called &quot;Thai Select&quot;. It issues certificates in three grades to domestic Thai restaurants: gold (five stars); red (four stars); and orange (three stars). The goal is to enable tourists to Thailand to choose a worthy restaurant.

Culture Minister Vira Rojpojchanarat announced in 2018 that between 2020 and 2024, his ministry will investigate ways to preserve authentic Thai cuisine from the increasing influence of foreign dishes. &quot;Unique in its preparation with recipes handed down for generations, Thai culinary art needs better protection against foreign influences which are now changing the look and taste of certain local dishes,&quot; he warned. The plan will conform to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The 2003 convention intends to protect the &quot;uses, representations, expressions, knowledge and techniques that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, recognised as an integral part of their cultural heritage&quot;.

===Salt reduction efforts===

<text>Toxicology is a scientific discipline, overlapping with biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine, that involves the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms and the practice of diagnosing and treating exposures to toxins and toxicants. The relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high significance in toxicology. Factors that influence chemical toxicity include the dosage, duration of exposure (whether it is acute or chronic), route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment. Toxicologists are experts on poisons and poisoning. There is a movement for evidence-based toxicology as part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. Toxicology is currently contributing to the field of cancer research, since some toxins can be used as drugs for killing tumor cells. One prime example of this is ribosome-inactivating proteins, tested in the treatment of leukemia.

The word &quot;toxicology&quot; () is a neoclassical compound from Neo-Latin, first attested , from the combining forms &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, which in turn come from the Ancient Greek words &quot;toxikos&quot;, &quot;poisonous&quot;, and &quot;logos&quot;, &quot;subject matter&quot;).

== History ==

The earliest treatise dedicated to the general study of plant and animal poisons, including their classification, recognition, and the treatment of their effects is the &quot;Kalpasthāna&quot;, one of the major sections of the Suśrutasaṃhitā, a Sanskrit work composed before ca. 300 CE and perhaps in part as early as the fourth century BCE. The &quot;Kalpasthāna&quot; was influential on many later Sanskrit medical works and was translated into Arabic and other languages, influencing South East Asia, the Middle East, Tibet and eventually Europe. 

Dioscorides, a Greek physician in the court of the Roman emperor Nero, made an early attempt to classify plants according to their toxic and therapeutic effect. A work attributed to the 10th century author Ibn Wahshiyya called the &quot;Book on Poisons&quot; describes various toxic substances and poisonous recipes that can be made using magic. A 14th century Kannada poetic work attributed to the Jain prince Mangarasa, &quot;Khagendra Mani Darpana&quot;, describes several poisonous plants.

The 16th-century Swiss physician Paracelsus is considered &quot;the father&quot; of modern toxicology, based on his rigorous (for the time) approach to understanding the effects of substances on the body. He is credited with the classic toxicology maxim, &quot;Alle Dinge sind Gift und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.&quot; which translates as, &quot;All things are poisonous and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not poisonous.&quot; This is often condensed to: &quot;The dose makes the poison&quot; or in Latin &quot;Sola dosis facit venenum&quot;.

Mathieu Orfila is also considered the modern father of toxicology, having given the subject its first formal treatment in 1813 in his &quot;Traité des poisons&quot;, also called &quot;Toxicologie générale&quot;.

In 1850, Jean Stas became the first person to successfully isolate plant poisons from human tissue. This allowed him to identify the use of nicotine as a poison in the Bocarmé murder case, providing the evidence needed to convict the Belgian Count Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé of killing his brother-in-law.

==Basic principles==

The goal of toxicity assessment is to identify adverse effects of a substance. Adverse effects depend on two main factors: i) routes of exposure (oral, inhalation, or dermal) and ii) dose (duration and concentration of exposure). To explore dose, substances are tested in both acute and chronic models. Generally, different sets of experiments are conducted to determine whether a substance causes cancer and to examine other forms of toxicity.

Factors that influence chemical toxicity:
* Dosage
** Both large single exposures (acute) and continuous small exposures (chronic) are studied.
* Route of exposure
** Ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption
* Other factors
** Species
** Age
** Sex
** Health
** Environment
** Individual characteristics
The discipline of evidence-based toxicology strives to transparently, consistently, and objectively assess available scientific evidence in order to answer questions in toxicology, the study of the adverse effects of chemical, physical, or biological agents on living organisms and the environment, including the prevention and amelioration of such effects. Evidence-based toxicology has the potential to address concerns in the toxicological community about the limitations of current approaches to assessing the state of the science. These include concerns related to transparency in decision-making, synthesis of different types of evidence, and the assessment of bias and credibility. Evidence-based toxicology has its roots in the larger movement towards evidence-based practices.

== Testing methods ==
Toxicity experiments may be conducted &quot;in vivo&quot; (using the whole animal) or &quot;in vitro&quot; (testing on isolated cells or tissues), or &quot;in silico&quot; (in a computer simulation).

=== &quot;In vivo&quot; model organism ===
The classic experimental tool of toxicology is testing on non-human animals. Examples of model organisms are &quot;Galleria mellonella,&quot; which can replace small mammals, Zebrafish (&quot;Danio rerio&quot;), which allow for the study of toxicology in a lower order vertebrate &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. As of 2014, such animal testing provides information that is not available by other means about how substances function in a living organism. The use of non-human animals for toxicology testing is opposed by some organisations for reasons of animal welfare, and it has been restricted or banned under some circumstances in certain regions, such as the testing of cosmetics in the European Union.

=== &quot;In vitro&quot; methods ===
While testing in animal models remains as a method of estimating human effects, there are both ethical and technical concerns with animal testing.

Since the late 1950s, the field of toxicology has sought to reduce or eliminate animal testing under the rubric of &quot;Three Rs&quot; – reduce the number of experiments with animals to the minimum necessary; refine experiments to cause less suffering, and replace &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments with other types, or use more simple forms of life when possible. The historical development of alternative testing methods in toxicology has been published by Balls.

Computer modeling is an example of an alternative in vitro toxicology testing method; using computer models of chemicals and proteins, structure-activity relationships can be determined, and chemical structures that are likely to bind to, and interfere with, proteins with essential functions, can be identified. This work requires expert knowledge in molecular modeling and statistics together with expert judgment in chemistry, biology and toxicology.

In 2007 the American NGO National Academy of Sciences published a report called &quot;Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy&quot; which opened with a statement: &quot;Change often involves a pivotal event that builds on previous history and opens the door to a new era. Pivotal events in science include the discovery of penicillin, the elucidation of the DNA double helix, and the development of computers. ... Toxicity testing is approaching such a scientific pivot point. It is poised to take advantage of the revolutions in biology and biotechnology. Advances in toxicogenomics, bioinformatics, systems biology, epigenetics, and computational toxicology could transform toxicity testing from a system based on whole-animal testing to one founded primarily on in vitro methods that evaluate changes in biologic processes using cells, cell lines, or cellular components, preferably of human origin.&quot; As of 2014 that vision was still unrealized.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency studied 1,065 chemical and drug substances in their ToxCast program (part of the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) using &quot;in silica&quot; modelling and a human pluripotent stem cell-based assay to predict &quot;in vivo&quot; developmental intoxicants based on changes in cellular metabolism following chemical exposure. Major findings from the analysis of this ToxCast_STM dataset published in 2020 include: (1) 19% of 1065 chemicals yielded a prediction of developmental toxicity, (2) assay performance reached 79%–82% accuracy with high specificity (&gt; 84%) but modest sensitivity (&lt; 67%) when compared with &quot;in vivo&quot; animal models of human prenatal developmental toxicity, (3) sensitivity improved as more stringent weights of evidence requirements were applied to the animal studies, and (4) statistical analysis of the most potent chemical hits on specific biochemical targets in ToxCast revealed positive and negative associations with the STM response, providing insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of the targeted endpoint and its biological domain.

In some cases shifts away from animal studies have been mandated by law or regulation; the European Union (EU) prohibited use of animal testing for cosmetics in 2013.

== Dose response complexities ==
Most chemicals display a classic dose response curve – at a low dose (below a threshold), no effect is observed. Some show a phenomenon known as sufficient challenge – a small exposure produces animals that &quot;grow more rapidly, have better general appearance and coat quality, have fewer tumors, and live longer than the control animals&quot;.
A few chemicals have no well-defined safe level of exposure. These are treated with special care. Some chemicals are subject to bioaccumulation as they are stored in rather than being excreted from the body; these also receive special consideration.

Several measures are commonly used to describe toxic dosages according to the degree of effect on an organism or a population, and some are specifically defined by various laws or organizational usage. These include:
* LD50 or LD50 = Median lethal dose, a dose that will kill 50% of an exposed population
* NOEL = No-Observed-Effect-Level, the highest dose known to show no effect
* NOAEL = No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level, the highest dose known to show no adverse effects
* PEL = Permissible Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted under US OSHA regulations
* STEL = Short-Term Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted for short periods of time, in general 15–30 minutes
* TWA = Time-Weighted Average, the average amount of an agent&#x27;s concentration over a specified period of time, usually 8 hours
* TTC = The Threshold of Toxicological Concern concept has been applied to low-level contaminants, such as the constituents of tobacco smoke

==Types==
Medical toxicology is the discipline that requires physician status (MD or DO degree plus specialty education and experience).

Clinical toxicology is the discipline that can be practiced not only by physicians but also other health professionals with a master&#x27;s degree in clinical toxicology: physician extenders (physician assistants, nurse practitioners), nurses, pharmacists, and allied health professionals.

Forensic toxicology is the discipline that makes use of toxicology and other disciplines such as analytical chemistry, pharmacology and clinical chemistry to aid medical or legal investigation of death, poisoning, and drug use. The primary concern for forensic toxicology is not the legal outcome of the toxicological investigation or the technology utilized, but rather the obtainment and interpretation of results.

Computational toxicology is a discipline that develops mathematical and computer-based models to better understand and predict adverse health effects caused by chemicals, such as environmental pollutants and pharmaceuticals. Within the &quot;Toxicology in the 21st Century&quot; project, the best predictive models were identified to be Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, which can reach the performance of in vitro experiments.

Occupational toxicology is the application of toxicology to chemical hazards in the workplace.

== Toxicology as a profession ==
A toxicologist is a scientist or medical personnel who specializes in the study of chemicals to determine if they are harmful to living organisms. They may analyze symptoms, mechanisms, treatments and detection of venoms and toxins; especially the poisoning of people. There are several types of toxicologist including medical, academic and non-profit.

=== Requirements ===
To work as a toxicologist one should obtain a degree in toxicology or a related degree like biology, chemistry, pharmacology or biochemistry. Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in toxicology cover the chemical makeup of toxins and their effects on biochemistry, physiology and ecology. After introductory life science courses are complete, students typically enroll in labs and apply toxicology principles to research and other studies. Advanced students delve into specific sectors, like the pharmaceutical industry or law enforcement, which apply methods of toxicology in their work. The Society of Toxicology (SOT) recommends that undergraduates in postsecondary schools that do not offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree in toxicology consider attaining a degree in biology or chemistry. Additionally, the SOT advises aspiring toxicologists to take statistics and mathematics courses, as well as gain laboratory experience through lab courses, student research projects and internships. In the USA, Medical Toxicologists complete residency training such as in Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics or Internal Medicine, followed by fellowship in Medical Toxicology and eventual certification by the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT).

=== Duties ===
Toxicologists perform many different duties including research in the academic, nonprofit and industrial fields, product safety evaluation, consulting, public service and legal regulation. In order to research and assess the effects of chemicals, toxicologists perform carefully designed studies and experiments. These experiments help identify the specific amount of a chemical that may cause harm and potential risks of being near or using products that contain certain chemicals. Research projects may range from assessing the effects of toxic pollutants on the environment to evaluating how the human immune system responds to chemical compounds within pharmaceutical drugs. While the basic duties of toxicologists are to determine the effects of chemicals on organisms and their surroundings, specific job duties may vary based on industry and employment. For example, forensic toxicologists may look for toxic substances in a crime scene, whereas aquatic toxicologists may analyze the toxicity level of water bodies.

=== Compensation ===
The salary for jobs in toxicology is dependent on several factors, including level of schooling, specialization, experience. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) noted that jobs for biological scientists, which generally include toxicologists, were expected to increase by 21% between 2008 and 2018; the BLS noted that this increase could be due to research and development growth in biotechnology, as well as budget increases for basic and medical research in biological science.

<doc id="30535" wikidata="Q33866" url="?curid=30535" title="Theodore Roosevelt">
<text>Theodore Roosevelt Jr. (October 27, 1858 – January 6, 1919), also known as Teddy or T.R., was the 26th president of the United States, serving from 1901 to 1909. Roosevelt previously was involved in New York politics, including serving as the state&#x27;s 33rd governor for two years. He served as the 25th vice president under President William McKinley for six months in 1901, assuming the presidency after McKinley&#x27;s assassination. As president, Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the Republican Party and became a driving force for anti-trust and Progressive policies.

A sickly child with debilitating asthma, Roosevelt overcame health problems through a strenuous lifestyle. He was homeschooled and began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending Harvard College. His book &quot;The Naval War of 1812&quot; established his reputation as a historian and popular writer. Roosevelt became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in the New York State Legislature. His first wife Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt and mother Martha Bulloch Roosevelt died on the same night, devastating him psychologically. He recuperated by buying and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas. Roosevelt served as the assistant secretary of the Navy under McKinley, and in 1898 helped plan the successful naval war against Spain. He resigned to help form and lead the Rough Riders, a unit that fought the Spanish Army in Cuba to great publicity. Returning a war hero, Roosevelt was elected New York&#x27;s governor in 1898. The New York state party leadership disliked his ambitious agenda and convinced McKinley to choose him as his running mate in the 1900 presidential election; the McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory.

Roosevelt assumed the presidency aged 42, and is the youngest person to become U.S. president. As a leader of the progressive movement, he championed his &quot;Square Deal&quot; domestic policies, which called for fairness for all citizens, breaking bad trusts, regulating railroads, and pure food and drugs. Roosevelt prioritized conservation and established national parks, forests, and monuments to preserve U.S. natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America, beginning construction of the Panama Canal. Roosevelt expanded the Navy and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project naval power. His successful efforts to end the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize, the first American to win a Nobel Prize. Roosevelt was elected to a full term in 1904 and convinced William Howard Taft to succeed him in 1908.

Roosevelt grew frustrated with Taft&#x27;s brand of conservatism and tried, and failed, to win the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. He founded the new Progressive Party and ran in 1912; the split allowed the Democrat Woodrow Wilson to win. Roosevelt led a four-month expedition to the Amazon basin, where he nearly died of tropical disease. During World War I, he criticized Wilson for keeping the U.S. out; his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. Roosevelt&#x27;s health deteriorated and he died in 1919. Polls of historians and political scientists rank him as one of the greatest American presidents.

==Early life==
Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at 28 East 20th Street in Manhattan. His parents were Martha Stewart Bulloch and businessman Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister named Anna (called Bamie), a younger brother named Elliott, and a younger sister named Corinne.

Roosevelt&#x27;s youth was shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma attacks, which terrified him and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a market; after obtaining the seal&#x27;s head, Roosevelt and cousins formed the &quot;Roosevelt Museum of Natural History&quot;. Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals he killed or caught. Aged nine, he recorded his observations in a paper entitled &quot;The Natural History of Insects&quot;.
Family trips, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt discovered the benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regimen of exercise. After being manhandled by older boys on the way to a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to train him.

===Education===
Roosevelt was homeschooled. Biographer H. W. Brands wrote that, &quot;The most obvious drawback...was uneven coverage of...various areas of...knowledge.&quot; He was solid in geography and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, he struggled in mathematics and the classical languages.

In September 1876, he entered Harvard College. His father instructed him to, &quot;take care of your morals first, your health next, and finally your studies.&quot; His father&#x27;s sudden death in 1878 devastated Roosevelt. He inherited $60,000 (equivalent to $ in ), enough on which he could live comfortably for the rest of his life.

His father, a devout Presbyterian, regularly led the family in prayers. Young Theodore emulated him by teaching Sunday School for more than three years at Christ Church in Cambridge. When the minister at Christ Church, which was an Episcopal church, eventually insisted he become an Episcopalian to continue teaching, Roosevelt declined, and began teaching a mission class in a poor section of Cambridge. 

Roosevelt did well in science, philosophy, and rhetoric courses but struggled in Latin and Greek. He studied biology intently and was already an accomplished naturalist and a published ornithologist. He read prodigiously with an almost photographic memory. Roosevelt participated in rowing and boxing, and was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi literary society, the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and the prestigious Porcellian Club. In 1880, Roosevelt graduated Phi Beta Kappa (22nd of 177) with an A.B. &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. Henry F. Pringle wrote:
Roosevelt gave up his plan of studying natural science and attended Columbia Law School, moving back into his family&#x27;s home in New York. Although Roosevelt was an able student, he found law to be irrational. Determined to enter politics, Roosevelt began attending meetings at Morton Hall, the headquarters of New York&#x27;s 21st District Republican Association. Though Roosevelt&#x27;s father had been a prominent member of the Republican Party, Roosevelt made an unorthodox career choice for someone of his class, as most of Roosevelt&#x27;s peers refrained from becoming too closely involved in politics. Roosevelt found allies in the local Republican Party and defeated a Republican state assemblyman tied to the political machine of Senator Roscoe Conkling closely. After his election victory, Roosevelt dropped out of law school, later saying, &quot;I intended to be one of the governing class.&quot;

===Naval history and strategy===
While at Harvard, Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the United States Navy in the War of 1812. He ultimately published &quot;The Naval War of 1812&quot; in 1882. The book included comparisons of British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level. It was praised for its scholarship and style, and remains a standard study of the war.

With the 1890 publication of &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History,&quot; Alfred Thayer Mahan was hailed as the world&#x27;s outstanding naval theorist by European leaders. Mahan popularized a concept that only nations with significant naval power had been able to influence history, dominate oceans, exert their diplomacy to the fullest, and defend their borders. It has been believed Roosevelt&#x27;s naval ideas were derived from Mahan&#x27;s book, but naval historian Nicholas Danby felt Roosevelt&#x27;s ideas predated Mahan&#x27;s book.

=== First marriage and widowerhood ===
In 1880, Roosevelt married socialite Alice Hathaway Lee. Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, was born on February 12, 1884. Two days later, the new mother died of undiagnosed kidney failure, on the same day as Roosevelt&#x27;s mother Martha died of typhoid fever. In his diary, Roosevelt wrote a large &quot;X&quot; on the page and then, &quot;The light has gone out of my life.&quot; Distraught, Roosevelt left baby Alice in the care of his sister Bamie while he grieved; he assumed custody of Alice when she was three.

After the deaths of his wife and mother, Roosevelt focused on his work, specifically by re-energizing a legislative investigation into corruption of the New York City government, which arose from a bill proposing power be centralized in the mayor&#x27;s office. For the rest of his life, he rarely spoke about his wife Alice and did not write about her in his autobiography.

==Early political career==
===State Assemblyman===

In 1881, Roosevelt won election to the New York State Assembly, representing the 21st district, then centered on the &quot;Silk Stocking District&quot; of New York County&#x27;s Upper East Side. He served in the 1882, 1883, and 1884 sessions of the legislature. He began making his mark immediately: he blocked a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. Roosevelt exposed the collusion of Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and successfully argued for an investigation, aiming for the judge to be impeached. Although the investigation committee rejected the impeachment, Roosevelt had exposed corruption in Albany and assumed a high and positive profile in New York publications.

Roosevelt&#x27;s anti-corruption efforts helped him win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made more impressive by the victory that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won in Roosevelt&#x27;s district. With Conkling&#x27;s Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, Roosevelt won election as party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. Roosevelt won re-election and sought the office of Speaker, but Titus Sheard obtained the position. Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities, during which he wrote more bills than any other legislator.

===Presidential election of 1884===

With numerous presidential hopefuls, Roosevelt supported Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. The state Republican Party preferred incumbent president, Chester Arthur, who was known for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Roosevelt succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention. He then took control of the convention, bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering supporters of Arthur and James G. Blaine; consequently, he gained a national reputation as a key politician in his state.

Roosevelt attended the 1884 Republican National Convention in Chicago, where he gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch, an Edmunds supporter, to be temporary chair. Roosevelt fought alongside the Mugwump reformers against Blaine. However, Blaine gained support from Arthur&#x27;s and Edmunds&#x27;s delegates, and won the nomination. In a crucial moment of his budding career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of fellow Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine. He bragged: &quot;We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman...this needed...skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions to come in... to defeat the common foe.&quot; He was impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd he had addressed up to then. 

Having gotten a taste of national politics, Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; he retired to his new &quot;Chimney Butte Ranch&quot; on the Little Missouri River. Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Cleveland, the Democratic nominee in the general election. After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt carelessly said he would give &quot;hearty support to any decent Democrat&quot;. He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant &quot;for publication&quot;. When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, &quot;I decline to answer.&quot; In the end, he realized he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the party and did so in a press release. Having lost the support of many reformers, and still reeling from the deaths of his wife and mother, Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and moved to North Dakota.

==Cattle rancher in Dakota==

Roosevelt first visited the Dakota Territory in 1883 to hunt bison. Exhilarated by the western lifestyle and with the cattle business booming, Roosevelt invested $14,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in hope of becoming a prosperous cattle rancher. For several years, he shuttled between his home in New York and ranch in Dakota.

Following the 1884 United States presidential election, Roosevelt built Elkhorn Ranch north of the boomtown of Medora, North Dakota. Roosevelt learned to ride western style, rope, and hunt on the banks of the Little Missouri. A cowboy, he said, possesses, &quot;few of the emasculated, milk-and-water moralities admired by the pseudo-philanthropists; but he does possess, to a very high degree, the stern, manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation&quot;. He wrote about frontier life for national magazines and published books: &quot;Hunting Trips of a Ranchman&quot;, &quot;Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail&quot;, and &quot;The Wilderness Hunter&quot;.

Roosevelt successfully led efforts to organize ranchers to address the problems of overgrazing and other shared concerns, which resulted in the formation of the Little Missouri Stockmen&#x27;s Association. He formed the Boone and Crockett Club, whose primary goal was the conservation of large game animals and their habitats. In 1886, Roosevelt served as a deputy sheriff in Billings County, North Dakota. He and ranch hands hunted down three boat thieves.

The severe winter of 1886–1887 wiped out his herd and over half of his $80,000 investment (equivalent to $ in ). He ended his ranching life and returned to New York, where he escaped the damaging label of an ineffectual intellectual.

==Second marriage==

On December 2, 1886, Roosevelt married his childhood friend, Edith Kermit Carow, at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, in London, England. Roosevelt felt deeply troubled that his second marriage was soon after the death of his first wife and he faced resistance from his sisters. The couple had five children: Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; III in 1887, Kermit in 1889, Ethel in 1891, Archibald in 1894, and Quentin in 1897. They also raised Roosevelt&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage, Alice, who often clashed with her stepmother.

==Reentering public life==
Upon Roosevelt&#x27;s return to New York, Republican leaders approached him about running for mayor of New York City in the 1886 election. Roosevelt accepted the nomination despite having little hope against United Labor Party candidate Henry George and Democrat Abram Hewitt. Roosevelt campaigned hard, but Hewitt won with 41%, taking the votes of many Republicans who feared George&#x27;s radical policies. George was held to 31%, and Roosevelt took third with 27%. Fearing his political career might never recover, Roosevelt turned to writing &quot;The Winning of the West&quot;, tracking the westward movement of Americans; it was a great success, earning favorable reviews and selling all copies from the first printing.

===Civil Service Commission===
After Benjamin Harrison unexpectedly defeated Blaine for the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt gave stump speeches in the Midwest in support of Harrison. On the insistence of Henry Cabot Lodge, President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1895. While many of his predecessors had approached the office as a sinecure, Roosevelt fought the spoilsmen and demanded enforcement of civil service laws. &quot;The Sun&quot; described Roosevelt as &quot;irrepressible, belligerent, and enthusiastic&quot;. Roosevelt clashed with Postmaster General John Wanamaker, who handed out patronage positions to Harrison supporters, and Roosevelt&#x27;s attempt to force out several postal workers damaged Harrison politically. Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s support for Harrison&#x27;s reelection in the 1892 presidential election, the winner, Grover Cleveland, reappointed him. Roosevelt&#x27;s close friend and biographer, Joseph Bucklin Bishop, described his assault on the spoils system:

===New York City Police Commissioner===
In 1894, reform Republicans approached Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife&#x27;s resistance to being removed from the Washington social set. Soon after, he realized he had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career. He retreated to the Dakotas; Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed there would be no repeat.

William Lafayette Strong won the 1894 mayoral election and offered Roosevelt a position on the board of the New York City Police Commissioners. Roosevelt became president of commissioners and radically reformed the police force: he implemented regular inspections of firearms and physical exams, appointed recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications rather than political affiliation, established Meritorious Service Medals, closed corrupt police hostelries, and had telephones installed in station houses.

In 1894, Roosevelt met Jacob Riis, the muckraking &quot;Evening Sun&quot; journalist who was opening the eyes of New Yorkers to the terrible conditions of the city&#x27;s immigrants with such books as &quot;How the Other Half Lives.&quot; Riis described how his book affected Roosevelt:

Roosevelt made a habit of walking officers&#x27; beats at night and early in the morning to make sure that they were on duty. He made a concerted effort to uniformly enforce New York&#x27;s Sunday closing law; in this, he ran up against Tom Platt and Tammany Hall—he was notified the Police Commission was being legislated out of existence. His crackdowns led to protests. Invited to one large demonstration, not only did he accept, but he delighted in the insults and lampoons directed at him, and earned goodwill. Roosevelt chose to defer rather than split with his party. As Governor of New York State, he would later sign an act replacing the Police Commission with a Police Commissioner.

==Emergence as national figure==
===Assistant Secretary of the Navy===

In the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election. Roosevelt strongly opposed Bryan&#x27;s free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan&#x27;s followers as dangerous fanatics. He gave campaign speeches for McKinley. Urged by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897. Secretary of the Navy John D. Long was in poor health and left many major decisions to Roosevelt. Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships. Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley and was adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba. He explained his priorities to one of the Navy&#x27;s planners in late 1897:

On February 15, 1898, the armored cruiser exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution. Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt&#x27;s orders. After giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war on Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War.

===War in Cuba===
With the beginning of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Along with Army Colonel Leonard Wood, he formed the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. His wife and many friends begged Roosevelt to remain in Washington, but Roosevelt was determined to see battle. When the newspapers reported the formation of the new regiment, Roosevelt and Wood were flooded with applications. Referred to by the press as the &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, it was one of many temporary units active only during the war.

The regiment trained for several weeks in San Antonio, Texas; in his autobiography, Roosevelt wrote that his experience with the New York National Guard enabled him to immediately begin teaching basic soldiering skills. Diversity characterized the regiment, which included Ivy Leaguers, athletes, frontiersmen, Native Americans, hunters, miners, former soldiers, tradesmen, and sheriffs. The Rough Riders were part of the cavalry division commanded by former Confederate general Joseph Wheeler. Roosevelt and his men landed in Daiquirí, Cuba, on June 23, 1898, and marched to Siboney. Wheeler sent the Rough Riders on a parallel road northwest running along a ridge up from the beach. Roosevelt took command of the regiment; he had his first experience in combat when the Rough Riders met Spanish troops in a skirmish known as the Battle of Las Guasimas. They fought their way through Spanish resistance and, together with the Regulars, forced the Spaniards to abandon their positions. On July 1, in a combined assault with the Regulars, under Roosevelt&#x27;s leadership, the Rough Riders became famous for charges up Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill. Roosevelt was the only soldier on horseback, as he rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged despite the absence of orders. He was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The assaults would become known as the Battle of San Juan Heights. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.

In August, Roosevelt and other officers demanded the soldiers be returned home. Roosevelt recalled San Juan Heights as &quot;the great day of my life&quot;. After returning to civilian life, Roosevelt preferred to be known as &quot;Colonel Roosevelt&quot; or &quot;The Colonel&quot;; &quot;Teddy&quot; remained much more popular with the public, though Roosevelt openly despised that moniker.

===Governor of New York===
Shortly after Roosevelt&#x27;s return, Republican Congressman Lemuel E. Quigg, a lieutenant of New York machine boss Thomas C. Platt, asked Roosevelt to run in the 1898 gubernatorial election. Prospering politically from the Platt machine, Roosevelt&#x27;s rise to power was marked by the pragmatic decisions of Platt, who disliked Roosevelt. Platt feared Roosevelt would oppose his interests in office and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics, but needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, Frank S. Black. Roosevelt agreed to become the nominee and to try not to &quot;make war&quot; with the Republican establishment once in office. Roosevelt defeated Black in the Republican caucus, and faced Democrat Augustus Van Wyck, a well-respected judge, in the general election. Roosevelt campaigned on his war record, winning by just 1%.

As governor, Roosevelt learned about economic issues and political techniques that proved valuable in his presidency. He studied the problems of trusts, monopolies, labor relations, and conservation. G. Wallace Chessman argues that Roosevelt&#x27;s program &quot;rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state&quot;. The rules for the Square Deal were &quot;honesty in public affairs, an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility, and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large&quot;.

By holding twice-daily press conferences—an innovation—Roosevelt remained connected with his middle-class base. Roosevelt successfully pushed the Ford Franchise-Tax bill, which taxed public franchises granted by the state and controlled by corporations, declaring that &quot;a corporation which derives its powers from the State, should pay to the State a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges it enjoys&quot;. He rejected Platt worries that this approached Bryanite Socialism, explaining that without it, New York voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises.

Power to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for the governor. Platt insisted he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate people with Platt&#x27;s approval. He even enlisted Platt&#x27;s help in securing reform, such as in spring 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called &quot;superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America&quot;.

Chessman argues that as governor, Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the poor. Roosevelt sought to position himself against the excesses of large corporations and radical movements.

As chief executive of the most populous state, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential presidential candidate, and supporters such as William Allen White encouraged him to run. Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the nomination in 1900 and was denied his preferred post of Secretary of War. As his term progressed, Roosevelt pondered a 1904 run, but was uncertain about whether he should seek re-election as governor in 1900.

===Vice presidency (1901)===
In November 1899, Vice President Garret Hobart died, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket. Though Henry Cabot Lodge and others urged him to run for vice president in 1900, Roosevelt issued a public statement saying that he would not accept the nomination. Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination. Roosevelt attended the 1900 Republican National Convention as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination if the convention offered it to him but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss Matthew Quay to lead the campaign for Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Mark Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket. Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously.

Roosevelt&#x27;s vice-presidential campaigning proved highly energetic and a match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s barnstorming style. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his energy to the public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of those who won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported the war itself, but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. The voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.

Roosevelt took office as vice president in March 1901. The office was a powerless sinecure and did not suit Roosevelt&#x27;s aggressive temperament. Roosevelt&#x27;s six months as vice president were uneventful and boring for a man of action. He had no power; he presided over the Senate for a mere four days before it adjourned. On September 2, 1901, Roosevelt first publicized an aphorism that thrilled his supporters: &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far.&quot;

==Presidency (1901–1909)==
On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, when he was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Roosevelt, vacationing in Isle La Motte, Vermont, traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. When McKinley seemed to recover, Roosevelt resumed his vacation. When McKinley&#x27;s condition worsened, Roosevelt rushed back to Buffalo. He was in North Creek when he learned of McKinley&#x27;s death on September 14. Roosevelt then continued to Buffalo and was sworn in as the 26th president at the Ansley Wilcox House.

McKinley&#x27;s supporters were uneasy about Roosevelt, with Ohio Senator Mark Hanna particularly bitter, given his strong opposition at the convention. Although Roosevelt assured party leaders that he would adhere to McKinley&#x27;s policies and retained his Cabinet, he sought to establish himself as the party&#x27;s leader and position himself for the 1904 election. Roosevelt’s ascension to the presidency was met with concern by conservative Republicans, with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin noting that 

Adding to this point, Kearns has noted that

Shortly after taking office, Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House, sparking a bitter reaction across the heavily segregated South. While Roosevelt initially planned more dinners with Washington, he later avoided further invitations in favor of business appointments to retain political support in the white South.

===Domestic policies: The Square Deal===
====Trust busting and regulation====
Roosevelt was hailed as the &quot;trust-buster&quot; for his aggressive use of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, compared to his predecessors. He viewed big business as essential to the American economy, prosecuting only &quot;bad trusts&quot; that restrained trade and charged unfair prices. Roosevelt brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly, and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company. His predecessors, Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley, had together prosecuted only 18 antitrust violations.

After winning large majorities in the 1902 elections, Roosevelt proposed creating the United States Department of Commerce and Labor, which included the Bureau of Corporations. Congress was receptive to the department but skeptical of the antitrust powers Roosevelt wanted within the Bureau. Roosevelt appealed to the public, pressuring Congress, which overwhelmingly passed his version of the bill.

House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon commented on Roosevelt&#x27;s desire for executive branch control: &quot;That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.&quot; Biographer Brands notes, &quot;Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn&#x27;t any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve.&quot; Roosevelt&#x27;s willingness to exercise power extended to attempted rule changes in American football, forcing retention of martial arts classes at the U.S. Naval Academy, revising disciplinary rules, altering the design of a disliked coin, and ordering simplified spellings for 300 words, though he rescinded the latter after ridicule from the press and a House protest.

====Coal strike====

In May 1902, anthracite coal miners went on strike, threatening a national energy shortage. After threatening the coal operators with federal troops, Roosevelt won their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, stopping the strike. The accord with J. P. Morgan resulted in miners getting more pay for fewer hours but no union recognition. Roosevelt said, &quot;My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital, and both are reducible to my favorite formula—a square deal for every man.&quot; He was the first president to help settle a labor dispute.

====Prosecuted misconduct====
During Roosevelt&#x27;s second year in office, corruption was uncovered in the Indian Service, the United States General Land Office, and the Post Office Department. He prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated Native American tribes out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation involving Oregon timberlands, led to him and Ethan A. Hitchcock forcing General Land Office Commissioner Binger Hermann from office, in November 1902. Special prosecutor Francis J. Heney obtained 146 indictments in the Oregon Land Office bribery ring. Roosevelt also prosecuted 44 postal employees on charges of bribery and fraud. Historians agree he moved &quot;quickly and decisively&quot; to address misconduct in his administration.

====Railroads====

Merchants complained that some railroad rates were too high. In the 1906 Hepburn Act, Roosevelt sought to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative Nelson Aldrich, resisted. Roosevelt worked with Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman to pass the bill. They ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with &quot;just-and-reasonable&quot; maximum rates, allowing railroads to appeal to federal courts on what was &quot;reasonable&quot;. The Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and other aspects of railroad operations.

====Pure food and drugs====
Roosevelt responded to public outrage over abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Conservatives initially opposed the bill, but Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;, published in 1906, galvanized support for reform. The Meat Inspection Act banned misleading labels and preservatives with harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned impure or falsely labeled food and drugs from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908 and convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children in 1909.

====Conservation====
Roosevelt was proudest of his work in conserving natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife. He worked closely with Interior Secretary James Rudolph Garfield and Chief of the United States Forest Service Gifford Pinchot to enact a series of conservation programs that met resistance from Western Congress members, such as Charles William Fulton. Nonetheless, Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new U.S. National Monuments. He also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 National Forests. The area of the United States he placed under public protection totals approximately . Roosevelt was the first honorary member of the Camp-Fire Club of America.

Roosevelt extensively used executive orders to protect forest and wildlife lands during his presidency. By the end of his second term, Roosevelt used executive orders to reserve of forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his use of executive orders to protect the environment, despite Congress&#x27;s perception that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill preventing the president from reserving further land. Before signing the bill, Roosevelt established an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign it into law. In total, Roosevelt established 121 forest reserves in 31 states through executive orders. Roosevelt issued 1,081 executive orders, more than any previous president except Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 executive orders.

====Business panic of 1907====
In 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893. Wall Street&#x27;s stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many investors blamed Roosevelt&#x27;s regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices. Roosevelt ultimately helped calm the crisis by meeting with the leaders of U.S. Steel on November 4, 1907, and approving their plan to purchase a Tennessee steel company near bankruptcy—its failure would ruin a major New York bank.

However, in August, Roosevelt had exploded in anger at the super-rich for their economic malfeasance, calling them &quot;malefactors of great wealth&quot; in a major speech, &quot;The Puritan Spirit and the Regulation of Corporations&quot;. Trying to restore confidence, he blamed the crisis primarily on Europe, but then, after saluting the unbending rectitude of the Puritans, he went on:It may well be that the determination of the government...to punish certain malefactors of great wealth, has been responsible for something of the trouble; at least to the extent of having caused these men to combine to bring about as much financial stress as possible, in order to discredit the policy of the government and thereby secure a reversal of that policy, so that they may enjoy unmolested the fruits of their own evil-doing.

Regarding the very wealthy, Roosevelt privately scorned, &quot;their entire unfitness to govern the country, and ... the lasting damage they do by much of what they think are the legitimate big business operations of the day&quot;.

===Foreign policy===
==== Japan ====
The American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that Japan would dominate or seize the Hawaiian Republic. Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S. to take over. As the U.S. became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan.

In the 1890s, Roosevelt had been an ardent imperialist and vigorously defended the permanent acquisition of the Philippines in the 1900 campaign. After the local insurrection ended in 1902, Roosevelt wished to have a strong U.S. presence in the region as a symbol of democratic values, but he did not envision any new acquisitions. One of Roosevelt&#x27;s priorities was the maintenance of friendly relations with Japan. From 1904 to 1905 Japan and Russia were at war. Both sides asked Roosevelt to mediate a peace conference, held successfully in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.

Though he proclaimed that the United States would be neutral during the Russo-Japanese War, Roosevelt secretly favored Imperial Japan to emerge victorious against the Russian Empire. In California, anti-Japanese hostility was growing, and Tokyo protested. Roosevelt negotiated a &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; in 1907. It ended explicit discrimination against the Japanese, and Japan agreed not to allow unskilled immigrants into the United States. The Great White Fleet of American battleships visited Japan in 1908. Roosevelt intended to emphasize the superiority of the American fleet over the smaller Japanese navy, but instead of resentment, the visitors arrived to a joyous welcome. This goodwill facilitated the Root–Takahira Agreement of November 1908 which reaffirmed the status quo of Japanese control of Korea and American control of the Philippines.

==== China ====
Following the Boxer Rebellion, foreign powers, including the United States, required China to pay indemnities as part of the Boxer protocol. In 1908, Roosevelt appropriated these indemnities for the Boxer Indemnity Scholarships, which funded tens of thousands of Chinese students to study in the U.S. over the next 40 years.

====Europe====
Success in the war against Spain and the new empire, plus having the largest economy in the world, meant that the United States had emerged as a world power. Roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad. He also played a major role in mediating the First Moroccan Crisis by calling the Algeciras Conference, which averted war between France and Germany.

Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency saw the strengthening of ties with Great Britain. The Great Rapprochement had begun with British support of the United States during the Spanish–American War, and it continued as Britain withdrew its fleet from the Caribbean in favor of directing most of its attention to the rising German naval threat. In 1901, Britain and the U.S. signed the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty, abrogating the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which had prevented the U.S. from constructing a canal connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. The long-standing Alaska boundary dispute was settled on terms favorable to the U.S.; as Roosevelt later put it, this &quot;settled the last serious trouble between the British Empire and ourselves.&quot;

====Latin America and the Panama Canal====
As president, Roosevelt primarily directed the nation&#x27;s overseas ambitions towards the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the Panama Canal. Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of his second term, the U.S. had more battleships than any country other than Britain. The Panama Canal, when it opened in 1914, allowed the U.S. Navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters.

In December 1902, the Germans, British, and Italians blockaded the ports of Venezuela to force the repayment of delinquent loans. Roosevelt was particularly concerned about the motives of German Emperor Wilhelm II. He succeeded in getting the three nations to agree to arbitration by tribunal at The Hague, and successfully defused the crisis. The latitude granted to the Europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the &quot;Roosevelt Corollary&quot; to the Monroe Doctrine, which the President issued in 1904: Chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.
Two possible routes for an isthmus canal in Central America were under consideration: through Nicaragua and through Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia. Roosevelt persuaded Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by the Colombian government. When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A treaty with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was reached in 1903. Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the rights and equipment to build the canal. Critics charged that an American investor syndicate divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the &quot;New York World&quot; and the &quot;Indianapolis News&quot; known as the &quot;Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases&quot;. Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the lower courts&#x27; rulings. Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt&#x27;s criminal prosecutions of the newspapers but are divided on whether actual corruption took place.

In 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines, if necessary, without congressional approval.

Examining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard reports that:

The most striking evolution in the twenty-first-century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist... [Recent works] have underlined cogently Roosevelt&#x27;s exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentieth-century &quot;special relationship&quot;. ...The twenty-sixth president&#x27;s reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and real politician has undeniably reached new heights in the twenty-first century...yet, his Philippine policy still prompts criticism.
On November 6, 1906, Roosevelt was the first president to depart the continental United States on an official diplomatic trip. Roosevelt made a 17-day trip to Panama and Puerto Rico. He visited the Panama Canal worksite and attended diplomatic receptions in both Panama and Puerto Rico.

===Media===

Building on McKinley&#x27;s effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.
Aside from the Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases, Roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press. While out of office, he made a living as a writer and magazine editor. He loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. He drew the line, however, at exposé-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, sent magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but a speech of his from 1906 coined the term &quot;muckraker&quot; for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges.

===Election of 1904===
With the waning of Thomas Platt&#x27;s power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination. In deference to Mark Hanna&#x27;s conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss, but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his own man, George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress his hold on the party&#x27;s nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered opposing the President. The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R. Hitt, was not nominated. Senator Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination.

While Roosevelt followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump, he sought to control the campaign&#x27;s message through specific instructions to Cortelyou. He also attempted to manage the press&#x27;s release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club. Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access.

The Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee in 1904 was Alton Brooks Parker. Democratic newspapers charged that Republicans were extorting large campaign contributions from corporations, putting ultimate responsibility on Roosevelt himself. Roosevelt denied corruption while at the same time ordering Cortelyou to return $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ) of a campaign contribution from Standard Oil. Parker said that Roosevelt was accepting corporate donations to keep damaging information from the Bureau of Corporations from going public. Roosevelt strongly denied Parker&#x27;s charge and responded that he would &quot;go into the Presidency unhampered by any pledge, promise, or understanding of any kind, sort, or description...&quot;. Allegations from Parker and the Democrats, however, had little impact on the election, as Roosevelt promised to give every American a &quot;square deal&quot;. Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote to Parker&#x27;s 38%, and won the Electoral College vote 336 to 140. Before his inauguration ceremony, Roosevelt declared that he would not serve another term. Democrats would continue to charge Roosevelt and the Republicans of being influenced by corporate donations.

===Second term===
As his second term progressed, Roosevelt moved to the left of his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which Congress failed to pass. Roosevelt&#x27;s influence waned as he approached the end of his second term, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen. He sought a national incorporation law, called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot;), and an inheritance tax. Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees. In other areas, he also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.

The election of 1904 continued to be a source of contention between Republicans and Democrats. A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the Osage lands to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York &quot;Sun&quot; made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery that financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to $ in ) after Roosevelt&#x27;s alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell&#x27;s allegation as &quot;a lie, pure and simple&quot;.

====Rhetoric of righteousness====
Roosevelt&#x27;s rhetoric was characterized by an intense moralism of personal righteousness. The tone was typified by his denunciation of &quot;predatory wealth&quot; in a message he sent Congress in January 1908 calling for passage of new labor laws: Predatory wealth--of the wealth accumulated on a giant scale by all forms of iniquity, ranging from the oppression of wageworkers to unfair and unwholesome methods of crushing out competition, and to defrauding the public by stock jobbing and the manipulation of securities. Certain wealthy men of this stamp, whose conduct should be abhorrent to every man of ordinarily decent conscience, and who commit the hideous wrong of teaching our young men that phenomenal business success must ordinarily be based on dishonesty, have during the last few months made it apparent that they have banded together to work for a reaction. Their endeavor is to overthrow and discredit all who honestly administer the law, to prevent any additional legislation which would check and restrain them, and to secure if possible a freedom from all restraint which will permit every unscrupulous wrongdoer to do what he wishes unchecked provided he has enough money...The methods by which the Standard Oil people and those engaged in the other combinations of which I have spoken above have achieved great fortunes can only be justified by the advocacy of a system of morality which would also justify every form of criminality on the part of a labor union, and every form of violence, corruption, and fraud, from murder to bribery and ballot box stuffing in politics. 

==Post-presidency (1909–1919)==
===Election of 1908===
Roosevelt enjoyed being president but believed limited terms provided a check against dictatorship. He decided to honor his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. Though he favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, Root&#x27;s ill health made him unsuitable. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes was a strong candidate and shared Roosevelt&#x27;s progressivism, but Roosevelt considered him too independent. He settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had been his friend since 1890 and consistently supported Roosevelt&#x27;s policies. Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote to Taft: &quot;Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!&quot; Just weeks later, he branded as &quot;false and malicious&quot; the charge he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft. At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted &quot;four years more&quot; of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear Roosevelt was not interested.

In the 1908 election, Taft easily defeated Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan. Taft promoted progressivism emphasizing the rule of law; he preferred that judges, rather than politicians, make decisions about fairness. However, Taft proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt, lacking the energy, personal magnetism, and public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized lowering the tariff would create severe tensions inside the Republican Party, he stopped talking about it. Taft, ignoring the risks, tackled the tariff boldly, resulting in the Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909, which alienated reformers on all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, allowing Taft space.

===Africa and Europe (1909–1910)===

In March 1909, the ex-president left for the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition. Roosevelt&#x27;s party landed in Mombasa in East Africa and traveled to the Belgian Congo before following the Nile River to Khartoum in modern Sudan. Well-financed by Andrew Carnegie and by his own writings, Roosevelt&#x27;s party hunted for specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and American Museum of Natural History. The group, led by hunter-tracker R.J. Cunninghame, included scientists from the Smithsonian, and was joined by Frederick Selous, famous big game hunter and explorer. Participants included Kermit Roosevelt, Edgar Alexander Mearns, Edmund Heller, and John Alden Loring. The team killed or trapped 11,400 animals, from insects and moles to hippopotamuses and elephants. The 1,000 large animals included 512 big game animals, including six rare white rhinos. Tons of salted carcasses and skins were shipped to Washington; it took years to mount them all. Regarding the large number taken, Roosevelt said, &quot;I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned&quot;. He wrote a detailed account of the trip in &quot;African Game Trails&quot;.

After his safari, Roosevelt traveled north to embark on a tour of Europe. Stopping first in Egypt, he commented favorably on British rule, stating Egypt was not yet ready for independence. He refused a meeting with the Pope due to a dispute over a group of Methodists active in Rome. He met with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King George V of Great Britain, and other leaders. In Oslo, Roosevelt delivered a speech calling for limitations on naval armaments, a strengthening of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the creation of a &quot;League of Peace&quot; among the world powers. He delivered the Romanes Lecture at Oxford, where he denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society. Though Roosevelt attempted to avoid domestic politics, he quietly met with Gifford Pinchot, who related his disappointment with the Taft Administration. Pinchot had been forced to resign as head of the forest service after clashing with Taft&#x27;s Interior Secretary, Richard Ballinger. Roosevelt returned to the U.S. in June 1910. Four months later, Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to fly in a plane, staying aloft for 4 minutes in a Wright brothers-designed craft.

Roosevelt relied on Andrew Carnegie for financing his expedition. In return, Carnegie asked the ex-president to mediate the growing conflict between the cousins who ruled Britain and Germany. Roosevelt started to, but the scheme collapsed when King Edward VII suddenly died. David Nasaw argues Roosevelt systematically deceived and manipulated Carnegie and held the elderly man in contempt.

===Republican Party schism===
Roosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a copy of himself, but recoiled as Taft began to display his individuality. He was offended on election night when Taft indicated his success had been possible not just through Roosevelt, but also Taft&#x27;s half-brother Charles P. Taft. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft did not consult him about cabinet appointments. Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft&#x27;s conservation policies and his handling of the tariff, when he concentrated power with conservative party leaders in Congress. Others have argued that Taft abided by the goals and procedures of the &quot;Square Deal&quot; promoted by Roosevelt in his first term. The problem was Roosevelt and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals, such as curbing the judiciary, which Taft rejected.

Roosevelt urged progressives to take control of the Republican Party, and to avoid splitting it in a way that would hand the presidency to the Democrats in 1912. To that end, Roosevelt publicly expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with the president in June 1910.

==== Dispute over court power ====
Roosevelt gave speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910 in which he severely criticized the nation&#x27;s judiciary. Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1905 decision in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, he accused federal courts of undermining democracy, branding the suspect jurists &quot;fossilized judges,&quot; and compared their tendency to strike down progressive reform legislation, to Justice Roger B. Taney&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857). To ensure the constitution served the public interests, Roosevelt joined other progressives in calling for the &quot;judicial recall,&quot; which would enable popular majorities to remove judges from office and reverse unpopular judicial decisions. This attack horrified Taft, who, though he privately agreed that &quot;Lochner&quot; and other decisions had been poorly decided, was an adamant believer in judicial authority preserving constitutional government. His horror was shared with other prominent members of the elite legal community, and solidified in Taft&#x27;s mind that Roosevelt must not be permitted to regain the presidency.

==== Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;New Nationalism&quot; ====
In August 1910, Roosevelt escalated the rivalry with a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career. It marked his public break with Taft and conservative Republicans. Advocating a program he called the &quot;New Nationalism&quot;, Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and the need to control corporate creation and combination. He called for a ban on corporate political contributions. Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from William Barnes Jr.. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft&#x27;s support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention. Roosevelt campaigned for the Republicans in the 1910 elections, in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since 1892. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York State senator Franklin D. Roosevelt, who argued he represented his distant cousin&#x27;s policies better than his Republican opponent.

The Republican progressives interpreted the defeats as a compelling argument for reorganization of the party in 1911. Senator Robert M. La Follette joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor Hiram Johnson to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and replace Taft at the national level. Despite his skepticism of the league, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote articles for &quot;The Outlook&quot;, defending what he called &quot;the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy&quot;. With Roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912, La Follette declared his own candidacy in June 1911. Roosevelt continually criticized Taft after the 1910 elections, and the break between them became final after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; Roosevelt was humiliated because he had personally approved an acquisition the Justice Department was now challenging. However, Roosevelt was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; he hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in 1912.

====Battling Taft over arbitration treaties====
Taft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace. In 1911 he and Secretary of State Philander C. Knox negotiated treaties with Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or another tribunal. These were signed in August 1911, but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with Senate leaders during negotiations. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing them.

Arbitration revealed a dispute among American progressives. One faction, led by Taft looked to it as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer, understanding the legal issues. Taft&#x27;s base was the conservative business community that supported peace movements before 1914. However, he failed to mobilize them. The businessmen believed economic rivalries were the cause of war, and that trade led to an interdependent world that would make war expensive and useless. However, an opposing faction, led by Roosevelt, ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of war as the only solution to serious international disputes. Roosevelt worked with close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the treaties. Roosevelt was acting to sabotage Taft&#x27;s campaign promises. At a deeper level, Roosevelt truly believed arbitration was a naïve solution and great issues had to be decided by war. The Rooseveltian approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen&#x27;s calculation of profit and national interest.

===Election of 1912===
====Republican primaries and convention====

In November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party&#x27;s nomination for president. Roosevelt conspicuously declined to refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, &quot;I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership.&quot; In January 1912, Roosevelt declared &quot;if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve&quot;. Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions. In reaction to Roosevelt&#x27;s proposals Taft said, &quot;Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics&quot;.

Roosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the party from defeat in the upcoming election. In February 1912 in Boston, Roosevelt said, &quot;I will accept the nomination for president if it is tendered to me&quot;. Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge thought division would lead to defeat in the election, while Taft believed he would be defeated either in the primary or general election.

The 1912 primaries represented the first extensive use of the presidential primary, a reform achievement of the progressive movement. The Republican primaries in the South, where party regulars dominated, went for Taft, as did New York, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Meanwhile, Roosevelt won in Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, California, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. At the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Taft won the nomination on the first ballot.

According to Lewis L. Gould, in 1912 Roosevelt saw Taft as the agent of &quot;the forces of reaction and of political crookedness&quot;... Roosevelt had become the most dangerous man in American history, said Taft, &quot;because of his hold upon the less intelligent voters and the discontented.&quot; The Republican National Committee, dominated by the Taft forces, awarded 235 delegates to the president and 19 to Roosevelt...Roosevelt believed himself entitled to 72 delegates from Arizona, California, Texas and Washington that had been given to Taft. Firm in his conviction that the nomination was being stolen from him, Roosevelt ...told cheering supporters that there was &quot;a great moral issue&quot; at stake and he should have &quot;sixty to eighty lawfully elected delegates&quot; added to his total...Roosevelt ended his speech declaring: &quot;Fearless of the future; unheeding of our individual fates; with unflinching hearts and undimmed eyes; we stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord!&quot;

====Progressive Party====
Once his defeat appeared probable, Roosevelt announced he would &quot;accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and I shall fight to the end, win or lose&quot;. Roosevelt prophetically said, &quot;My feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive&quot;. Roosevelt left the Republican Party and created the Progressive Party. Leadership of the new party included a range of reformers. Jane Addams campaigned vigorously for the party as a breakthrough in social reform. Gifford Pinchot represented environmentalists and anti-trust crusaders. Publisher Frank Munsey provided cash and George W. Perkins, a Wall Street financier came from the efficiency movement. He handled the new party&#x27;s finances efficiently but was distrusted by many reformers.

Governor Hiram Johnson controlled the California party, forcing out the Taft supporters. He was nominated as Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate. Roosevelt&#x27;s platform echoed his radical 1907–1908 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from selfish interests:

Though many Progressive party activists in the North opposed the steady loss of civil rights for blacks, Roosevelt ran a &quot;lily-white&quot; campaign in the South. Rival all-white and all-black delegations from southern states arrived at the Progressive national convention, and Roosevelt decided to seat the all-white delegations. Nevertheless, he won few votes outside traditional Republican strongholds. Out of 1,100 counties in the South, Roosevelt won two counties in Alabama, one in Arkansas, seven in North Carolina, three in Georgia, 17 in Tennessee, two in Texas, one in Virginia, and none in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina.

====Attempted assassination====

On October 14, 1912, while arriving at a campaign event in Milwaukee, Roosevelt was shot by delusional saloonkeeper John Schrank, who believed the ghost of assassinated president William McKinley had directed him to kill Roosevelt. The bullet lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest after penetrating his eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page folded copy of the speech titled &quot;&quot;. Schrank was disarmed and captured by Roosevelt&#x27;s stenographer, Elbert E. Martin as he attempted to fire a second time, and might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed. Roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right, then ordered police to take Schrank and make sure no violence was done to him.

As an experienced hunter and anatomist, Roosevelt correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung. He declined to go to hospital immediately and instead delivered a with blood seeping into his shirt. Only afterwards did he accept medical attention. Probes and an x-ray showed the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded it would be less dangerous to leave it than attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet in him for the rest of his life. Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson suspended their campaigning until Roosevelt resumed his. When asked if the shooting would affect his election campaign, he said to the reporter &quot;I&#x27;m fit as a bull moose.&quot; The bull moose became a symbol of Roosevelt and the Progressive Party, and it often was referred to as the Bull Moose Party. He spent two weeks recuperating before returning to campaign. He wrote a friend about the bullet, &quot;I do not mind it any more than if it were in my waistcoat-pocket.&quot;

====Democratic victory====
After the Democrats nominated Governor Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt did not expect to win the election, as Wilson had compiled a record attractive to progressive Democrats who might have considered voting for Roosevelt. Roosevelt still campaigned vigorously, and the election developed into a two-person contest despite Taft&#x27;s quiet presence. Roosevelt respected Wilson, but they differed on various issues; Wilson opposed federal intervention regarding women&#x27;s suffrage or child labor, and attacked Roosevelt&#x27;s tolerance of large businesses.

Roosevelt won 4.1 million votes (27%), compared to Taft&#x27;s 3.5 million (23%) and Wilson&#x27;s 6.3 million (42%). Wilson scored a landslide in the Electoral College with 435 electoral votes; Roosevelt 88, and Taft 8. Pennsylvania was the only eastern state won by Roosevelt; in the Midwest, he carried Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota; in the West, California, and Washington. Roosevelt garnered a higher share of the popular vote than any other third-party presidential candidate in history and won the most states of any third-party candidate after the Civil War.

===South American expedition (1913–1914)===
In 1907 a friend of Roosevelt&#x27;s, John Augustine Zahm, invited Roosevelt to help plan a research expedition to South America. To finance it, Roosevelt obtained support from the American Museum of Natural History in return for promising to bring back new animal specimens. Roosevelt&#x27;s popular book, &quot;Through the Brazilian Wilderness&quot; describes his expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition, co-named after its leader, Brazilian Cândido Rondon.

Once in South America, a more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the river Duvida and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the Amazon River. Duvida was later renamed Roosevelt River. Roosevelt&#x27;s crew consisted of his son Kermit, Colonel Rondon, naturalist George Kruck Cherrie, Brazilian Lieutenant João Lira, team physician José Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. The initial expedition started tenuously on December 9, 1913, at the height of rainy season. The trip down Duvida started on February 27, 1914.

Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped in to try to prevent canoes from smashing against the rocks. The flesh wound he received, however, soon gave him tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in Cuba. The infection weakened Roosevelt so greatly that six weeks in, he had to be attended to constantly by the expedition&#x27;s physician and Kermit. By then, he could not walk because of the infection and an infirmity in the other leg, due to a traffic accident a decade earlier. Roosevelt had chest pains and a fever that soared to and made him delirious. Regarding his condition as a threat to others&#x27; survival, Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed, preparing to commit suicide with morphine. Only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue.

Despite Roosevelt&#x27;s continued decline and loss of , Rondon reduced the pace for map-making, which required regular stops to fix their position by sun-based survey. Upon Roosevelt&#x27;s return to New York, friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote, perhaps prophetically, to a friend that it had cut his life short by ten years. For the rest of his few remaining years, he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery. Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home, critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over long. When he had recovered sufficiently, he addressed a standing-room-only convention organized in Washington, by the National Geographic Society and satisfactorily defended his claims.

===Final years===
Roosevelt returned to the U.S. in May 1914. Though he was outraged by the Wilson Administration&#x27;s conclusion of a treaty that expressed &quot;sincere regret&quot; for the way in which the U.S. had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many reforms passed. Roosevelt made campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the fledgling third party. Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt. In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the 1916 Progressive National Convention at the same time as the 1916 Republican National Convention. When the Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, Roosevelt declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support the Republican candidate. Though Roosevelt had long disliked Hughes, he disliked Wilson even more, and campaigned energetically for the Republican nominee. However, Wilson won the 1916 election by a narrow margin. The Progressives disappeared as a party, and Roosevelt and many of his followers re-joined the Republican Party.

====World War I====
When the First World War began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the Allies and demanded a harsher policy against Germany, especially regarding submarine warfare. Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of Wilson, calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights. In 1916, while campaigning for Hughes, Roosevelt repeatedly denounced Irish Americans and German Americans whom he described as unpatriotic; he insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a &quot;hyphenated American&quot; who juggled multiple loyalties. In March 1917, Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the Rough Riders. However, President Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France, but instead an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John J. Pershing. Roosevelt never forgave Wilson, and published &quot;The Foes of Our Own Household&quot;, an indictment of the sitting president. Roosevelt&#x27;s youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France, was killed when shot down behind German lines on July 14, 1918, aged 20. Roosevelt never recovered from his loss.

====League of Nations====

Roosevelt was an early supporter of the modern view that there needs to be a global order. In his Nobel prize address of 1910, he said, &quot;it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others.&quot; It would have executive power such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked. He called for American participation.

When World War I broke out, Roosevelt proposed &quot;a World League for the Peace of Righteousness&quot;, in September 1914, which would preserve sovereignty but limit armaments and require arbitration. He added it should be &quot;solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court, then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice.&quot; In 1915 he outlined this plan more specifically, urging nations guarantee their entire military force, if necessary, against any nation that refused to carry out arbitration decrees or violated rights of other nations. Though Roosevelt had some concerns about the impact on United States sovereignty, he insisted that such a league would only work if the United States participated as one of the &quot;joint guarantors&quot;. Roosevelt referred to this plan in a 1918 speech as &quot;the most feasible for...a league of nations&quot;. By this time Wilson was strongly hostile to Roosevelt and Lodge and developed his own plans for a different League of Nations. It became reality along Wilson&#x27;s lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Roosevelt denounced Wilson&#x27;s approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations. In the end, on March 19, 1920, Wilson had Democratic Senators vote against the League with the Lodge Reservations and the United States never joined the League of Nations.

====Final political activities====

Roosevelt&#x27;s attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1918. He declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. Though his health was uncertain, he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, &quot;If they take me, they&#x27;ll have to take me without a single modification of the things that I have always stood for!&quot; He wrote William Allen White, &quot;I wish to do everything in my power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as it was under Lincoln.&quot; Accordingly, he told the 1918 state convention of the Maine Republican Party that he stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations.

While his political profile remained high, Roosevelt&#x27;s physical condition deteriorated throughout 1918 due to the long-term effects of jungle diseases. He was hospitalized for seven weeks and never fully recovered.

==Death==

On the night of January 5, 1919, Roosevelt suffered breathing problems. After receiving treatment from his physician, George W. Faller, he felt better and went to bed. Roosevelt&#x27;s last words were either &quot;Please put out that light, James&quot; or &quot;James, will you please put out the light.&quot;, said to his family servant James E. Amos. Between 4:00 and 4:15 the next morning, Roosevelt died at the age of 60 in his sleep at Sagamore Hill of a pulmonary embolism.

Upon receiving word of his death, his son Archibald telegraphed his siblings: &quot;The old lion is dead.&quot; Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s vice president, Thomas R. Marshall, said that &quot;Death had to take Roosevelt sleeping, for if he had been awake, there would have been a fight.&quot; Following a private farewell service in the North Room at Sagamore Hill, a simple funeral was held at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay. Vice President Thomas R. Marshall, former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes, Senators Warren G. Harding and Henry Cabot Lodge, and former President William Howard Taft were among the mourners. The procession route to Youngs Memorial Cemetery was lined with spectators and a squad of mounted policemen who had ridden from New York City. Roosevelt was buried on a hillside overlooking Oyster Bay.

==Writer==

Roosevelt was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. Roosevelt was also an avid reader of poetry. Poet Robert Frost said that Roosevelt &quot;was our kind. He quoted poetry to me. He knew poetry.&quot;

As an editor of &quot;The Outlook&quot;, Roosevelt had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, Roosevelt wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including his autobiography, &quot;The Rough Riders&quot;, &quot;History of the Naval War of 1812&quot;, and others on subjects such as ranching, explorations, and wildlife. His most ambitious book was the four-volume narrative &quot;The Winning of the West&quot;, focused on the American frontier in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Roosevelt said that the American character—indeed a new &quot;American race&quot;—had emerged from the heroic wilderness hunters and Indian fighters, acting on the frontier with little government help.

In 1905, Roosevelt became embroiled in a widely publicized literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy. A few years earlier, naturalist John Burroughs had published an article entitled &quot;Real and Sham Natural History&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, attacking popular writers of the day such as Ernest Thompson Seton, Charles G. D. Roberts, and William J. Long for their fantastical representations of wildlife. Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs&#x27;s criticisms and published several essays denouncing the booming genre of &quot;naturalistic&quot; animal stories as &quot;yellow journalism of the woods&quot;. It was the President himself who popularized the negative term &quot;nature faker&quot; to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism.

==Character and beliefs==

British scholar Marcus Cunliffe evaluates the liberal argument that Roosevelt was an opportunist, exhibitionist, and imperialist. Cunliffe praises Roosevelt&#x27;s versatility, his respect for law, and his sincerity. He argues that Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy was better than his detractors allege. Cunliffe calls him &quot;a big man in several respects&quot;.

Roosevelt was a Freemason and member of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was also a member of The Explorers Club.
Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called, in an 1899 speech, &quot;The Strenuous Life&quot;. To this end, he exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times each week, a practice he regularly continued as president until being hit so hard in the face he became blind in his left eye (a fact not made public until many years later). Roosevelt began to believe in the utility of jiu-jitsu training after training with Yoshitsugu Yamashita. Concerned that the U.S. would lose its military supremacy to rising powers like Japan, Roosevelt began to advocate for jiu-jitsu training for American soldiers. Roosevelt was an enthusiastic singlestick player and, according to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, showed up at a White House reception with his arm bandaged after a bout with General Leonard Wood in 1905.

Historians have often emphasized Roosevelt&#x27;s warrior persona. Richard D. White Jr states, &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s warrior spirit framed his views of national politics, [and] international relations.&quot; He took aggressive positions regarding war with Spain in 1898, Colombia in 1903, and especially with Germany, from 1915 to 1917. As a demonstration of American naval might, he sent the Great White Fleet around the world in 1907–1909. He boasted in his autobiography:
Historian Howard K. Beale has argued:
Roosevelt often praised moral behavior but apparently never made a spiritual confession of his own faith. After the 1884 death of his wife, he almost never mentioned Jesus in public or private. His rejection of dogma and spirituality, says biographer William Harbaugh, led to a broad tolerance. Roosevelt publicly encouraged church attendance and was a conscientious churchgoer himself, a lifelong adherent of the Dutch Reformed church. When gas rationing was introduced during the First World War, he walked the three miles from his home to the local church and back, even after a serious operation. According to Christian Reisner, &quot;Religion was as natural to Mr. Roosevelt as breathing&quot;, and when the travel library for Roosevelt&#x27;s famous Smithsonian-sponsored African expedition was being assembled, the Bible was, according to his sister, &quot;the first book selected&quot;. In an address delivered to the Long Island Bible Society in 1901, Roosevelt declared that:
==Political positions==
When he assumed the presidency, Roosevelt reassured many conservatives, stating that &quot;the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.&quot; The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president&#x27;s independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the Northern Securities Company, and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker J.P. Morgan. In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party. Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution. His Square Deal domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection. The Square Deal evolved into his program of &quot;New Nationalism&quot;, which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.

===Foreign policy beliefs===
In the analysis by Henry Kissinger, Roosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally. The idea of being a passive &quot;city on the hill&quot; model that others could look up to, he rejected. Roosevelt, trained in biology, was a social Darwinist who believed in survival of the fittest. The international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict. The United States had all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe. The United States had a duty to act decisively. For example, in terms of the Monroe Doctrine, the United States had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere. But there was more, as he expressed in his Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine: the U.S. had to be the policeman of the region because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if United States did not do it, European powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine.

Roosevelt was a realist and a conservative. He deplored many of the increasingly popular idealistic liberal themes, such as were promoted by William Jennings Bryan, the anti-imperialists, and Woodrow Wilson. Kissinger says he rejected the efficacy of international law. Roosevelt argued that if a country could not protect its own interests, the international community could not help very much. He ridiculed disarmament proposals that were increasingly common. He saw no likelihood of an international power capable of checking wrongdoing on a major scale. As for world government: I regard the Wilson–Bryan attitude of trusting to fantastic peace treaties, too impossible promises, to all kinds of scraps of paper without any backing in efficient force, as abhorrent. It is infinitely better for a nation and for the world to have the Frederick the Great and Bismarck tradition as regards foreign policy than to have the Bryan or Bryan–Wilson attitude as a permanent national attitude... A milk-and-water righteousness unbacked by force is...as wicked as and even more mischievous than force divorced from righteousness.

On his international outlook, Roosevelt favored spheres of influence, whereby one great power would generally prevail, such as the United States in the Western Hemisphere or Great Britain in the Indian subcontinent. Japan fit that role and he approved. However, he had deep distrust of both Germany and Russia.

==Legacy==
Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation&#x27;s political system by placing the &quot;bully pulpit&quot; of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues. His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to liberals and progressives for his early proposals that foreshadowed the modern welfare state, including federal taxation, labor reforms, and more direct democracy. Conservationists admire Roosevelt for prioritizing the environment and selflessness towards future generations. Conservatives and nationalists respect his commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values. Dalton states, &quot;Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century.&quot;

Liberals and socialists criticize his interventionist and imperialist approach, while libertarians reject his vision of the welfare state. Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.

===Persona and masculinity===

Dalton says Roosevelt is remembered as &quot;one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape&quot;. His friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed: &quot;Roosevelt, more than any other man... showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter—the quality that medieval theology assigned to God—he was pure act&quot;. Cooper compared him with Woodrow Wilson, highlighting their roles as warrior and priest. Dalton stressed Roosevelt&#x27;s strenuous life. Brands calls Roosevelt &quot;the last romantic&quot;, viewing his romantic notion of life as emerging from his belief in physical bravery as the highest virtue. Henry F. Pringle, who won the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; (1931), stated the &quot;Roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men.&quot;

Roosevelt as the exemplar of American masculinity has become a major theme. He often warned that men were becoming too complacent, failing in their duties to propagate the race and exhibit masculine vigor. Historian Serge Ricard noted that Roosevelt&#x27;s advocacy of the &quot;Strenuous Life&quot; made him an ideal subject for psycho-historical analysis of aggressive manhood in his era. He promoted competitive sports for physically strengthening American men and supported organizations like the Boy Scouts, to mold and strengthen the character of American boys. Brands shows that heroic displays of bravery were central to Roosevelt&#x27;s image:
 In 1902, Théobald Chartran was commissioned to paint Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential portrait. Roosevelt hid it in a closet before having it destroyed because it made him look like a &quot;meek kitten&quot;. Roosevelt instead chose John Singer Sargent to paint his portrait.

===Memorials and cultural depictions===
Roosevelt was included with Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927.

Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick&quot; ideology is still quoted by politicians and columnists—not only in English, but in many translations. Another popular legacy is the teddy bear—named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902.

For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt&#x27;s commanders recommended him for the Medal of Honor. However, the recommendation lacked any eyewitnesses, and the effort was tainted by Roosevelt&#x27;s lobbying of the War Department. In the 1990s, Roosevelt&#x27;s supporters again recommended the award, which was denied by the Secretary of the Army on the basis the decorations board determined &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s bravery in battle did not rise to the level that would justify the Medal of Honor and, indeed, it did not rise to the level of men who fought in that engagement.&quot; Nevertheless, politicians apparently convinced the secretary to reconsider and reverse himself, leading to the charge it was a &quot;politically motivated award&quot;. In 2001, President Bill Clinton awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor for his charge. He is the only president to have received it.

The United States Navy named two ships for Roosevelt: the , a submarine in commission from 1961 to 1982, and the , an aircraft carrier on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986. Roosevelt has appeared on five U.S. Postage stamps, the first being issued in 1922. In 1956, the United States Postal Service released a 6¢ Liberty Issue postage stamp honoring Roosevelt. A 32¢ stamp was issued in 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century series. Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota is named after him. The America the Beautiful Quarters series features Roosevelt riding a horse on the national park&#x27;s quarter. Asteroid 188693 Roosevelt, discovered in 2005, was named after him. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on November 8, 2019 (). Robert Peary named the Roosevelt Range and Roosevelt Land after him.

Roosevelt has also been portrayed in films and television series such as &quot;Brighty of the Grand Canyon&quot;, &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;, &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;,&quot; and Law of the Plainsman.&quot; Robin Williams portrayed Roosevelt in the form of a wax mannequin that comes to life in &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; and its sequels. Roosevelt is the leader of the American civilization in the video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;.

For 80 years, an equestrian statue of Roosevelt, sitting above a Native American and an African American, stood in front of New York&#x27;s American Museum of Natural History. In 2022, after years of lobbying by activists, the statue was removed. Museum president Ellen V. Futter said the decision did not reflect a judgment about Roosevelt but the sculpture&#x27;s &quot;hierarchical composition&quot;.

===Audiovisual media===
Roosevelt was one of the first presidents whose voice was recorded for posterity. Several of his recorded speeches survive. A 1912 voice recording of &quot;The Right of the People to Rule&quot;, which preserves Roosevelt&#x27;s lower timbre ranges particularly well for its time, is available from the Michigan State University libraries. The audio clip sponsored by the Authentic History Center includes his defense of the Progressive Party in 1912, wherein he proclaims it the &quot;party of the people&quot; – in contrast with the other major parties.

<text>Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus ( ; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March AD 37) was Roman emperor from AD 14 until 37. He succeeded his stepfather Augustus, the first Roman emperor. Tiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC to Roman politician Tiberius Claudius Nero and his wife, Livia Drusilla. In 38 BC, Tiberius&#x27;s mother divorced his father and married Augustus. Following the untimely deaths of Augustus&#x27;s two grandsons and adopted heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus&#x27;s successor. Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat and one of the most successful Roman generals: his conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the empire&#x27;s northern frontier.

Early in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus&#x27;s friend, distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania and marry Agrippa&#x27;s widow, Augustus&#x27; own daughter (Tiberius&#x27;s step-sister) Julia. Tiberius reluctantly gave in. This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; ultimately, Julia was sent into exile by her father. Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. On Augustus&#x27;s death in 14, Tiberius became &quot;princeps&quot; at the age of 55. He seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus.

From the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with the Senate and suspected many plots against him. Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. After the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in AD 19 and his son Drusus in 23, Tiberius became reclusive and aloof. In 26 he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his ambitious praetorian prefect Sejanus, whom he later had executed for treason, and then Sejanus&#x27;s replacement, Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Germanicus&#x27;s son Caligula, whose lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours drained much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers through good management.

Tiberius allowed the worship of his divine &quot;Genius&quot; in only one temple, in Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces, and promoted restraint in the empire-wide cult to the deceased Augustus. When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him &quot;the gloomiest of men&quot;.

== Early life ==

=== Family and youth ===

Tiberius was born in Rome on 16 November 42 BC to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla. Both of his biological parents belonged to the &quot;gens Claudia&quot;, an ancient patrician family that came to prominence in the early years of the republic. His mother was also a member of the Livii family, an ancient plebeian but prominent family, through the adoption into it of his maternal grandfather. Little is recorded of Tiberius&#x27;s early life. In 39 BC, his mother divorced his biological father and, despite being pregnant again by Tiberius Nero, married Octavian, later known as Augustus. In 38 BC his brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, was born. In 32 BC, Tiberius, at the age of nine, delivered the eulogy for his biological father at the &quot;rostra&quot;. In 29 BC, he rode in the triumphal chariot along with his adoptive father Octavian in celebration of the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at Actium.

=== Succession question ===

In 23 BC, Augustus became gravely ill, and his possible death threatened to plunge the Roman world into even more civil conflict. Historians generally agree that it is during this time that the question of Augustus&#x27;s heir became most acute, and while Augustus had seemed to indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus&#x27;s chief problem. In response, a series of potential heirs seem to have been selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24 BC, at the age of seventeen, Tiberius entered politics under Augustus&#x27;s direction, receiving the position of &quot;quaestor&quot;, and was granted the right to stand for election as &quot;praetor&quot; and &quot;consul&quot; five years in advance of the age required by law. Similar provisions were made for Drusus.

== Civil and military career ==

=== Early career and marriage ===

Shortly thereafter Tiberius began appearing in court as an advocate, and it was presumably at this time that his interest in Greek rhetoric began. In 20 BC, Tiberius went east to join Augustus. The Parthian Empire had previously captured the standards of the legions under the command of Marcus Licinius Crassus (53 BC) (at the Battle of Carrhae), Decidius Saxa (40 BC), and Mark Antony (36 BC) and, after negotiations with Parthia&#x27;s King Phraates IV, either Augustus or Tiberius, or perhaps both together, were able to reclaim them for Rome. Tiberius then led a sizeable force into Armenia, presumably to establish it as a Roman client state and end the threat it posed on the Roman-Parthian border. Augustus was able to reach a compromise whereby the standards were returned, and Armenia remained a neutral territory between the two powers.

Tiberius married Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of Augustus&#x27;s close friend and most famed general, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. He was appointed to the position of &quot;praetor&quot;, and was sent with his legions to assist his brother Drusus in campaigns in the west. While Drusus focused his forces in Gallia Narbonensis and along the German frontier, Tiberius combated the tribes in the Alps and within Transalpine Gaul, conquering Raetia. In 15 BC he discovered the sources of the Danube, and soon afterward the bend of the middle course. Returning to Rome in 13 BC, Tiberius was appointed as &quot;consul&quot;, and around this same time his son, Drusus Julius Caesar, was born.

Agrippa&#x27;s death in 12 BC elevated Tiberius and Drusus with respect to the succession. At Augustus&#x27;s request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus&#x27;s daughter and Agrippa&#x27;s widow. Tiberius was very reluctant to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married, and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour. Suetonius claims that when Tiberius ran into Vipsania again, he followed her home crying and begging forgiveness. Soon afterwards, Tiberius met with Augustus, and steps were taken to ensure that Tiberius and Vipsania would never meet again. Tiberius continued to be elevated by Augustus, and after Agrippa&#x27;s death and his brother Drusus&#x27;s death in 9 BC, seemed the clear candidate for succession. As such, in 12 BC he received military commissions in Pannonia and Germania, both areas highly volatile and of key importance to Augustan policy.

=== Military campaigns ===

In 6 BC, Tiberius launched a pincer movement against the Marcomanni. Setting out northwest from Carnuntum on the Danube with four legions, Tiberius passed through Quadi territory in order to invade Marcomanni territory from the east. Meanwhile, general Gaius Sentius Saturninus would depart east from Moguntiacum on the Rhine with two or three legions, pass through newly annexed Hermunduri territory, and attack the Marcomanni from the west. The campaign was a resounding success, but Tiberius could not subjugate the Marcomanni because he was soon summoned to the Rhine frontier to protect Rome&#x27;s new conquests in Germania. He returned to Rome and was consul for a second time in 7 BC, and in 6 BC was granted tribunician power (&quot;tribunicia potestas&quot;) and control in the East, positions that Agrippa had held before him.

== Midlife ==

=== Retirement to Rhodes ===

In 6 BC, while on the verge of accepting command in the East and becoming the second-most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The motives for Tiberius&#x27;s withdrawal are unclear. Some historians have speculated that Tiberius and Drusus were only ever intended as caretakers, and would have been swept aside once Julia&#x27;s two sons by Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius, were adopted as Augustus&#x27;s heirs and came of age. The promiscuous, and very public behaviour of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Tacitus understood this to be Tiberius&#x27;s innermost reason for moving to Rhodes, a reflection of his hatred of Julia and his longing for Vipsania. Tiberius, forbidden to see the woman he loved, found himself married to a woman he loathed, and publicly humiliated by her nighttime escapades in the Roman Forum.

Whatever Tiberius&#x27;s motives, his withdrawal was almost disastrous for Augustus&#x27;s succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still in their early teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There was no longer a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus&#x27;s death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family&#x27;s allies, would continue to hold power should the position of &quot;Princeps&quot; survive. Somewhat melodramatic stories tell of Augustus pleading with Tiberius to stay, even going so far as to stage a serious illness. Tiberius&#x27;s response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes. Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.

=== Heir to Augustus ===

With Tiberius&#x27;s departure, succession rested solely on Augustus&#x27;s two young grandsons, Lucius and Gaius Caesar. The situation became more precarious in AD 2 with the death of Lucius. Augustus, with perhaps some pressure from Livia, allowed Tiberius to return to Rome as a private citizen and nothing more. In AD 4, Gaius was killed in Armenia, and Augustus had no other choice but to turn to Tiberius. The death of Gaius initiated a flurry of activity in the household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted in 26 June as full son and heir, and in turn he was required to adopt his nephew Germanicus, the son of his brother Nero Claudius Drusus and Augustus&#x27;s niece Antonia Minor. Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power as well as a share of Augustus&#x27;s &quot;maius imperium&quot;, something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had. In AD 7, Agrippa Postumus, a younger brother of Gaius and Lucius, was disowned by Augustus and banished to the island of Pianosa, to live in solitary confinement.

Thus, when in AD 13, the powers held by Tiberius were made equal, rather than second, to Augustus&#x27;s own powers, he was for all intents and purposes a &quot;co-Princeps&quot; with Augustus, and, in the event of the latter&#x27;s passing, would simply continue to rule without an interregnum or possible upheaval.

However, according to Suetonius, after a two-year stint in Germania, which lasted from AD 10–12,&quot;Tiberius returned and celebrated the triumph which he had postponed, accompanied also by his generals, for whom he had obtained the triumphal regalia. And before turning to enter the Capitol, he dismounted from his chariot and fell at the knees of his father, who was presiding over the ceremonies.&quot; &quot;Since the consuls caused a law to be passed soon after this that he should govern the provinces jointly with Augustus and hold the census with him, he set out for Illyricum on the conclusion of the lustral ceremonies.&quot;Thus, according to Suetonius, these ceremonies and the declaration of his &quot;co-Princeps&quot; took place in the year AD 12, after Tiberius&#x27;s return from Germania. &quot;But he was at once recalled, and finding Augustus in his last illness but still alive, he spent an entire day with him in private.&quot; Augustus died on 19 August AD 14, a month before his 76th birthday and exactly 56 years after he first assumed the consulship. He was cremated with all due ceremony and, as had been arranged beforehand, deified, his will read, and Tiberius, now a middle-aged man at 55, was confirmed as his sole surviving heir. Tiberius peacefully took power, unchallenged by any rivals.

==Emperor==
=== Early reign ===
On 17 September Tiberius called the Senate in order to validate his position as &quot;Princeps&quot;, and, as had Augustus before him, grant himself its powers. Tiberius already had the administrative and political powers of the &quot;Princeps&quot;, but he lacked the titles of &quot;Augustus&quot; and &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; (&quot;Father of the country&quot;), and refused the Civic Crown. Like Augustus before him, Tiberius may have sought to represent himself as a reluctant yet devoted public servant, no more than an ordinary citizen who wanted to serve the state and people to the best of his ability, but his refusal of these titular, quasi-religious honours, and his reluctance to accept the full powers of a &quot;princeps&quot; were taken as insults to the elite who offered them; signs of hypocrisy, not humility. According to Tacitus, Tiberius derided the Senate as &quot;men fit to be slaves&quot;. Antagonism between Tiberius and his senate seems to have been a feature of his rule. In his first few years as emperor, Tiberius seems to have wanted the Senate to act alone, with no reference to him or his responsibilities as &quot;first Senator&quot;. His direct orders were rather vague, inspiring debates on what he actually meant, rather than passing his legislation.

=== Germanicus ===
The Roman legions in Pannonia and Germania had not been paid the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and showed early signs of mutiny when it was clear that a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming.

Germanicus and Tiberius&#x27;s son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line. Germanicus took charge of the mutinous troops and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, promising that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus&#x27;s forces took over all the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. They took control of the Teutoburg forest, where three Roman legions and their auxiliary cohorts, led by Publius Quinctilius Varus, had been annihilated by Germanic tribes several years before. Germanicus took back the legionary standards lost in that disaster, saving them from the disgrace of captivity. These bold and successful actions increased Germanicus&#x27;s already high popular standing. After his return to Rome, Germanicus was awarded a full triumph, which he celebrated in AD 17. It was the first full triumph held since Augustus&#x27;s own in 29 BC.

In AD 18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, like Agrippa and Tiberius before him. This was interpreted as a sign that he would be Tiberius&#x27;s successor; but Germanicus died just over a year later, having accused Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the governor of Syria, of poisoning him.

The Pisones had been longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with the young Octavian after his marriage to Livia, the mother of Tiberius. Germanicus&#x27;s death and accusations indicted the new &quot;Princeps&quot;. Piso was placed on trial and, according to Tacitus, threatened to implicate Tiberius. Whether the governor actually could connect the &quot;Princeps&quot; to the death of Germanicus is unknown; rather than continuing to stand trial when it became evident that the Senate was against him, Piso committed suicide.

In AD 22, Tiberius shared his tribunician authority with his son Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year. In AD 23, Drusus died in mysterious circumstances, and Tiberius seems to have made no effort to elevate a replacement. In AD 26, Tiberius moved to an imperial villa-complex he had inherited from Augustus, on the island of Capri. It was just off the coast of Campania, which was a traditional holiday retreat for Rome&#x27;s upper classes, particularly those who valued cultured leisure  Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian Augustus Rome, 23 September 63 BC – Nola, 19 August 14) founder of the Regio I Latium et Campania, was the first of the eleven regions of Augustan Italy, rightly First because it contained the city of Rome. &quot;Campania was not the Campania of holidays but the territory of Rome.(otium) and a Hellenised lifestyle.

=== Tiberius in Capri, with Sejanus in Rome ===
Lucius Aelius Sejanus had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD 15. As Tiberius became more embittered with the position of &quot;Princeps&quot;, he began to depend more and more upon the limited secretariat left to him by Augustus, and specifically upon Sejanus and the Praetorians. In AD 17 or 18, Tiberius had trimmed the ranks of the Praetorian Guard responsible for the defence of the city, and had moved it from encampments outside of the city walls into the city itself, giving Sejanus access to somewhere between 6000 and 9000 troops.

The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus, at least in the eyes of Tiberius, who thereafter refers to him as his &quot;Socius Laborum&quot; (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius&#x27;s withdrawal in AD 26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.

Sejanus&#x27;s position was not quite that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD 25 to Tiberius&#x27;s niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus&#x27;s Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to have checked his overt power for a time. Her death in AD 29 changed all that.

Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians (such as Curtius Atticus) in the city of Rome, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Germanicus&#x27;s widow Agrippina the Elder and two of her sons, Nero Julius Caesar and Drusus Caesar were arrested and exiled in AD 30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances. In Sejanus&#x27;s purge of Agrippina the Elder and her family, Caligula, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla were the only survivors.

In 31, Sejanus held the consulship with Tiberius &quot;,&quot; and began his play for power in earnest. Precisely what happened is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line to place himself, as an adopted Julian, in the position of &quot;Princeps&quot;, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot and was revealed to have been Sejanus&#x27;s lover for several years.

The plot seems to have involved the two of them overthrowing Tiberius, with the support of the Julians, and either assuming the Principate themselves, or serving as regent to the young Tiberius Gemellus or possibly even Caligula. Those who stood in his way were tried for treason and swiftly dealt with.

In AD 31 Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week. As commander of the Praetorian Guard, he was replaced by Naevius Sutorius Macro.

Tacitus claims that more treason trials followed and that whereas Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the outset of his reign, now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. The hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was hit, as any and all who had associated with Sejanus or could in some way be tied to his schemes were summarily tried and executed, their properties seized by the state. As Tacitus vividly describes,

However, Tacitus&#x27;s portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by some historians: Edward Togo Salmon notes in &quot;A History of the Roman World&quot;:

While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, including graphic depictions of child molestation, cruelty, and most of all his paranoia. While heavily sensationalised, Suetonius&#x27;s stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.

=== Final years ===
The affair of Sejanus and the final years of treason trials permanently damaged Tiberius&#x27;s image and reputation. After Sejanus&#x27;s fall, Tiberius&#x27;s withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the &quot;Princeps&quot;. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and spent a great deal of time brooding over the death of his son. During this period there was a short invasion by Parthia, and incursions on Roman territories by Dacian and Germanic tribes.

Little was done to plan or secure Tiberius&#x27;s succession. The Julians and their supporters were diminished in numbers and political influence, thanks to Sejanus, and Tiberius&#x27;s immediate heirs were dead. Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or Tiberius&#x27;s own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus, were possibly candidates. However, Tiberius only made a half-hearted attempt at the end of his life to make Caligula a &quot;quaestor&quot;, and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.

=== Death ===

Tiberius died in Misenum on 16 March AD 37, months before his 78th birthday. While ancient sources agree on the date and location of his death, contradictory accounts exist of the precise circumstances.

Tacitus relates that the emperor appeared to have stopped breathing, and that Caligula, who was at Tiberius&#x27;s villa, was being congratulated on his succession to the empire, when news arrived that the emperor had revived and was recovering his faculties. He goes on to report that those who had moments before recognized Caligula as Augustus fled in fear of the emperor&#x27;s wrath, while Macro took advantage of the chaos to have Tiberius smothered with his own bedclothes.

Suetonius reports that, upon recovering after an illness, and finding himself deserted by his attendants, Tiberius attempted to rise from his couch, but fell dead. Suetonius further reports several rumours, including that the emperor had been poisoned by Caligula, starved, and smothered with a pillow. Seneca the Elder also reports Tiberius having died a natural death.

According to Cassius Dio, Caligula, fearing that the emperor would recover, refused Tiberius&#x27;s requests for food, insisting that he needed warmth, not food; then, assisted by Macro, he smothered the emperor in his bedclothes.

Neither Josephus, Pliny, nor Philo relate the story of Tiberius&#x27;s suffocation, stating simply the date of his death and/or the length of his reign. Modern medical analysis has concluded Tiberius most likely died as a result of myocardial infarction.

After his death, the Senate refused to vote Tiberius the divine honours that had been paid to Augustus, and mobs filled the streets yelling &quot;To the Tiber with Tiberius!&quot; (the bodies of criminals were typically thrown into the river, instead of being buried or burnt). However, the emperor was cremated, and his ashes were placed in the Mausoleum of Augustus.

In his will, Tiberius nominated Caligula and Tiberius Gemellus as his joint heirs. Caligula&#x27;s first act on becoming &quot;Princeps&quot; was to void Tiberius&#x27;s will.

==Health and physical appearance==

Suetonius describes Tiberius as being pale skinned, broad shouldered, left-handed, and exceptionally strong and tall for a Roman, although he had poor posture. Suetonius and Paterculus both write that, as a young man, he was considered attractive by Roman beauty standards. Even in adulthood, he was prone to severe acne outbreaks. He wore his hair cut short at the front and sides but long in the back so it covered the nape of his neck in a style similar to the mullet, which Suetonius claims was a family tradition of the Claudian gens. This assertion is confirmed by busts of other Claudian men, who were depicted with the same hairstyle. Suetonius describes his eyes as being larger than average, while a passage in Pliny indicates they were grey or blue-grey; polychromy restoration on a bust of Tiberius depict him with grey eyes and hair. Suetonius reports he tended to talk with his hands, a habit others found unnerving, and which Augustus saw as an inherent character flaw.

Both Cassius Dio and Tacitus record that by the time he became Emperor, Tiberius had gone bald. Tacitus further reports that the Emperor had lost most of his body fat and become abnormally thin, although he retained his physical strength. He also contracted a disfiguring facial ailment which may have been a severe case of herpes, an outbreak of which affected the Empire during his reign; Tiberius banned kissing at public functions in an effort to curtail its spread. Tacitus believed that embarrassment over his baldness and the disfigurement of his face may have been contributing factors to his retreat to Capri, and noted that he regularly attempted to cover his sores with plaster. Despite this, Suetonius reports that Tiberius enjoyed good general health for the duration of his reign. Late in life he suffered from a poor pulse, which modern scholars believe may have been a sign of heart disease. Shortly before his death, he suffered an injury to his back while killing a boar with a javelin to open soldiers&#x27; games, which severely limited his mobility in his final days.

Since the 20th century, much scholarship has been dedicated to Tiberius&#x27;s psychological profile. Modern assessments tend to agree that he likely suffered from lifelong major depressive disorder. Additionally, while wine consumption was a regular part of Roman life, contemporary sources note he consumed more than was considered healthy by Roman standards; in the legions, he earned the nickname &quot;Biberius&quot; (from &quot;bibere&quot;, &quot;to drink&quot;). This has led modern writers to conclude he probably suffered from alcoholism. As the Julio-Claudian Emperor who saw the most frontlines combat, and the one who actually led troops into battle, modern writers have concluded Tiberus&#x27;s erratic and paranoid behavior later in life, as well as his alcohol intake, may have been the result of post-traumatic stress disorder. Proponents of this theory believe the tales of Tiberius&#x27;s lurid sexual exploits were contemporary exaggerations of sexual compulsivity as a means of coping with untreated trauma. Other modern diagnoses offered for Tiberius include obsessive compulsive personality disorder and Schizoid personality disorder; the latter diagnoses was offered by Gregorio Marañón in a book-length psychological assessment of the Emperor, which further argued he suffered from some kind of anxiety disorder.

==Legacy==
=== Historiography ===
Had he died before AD 23, he might have been hailed as an exemplary ruler. Despite the overwhelmingly negative characterisation left by Roman historians, Tiberius left the imperial treasury with nearly 3 billion &quot;sesterces&quot; upon his death. Rather than embark on costly campaigns of conquest, he chose to strengthen the existing empire by building additional bases, using diplomacy as well as military threats, and generally refraining from getting drawn into petty squabbles between competing frontier tyrants. The result was a stronger, more consolidated empire, ensuring the imperial institutions introduced by his adoptive father would remain for centuries to come.

Of the authors whose texts have survived, only four describe the reign of Tiberius in considerable detail: Tacitus, Suetonius, Cassius Dio and Marcus Velleius Paterculus. Fragmentary evidence also remains from Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Seneca the Elder. Philo of Alexandria speaks briefly of Tiberius&#x27;s reign in Embassy to Gaius. Tiberius himself wrote an autobiography which Suetonius describes as &quot;brief and sketchy&quot;, but this book has been lost.

==== Publius Cornelius Tacitus ====
The most detailed account of this period was written by Tacitus, whose &quot;Annals&quot; dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born during the reign of Nero in AD 56, and &quot;consul suffectus&quot; in AD 97. His text is largely based on the &quot;Acta Senatus&quot; (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the &quot;Acta Diurna&quot; (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost). Tacitus&#x27;s narrative emphasises both political and psychological motivation. His characterisation of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point with the death of his son Drusus in AD 23.

Tacitus describes Julio-Claudian rule as generally unjust and &quot;criminal&quot;; he attributes the apparent virtues of Tiberius during his early reign to hypocrisy.
Another major recurring theme concerns the balance of power between the Senate and the emperors, corruption, and the growing tyranny among the governing classes of Rome. A substantial amount of his account on Tiberius is therefore devoted to the treason trials and persecutions following the revival of the &quot;maiestas&quot; law under Augustus. Ultimately, Tacitus&#x27;s opinion on Tiberius is best illustrated by his conclusion of the sixth book:

==== Suetonius Tranquillus ====
Suetonius was an equestrian who held administrative posts during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; details a biographical history of the principate from the birth of Julius Caesar to the death of Domitian in AD 96. Like Tacitus, he drew upon the imperial archives, as well as histories by Aufidius Bassus, Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Augustus&#x27;s own letters.

His account is more sensationalist and anecdotal than that of his contemporary Tacitus, and delves into Tiberius&#x27;s numerous alleged debaucheries while at Capri. Nevertheless, Suetonius praises Tiberius&#x27;s actions during his early reign, emphasising his modesty.

==== Velleius Paterculus ====
One of the few surviving sources contemporary with the rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD 4) in Germany and Pannonia as &quot;praefect&quot; of cavalry and &quot;legatus&quot;. Paterculus&#x27; &quot;Compendium of Roman History&quot; spans a period from the fall of Troy to the death of Livia in AD 29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD 31 as a friend of Sejanus.

=== Gospels, Jews, and Christians ===
According to the Gospels, Jesus of Nazareth preached and was executed during the reign of Tiberius, by the authority of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judaea province. &quot;Luke 3:1&quot;, states that John the Baptist entered on his public ministry in the fifteenth year of Tiberius&#x27;s reign. The city of Tiberias, on the Western shore of the Sea of Galilee (also known as the &quot;Sea of Tiberias&quot;) was named thus by Herod Antipas in Tiberius&#x27;s honour. It is referred to in &quot;John 6:23&quot; and &quot;John 6:1&quot;. The so-called &quot;tribute penny&quot; referred to in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark is popularly thought to be a silver &quot;denarius&quot; coin of Tiberius.

During Tiberius&#x27;s reign, Jews had become more prominent in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytising Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. In AD 19 Tiberius ordered Jews of military age to join the Roman Army. He banished the rest of Rome&#x27;s Jewish population, on pain of enslavement for life. Josephus credits the banishment to a quartet of Jewish con artists – one of whom had fled prosecution in Judea for financial crimes – who successfully conspired to scam a Roman Matron out of a large quantity of money, silk, and gold, ostensibly to be sent for dedication in the Second Temple in Jerusalem.

There were no systematic Roman persecutions of Christians under Tiberius after Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. Jossa finds it &quot;unthinkable&quot; that Tiberius was aware of Christianity as a faith separate from Judaism. Most scholars believe that Roman distinction between Jews and Christians began in the 40s, in Caligula&#x27;s reign, and was complete by around AD 70 (the destruction of Jerusalem).

The early Christian Church&#x27;s view of Tiberius has generally been favourable. The 2nd-3rd Century Christian apologist Tertullian said Tiberius approached the Senate with a request to acknowledge Christ as a deity, citing evidence of his miracles, and his resurrection following his crucifixion. Early Church historian Eusebius said Pilate reported to Tiberius of the resurrection of Christ. Tiberius is said to have taken Pilate&#x27;s report to the Senate. Tiberius had to be content with the protection of Christians from malicious prosecution by senators; St. Jerome adds that this was under the penalty of death. Both he and Eusebius included Tertullian&#x27;s account in their respective histories of the Christian Church, but no evidence of such protection survives in Roman law. Crake describes the episode as essentially a comment on deification by decree of the senate&quot;, in which few &quot;would take seriously even Tertullian&#x27;s version of events&quot; Translator G.A. Williamson said it &quot;can be hardly doubted that Pilate sent such a report, but none of the extant versions is regarded as genuine.&quot; The Christian History Institute does not list Tiberius as a Roman emperor who persecuted Christians. The first Roman emperor listed is Claudius.

=== Archaeology ===

Possible traces remain of renovations by Tiberius in the Gardens of Maecenas, where he lived upon returning from exile in AD 2. These persist inside the villa&#x27;s likely &quot;triclinium&quot;-&quot;nymphaeum&quot;, the so-called Auditorium of Maecenas. In an otherwise Late Republican-era building, identifiable as such by its brickwork and flooring, the Dionysian-themed landscape and nature frescoes lining the walls are reminiscent of the illusionistic early Imperial paintings in his mother&#x27;s own subterranean dining room.

Tiberius&#x27;s palace in Rome was on the Palatine Hill; its ruins still stand. Tiberius built a temple in Rome to the deified Augustus, and restored the theatre of Pompey, these works were not finished until the reign of Caligula. The remains of Tiberius&#x27;s villa at Sperlonga include a grotto, where the fragmentary Sperlonga sculptures were found. The hill-top &quot;Villa Jovis&quot; retreat at Capri has been preserved. The estate at Capri is said by Tacitus to have included a total of twelve villas, of which the &quot;Villa Jovis&quot; was the largest.

Tiberius refused to be officially worshipped as a living god. He promoted restraint in the official, empire-wide cult to the divinised Augustus, and established a priesthood, the &quot;Sodales Augustales&quot;, to administer its rites. He allowed a single temple to honour both his own &quot;genius&quot; and that of the Senate, at Smyrna.

=== Popular culture ===
Tiberius has been represented in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, often as a peripheral character in the central storyline. The following is a list of appearances Tiberius made in popular culture.

* He appears in the 1934 novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves, and the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker.
* George R. R. Martin, the author of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.
* In the 1968 ITV historical drama &quot;The Caesars&quot;, Tiberius (by André Morell) is the central character for much of the series and is portrayed in a much more balanced way than in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.
* He also appears as a minor character in the 2006 film &quot;The Inquiry&quot;, in which he is played by Max von Sydow. In addition, Tiberius has prominent roles in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (played by George Relph in his last starring role), and in &quot;A.D.&quot; (played by James Mason).
* He was featured in &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), played by Ernest Thesiger.
* He was featured in the 1979 film &quot;Caligula&quot;, portrayed by Peter O&#x27;Toole.
* He was an important character in Taylor Caldwell&#x27;s 1958 novel, &quot;Dear and Glorious Physician&quot;, a biography of St Luke the Evangelist, author of the third canonical Gospel.
* He was played by Kenneth Cranham in the 2015 TV series &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues.&quot;
* In the TV series &quot;Roman Empire&quot;, Tiberius was portrayed by Craig Walsh-Wrightson. In the 2021 TV series &quot;Domina&quot;, he was played by Earl Cave.
* The theft of the Gold Tiberius, an unintentionally unique commemorative coin commissioned by Tiberius which is stated to have achieved legendary status in the centuries hence, from a mysterious triad of occultists drives the plot of the framing story in Arthur Machen&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;The Three Impostors&quot;.

== Children and family ==
Tiberius was married twice, with only his first union producing a child who would survive to adulthood:
* Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (16 –11 BC)
** Drusus Julius Caesar (14 BC – AD 23) (Had Issue)
* Julia the Elder, only daughter of Augustus (11 – 6 BC)
** Infant son, (dubbed &quot;Tiberillus&quot; by modern historians), died in infancy.
In AD 4 Tiberius adopted his nephew Germanicus Julius Caesar (15 BC – AD 19), the son of his brother Drusus (the Elder) and Augustus&#x27;s niece Antonia Minor, as his full son and heir.

<text>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.

TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; they do this through three-way handshake procedure. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection adds to reliability but lengthens latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.

==Historical origin==
In May 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes. The authors had been working with Gérard Le Lann to incorporate concepts from the French CYCLADES project into the new network. The specification of the resulting protocol, (&quot;Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program&quot;), was written by Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, and published in December 1974. It contains the first attested use of the term &quot;internet&quot;, as a shorthand for &quot;internetwork&quot;.

The Transmission Control Program incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. In version 4, the monolithic Transmission Control Program was divided into a modular architecture consisting of the &quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot; and the &quot;Internet Protocol&quot;. This resulted in a networking model that became known informally as &quot;TCP/IP&quot;, although formally it was variously referred to as the &quot;DoD internet architecture model&quot; (&quot;DoD model&quot; for short) or &quot;DARPA model&quot;. Later, it became the part of, and synonymous with, the &quot;Internet Protocol Suite&quot;.

The following Internet Experiment Note (IEN) documents describe the evolution of TCP into the modern version:

* IEN 5 &quot;Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program TCP Version 2 (&quot;March 1977).
* IEN 21 &quot;Specification of Internetwork Transmission Control Program TCP Version 3 (&quot;January 1978).
* IEN 27
* IEN 40
* IEN 44
* IEN 55
* IEN 81
* IEN 112
* IEN 124

TCP was standardized in January 1980 as .

In 2004, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn received the Turing Award for their foundational work on TCP/IP.

==Network function==
The Transmission Control Protocol provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet Protocol. It provides host-to-host connectivity at the transport layer of the Internet model. An application does not need to know the particular mechanisms for sending data via a link to another host, such as the required IP fragmentation to accommodate the maximum transmission unit of the transmission medium. At the transport layer, TCP handles all handshaking and transmission details and presents an abstraction of the network connection to the application typically through a network socket interface.

At the lower levels of the protocol stack, due to network congestion, traffic load balancing, or unpredictable network behavior, IP packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. TCP detects these problems, requests re-transmission of lost data, rearranges out-of-order data and even helps minimize network congestion to reduce the occurrence of the other problems. If the data still remains undelivered, the source is notified of this failure. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted, it passes them to the receiving application. Thus, TCP abstracts the application&#x27;s communication from the underlying networking details.

TCP is used extensively by many internet applications, including the World Wide Web (WWW), email, File Transfer Protocol, Secure Shell, peer-to-peer file sharing, and streaming media.

TCP is optimized for accurate delivery rather than timely delivery and can incur relatively long delays (on the order of seconds) while waiting for out-of-order messages or re-transmissions of lost messages. Therefore, it is not particularly suitable for real-time applications such as voice over IP. For such applications, protocols like the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) operating over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are usually recommended instead.

TCP is a reliable byte stream delivery service that guarantees that all bytes received will be identical and in the same order as those sent. Since packet transfer by many networks is not reliable, TCP achieves this using a technique known as &quot;positive acknowledgment with re-transmission&quot;. This requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data. The sender keeps a record of each packet it sends and maintains a timer from when the packet was sent. The sender re-transmits a packet if the timer expires before receiving the acknowledgment. The timer is needed in case a packet gets lost or corrupted.

While IP handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of &quot;segments&quot; – the individual units of data transmission that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the network. For example, when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of that server divides the file into segments and forwards them individually to the internet layer in the network stack. The internet layer software encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP address. When the client program on the destination computer receives them, the TCP software in the transport layer re-assembles the segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error-free as it streams the file contents to the receiving application.

==TCP segment structure==
Transmission Control Protocol accepts data from a data stream, divides it into chunks, and adds a TCP header creating a TCP segment. The TCP segment is then encapsulated into an Internet Protocol (IP) datagram, and exchanged with peers.

The term &quot;TCP packet&quot; appears in both informal and formal usage, whereas in more precise terminology &quot;segment&quot; refers to the TCP protocol data unit (PDU), &quot;datagram&quot; to the IP PDU, and &quot;frame&quot; to the data link layer PDU:
Processes transmit data by calling on the TCP and passing buffers of data as arguments. The TCP packages the data from these buffers into segments and calls on the internet module [e.g. IP] to transmit each segment to the destination TCP.
A TCP segment consists of a segment &quot;header&quot; and a &quot;data&quot; section. The segment header contains 10 mandatory fields, and an optional extension field (&quot;Options&quot;, pink background in table). The data section follows the header and is the payload data carried for the application. The length of the data section is not specified in the segment header; it can be calculated by subtracting the combined length of the segment header and IP header from the total IP datagram length specified in the IP header.

==Protocol operation==
TCP protocol operations may be divided into three phases. &quot;Connection establishment&quot; is a multi-step handshake process that establishes a connection before entering the &quot;data transfer&quot; phase. After data transfer is completed, the &quot;connection termination&quot; closes the connection and releases all allocated resources.

A TCP connection is managed by an operating system through a resource that represents the local end-point for communications, the &quot;Internet socket&quot;. During the lifetime of a TCP connection, the local end-point undergoes a series of state changes:

===Connection establishment===

Before a client attempts to connect with a server, the server must first bind to and listen at a port to open it up for connections: this is called a passive open. Once the passive open is established, a client may establish a connection by initiating an active open using the three-way (or 3-step) handshake:
# SYN: The active open is performed by the client sending a SYN to the server. The client sets the segment&#x27;s sequence number to a random value A.
# SYN-ACK: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK. The acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1, and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is another random number, B.
# ACK: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgment value i.e. A+1, and the acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1.

Steps 1 and 2 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for one direction (client to server). Steps 2 and 3 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for the other direction (server to client). Following the completion of these steps, both the client and server have received acknowledgments and a full-duplex communication is established.

===Connection termination===

The connection termination phase uses a four-way handshake, with each side of the connection terminating independently. When an endpoint wishes to stop its half of the connection, it transmits a FIN packet, which the other end acknowledges with an ACK. Therefore, a typical tear-down requires a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint. After the side that sent the first FIN has responded with the final ACK, it waits for a timeout before finally closing the connection, during which time the local port is unavailable for new connections; this state lets the TCP client resend the final acknowledgment to the server in case the ACK is lost in transit. The time duration is implementation-dependent, but some common values are 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes. After the timeout, the client enters the CLOSED state and the local port becomes available for new connections.

It is also possible to terminate the connection by a 3-way handshake, when host A sends a FIN and host B replies with a FIN &amp; ACK (combining two steps into one) and host A replies with an ACK.

Some operating systems, such as Linux and HP-UX, implement a half-duplex close sequence. If the host actively closes a connection, while still having unread incoming data available, the host sends the signal RST (losing any received data) instead of FIN. This assures that a TCP application is aware there was a data loss.

A connection can be in a half-open state, in which case one side has terminated the connection, but the other has not. The side that has terminated can no longer send any data into the connection, but the other side can. The terminating side should continue reading the data until the other side terminates as well.

===Resource usage===
Most implementations allocate an entry in a table that maps a session to a running operating system process. Because TCP packets do not include a session identifier, both endpoints identify the session using the client&#x27;s address and port. Whenever a packet is received, the TCP implementation must perform a lookup on this table to find the destination process. Each entry in the table is known as a Transmission Control Block or TCB. It contains information about the endpoints (IP and port), status of the connection, running data about the packets that are being exchanged and buffers for sending and receiving data.

The number of sessions in the server side is limited only by memory and can grow as new connections arrive, but the client must allocate an ephemeral port before sending the first SYN to the server. This port remains allocated during the whole conversation and effectively limits the number of outgoing connections from each of the client&#x27;s IP addresses. If an application fails to properly close unrequired connections, a client can run out of resources and become unable to establish new TCP connections, even from other applications.

Both endpoints must also allocate space for unacknowledged packets and received (but unread) data.

===Data transfer===
The Transmission Control Protocol differs in several key features compared to the User Datagram Protocol:
* Ordered data transfer: the destination host rearranges segments according to a sequence number
* Retransmission of lost packets: any cumulative stream not acknowledged is retransmitted
* Error-free data transfer: corrupted packets are treated as lost and are retransmitted
* Flow control: limits the rate a sender transfers data to guarantee reliable delivery. The receiver continually hints the sender on how much data can be received. When the receiving host&#x27;s buffer fills, the next acknowledgment suspends the transfer and allows the data in the buffer to be processed.
* Congestion control: lost packets (presumed due to congestion) trigger a reduction in data delivery rate

====Reliable transmission====
TCP uses a &quot;sequence number&quot; to identify each byte of data. The sequence number identifies the order of the bytes sent from each computer so that the data can be reconstructed in order, regardless of any out-of-order delivery that may occur. The sequence number of the first byte is chosen by the transmitter for the first packet, which is flagged SYN. This number can be arbitrary, and should, in fact, be unpredictable to defend against TCP sequence prediction attacks.

Acknowledgments (ACKs) are sent with a sequence number by the receiver of data to tell the sender that data has been received to the specified byte. ACKs do not imply that the data has been delivered to the application, they merely signify that it is now the receiver&#x27;s responsibility to deliver the data.

Reliability is achieved by the sender detecting lost data and retransmitting it. TCP uses two primary techniques to identify loss. Retransmission timeout (RTO) and duplicate cumulative acknowledgments (DupAcks).

When a TCP segment is retransmitted, it retains the same sequence number as the original delivery attempt. This conflation of delivery and logical data ordering means that, when acknowledgment is received after a retransmission, the sender cannot tell whether the original transmission or the retransmission is being acknowledged, the so-called &quot;retransmission ambiguity&quot;. TCP incurs complexity due to retransmission ambiguity.

=====Duplicate-ACK-based retransmission=====
If a single segment (say segment number 100) in a stream is lost, then the receiver cannot acknowledge packets above that segment number (100) because it uses cumulative ACKs. Hence the receiver acknowledges packet 99 again on the receipt of another data packet. This duplicate acknowledgement is used as a signal for packet loss. That is, if the sender receives three duplicate acknowledgments, it retransmits the last unacknowledged packet. A threshold of three is used because the network may reorder segments causing duplicate acknowledgements. This threshold has been demonstrated to avoid spurious retransmissions due to reordering. Some TCP implementations use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP&#x27;s ability to retransmit the right segments.

Retransmission ambiguity can cause spurious fast retransmissions and congestion avoidance if there is reordering beyond the duplicate acknowledgment threshold. In the last two decades more packet reordering has been observed over the Internet which led TCP implementations, such as the one in the Linux Kernel to adopt heuristic methods to scale the duplicate acknowledgment threshold. Recently, there have been efforts to completely phase out duplicate-ACK-based fast-retransmissions and replace them with timer based ones. (Not to be confused with the classic RTO discussed below). The time based loss detection algorithm called Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) has been adopted as the default algorithm in Linux and Windows.

=====Timeout-based retransmission=====
When a sender transmits a segment, it initializes a timer with a conservative estimate of the arrival time of the acknowledgment. The segment is retransmitted if the timer expires, with a new timeout threshold of twice the previous value, resulting in exponential backoff behavior. Typically, the initial timer value is , where is the clock granularity. This guards against excessive transmission traffic due to faulty or malicious actors, such as man-in-the-middle denial of service attackers.

Accurate RTT estimates are important for loss recovery, as it allows a sender to assume an unacknowledged packet to be lost after sufficient time elapses (i.e., determining the RTO time). Retransmission ambiguity can lead a sender&#x27;s estimate of RTT to be imprecise. In an environment with variable RTTs, spurious timeouts can occur: if the RTT is under-estimated, then the RTO fires and triggers a needless retransmit and slow-start. After a spurious retransmission, when the acknowledgments for the original transmissions arrive, the sender may believe them to be acknowledging the retransmission and conclude, incorrectly, that segments sent between the original transmission and retransmission have been lost, causing further needless retransmissions to the extent that the link truly becomes congested; selective acknowledgement can reduce this effect. specifies that implementations must not use retransmitted segments when estimating RTT. Karn&#x27;s algorithm ensures that a good RTT estimate will be produced—eventually—by waiting until there is an unambiguous acknowledgment before adjusting the RTO. After spurious retransmissions, however, it may take significant time before such an unambiguous acknowledgment arrives, degrading performance in the interim. TCP timestamps also resolve the retransmission ambiguity problem in setting the RTO, though they do not necessarily improve the RTT estimate.

====Error detection====
Sequence numbers allow receivers to discard duplicate packets and properly sequence out-of-order packets. Acknowledgments allow senders to determine when to retransmit lost packets.

To assure correctness a checksum field is included; see for details. The TCP checksum is a weak check by modern standards and is normally paired with a CRC integrity check at layer 2, below both TCP and IP, such as is used in PPP or the Ethernet frame. However, introduction of errors in packets between CRC-protected hops is common and the 16-bit TCP checksum catches most of these.

====Flow control====
TCP uses an end-to-end flow control protocol to avoid having the sender send data too fast for the TCP receiver to receive and process it reliably. Having a mechanism for flow control is essential in an environment where machines of diverse network speeds communicate. For example, if a PC sends data to a smartphone that is slowly processing received data, the smartphone must be able to regulate the data flow so as not to be overwhelmed.

TCP uses a sliding window flow control protocol. In each TCP segment, the receiver specifies in the &quot;receive window&quot; field the amount of additionally received data (in bytes) that it is willing to buffer for the connection. The sending host can send only up to that amount of data before it must wait for an acknowledgment and receive window update from the receiving host.

When a receiver advertises a window size of 0, the sender stops sending data and starts its &quot;persist timer&quot;. The persist timer is used to protect TCP from a deadlock situation that could arise if a subsequent window size update from the receiver is lost, and the sender cannot send more data until receiving a new window size update from the receiver. When the persist timer expires, the TCP sender attempts recovery by sending a small packet so that the receiver responds by sending another acknowledgment containing the new window size.

If a receiver is processing incoming data in small increments, it may repeatedly advertise a small receive window. This is referred to as the silly window syndrome, since it is inefficient to send only a few bytes of data in a TCP segment, given the relatively large overhead of the TCP header.

====Congestion control====

The final main aspect of TCP is congestion control. TCP uses a number of mechanisms to achieve high performance and avoid congestive collapse, a gridlock situation where network performance is severely degraded. These mechanisms control the rate of data entering the network, keeping the data flow below a rate that would trigger collapse. They also yield an approximately max-min fair allocation between flows.

Acknowledgments for data sent, or the lack of acknowledgments, are used by senders to infer network conditions between the TCP sender and receiver. Coupled with timers, TCP senders and receivers can alter the behavior of the flow of data. This is more generally referred to as congestion control or congestion avoidance.

Modern implementations of TCP contain four intertwined algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.

In addition, senders employ a &quot;retransmission timeout&quot; (RTO) that is based on the estimated round-trip time (RTT) between the sender and receiver, as well as the variance in this round-trip time. There are subtleties in the estimation of RTT. For example, senders must be careful when calculating RTT samples for retransmitted packets; typically they use Karn&#x27;s Algorithm or TCP timestamps. These individual RTT samples are then averaged over time to create a smoothed round trip time (SRTT) using Jacobson&#x27;s algorithm. This SRTT value is what is used as the round-trip time estimate.

Enhancing TCP to reliably handle loss, minimize errors, manage congestion and go fast in very high-speed environments are ongoing areas of research and standards development. As a result, there are a number of TCP congestion avoidance algorithm variations.

===Maximum segment size===
The maximum segment size (MSS) is the largest amount of data, specified in bytes, that TCP is willing to receive in a single segment. For best performance, the MSS should be set small enough to avoid IP fragmentation, which can lead to packet loss and excessive retransmissions. To accomplish this, typically the MSS is announced by each side using the MSS option when the TCP connection is established. The option value is derived from the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the data link layer of the networks to which the sender and receiver are directly attached. TCP senders can use path MTU discovery to infer the minimum MTU along the network path between the sender and receiver, and use this to dynamically adjust the MSS to avoid IP fragmentation within the network.

MSS announcement may also be called &quot;MSS negotiation&quot; but, strictly speaking, the MSS is not &quot;negotiated&quot;. Two completely independent values of MSS are permitted for the two directions of data flow in a TCP connection, so there is no need to agree on a common MSS configuration for a bidirectional connection.

===Selective acknowledgments===

Relying purely on the cumulative acknowledgment scheme employed by the original TCP can lead to inefficiencies when packets are lost. For example, suppose bytes with sequence number 1,000 to 10,999 are sent in 10 different TCP segments of equal size, and the second segment (sequence numbers 2,000 to 2,999) is lost during transmission. In a pure cumulative acknowledgment protocol, the receiver can only send a cumulative ACK value of 2,000 (the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the received data) and cannot say that it received bytes 3,000 to 10,999 successfully. Thus the sender may then have to resend all data starting with sequence number 2,000.

To alleviate this issue TCP employs the &quot;selective acknowledgment (SACK)&quot; option, defined in 1996 in , which allows the receiver to acknowledge discontinuous blocks of packets that were received correctly, in addition to the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the last contiguous byte received successively, as in the basic TCP acknowledgment. The acknowledgment can include a number of &quot;SACK blocks&quot;, where each SACK block is conveyed by the &quot;Left Edge of Block&quot; (the first sequence number of the block) and the &quot;Right Edge of Block&quot; (the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of the block), with a &quot;Block&quot; being a contiguous range that the receiver correctly received. In the example above, the receiver would send an ACK segment with a cumulative ACK value of 2,000 and a SACK option header with sequence numbers 3,000 and 11,000. The sender would accordingly retransmit only the second segment with sequence numbers 2,000 to 2,999.

A TCP sender may interpret an out-of-order segment delivery as a lost segment. If it does so, the TCP sender will retransmit the segment previous to the out-of-order packet and slow its data delivery rate for that connection. The duplicate-SACK option, an extension to the SACK option that was defined in May 2000 in , solves this problem. Once the TCP receiver detects a second duplicate packet, it sends a D-ACK to indicate that no segments were lost, allowing the TCP sender to reinstate the higher transmission rate.

The SACK option is not mandatory and comes into operation only if both parties support it. This is negotiated when a connection is established. SACK uses a TCP header option (see for details). The use of SACK has become widespread—all popular TCP stacks support it. Selective acknowledgment is also used in Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

Selective acknowledgements can be &#x27;reneged&#x27;, where the receiver unilaterally discards the selectively acknowledged data. discouraged such behavior, but did not prohibit it to allow receivers the option of reneging if they, for example, ran out of buffer space. The possibility of reneging leads to implementation complexity for both senders and receivers, and also imposes memory costs on the sender.

===Window scaling===

For more efficient use of high-bandwidth networks, a larger TCP window size may be used. A 16-bit TCP window size field controls the flow of data and its value is limited to 65,535 bytes. Since the size field cannot be expanded beyond this limit, a scaling factor is used. The TCP window scale option, as defined in , is an option used to increase the maximum window size to 1 gigabyte. Scaling up to these larger window sizes is necessary for TCP tuning.

The window scale option is used only during the TCP 3-way handshake. The window scale value represents the number of bits to left-shift the 16-bit window size field when interpreting it. The window scale value can be set from 0 (no shift) to 14 for each direction independently. Both sides must send the option in their SYN segments to enable window scaling in either direction.

Some routers and packet firewalls rewrite the window scaling factor during a transmission. This causes sending and receiving sides to assume different TCP window sizes. The result is non-stable traffic that may be very slow. The problem is visible on some sites behind a defective router.

===TCP timestamps===
TCP timestamps, defined in in 1992, can help TCP determine in which order packets were sent. TCP timestamps are not normally aligned to the system clock and start at some random value. Many operating systems will increment the timestamp for every elapsed millisecond; however, the RFC only states that the ticks should be proportional.

There are two timestamp fields:
* a 4-byte sender timestamp value (my timestamp)
* a 4-byte echo reply timestamp value (the most recent timestamp received from you).

TCP timestamps are used in an algorithm known as &quot;Protection Against Wrapped Sequence&quot; numbers, or &quot;PAWS&quot;. PAWS is used when the receive window crosses the sequence number wraparound boundary. In the case where a packet was potentially retransmitted, it answers the question: &quot;Is this sequence number in the first 4 GB or the second?&quot; And the timestamp is used to break the tie.

Also, the Eifel detection algorithm uses TCP timestamps to determine if retransmissions are occurring because packets are lost or simply out of order.

TCP timestamps are enabled by default in Linux, and disabled by default in Windows Server 2008, 2012 and 2016.

Recent Statistics show that the level of TCP timestamp adoption has stagnated, at ~40%, owing to Windows Server dropping support since Windows Server 2008.

===Out-of-band data===
It is possible to interrupt or abort the queued stream instead of waiting for the stream to finish. This is done by specifying the data as &quot;urgent&quot;. This marks the transmission as out-of-band data (OOB) and tells the receiving program to process it immediately. When finished, TCP informs the application and resumes the stream queue. An example is when TCP is used for a remote login session where the user can send a keyboard sequence that interrupts or aborts the remotely running program without waiting for the program to finish its current transfer.

The &quot;urgent&quot; pointer only alters the processing on the remote host and doesn&#x27;t expedite any processing on the network itself. The capability is implemented differently or poorly on different systems or may not be supported. Where it is available, it is prudent to assume only single bytes of OOB data will be reliably handled. Since the feature is not frequently used, it is not well tested on some platforms and has been associated with vulnerabilities, WinNuke for instance.

===Forcing data delivery===
Normally, TCP waits for 200 ms for a full packet of data to send (Nagle&#x27;s Algorithm tries to group small messages into a single packet). This wait creates small, but potentially serious delays if repeated constantly during a file transfer. For example, a typical send block would be 4 KB, a typical MSS is 1460, so 2 packets go out on a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet taking ~1.2 ms each followed by a third carrying the remaining 1176 after a 197 ms pause because TCP is waiting for a full buffer. In the case of telnet, each user keystroke is echoed back by the server before the user can see it on the screen. This delay would become very annoying.

Setting the socket option codice_2 overrides the default 200 ms send delay. Application programs use this socket option to force output to be sent after writing a character or line of characters.

The RFC defines the codice_3 push bit as &quot;a message to the receiving TCP stack to send this data immediately up to the receiving application&quot;. There is no way to indicate or control it in user space using Berkeley sockets; it is controlled by the protocol stack only.

==Vulnerabilities==
TCP may be attacked in a variety of ways. The results of a thorough security assessment of TCP, along with possible mitigations for the identified issues, were published in 2009, and was pursued within the IETF through 2012. Notable vulnerabilities include denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto and TCP reset attack.

===Denial of service===
By using a spoofed IP address and repeatedly sending purposely assembled SYN packets, followed by many ACK packets, attackers can cause the server to consume large amounts of resources keeping track of the bogus connections. This is known as a SYN flood attack. Proposed solutions to this problem include SYN cookies and cryptographic puzzles, though SYN cookies come with their own set of vulnerabilities. Sockstress is a similar attack, that might be mitigated with system resource management. An advanced DoS attack involving the exploitation of the TCP &quot;persist timer&quot; was analyzed in Phrack No. 66. PUSH and ACK floods are other variants.

===Connection hijacking===

An attacker who is able to eavesdrop on a TCP session and redirect packets can hijack a TCP connection. To do so, the attacker learns the sequence number from the ongoing communication and forges a false segment that looks like the next segment in the stream. A simple hijack can result in one packet being erroneously accepted at one end. When the receiving host acknowledges the false segment, synchronization is lost. Hijacking may be combined with ARP spoofing or other routing attacks that allow an attacker to take permanent control of the TCP connection.

Impersonating a different IP address was not difficult prior to when the initial &quot;sequence number&quot; was easily guessable. The earlier implementations allowed an attacker to blindly send a sequence of packets that the receiver would believe came from a different IP address, without the need to intercept communication through ARP or routing attacks: it is enough to ensure that the legitimate host of the impersonated IP address is down, or bring it to that condition using denial-of-service attacks. This is why the initial sequence number is now chosen at random.

===TCP veto===
An attacker who can eavesdrop and predict the size of the next packet to be sent can cause the receiver to accept a malicious payload without disrupting the existing connection. The attacker injects a malicious packet with the sequence number and a payload size of the next expected packet. When the legitimate packet is ultimately received, it is found to have the same sequence number and length as a packet already received and is silently dropped as a normal duplicate packet—the legitimate packet is &quot;vetoed&quot; by the malicious packet. Unlike in connection hijacking, the connection is never desynchronized and communication continues as normal after the malicious payload is accepted. TCP veto gives the attacker less control over the communication but makes the attack particularly resistant to detection. The only evidence to the receiver that something is amiss is a single duplicate packet, a normal occurrence in an IP network. The sender of the vetoed packet never sees any evidence of an attack.

==TCP ports==

A TCP connection is identified by a four-tuple of the source address, source port, destination address, and destination port. Port numbers are used to identify different services, and to allow multiple connections between hosts. TCP uses 16-bit port numbers, providing 65,536 possible values for each of the source and destination ports. The dependency of connection identity on addresses means that TCP connections are bound to a single network path; TCP cannot use other routes that multihomed hosts have available, and connections break if an endpoint&#x27;s address changes.

Port numbers are categorized into three basic categories: well-known, registered, and dynamic or private. The well-known ports are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and are typically used by system-level processes. Well-known applications running as servers and passively listening for connections typically use these ports. Some examples include: FTP (20 and 21), SSH (22), TELNET (23), SMTP (25), HTTP over SSL/TLS (443), and HTTP (80). Registered ports are typically used by end-user applications as ephemeral source ports when contacting servers, but they can also identify named services that have been registered by a third party. Dynamic or private ports can also be used by end-user applications, however, these ports typically do not contain any meaning outside a particular TCP connection.

Network Address Translation (NAT), typically uses dynamic port numbers, on the public-facing side, to disambiguate the flow of traffic that is passing between a public network and a private subnetwork, thereby allowing many IP addresses (and their ports) on the subnet to be serviced by a single public-facing address.

==Development==
TCP is a complex protocol. However, while significant enhancements have been made and proposed over the years, its most basic operation has not changed significantly since its first specification in 1974, and the v4 specification , published in September 1981. , published in October 1989, clarified a number of TCP protocol implementation requirements. A list of the 8 required specifications and over 20 strongly encouraged enhancements is available in . Among this list is , TCP Congestion Control, one of the most important TCP-related RFCs in recent years, describes updated algorithms that avoid undue congestion. In 2001, was written to describe Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), a congestion avoidance signaling mechanism.

The original TCP congestion avoidance algorithm was known as &quot;TCP Tahoe&quot;, but many alternative algorithms have since been proposed (including TCP Reno, TCP Vegas, FAST TCP, TCP New Reno, and TCP Hybla).

Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is an ongoing effort within the IETF that aims at allowing a TCP connection to use multiple paths to maximize resource usage and increase redundancy. The redundancy offered by Multipath TCP in the context of wireless networks enables the simultaneous use of different networks, which brings higher throughput and better handover capabilities. Multipath TCP also brings performance benefits in datacenter environments. The reference implementation of Multipath TCP was developed in the Linux kernel. Multipath TCP is used to support the Siri voice recognition application on iPhones, iPads and Macs.

tcpcrypt is an extension proposed in July 2010 to provide transport-level encryption directly in TCP itself. It is designed to work transparently and not require any configuration. Unlike TLS (SSL), tcpcrypt itself does not provide authentication, but provides simple primitives down to the application to do that. The tcpcrypt RFC was published by the IETF in May 2019.

TCP Fast Open is an extension to speed up the opening of successive TCP connections between two endpoints. It works by skipping the three-way handshake using a cryptographic &quot;cookie&quot;. It is similar to an earlier proposal called T/TCP, which was not widely adopted due to security issues. TCP Fast Open was published as in 2014.

Proposed in May 2013, Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR) is a TCP extension developed by Google engineers. PRR ensures that the TCP window size after recovery is as close to the slow start threshold as possible. The algorithm is designed to improve the speed of recovery and is the default congestion control algorithm in Linux 3.2+ kernels.

=== Deprecated proposals ===
TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) is an extension proposed in December 2009 to secure servers against denial-of-service attacks. Unlike SYN cookies, TCPCT does not conflict with other TCP extensions such as window scaling. TCPCT was designed due to necessities of DNSSEC, where servers have to handle large numbers of short-lived TCP connections. In 2016, TCPCT was deprecated in favor of TCP Fast Open. The status of the original RFC was changed to &quot;historic&quot;.

==Hardware implementations==
One way to overcome the processing power requirements of TCP is to build hardware implementations of it, widely known as TCP offload engines (TOE). The main problem of TOEs is that they are hard to integrate into computing systems, requiring extensive changes in the operating system of the computer or device.

== Wire image and ossification ==
The wire data of TCP provides significant information-gathering and modification opportunities to on-path observers, as the protocol metadata is transmitted in cleartext. While this transparency is useful to network operators and researchers, information gathered from protocol metadata may reduce the end-user&#x27;s privacy. This visibility and malleability of metadata has led to TCP being difficult to extend—a case of protocol ossification—as any intermediate node (a &#x27;middlebox&#x27;) can make decisions based on that metadata or even modify it, breaking the end-to-end principle. One measurement found that a third of paths across the Internet encounter at least one intermediary that modifies TCP metadata, and 6.5% of paths encounter harmful ossifying effects from intermediaries. Avoiding extensibility hazards from intermediaries placed significant constraints on the design of MPTCP, and difficulties caused by intermediaries have hindered the deployment of TCP Fast Open in web browsers. Another source of ossification is the difficulty of modification of TCP functions at the endpoints, typically in the operating system kernel or in hardware with a TCP offload engine.

== Performance ==
As TCP provides applications with the abstraction of a reliable byte stream, it can suffer from head-of-line blocking: if packets are reordered or lost and need to be retransmitted (and thus are reordered), data from sequentially later parts of the stream may be received before sequentially earlier parts of the stream; however, the later data cannot typically be used until the earlier data has been received, incurring network latency. If multiple independent higher-level messages are encapsulated and multiplexed onto a single TCP connection, then head-of-line blocking can cause processing of a fully-received message that was sent later to wait for delivery of a message that was sent earlier. Web browsers attempt to mitigate head-of-line blocking by opening multiple parallel connections. This incurs the cost of connection establishment repeatedly, as well as multiplying the resources needed to track those connections at the endpoints. Parallel connections also have congestion control operating independently of each other, rather than being able to pool information together and respond more promptly to observed network conditions; TCP&#x27;s aggressive initial sending patterns can cause congestion if multiple parallel connections are opened; and the per-connection fairness model leads to a monopolization of resources by applications that take this approach.

Connection establishment is a major contributor to latency as experienced by web users. TCP&#x27;s three-way handshake introduces one RTT of latency during connection establishment before data can be sent. For short flows, these delays are very significant. Transport Layer Security (TLS) requires a handshake of its own for key exchange at connection establishment. Because of the layered design, the TCP handshake and the TLS handshake proceed serially; the TLS handshake cannot begin until the TCP handshake has concluded. Two RTTs are required for connection establishment with TLS 1.2 over TCP. TLS 1.3 allows for zero RTT connection resumption in some circumstances, but, when layered over TCP, one RTT is still required for the TCP handshake, and this cannot assist the initial connection; zero RTT handshakes also present cryptographic challenges, as efficient, replay-safe and forward secure non-interactive key exchange is an open research topic. TCP Fast Open allows the transmission of data in the initial (i.e., SYN and SYN-ACK) packets, removing one RTT of latency during connection establishment. However, TCP Fast Open has been difficult to deploy due to protocol ossification; , no Web browsers used it by default.

TCP throughput is affected by packet reordering. Reordered packets can cause duplicate acknowledgments to be sent, which, if they cross a threshold, will then trigger a spurious retransmission and congestion control. Transmission behavior can also become bursty, as large ranges are acknowledged all at once when a reordered packet at the range&#x27;s start is received (in a manner similar to how head-of-line blocking affects applications). found that throughput was inversely related to the amount of reordering, up to a threshold where all reordering triggers spurious retransmission. Mitigating reordering depends on a sender&#x27;s ability to determine that it has sent a spurious retransmission, and hence on resolving retransmission ambiguity. Reducing reordering-induced spurious retransmissions may slow recovery from genuine loss.

Selective acknowledgment can provide a significant benefit to throughput; measured gains of up to 45%. An important factor in the improvement is that selective acknowledgment can more often avoid going into slow start after a loss and can hence better use available bandwidth. However, TCP can only selectively acknowledge a maximum of three blocks of sequence numbers. This can limit the retransmission rate and hence loss recovery or cause needless retransmissions, especially in high-loss environments.

TCP was originally designed for wired networks where packet loss is considered to be the result of network congestion and the congestion window size is reduced dramatically as a precaution. However, wireless links are known to experience sporadic and usually temporary losses due to fading, shadowing, hand off, interference, and other radio effects, that are not strictly congestion. After the (erroneous) back-off of the congestion window size, due to wireless packet loss, there may be a congestion avoidance phase with a conservative decrease in window size. This causes the radio link to be underused. Extensive research on combating these harmful effects has been conducted. Suggested solutions can be categorized as end-to-end solutions, which require modifications at the client or server, link layer solutions, such as Radio Link Protocol in cellular networks, or proxy-based solutions which require some changes in the network without modifying end nodes. A number of alternative congestion control algorithms, such as Vegas, Westwood, Veno, and Santa Cruz, have been proposed to help solve the wireless problem.

== Acceleration ==
The idea of a TCP accelerator is to terminate TCP connections inside the network processor and then relay the data to a second connection toward the end system. The data packets that originate from the sender are buffered at the accelerator node, which is responsible for performing local retransmissions in the event of packet loss. Thus, in case of losses, the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver is shortened to the one between the acceleration node and the receiver which guarantees a faster delivery of data to the receiver.

Since TCP is a rate-adaptive protocol, the rate at which the TCP sender injects packets into the network is directly proportional to the prevailing load condition within the network as well as the processing capacity of the receiver. The prevalent conditions within the network are judged by the sender on the basis of the acknowledgments received by it. The acceleration node splits the feedback loop between the sender and the receiver and thus guarantees a shorter round trip time (RTT) per packet. A shorter RTT is beneficial as it ensures a quicker response time to any changes in the network and a faster adaptation by the sender to combat these changes.

Disadvantages of the method include the fact that the TCP session has to be directed through the accelerator; this means that if routing changes so that the accelerator is no longer in the path, the connection will be broken. It also destroys the end-to-end property of the TCP ACK mechanism; when the ACK is received by the sender, the packet has been stored by the accelerator, not delivered to the receiver.

==Debugging==
A packet sniffer, which taps TCP traffic on a network link, can be useful in debugging networks, network stacks, and applications that use TCP by showing an engineer what packets are passing through a link. Some networking stacks support the SO_DEBUG socket option, which can be enabled on the socket using setsockopt. That option dumps all the packets, TCP states, and events on that socket, which is helpful in debugging. Netstat is another utility that can be used for debugging.

==Alternatives==
For many applications TCP is not appropriate. One problem (at least with normal implementations) is that the application cannot access the packets coming after a lost packet until the retransmitted copy of the lost packet is received. This causes problems for real-time applications such as streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) where it is generally more useful to get most of the data in a timely fashion than it is to get all of the data in order.

For historical and performance reasons, most storage area networks (SANs) use Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) over Fibre Channel connections.

Also, for embedded systems, network booting, and servers that serve simple requests from huge numbers of clients (e.g. DNS servers) the complexity of TCP can be a problem. Finally, some tricks such as transmitting data between two hosts that are both behind NAT (using STUN or similar systems) are far simpler without a relatively complex protocol like TCP in the way.

Generally, where TCP is unsuitable, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used. This provides the application multiplexing and checksums that TCP does, but does not handle streams or retransmission, giving the application developer the ability to code them in a way suitable for the situation, or to replace them with other methods like forward error correction or interpolation.

Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is another protocol that provides reliable stream-oriented services similar to TCP. It is newer and considerably more complex than TCP, and has not yet seen widespread deployment. However, it is especially designed to be used in situations where reliability and near-real-time considerations are important.

Venturi Transport Protocol (VTP) is a patented proprietary protocol that is designed to replace TCP transparently to overcome perceived inefficiencies related to wireless data transport.

TCP also has issues in high-bandwidth environments. The TCP congestion avoidance algorithm works very well for ad-hoc environments where the data sender is not known in advance. If the environment is predictable, a timing-based protocol such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can avoid TCP&#x27;s retransmits overhead.

UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol (UDT) has better efficiency and fairness than TCP in networks that have high bandwidth-delay product.

Multipurpose Transaction Protocol (MTP/IP) is patented proprietary software that is designed to adaptively achieve high throughput and transaction performance in a wide variety of network conditions, particularly those where TCP is perceived to be inefficient.

==Checksum computation==

===TCP checksum for IPv4===
When TCP runs over IPv4, the method used to compute the checksum is defined as follows:

&quot;The checksum field is the 16-bit ones&#x27; complement of the ones&#x27; complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header and text. The checksum computation needs to ensure the 16-bit alignment of the data being summed. If a segment contains an odd number of header and text octets, alignment can be achieved by padding the last octet with zeros on its right to form a 16-bit word for checksum purposes. The pad is not transmitted as part of the segment. While computing the checksum, the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros.&quot;

In other words, after appropriate padding, all 16-bit words are added using ones&#x27; complement arithmetic. The sum is then bitwise complemented and inserted as the checksum field. A pseudo-header that mimics the IPv4 packet header used in the checksum computation is shown in the table below.




The checksum is computed over the following fields:
;
;

===TCP checksum for IPv6===
When TCP runs over IPv6, the method used to compute the checksum is changed:

&quot;Any transport or other upper-layer protocol that includes the addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be modified for use over IPv6, to include the 128-bit IPv6 addresses instead of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.&quot;

A pseudo-header that mimics the IPv6 header for computation of the checksum is shown below.





The checksum is computed over the following fields:
;
;

===Checksum offload ===
Many TCP/IP software stack implementations provide options to use hardware assistance to automatically compute the checksum in the network adapter prior to transmission onto the network or upon reception from the network for validation. This may relieve the OS from using precious CPU cycles calculating the checksum. Hence, overall network performance is increased.

This feature may cause packet analyzers that are unaware or uncertain about the use of checksum offload to report invalid checksums in outbound packets that have not yet reached the network adapter. This will only occur for packets that are intercepted before being transmitted by the network adapter; all packets transmitted by the network adaptor on the wire will have valid checksums. This issue can also occur when monitoring packets being transmitted between virtual machines on the same host, where a virtual device driver may omit the checksum calculation (as an optimization), knowing that the checksum will be calculated later by the VM host kernel or its physical hardware.

<text>The 2001 Tour de France was a multiple-stage bicycle race held from 7 to 29 July, and the 88th edition of the Tour de France. It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005. The verdict was subsequently confirmed by the Union Cycliste Internationale.

The race included a team time trial, two individual time trials and five consecutive mountain-top finishing stages, the second of which was the Chamrousse special-category climb time trial. Thus, all the high-mountain stages were grouped consecutively, following the climbing time trial, with one rest day in between. France was ridden &#x27;clockwise&#x27;, so the Alps were visited before the Pyrenees. The Tour started in France but also visited Belgium in its first week. The ceremonial final stage finished at the Champs-Élysées in Paris, as is tradition. Erik Zabel won his record sixth consecutive points classification victory. This was a record for points classification victories and is still a record for most consecutive victories, however Peter Sagan now holds the record for most total green jersey wins with seven.

==Teams==
The organisers felt that the 2000 Tour de France had not included enough French teams and consequently changed the selection procedure. was selected because it included the winner of the previous edition, Lance Armstrong. was selected because it included the winner of the 2000 UCI Road World Cup, Erik Zabel). was selected because it won the team classification in the 2000 Giro d&#x27;Italia. was selected because it won the team classifications in both the 2000 Tour de France and 2000 Vuelta a España. A further twelve teams qualified based on the UCI ranking in the highest UCI division at the end of 2000, after compensating for transfers. Although initially it was announced that four wildcards would be given, the tour organisation decided to add five teams: In total, 21 teams participated, each with 9 cyclists, giving a total of 189 cyclists.

==Route and stages==

The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 14.

==Race overview==

It was during this Tour de France that Johan Bruyneel, the Directeur Sportif of the US Postal team, intentionally mislead other teams about the condition of his riders through race radio, in an attempt to get opponents to believe his riders were suffering more than they actually were. This Tour is also noted for The Look, which became one of the more misinterpreted moments in cycling history.

===Doping===

After Armstrong abandoned his fight against the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), he was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles. The Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events. The 2001 Tour therefore has no official winner.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==
There were several classifications in the 2001 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist&#x27;s finishing times in each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.

Additionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In this classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification and was identified with a green jersey.

There was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists to reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The fourth individual classification was the young rider classification, which was marked by the white jersey. This was decided in the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years of age were eligible.

For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Laurent Jalabert won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.

There were also two special awards each with a prize of F 20,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col de la Madeleine on stage 10, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given for the first time in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 14. Laurent Roux won the Henri Desgrange and Sven Montgomery won the Jacques Goddet.

*In stage 1, Igor González de Galdeano wore the green jersey.
*In stages 8 and 9, Erik Zabel wore the green jersey.

<text>The Alhambra (, ; ) is a palace and fortress complex located in Granada, Spain. It is one of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture and one of the best-preserved palaces of the historic Islamic world. Additionally, the palace contains notable examples of Spanish Renaissance architecture.

The complex was begun in 1238 by Muhammad I Ibn al-Ahmar, the first Nasrid emir and founder of the Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim state of Al-Andalus. It was built on the Sabika hill, an outcrop of the Sierra Nevada which had been the site of earlier fortresses and of the 11th-century palace of Samuel ibn Naghrillah. Later Nasrid rulers continuously modified the site. The most significant construction campaigns, which gave the royal palaces much of their defining character, took place in the 14th century during the reigns of Yusuf I and Muhammad V. After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered. In 1526, Charles V commissioned a new Renaissance-style palace in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid palaces, but it was left uncompleted in the early 17th century. The site fell into disrepair over the following centuries, with its buildings occupied by squatters. The troops of Napoleon destroyed parts of it in 1812. After this, the Alhambra became an attraction for British, American, and other European Romantic travellers. The most influential of them was Washington Irving, whose &quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot; (1832) brought international attention to the site. The Alhambra was one of the first Islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the subject of numerous restorations since the 19th century. It is now one of Spain&#x27;s major tourist attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

During the Nasrid era, the Alhambra was a self-contained city separate from the rest of Granada below. It contained most of the amenities of a Muslim city such as a Friday mosque, hammams (public baths), roads, houses, artisan workshops, a tannery, and a sophisticated water supply system. As a royal city and citadel, it contained at least six major palaces, most of them located along the northern edge where they commanded views over the Albaicín quarter. The most famous and best-preserved are the Mexuar, the Comares Palace, the Palace of the Lions, and the Partal Palace, which form the main attraction to visitors today. The other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations. At the Alhambra&#x27;s western tip is the Alcazaba fortress. Multiple smaller towers and fortified gates are also located along the Alhambra&#x27;s walls. Outside the Alhambra walls and located nearby to the east is the Generalife, a former Nasrid country estate and summer palace accompanied by historic orchards and modern landscaped gardens.

The architecture of the Nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of Moorish architecture developed over previous centuries. It is characterized by the use of the courtyard as a central space and basic unit around which other halls and rooms were organized. Courtyards typically had water features at their centre, such as a reflective pool or a fountain. Decoration was focused on the inside of the building and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls. Geometric patterns, vegetal motifs, and Arabic inscriptions were the main types of decorative motifs. Additionally, &quot;stalactite&quot;-like sculpting, known as &quot;muqarnas&quot;, was used for three-dimensional features like vaulted ceilings.


== Etymology ==
&quot;Alhambra&quot; derives from the Arabic (&#x27;, ), meaning (f.), the complete form of which was &#x27; &quot;the red fortress (qalat)&quot;. The &quot;Al-&quot; in &quot;Alhambra&quot; means &quot;the&quot; in Arabic, but this is ignored in general usage in both English and Spanish, where the name is normally given the definite article. The reference to the colour &quot;red&quot; in the name is due to the reddish colour of its walls, which were constructed of rammed earth. The reddish colour comes from the iron oxide in the local clay used for this type of construction.

Most of the names used today for specific structures and locations within the Alhambra are imaginative names coined after the mediaeval period, often in the 19th century. The original Arabic names of the Nasrid-era buildings are not known, although some scholars have proposed connections between certain buildings and some of the names mentioned in historical sources.

==History==
=== Origins and early history ===

The evidence for a Roman presence is unclear but archaeologists have found remains of ancient foundations on the Sabika hill. A fortress or citadel, probably dating from the Visigothic period, existed on the hill in the 9th century. The first reference to the &quot;Qal‘at al-Ḥamra&quot; was during the battles between the Arabs and the Muladies during the rule of ‘Abdallah ibn Muhammad (r. 888–912). According to surviving documents from the era, the red castle was quite small, and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering. The first reference to &quot;&quot; came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts, recorded by Ibn Hayyan (d. 1076):
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Deserted and roofless are the houses of our enemies;
 Invaded by the autumnal rains, traversed by impetuous winds;
Let them within the red castle (Kalat al hamra) hold their mischievous councils;
 Perdition and woe surround them on every side.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

At the beginning of the 11th century, the region of Granada was dominated by the Zirids, a Sanhaja Berber group and offshoot of the Zirids who ruled parts of North Africa. When the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed after 1009 and the Fitna (civil war) began, the Zirid leader Zawi ben Ziri established an independent kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. The Zirids built their citadel and palace, known as the &quot;al-Qaṣaba al-Qadīma&quot; (&quot;Old Citadel&quot; or &quot;Old Palace&quot;), on the hill now occupied by the Albaicín neighbourhood. It was connected to two other fortresses on the Sabika and Mauror hills to the south. On the Darro River, between the Zirid citadel and the Sabika hill, was a sluice gate called &quot;Bāb al-Difāf&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Tambourines&quot;), which could be closed to retain water if needed. This gate was part of the fortification connecting the Zirid citadel with the fortress on the Sabika hill and it also formed part of a &quot;coracha&quot; (from Arabic &quot;qawraja&quot;), a type of fortification allowing soldiers from the fortress to access the river and bring back water even during times of siege. The Sabika hill fortress, also known as &quot;al-Qasaba al-Jadida&quot; (&quot;the New Citadel&quot;), was later used for the foundations of the current Alcazaba of the Alhambra. Under the Zirid kings Habbus ibn Maksan and Badis, the most powerful figure in the kingdom was the Jewish administrator known as Samuel ha-Nagid (in Hebrew) or Isma&#x27;il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel built his own palace on the Sabika hill, possibly on the site of the current palaces, although nothing remains of it. It reportedly included gardens and water features.

=== Nasrid period ===

The period of the Taifa kingdoms, during which the Zirids ruled, came to an end with the conquest of al-Andalus by the Almoravids from North Africa during the late 11th century. In the mid-12th century they were followed by the Almohads. After 1228 Almohad rule collapsed and local rulers and factions emerged again across the territory of Al-Andalus. With the &quot;Reconquista&quot; in full swing, the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon – under kings Ferdinand III and James I, respectively – made major conquests across al-Andalus. Castile captured Cordoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248. Meanwhile, Ibn al-Ahmar (Muhammad I) established what became the last and longest reigning Muslim dynasty in the Iberian peninsula, the Nasrids, who ruled the Emirate of Granada. Ibn al-Ahmar was a relatively new political player in the region and likely came from a modest background, but he was able to win the support and consent of multiple Muslim settlements under threat from the Castilian advance.

Upon settling in Granada in 1238, Ibn al-Ahmar initially resided in the old citadel of the Zirids on the Albaicin hill, but that same year he began construction of the Alhambra as a new residence and citadel. According to an Arabic manuscript since published as the &quot;Anónimo de Madrid y Copenhague&quot;, 
During the reign of the Nasrid Dynasty, the Alhambra was transformed into a palatine city, complete with an irrigation system composed of aqueducts and water channels that provided water for the complex and for other nearby countryside palaces such as the Generalife. Previously, the old fortresses on the hill had been dependent on rainwater collected from the cistern near the Alcazaba and on what could be brought up from the Darro River below. The creation of the Sultan&#x27;s Canal (), which brought water from the mountains to the east, solidified the identity of the Alhambra as a palace-city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure. This first hydraulic system was expanded afterwards and included two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau.

The only elements preserved from the time of Ibn al-Ahmar are some of the fortification walls, particularly the Alcazaba at the western end of the complex. Ibn al-Ahmar did not have time to complete any major new palaces and he may have initially lived in one of the towers of the Alcazaba, before later moving to a modest house on the site of the current Palace of Charles V. Later Nasrid rulers after Ibn al-Ahmar continuously modified the site. Along with the fragile materials themselves, which needed regular repairs, this makes the exact chronology of its development difficult to determine.
The oldest major palace for which some remains have been preserved is the structure known as the &quot;Palacio del Partal Alto&quot;, in an elevated location near the centre of the complex, which probably dates from the reign of Ibn al-Ahmar&#x27;s son, Muhammad II (r. 1273–1302).&#x27; To the south was the Palace of the Abencerrajes, and to the east was another private palace, known as the Palace of the Convent of San Francisco&quot;,&quot; both of which were probably also originally constructed during the time of Muhammad II&quot;.&quot; Muhammad III (r. 1302–1309) erected the Partal Palace, parts of which are still standing today, as well as the Alhambra&#x27;s main (congregational) mosque (on the site of the current Church of Santa Maria de la Alhambra).&#x27; The Partal Palace is the earliest known palace to be built along the northern walls of the complex, with views onto the city below.&quot;&quot; It is also the oldest Nasrid palace still standing today.

Isma&#x27;il I (r. 1314–1325) undertook a significant remodelling of the Alhambra. His reign marked the beginning of the &quot;classical&quot; period of Nasrid architecture, during which many major monuments in the Alhambra were begun and decorative styles were consolidated. Isma&#x27;il decided to build a new palace complex just east of the Alcazaba to serve as the official palace of the sultan and the state, known as the &quot;Qaṣr al-Sultan&quot; or &quot;Dār al-Mulk&quot;. The core of this complex was the Comares Palace, while another wing of the palace, the Mexuar, extended to the west. The Comares Baths are the best-preserved element from this initial construction, as the rest of the palace was further modified by his successors. Near the main mosque Isma&#x27;il I also created the &quot;Rawda&quot;, the dynastic mausoleum of the Nasrids, of which only partial remains are preserved.&#x27; Yusuf I (r. 1333–1354) carried out further work on the Comares Palace, including the construction of the Hall of Ambassadors and other works around the current Mexuar. He also built the Alhambra&#x27;s main gate, the &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot;, and the &quot;Torre de la Cautiva&quot;, one of several small towers with richly-decorated rooms along the northern walls.&#x27;
Muhammad V&#x27;s reign (1354–1391, with interruptions) marked the political and cultural apogee of the Nasrid emirate as well as the apogee of Nasrid architecture. Particularly during his second reign (after 1362), there was a stylistic shift towards more innovative architectural layouts and an extensive use of complex &quot;muqarnas&quot; vaulting. His most significant contribution to the Alhambra was the construction of the Palace of the Lions to the east of the Comares Palace in an area previously occupied by gardens. He also remodelled the Mexuar, created the highly decorated &quot;Comares Façade&quot; in the &quot;Patio del Cuarto Dorado&quot;, and redecorated the Court of the Myrtles, giving these areas much of their final appearance.&quot;&quot;

After Muhammad V, relatively little major construction work occurred in the Alhambra. One exception is the &quot;Torre de las Infantas&quot;, which dates from the time of Muhammad VII (1392–1408).&#x27; The 15th century saw the Nasrid dynasty in decline and in turmoil, with few significant construction projects and a more repetitive, less innovative style of architecture.&#x27;

=== &quot;Reconquista&quot; and Christian Spanish period ===
The last Nasrid sultan, Muhammad XII of Granada, surrendered the Emirate of Granada in January 1492, without the Alhambra itself being attacked, when the forces of the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers. Muhammad XII moved the remains of his ancestors from the complex, as was verified by Leopoldo Torres Balbás in 1925, when he found seventy empty tombs. The remains are now likely to be located in Mondújar in the principality of Lecrín.

After the conquest, the Alhambra became a royal palace and property of the Spanish Crown. Isabella and Ferdinand initially took up residence here and stayed in Granada for several months, up until 25 May 1492. It was during this stay that two major events happened. On 31 March the monarchs signed the Alhambra Decree, which ordered the expulsion of all Jews in Spain who refused to convert. Christopher Columbus, who had also been present to witness the surrender of Granada, presented his plans for an expedition across the Atlantic to the monarchs in the Hall of Ambassadors and on 17 April they signed the contract which set the terms for the expedition which landed in the Americas later that year.
The new Christian rulers began to make additions and alterations to the palace complex. The governorship of the Alhambra was entrusted to the Tendilla family, who were given one of the Nasrid palaces, the &quot;Palacio del Partal Alto&quot; (near the Partal Palace), to use as family residence. Iñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones (d. 1515), the second Count of Tendilla, was present in Ferdinand II&#x27;s entourage when Muhammad XII surrendered the keys to the Alhambra and he became the Alhambra&#x27;s first Spanish governor. For almost 24 years after the conquest, he made repairs and modifications to its fortifications in order to better protect it against gunpowder artillery attacks. Multiple towers and fortifications – such as the &quot;Torre de Siete Suelos&quot;, the &quot;Torre de las Cabezas&quot;, and the &quot;Torres Bermejas&quot; – were built or reinforced in this period, as seen by the addition of semi-round bastions. In 1512 the Count was also awarded the property of Mondéjar and subsequently passed on the title of Marquis of Mondéjar to his descendants.
Charles V (r. 1516–1556) visited the Alhambra in 1526 with his wife Isabella of Portugal and decided to convert it into a royal residence for his use. He rebuilt or modified portions of the Nasrid palaces to serve as royal apartments, a process which began in 1528 and was completed in 1537. He also demolished a part of the Comares Palace to make way for a monumental new palace, known as the Palace of Charles V, designed in the Renaissance style of the period. Construction of the palace began in 1527 but it was eventually left unfinished after 1637.

The governorship of the Tendilla-Mondéjar family came to an end in 1717–1718, when Philip V confiscated the family&#x27;s properties in the Alhambra and dismissed the Marquis of Mondéjar, José de Mendoza Ibáñez de Segovia (1657–1734), from his position as mayor (&quot;alcaide&quot;) of the Alhambra, in retaliation for the Marquis opposing him in the War of the Spanish Succession. The departure of the Tendilla-Mondéjar family marked the beginning of the Alhambra&#x27;s most severe period of decline. During this period the Spanish state dedicated few resources to it and its management was taken over by self-interested local governors who lived with their families inside the neglected palaces.

Over subsequent years the Alhambra was further damaged. Between 1810 and 1812 Granada was occupied by Napoleon&#x27;s army during the Peninsular War. The French troops, under the command of Count Sebastiani, occupied the Alhambra as a fortified position and caused significant damage to the monument. Upon evacuating the city, they attempted to dynamite the whole complex to prevent it from being re-used as a fortified position. They successfully blew up eight towers before the remaining fuses were disabled by Spanish soldier José Garcia, whose actions saved what remains today. In 1821, an earthquake caused further damage. In the early 19th century, the site was described as being occupied by prisoners, disabled soldiers and other marginalized people.

=== Recovery and modern restorations ===

As early as the second half of the 18th century, the Alhambra&#x27;s appearance and details began to be documented by Spanish illustrators and officials. By the first decade of the 19th century, other European writers began to bring attention to it and the site subsequently became an object of fascination for Western Romanticist writers, whose publications frequently sought to evoke a contrast between the ornate architecture of the former Moorish palaces and their current state of ruin and neglect. This also coincided with a growing European interest in the Orient (Orientialism), which encouraged an emphasis on exoticism and on the &quot;oriental&quot; attributes of the Alhambra. This rediscovery of the Alhambra was led mostly by French, British, and German writers. In 1830, the American writer Washington Irving lived in Granada and wrote his &quot;Tales of the Alhambra&quot;, first published in 1832, which played a major role in spurring international interest in southern Spain and in its Islamic-era monuments like the Alhambra. Other artists and intellectuals, such as John Frederick Lewis, Richard Ford, François-René de Chateaubriand, and Owen Jones, helped make the Alhambra into an icon of the era with their writings and illustrations during the 19th century.

Restoration work on the Alhambra was undertaken in 1828 by the architect José Contreras, endowed in 1830 by Ferdinand VII. After the death of Contreras in 1847, it was continued by his son Rafael (died 1890) and his grandson Mariano Contreras (died 1912). The Contreras family members continued to be the most important architects and conservators of the Alhambra up until 1907. During this period, they generally followed a theory of &quot;stylistic restoration&quot;, which favoured the construction and addition of elements to make a monument &quot;complete&quot; but not necessarily corresponding to any historical reality. They added elements which they deemed to be representative of what they thought was an &quot;Arabic style&quot;, emphasizing the Alhambra&#x27;s purported &quot;Oriental&quot; character. For example, in 1858–1859 Rafael Contreras and Juan Pugnaire added Persian-looking spherical domes to the Court of the Lions and to the northern portico of the Court of the Myrtles, even though these had nothing to do with Nasrid architecture.

In 1868, a revolution deposed Isabella II and the government seized the properties of the Spanish monarchy, including the Alhambra. In 1870 the Alhambra was declared a National Monument of Spain and the state allocated a budget for its conservation, overseen by the Provincial Commission of Monuments. Mariano Contreras, the last of the Contreras architects to serve as director of conservation of the Alhambra, was appointed as architectural curator in April 1890. His tenure was controversial and his conservation strategy attracted criticism from other authorities. In September 1890, a fire destroyed a large part of the &quot;Sala de la Barca&quot; in the Comares Palace, which highlighted the site&#x27;s vulnerability. A report was commissioned in 1903. This resulted in the creation of a &quot;Special Commission&quot; in 1905. The Special Commission was tasked to oversee conservation and restoration of the Alhambra. The commission ultimately failed to exercise control due to friction with Contreras. In 1907, Mariano Contreras was replaced with Modesto Cendoya, whose work was also criticized. Cendoya began many excavations in search of new artifacts but often left these works unfinished. He restored some important elements of the site, like the water supply system, but neglected others. Due to continued friction with Cendoya, the Special Commission was dissolved in 1913 and replaced with the council (&quot;Patronato&quot;) of the Alhambra in 1914, which was charged again with overseeing the site&#x27;s conservation and Cendoya&#x27;s work. In 1915, it was linked directly to the Directorate-General of Fine Arts of the Ministry of Public Education (later the Ministry of National Education). Like Mariano Contreras before him, Cendoya continued to clash with the supervisory body and to obstruct their control. He was eventually dismissed from his post in 1923.
After Cendoya, Leopoldo Torres Balbás was appointed as chief architect from 1923 to 1936. The appointment of Torres Balbás, a trained archaeologist and art historian, marked a definitive shift to a more scientific and systematic approach to the Alhambra&#x27;s conservation. He endorsed the principles of the 1931 Athens Charter for the Restoration of Monuments, which emphasized regular maintenance, respect for the work of the past, legal protection for heritage monuments, and the legitimacy of modern techniques and materials in restoration so long as these were visually recognizable. Many of the buildings in the Alhambra were affected by his work. Some of the inaccurate changes and additions made by the Contreras architects were reversed. The young architect &quot;opened arcades that had been walled up, re-excavated filled-in pools, replaced missing tiles, completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering, and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of Charles V&quot;. He also carried out systematic archaeological excavations in various parts of the Alhambra, unearthing lost Nasrid structures such as the &quot;Palacio del Partal Alto&quot; and the Palace of the Abencerrajes which provided deeper insight into the former palace-city as a whole.

The work of Torres Balbás was continued by his assistant, Francisco Prieto Moreno, who was the chief architectural curator from 1936 to 1970. In 1940, a new Council of the Alhambra was created to oversee the site, which has remained in charge ever since. In 1984 the central government in Madrid transferred responsibility for the site to the Regional Government of Andalusia and in 1986 new statutes and documents were developed to regulate the planning and protection of the site. In 1984 the Alhambra and Generalife were also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Alhambra is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in Spain. Research, archaeological investigations, and restoration works have also remained ongoing into the 21st century.

==Layout==
The Alhambra site is about in length and about at its greatest width. It extends from west-northwest to east-southeast and covers an area of about or 35 acres. It stands on a narrow promontory overlooking the &quot;Vega&quot; or Plain of Granada and carved by the river Darro on its north side as it descends from the Sierra Nevada. The red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick- and stone- reinforced construction (&quot;tapial calicastrado&quot;) its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of &#x27;the Red Hill&#x27;.

The Alhambra&#x27;s most westerly feature is the Alcazaba, a large fortress overlooking the city. Due to touristic demand, modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot; (Gate of Justice) onto a large souq or public market square facing the Alcazaba, now subdivided and obscured by later Christian-era development. From the &quot;Puerta del Vino&quot; (Wine Gate) ran the &quot;Calle Real&quot; (Royal Street) dividing the Alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter, with mosques, hamams (bathhouses) and diverse functional establishments, and a greater northern portion, occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the Albaicín.

The rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later Moorish palaces, enclosed by a fortified wall, with thirteen defensive towers, some such as the &quot;Torre de la Infanta&quot; and &quot;Torre de la&quot; &quot;Cautiva&quot; containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature. The river Darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the Albaicín district of Granada. Similarly, the Sabika Valley, containing the Alhambra Park, lies on the west and south, and, beyond this valley, the almost parallel ridge of Monte Mauror separates it from the Antequeruela district. Another ravine separates it from the Generalife, the summer pleasure gardens of the emir. Salmerón Escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout, so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare.

== Architecture ==
=== General design ===
The design and decoration of the Nasrid palaces are a continuation of Moorish (western Islamic) architecture from earlier centuries but developed their own characteristics. The combination of carefully-proportioned courtyards, water features, gardens, arches on slender columns, and intricately-sculpted stucco and tile decoration gives Nasrid architecture qualities that are described as ethereal and intimate. Walls were built mostly in rammed earth, lime concrete, or brick and then covered with plaster, while wood (mostly pine) was used for roofs, ceilings, doors, and window shutters.

Buildings were designed to be seen from within, with their decoration focused on the inside. The basic unit of Nasrid palace architecture was a rectangular courtyard with a pool, fountain, or water channel at its centre. Courtyards were flanked on two or four sides by halls, often preceded by arcaded porticoes. Many of these structures featured a &quot;mirador&quot;, a room projecting from the exterior commanding scenic views of gardens or of the city. Buildings were designed with a mathematical proportional system that gives them a harmonious visual quality. The layout of the courtyards, the distribution of windows, and the use of water features were designed with the climate in mind, cooling and ventilating the environment in summer while minimizing cold drafts and maximizing sunlight in winter. Upper-floor rooms were smaller and more enclosed, making them more suited for use during the winter. Courtyards were usually aligned in a north–south direction which allows the main halls to receive direct sunlight at midday during the winter, while during the summer the higher midday sun is blocked by the position and depth of the porticos fronting these halls.

=== Architects and poets ===
Little is known about the architects and craftsmen who built the Alhambra, but more is known about the &quot;Dīwān al-Ins͟hā&quot;&#x27;, or chancery. This institution seems to have played an increasingly important role in the design of buildings, probably because inscriptions came to feature so prominently in their decoration. The head of the chancery was often also the vizier (prime minister) of the sultan. Although not exactly architects, the terms of office of many individuals in these positions coincide with the major phases of construction in the Alhambra, which suggests that they played a role in leading construction projects. The most important figures who held these positions, such as Ibn al-Jayyab, Ibn al-Khatib, and Ibn Zamrak, also composed much of the poetry that adorns the walls of the Alhambra. Ibn al-Jayyab served as head of the chancery at various times between 1295 and 1349 under six sultans from Muhammad II to Yusuf I. Ibn al-Khatib served as both head of the chancery and as vizier for various periods between 1332 and 1371, under the sultans Yusuf I and Muhammad V. Ibn Zamrak served as vizier and head of the chancery for periods between 1354 and 1393, under Muhammad V and Muhammad VII.

=== Decoration ===

Carved stucco (or &quot;yesería&quot; in Spanish) and mosaic tilework (&quot;zilīj&quot; or &quot;zellij&quot; in Arabic; &quot;alicatado&quot; in Spanish) were used for wall decoration, while ceilings were generally made in wood, which could be carved and painted in turn. Tile mosaics and wooden ceilings often feature geometric motifs. Tilework was generally used for lower walls or for floors, while stucco was used for upper zones. Stucco was typically carved with vegetal arabesque motifs (&quot;ataurique&quot; in Spanish, from ), epigraphic motifs, geometric motifs, or &quot;sebka&quot; motifs. It could be further sculpted into three-dimensional &quot;muqarnas&quot; (&quot;mocárabes&quot; in Spanish). Arabic inscriptions, a feature especially characteristic of the Alhambra, were carved along the walls and included Qur&#x27;anic excerpts, poetry by Nasrid court poets, and the repetition of the Nasrid motto &quot;wa la ghalib illa-llah&quot; (). 
White marble quarried from Macael (in Almeria province) was also used to make fountains and slender columns. The capitals of columns typically consisted of a lower cylindrical section sculpted with stylized acanthus leaves, an upper cubic section with vegetal or geometric motifs, and inscriptions (like the Nasrid motto) running along the base or the top edge.

While the stucco decoration, wooden ceilings, and marble capitals of the Alhambra often appear colourless or monochrome today, they were originally painted in bright colours. Primary colours – red, blue, and (in place of yellow) gold – were the most prominent and were juxtaposed to achieve a certain aesthetic balance, while other colours were used in more nuanced ways in the background.

==== Inscriptions ====

The Alhambra features various styles of the Arabic epigraphy that developed under the Nasrid dynasty, and particularly under Yusuf I and Muhammad V. José Miguel Puerta Vílchez compares the walls of the Alhambra to the pages of a manuscript, drawing similarities between the &quot;zilīj&quot;-covered dados and the geometric manuscript illuminations, and the epigraphical forms in the palace to calligraphic motifs in contemporary Arabic manuscripts. Inscriptions typically ran in vertical or horizontal bands or they were set inside cartouches of round or rectangular shape.

Most major inscriptions in the Alhambra use the &quot;Naskhi&quot; or cursive script, which was the most common script used in writing after the early Islamic period. &quot;Thuluth&quot; was a derivation of the cursive script often used for more pompous or formal contexts; favoured, for example, in the preambles of documents prepared by the Nasrid chancery. Many inscriptions in the Alhambra were composed in a mixed &quot;Naskhi-Thuluth&quot; script. Bands of cursive script often alternated with friezes or cartouches of Kufic script. Kufic is the oldest form of Arabic calligraphy, but by the 13th century Kufic scripts in the western Islamic world became increasingly stylized in architectural contexts and could be nearly illegible. In the Alhambra, there are many examples of &quot;Knotted&quot; Kufic, a particularly elaborate style where the letters tie together in intricate knots. The extensions of these letters could turn into strips that continued and formed more abstract motifs, or sometimes formed the edges of a cartouche encompassing the rest of the inscription.

The texts of the Alhambra include &quot;devout, regal, votive, and Qur&#x27;anic phrases and sentences,&quot; formed into arabesques, carved into wood and marble, and glazed onto tiles. Poets of the Nasrid court, including Ibn al-Khatīb and Ibn Zamrak, composed poems for the palace. The inscriptions of the Alhambra are also unique for their frequent self-referential nature and use of personification. Some inscribed poems, such as those in the Palace of the Lions, talk about the palace or room in which they&#x27;re situated and are written in the first person, as if the room itself was speaking to the reader. Most of the poetry is inscribed in Nasrid cursive script, while foliate and floral Kufic inscriptions—often formed into arches, columns, enjambments, and &quot;architectural calligrams&quot;—are generally used as decorative elements. Kufic calligrams, particularly of the words &quot;blessing&quot; ( &quot;baraka&quot;) and &quot;felicity&quot; ( &quot;yumn&quot;), are used as decorative motifs in arabesque throughout the palace. Like the rest of the original stucco decoration, many inscriptions were originally painted and enhanced with colours. Studies indicate that the letters were often painted in gold or silver, or in white with black outlines, which would have made them stand out on the decorated backgrounds that were often painted in red, blue, or turquoise (with other colours mixed into the details).
== Main structures ==
=== Entrance gates ===

The main gate of the Alhambra is the large &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot; (Gate of Justice), known in Arabic as &quot;Bab al-Shari&#x27;a&quot; (), which served as the main entrance on the south side of the walled complex. It was built in 1348 during the reign of Yusuf I. The gate consists of a large horseshoe arch leading to a steep ramp passing through a bent passage. The passage turns 90 degrees to the left and then 90 degrees to the right, with an opening above where defenders could throw projectiles onto any attackers below. The image of a hand, whose five fingers symbolized the Five Pillars of Islam, is carved above the archway on the exterior façade, while the image of a key, another symbol of faith, is carved above the archway on the inner façade. A Christian-era sculpture of the Virgin and Christ Child was inserted later into another niche just inside the gate. Near the outside of the gate is the &quot;Pilar de Carlos V&quot;, a Renaissance-style fountain built in 1524 with some further alterations in 1624.

At the end of the passage coming from the &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot; is the &quot;Plaza de los Aljibes&quot; (&#x27;Place of the Cisterns&#x27;), a broad open space which divides the Alcazaba from the Nasrid Palaces. The plaza is named after a large cistern dating to around 1494, commissioned by Iñigo López de Mondoza y Quiñones. The cistern was one of the first works carried out in the Alhambra after the 1492 conquest and it filled what was previously a gully between the Alcazaba and the palaces. On the east side of the square is the &quot;Puerta del Vino&quot; (Wine Gate) which leads to the Palace of Charles V and to the former residential neighbourhoods (the &quot;medina&quot;) of the Alhambra. The gate&#x27;s construction is attributed to the reign of Muhammad III, although the decoration dates from different periods. Both the inner and outer façades of the gate are embellished with ceramic decoration filing the spandrels of the arches and stucco decoration above. On the western side of the gate is the carving of a key symbol like the one on the &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot;.
The other main gate of the Alhambra was the &quot;Puerta de las Armas&quot; (&#x27;Gate of Arms&#x27;), located on the north side of the Alcazaba, from which a walled ramp leads towards the &quot;Plaza de los Aljibes&quot; and the Nasrid Palaces. This was originally the main access point to the complex for the regular residents of the city, since it was accessible from the Albaicín side, but after the Christian conquest the &quot;Puerta de la Justicia&quot; was favoured by Ferdinand and Isabella. The gate, one of the earliest structures built in the Alhambra in the 13th century, is one of the Alhambra structures that bears the most resemblance to the Almohad architectural tradition that preceded the Nasrids. The exterior façade of the gate is decorated with a polylobed moulding with glazed tiles inside a rectangular &quot;alfiz&quot; frame. Inside the gate&#x27;s passage is a dome that is painted to simulate the appearance of red brick, a decorative feature characteristic of the Nasrid period.

Two other exterior gates existed, both located further east. On the north side is the &quot;Puerta del Arrabal&quot; (&#x27;Arrabal Gate&#x27;), which opens onto the &quot;Cuesta de los Chinos&quot; (&#x27;Slope of the Pebbles&#x27;), the ravine between the Alhambra and the Generalife. It was probably created under Muhammad II and served the first palaces of the Alhambra which were built in this area during his reign. It underwent numerous modifications in the later Christian era of the Alhambra. On the south side is the &quot;Puerta de los Siete Suelos&quot; (&#x27;Gate of Seven Floors&#x27;), which was almost entirely destroyed by the explosions set off by the departing French troops in 1812. The present gate was reconstructed in the 1970s with help of remaining fragments and of multiple old engravings that illustrate the former gate. The original gate was probably built in the mid-14th century and its original Arabic name was &quot;Bab al-Gudur&quot;. It would have been the main entrance serving the &quot;medina&quot;, the area occupied by industries and the houses of workers inside the Alhambra. It was also through here that the Catholic Monarchs first entered the Alhambra on January 2, 1492.

=== Alcazaba ===
The Alcazaba or citadel is the oldest part of the Alhambra today. It was the centrepiece of the complicated system of fortifications that protected the area. Its tallest tower, the high &quot;Torre del Homenaje&quot; (&#x27;Tower of Homage&#x27;), was the keep and military command post of the complex. It may have also been the first residence of Ibn al-Ahmar inside the Alhambra while the complex was being constructed. The westernmost tower, the high &quot;Torre de la Vela&quot;, acted as a watch tower. The flag of Ferdinand and Isabella was first raised above it as a symbol of the Spanish conquest of Granada on 2 January 1492. A bell was added on the tower soon afterward and for centuries it was rung at regular times every day and on special occasions. In 1843 the tower became part of the city&#x27;s coat of arms. Inside the enclosure of the inner fortress was a residential district that housed the elite guards of the Alhambra. It contained urban amenities like a communal kitchen, a hammam, and a water supply cistern, as well as multiple subterranean chambers which served as dungeons and silos.

===Nasrid palaces===
The royal palace complex consists of three main parts, from west to east: the Mexuar, the Comares Palace, and the Palace of the Lions. Collectively, these palaces are also known as the &quot;Casa Real Vieja&quot; (&#x27;Old Royal Palace&#x27;), to distinguish them from the newer palaces erected next to them during the Christian Spanish period.

==== Mexuar ====
The Mexuar is the westernmost part of the palace complex. It was analogous to the &quot;mashwar&quot;s (or &quot;mechouar&quot;s) of royal palaces in North Africa. It was first built as part of the larger complex begun by Isma&#x27;il I which included the Comares Palace. It housed many of the administrative and more public functions of the palace, such as the chancery and the treasury. Its layout consisted of two consecutive courtyards followed by a main hall, all aligned along a central axis from west to east. Little remains of the two western courtyards of the Mexuar today, except for their foundations, a portico, and the water basin of a fountain. The main hall, known as the &quot;Sala del Mexuar&quot; or Council Hall, served as a throne hall where the sultan received and judged petitions. This area also granted access to the Comares Palace via the &quot;Cuarto Dorado&quot; section on the east side of the Council Hall. Multiple parts of the Mexuar were significantly modified in the post-&quot;Reconquista&quot; period; notably, the &quot;Sala del Mexuar&quot; was converted into a Christian chapel and additions were made to the &quot;Cuarto Dorado&quot; to convert it into a residence. Many of these additions were later removed during modern restorations in the 19th and 20th centuries.

====Comares Palace====

The Comares Palace was the core of a large palace complex begun by Isma&#x27;il I in the early 13th century and subsequently modified and refurbished by Yusuf I and Muhammad V over the course of the same century. This new palace complex served as the official palace of the sultan and the state, known in Arabic as the &quot;Qaṣr al-Sultan&quot; or &quot;Dār al-Mulk&quot;. The Comares Palace was accessed from the west through the Mexuar. An internal façade, known as the Comares Façade, stands on the south side of the &quot;Patio de Cuarto Dorado&quot; (&#x27;Courtyard of the Gilded Room&#x27;) at the east edge of the Mexuar. This highly decorated symmetrical façade, with two doors, was the entrance to the palace and likely served in some ceremonial functions.The Comares Palace itself is centred around the &quot;Patio de los Arrayanes&quot; (&#x27;Court of the Myrtles&#x27;), a courtyard measuring 23 to 23.5 metres wide and 36.6 metres long, with its long axis aligned roughly north-to-south. At the middle, aligned with the main axis of the court, is a wide reflective pool. The pool measures 34 metres long and 7,10 metres wide. The myrtle bushes that are the court&#x27;s namesake grow in hedges along either side of this pool. Two ornate porticos are situated at the north and south ends of the court, leading to further halls and rooms behind them. The court&#x27;s decoration contained eleven &quot;qasā&#x27;id&quot; by Ibn Zamrak, eight of which remain. Annexed to the east side of the palace are the Comares Baths, a royal hammam that is exceptionally well-preserved.

On the north side of the Court of the Myrtles, inside the massive Comares Tower, is the &quot;Salón de los Embajadores&quot; (&#x27;Hall of the Ambassadors&#x27;), the largest room in the Alhambra. It is accessed by passing through the &quot;Sala de la Barca&quot;, a wide rectangular hall behind the northern portico of the court. The Hall of the Ambassadors is a square chamber measuring 11.3 metres per side and rising to a height of 18.2 metres. This was the throne room or audience chamber of the sultan. The sultan&#x27;s throne was placed opposite the entrance in front of a recessed double-arched window at the back of the hall. In addition to the extensive tile and stucco decoration of the walls, the interior culminates in a large domed ceiling. The ceiling is made of 8017 interlinked pieces of wood that form an abstract geometric representation of the seven heavens. The hall and its tower project from the walls of the palace, with windows providing views in three directions. In this sense, it was an enlarged version of a &quot;mirador&quot;, a room from which the palace&#x27;s inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape.

====Palace of the Lions====
The Palace of the Lions is one of the most famous palaces in Islamic architecture and exemplifies the apogee of Nasrid architecture under the reign of Muhammad V. Its central rectangular courtyard measures about 28.7 metres long and 15.6 metres wide, with its long axis aligned roughly east-to-west. The arches and columns of the surrounding portico are arranged in a complex pattern of single columns alternating with groups of two or three columns, a design that was unique in Islamic architecture. Two ornate pavilions stand at the east and west sides of the courtyard, while the centre is occupied by the famed Fountain of the Lions. The fountain consists of a large basin surrounded by twelve stylized lion sculptures, all carved from marble. Along the rim of the fountain&#x27;s basin is an inscribed poem composed by Ibn Zamrak. This praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions, but it also describes their hydraulic systems and how they worked.

Four halls are arranged around the courtyard. The &quot;Sala de los Mocárabes&quot; (&#x27;Hall of the &quot;mocárabes&quot; (&quot;muqarnas&quot;)&#x27;), on the west side, was damaged in 1590 by the explosion of a nearby gunpowder magazine and its ceiling was replaced by the current Baroque-style plaster vault in 1714. The (&#x27;Hall of Kings&#x27;), on the east side, is subdivided into multiple sections covered by &quot;muqarnas&quot; vaults. Opening behind these are several more rooms, three of which contain rounded vault ceilings covered by unique pictorial scenes painted on leather. One painting shows ten figures, probably sultans or other important dignitaries, sitting and discussing together. The two other paintings feature scenes of sports, hunting, and court life. The style of painting was influenced to one extent or another by Christian Gothic art.

On the south side of the courtyard, the &quot;Sala de los Abencerrajes&quot; (&#x27;Hall of the Abencerrages&#x27;) derives its name from a legend according to which the father of Boabdil, the last sultan of Granada, having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet, massacred them here. It is covered by an elaborate &quot;muqarnas&quot; vault ceiling, featuring a 16-sided lantern cupola in the shape of an eight-pointed star, possibly symbolizing the celestial heaven. On the north side of the courtyard is the &quot;Sala de Dos Hermanas&quot; (&#x27;Hall of Two Sisters&#x27;), so-called because of two large slabs of marble that form part of the pavement. Its original Arabic name was &quot;al-Qubba al-Kubrā&quot; (), suggesting it had a particular significance. The hall is covered by one of the most remarkable &quot;muqarnas&quot; domes in Islamic art. The &quot;muqarnas&quot; composition consists of at least 5000 prismatic pieces, unfolding from the central summit into sixteen miniature domes right above the level of the windows.

To the north of the &quot;Sala de Dos Hermanas&quot;, and accessed through it, is the &quot;Mirador de Lindaraja&quot;, a small projecting room with double-arched windows on three sides which overlook the gardens below. The name &quot;Lindaraja&quot; is a corruption of Arabic &quot;&#x27;Ayn Dar &#x27;Aisha&quot; (). This small chamber has some of the most sophisticated carved stucco decoration in the Alhambra and retains original mosaic tilework that features very fine Arabic inscriptions. The room is also covered by a unique vault ceiling consisting of a wooden lattice shaped into an interlacing geometric motif and filled with pieces of coloured glass.

==== Renaissance apartments and courtyards ====

To the east of the Comares Palace and the Palace of the Lions is an area of Renaissance-style Christian additions dating primarily from the 16th century. Directly north of the Palace of the Lions is the &quot;Patio de Lindaraja&quot; (Lindaraja Courtyard), originally an open garden area but turned into a cloistered garden by the addition of new structures around it during the 16th century. The fountain at its centre features a Baroque pedestal made in 1626 that supports a Nasrid marble basin installed here at the same time, although a replica now replaces the original basin which is kept at the Alhambra Museum. On the west and north sides of the courtyard, along the upper floors, are six rooms constructed for Charles V between 1528 and 1537, known as the Emperor&#x27;s Chambers. The most interesting details of the rooms are a marble fireplace sculpted with the emperor&#x27;s coat of arms and a ceiling of panels painted with pictures of fruits. The paintings were made around 1537 by Julio Aquiles and Alejandro Mayner. To the west of the Lindaraja Courtyard is the smaller &quot;Patio de la Reja&quot; (&#x27;Courtyard of the Queen&#x27;), located between the Emperor&#x27;s Chambers and the Comares Tower. A gallery was built around the upper floor of the courtyard between 1654 and 1655.

Further north is a tower known as the &quot;Peinador de la Reina&quot; (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s Robing Room&#x27;), formerly known as the Tower of Abu al-Juyyush. This was originally a stand-alone fortification tower in the Alhambra walls that was probably built in the reign of Nasr (r. 1309–1314), also known as Abu al-Juyyush. Yusuf I converted it into a small palatial residence with a lantern ceiling and Muhammad V later added decoration around its entrance. Between 1528 and 1537 it was connected to the Emperor&#x27;s Chambers via a new elevated gallery and an upper level was added to the tower around the existing lantern ceiling. Between 1539 and 1546 this upper floor was painted by Julio Aquiles and Alejandro Mayner with mythological scenes, depictions of Charles V&#x27;s 1535 invasion of Tunis, and more formal classical-like motifs. Later, in 1618, Nasrid-period columns and capitals from other palaces were integrated into the gallery, some of which were later moved to the Alhambra Museum.

==== Partal Palace and gardens ====
To the east of the Palace of the Lions and the Renaissance additions is the Partal Palace, a pavilion structure on the edge of the Alhambra walls. It was built by Muhammad III, which makes it the oldest surviving palace in the Alhambra today, although it has undergone many alterations since then. Its south side has a portico and faces a large reflective pool, while a mirador projects from its north side over the walls. Next to it is a small but richly decorated oratory containing a mihrab. Beyond the Partal is an area of gardens stretching along the northern wall of the Alhambra. Several towers along this northern wall were converted into small palatial residences during the Nasrid period, including the &quot;Torre de los Picos&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Pointed Battlements&quot;), the &quot;Torre de la Cautiva&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Captive&quot;), and the &quot;Torre de las Infantas&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Princesses&quot;). For tourists visiting the Alhambra today, all these areas are accessible after passing through the main Nasrid Palaces, although the palace-towers are not normally open to visitors.

=== Palace of Charles V ===

The palace commissioned by Charles V in the middle of the Alhambra was designed by Pedro Machuca, an architect who had trained under Michelangelo in Rome and who was steeped in the culture of the Italian High Renaissance and of the artistic circles of Raphael and Giulio Romano. It was conceived in a contemporary Renaissance style or &quot;Roman&quot; style with an innovative design reflecting the architectural ideals of this period. The construction of a monumental Italian-influenced palace in the heart of the Nasrid-built Alhambra symbolized Charles V&#x27;s imperial status and the triumph of Christianity over Islam achieved by his grandparents (the Catholic Monarchs). It consists of a massive square structure of stone which encloses a perfectly circular courtyard. The exterior facades are divided into two horizontal zones of decoration, with rustication below and pilasters alternating with other embellishments above. The two main entrance portals, on the western and southern sides, have designs resembling triumphal arches with engaged columns. The pedestals of these columns are carved with reliefs depicting allegorical scenes such as the Victories destroying armaments, representing the emperor&#x27;s imposition of a universal peace. The upper façade of the southern entrance portal features a Serlian window. Among the other details of the palace façades are a series of bronze rings or knockers which are strictly ornamental, with more Hispanic symbolic imagery such as lion and eagle heads. Pedro Machuca had intended to create plazas with colonnades on the east and west sides of the building to serve as a grand new approach to the Alhambra palaces, but these were never executed.

Construction of the palace began in 1527. After Machuca&#x27;s death in 1550, it was continued by his son Luis, who finished the facades and built the internal courtyard. Work was halted for 15 years when the 1568 Morisco Rebellion began. Work was still unfinished when Philip IV visited in 1628 and the project was finally abandoned in 1637, leaving the structure without a roof. It was finally completed after 1923, when Leopoldo Torres Balbás began its restoration. Today, the building houses the Alhambra Museum, which holds objects and artefacts relating to the Alhambra&#x27;s history, as well as the Fine Arts Museum of Granada, which houses a collection of paintings from Granada dating from the 16th to 20th centuries.

=== Other Nasrid palaces ===

Three other major Nasrid-era palaces once existed but were largely destroyed over the centuries. The excavated remains of the &quot;Palacio del Partal Alto&quot; (&quot;Upper Partal Palace&quot;), also known as the &quot;Palacio del Conde del Tendilla&quot; (&quot;Palace of the Count of Tendilla&#x27;&quot;), are incorporated today into the Partal Gardens. The palace dates from the time of Muhammad II, with later renovations and modifications, and is the oldest palace in the Alhambra of which traces have been found.

The Palace of the Convent of San Francisco (&quot;Palacio del Convento de San Francisco&quot;, also known as the &quot;Palacio de los Infantes&quot;) is named after the Convent of Saint Francis which was installed here in 1494. The Nasrid palace here was probably first built by Muhammad II but some surviving inscriptions suggest it was significantly remodelled by Muhammad V. Little remains of the Nasrid structure today except for a rectangular courtyard and some of its adjoining rooms, including a richly-decorated chamber with &quot;muqarnas&quot; vaulting. Queen Isabella I was originally buried here in 1504 before her body was moved to the Royal Chapel near the cathedral. The rest of the present-day building dates from an 18th-century remodelling of the convent and includes a cloistered courtyard. Today it serves as a Parador (state-owned hotel).

The Palace of the Abencerrajes (&quot;Palacio de los Abencerrajes&quot;) was one of the largest palaces in the Alhambra and may also date from the time of Muhammad II. What was left of the palace was blown up by Napoleon&#x27;s troops in 1812. It then became part of an area of abandoned ruins known as the Secano. Its excavated remains are visible today in the southern part of the complex but they have yet to be fully studied.

=== Church of Santa Maria and the Alhambra Mosque ===

Located just east of the Palace of Charles V is the Catholic Church of &quot;Santa María de la Alhambra&quot; (&#x27;Saint Mary of the Alhambra&#x27;), which stands on the site of the former Alhambra Mosque, the congregational mosque of the Alhambra complex. The church was built between 1581 and 1618. It is under the authority of the Archbishop of Granada. The building was designed by architects Juan de Herrera and Juan de Orea and completed by Ambrosio Vico. Inside is a large Baroque altarpiece with gilded ornate columns completed in 1671, although the most impressive centrepiece of the altar, a sculpture of Our Lady of Sorrows (depicting Mary holding the body of Jesus), was carved between 1750 and 1760 by Torcuato Ruiz del Peral. Every year during Holy Week, this sculpture is taken out and carried in a procession through the streets of Granada. During processions it is carried on top of a &quot;throne&quot; or platform that is sculpted to resemble the arcades in the Court of the Lions.

Little remains of the Alhambra Mosque which stood previously on this site, aside from an ornate bronze lamp now preserved at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid. According to an inscription on this lamp and to the writings of Ibn al-Khatib, the mosque was commissioned by Muhammad III and completed in 1305. The mosque&#x27;s main axis was aligned towards the &quot;qibla&quot; to the southeast, which also matched the alignment of the main street next to it. The structure consisted of a hypostyle hall with three &quot;naves&quot; separated by rows of three arches. The arches were supported by marble columns with capitals similar in style to those of the earlier Cordoban Caliphate period in the 10th century. The roof was made of wood and the central nave, which led to the mihrab, had a higher ceiling than the two side naves. A slender minaret stood at the western end of the building. After the Christian conquest, the building was converted to a church but by the late 16th century it was in disrepair. It was finally demolished in 1576, prior to the construction of the present church.

==== Baths of the mosque ====

One of the Alhambra Mosque&#x27;s annexes, the baths (hammam), has been preserved on the east side of the church today and is accessible from the main street. Like other Islamic baths, it provided general hygiene to the local residents as well as the means to perform the ritual ablutions (&quot;ghusl&quot;) for religious purposes. Although sometimes eroticized in Romantic western literature, visitors attended the baths strictly with members of the same sex and wore cloths or towels around their private parts. These baths were constructed under Muhammad III along with the mosque. They may have been partly demolished in 1534 before being incorporated into a residential house during the 17th and 18th centuries. The preserved remains were significant enough to enable their restoration and reconstruction in 1934.

The layout of the baths had a typical sequence of rooms, including a changing room (&quot;bayt al-maslak͟h&quot; in Arabic), a cold room (&quot;bayt al-barid&quot;), and a hot room (&quot;bayt al-sak͟hun&quot;). Behind the hot room there would have been a boiler room where water was heated and firewood stored nearby. Original fragments of tile and stucco decoration, as well as part of the marble flooring, have been preserved in some of the rooms. The hot room has one small pool and another may have existed where a modern fountain stands today. However, unlike in Christian and earlier Greco-Roman culture, Muslims generally did not favour swimming or immersion in water for their visits to the baths. Private baths, of varying size and importance, were also built as part of the Alhambra&#x27;s palaces.

=== Rawda (Nasrid mausoleum) ===

In the space between the former mosque and the Palace of the Lions stood the &quot;Rawda&quot; (spelled &quot;Rauda&quot; in Spanish), the royal mausoleum of the Nasrids. The term &quot;rawda&quot; () means &#x27;garden&#x27; in Arabic, but a number of historic Islamic necropolises or cemeteries were known by this name, including the necropolis of the former Umayyad rulers in Cordoba. The Nasrid mausoleum was first built by Isma&#x27;il I in the early 14th century, though an earlier cemetery may have already existed there previously. The structure no longer stands today but it has been studied by archaeologists and its foundations are still visible. The necropolis consisted of a rectangular enclosure which was accessed through a small horseshoe-arch gate preserved today on its north side. Inside the enclosure was a square mausoleum chamber covered by a roof with a central square lantern. (The presence of the lantern is indicated by the remains of four pillars in the centre of the structure.) Some rectangular rooms were adjoined to the side of this chamber. The mausoleum was preceded by a rectangular courtyard. This layout was similar to some earlier mausoleums in North Africa and to the later Saadian Tombs in Marrakesh. Like the nearby mosque, the mausoleum was aligned with the &quot;qibla&quot;. It was decorated with carved stucco and tilework, remains of which have been uncovered in excavations. The windows of the central lantern were closed with wooden latticework, an example of which is preserved in the Alhambra Museum today.

The most important persons, such as the Nasrid rulers, were buried inside this mausoleum, but in the open space between the mausoleum and the outer enclosure wall were other graves belonging to less important figures. The tombs of important figures were covered with marble slabs on top of which were pyramidal or prismatic stones known as &quot;maqabriyya&quot;s, while lesser tombs outside where framed by stone curbs that made them look like miniature gardens. At the heads of important graves were marble tombstones carved with detailed inscriptions, some examples of which are preserved at the Alhambra Museum today. In 1574, during construction of the nearby Palace of Charles V, the tombstones of Muhammad II, Isma&#x27;il I, Yusuf I and Yusuf III were discovered. When Torres Balbás investigated the site in 1925–1926 he found 70 more graves inside the enclosure. Almost all the graves were already empty, as Muhammad XII, the last sultan of Granada, arranged to have the remains of his ancestors moved to an unknown site at Mondújar, in the Alpujarras.

=== Generalife ===

To the east of the Alhambra and outside its walls is the Generalife (from ), a Nasrid-era country estate which was first built by Muhammad II and Muhammad III in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. It underwent multiple modifications under later Nasrid rulers and then by Christian Spanish builders in the 16th century. It features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end. A large area of landscaped gardens from the 20th century occupies the approach to the former palace today. The Nasrid palace was originally linked to the Alhambra by a walled corridor that crossed the valley between them.

=== Other outlying structures ===

The main approach to the Alhambra today is through the Alhambra Woods in the valley on its south side. The outer entrance to the woods is through the &quot;Puerta de las Granadas&quot; (&#x27;Gate of the Pomegranates&#x27;), a formal Renaissance-style gate built in 1536 over the remains of an earlier Islamic-era gate. Within the woods is the &quot;Puerta de Birambla&quot; (from Arabic &quot;Bab al-Ramla&quot;), one of the former Islamic-era gates in Granada&#x27;s city walls which was demolished between 1873 and 1884 and then reconstructed here in 1933. To the south of the &quot;Puerta de las Granadas&quot; are the &quot;Torres Bermejas&quot; (&#x27;Vermilion Towers&#x27;), a group of three adjacent towers on the Mauror Hill. Their origin is not clear, but the oldest remains found here date from the late 8th century or early 9th century. They may have been inhabited by Muhammad I (the founder of the Nasrid dynasty). In the 16th century, during the Christian Spanish era, an artillery bastion was added to them on the northwest side.

During the Nasrid period there were several other country estates and palaces to the east of the Alhambra and the Generalife, located on the mountainside and taking advantage of the water supply system which ran through this area. The two best-known examples are the &quot;Palacio de los Alijares&quot; and the &quot;Dar al-&#x27;Arusa&quot; (), both of which were built in the 14th century and then abandoned some time after the 1492 conquest. Only traces of them remain today. They were probably richly decorated like the Alhambra palaces and were accompanied by gardens and amenities like hammams. Also nearby is the &quot;Silla del Moro&quot; (&#x27;Seat of the Moor&#x27;), a ruined structure on the hilltop overlooking the Generalife. It was once a fort and monitoring post that protected the water supply infrastructure in this area.

== Water supply system ==

Water was provided to both the Alhambra and the Generalife by the &quot;Acequia del Sultan&quot; (also known as the &quot;Acequia del Rey&quot; or &quot;Acequia Real&quot;), which still exists in large part today. It draws water from the Darro River at an uphill location in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, about 6.1 kilometres east of the Alhambra. A smaller branch known as the &quot;Acequia del Tercio&quot; also splits off from it several kilometres upstream and proceeded along higher ground before arriving at the top point of the Generalife&#x27;s palace and gardens. The main branch, proceeding along lower ground, also arrives at the Generalife palace and supplies water to its famous &quot;Patio de la Acequia&quot;. Both canals generally ran along the surface but some parts ran through tunnels cut directly into the bedrock.

After arriving at the Generalife, the canals turn towards the southeast and run past the gardens. They then join before turning back towards the Alhambra, where the water enters via an arched aqueduct next to the &quot;Torre del Agua&quot; (&#x27;Water Tower&#x27;) at the Alhambra&#x27;s eastern tip. From here it is channelled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits (&quot;acequias&quot;) and water tanks (&quot;albercones&quot;) which create the celebrated interplay of light, sound and surface in the palaces.

== Historic furnishings and art objects ==
While the walls and rooms of the Alhambra are devoid of furnishings today, they would have originally been decorated and filled with many objects such as carpets, floor cushions, and tapestries or similar objects to be hung on the walls. The custom of sitting on the ground explains why some of the windows in the miradors (lookout rooms) were situated so low, where the eyeline of seated persons would be.

Among the most famous objects from the Nasrid palaces are the &quot;Alhambra vases&quot;, a type of large Hispano-Moresque ware from the Nasrid period that were mostly found in the Alhambra. They stood on display in parts of the palace, probably in the corners of rooms. Their practical function, if any, is unclear but they probably served as accessories to complement the architecture. They stood about 125 centimetres tall on average, making them the largest lustreware pieces ever made. They were shaped like amphorae with narrow bases, bulging body, and narrow ribbed necks flanked by flat handles shaped like wings. They were decorated with Arabic inscriptions and other motifs, with the most common colours being cobalt blue, white, and gold. Ten vases of this kind have survived and began to be documented in the 18th century, making their way into museums afterwards. The earliest examples are dated to the late 13th or early 14th century, but the most elegant examples date from the late 14th or early 15th century. It is unclear where exactly they were produced, as there were several centres of ceramic production in the Nasrid kingdom, including Granada and Málaga. One of the best examples is the 14th-century Vase of the Gazelles, now kept at the Alhambra Museum. It stands 135 centimetres tall and is named after the image of confronted gazelles painted on its body.

Smaller jars and vases were also kept in niches in the walls and entrances of many rooms of the Alhambra. A &quot;taqa&quot;, a niche set into the walls under an archway (in the jambs), was a characteristic element of Nasrid architecture where such jars were kept, possibly filled with water for visitors. Examples of these niches are found in the entrance to the Hall of Ambassadors.

Another significant surviving object from the Alhambra is an elaborate bronze lamp that once hung in the main mosque, dated to 1305. The main section of the lamp is conical in shape, tied to a shaft or stem above which is punctuated with small spherical sections. The bronze is pierced to create Arabic inscriptions in a &quot;Naskhi&quot; script and a background of vegetal Arabesque motifs. After the 1492 conquest it was confiscated and made part of the treasury of Cardinal Cisneros. It is now on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid, although a replica is also kept at the Alhambra Museum.

==Influence==

=== In architecture ===

The Alhambra was often remembered nostalgically in some Muslim societies after the Christian conquest of 1492 and may have influenced later examples of Islamic architecture. For example, several monuments constructed by the Saadian dynasty, which ruled Morocco in the 16th and 17th centuries, appear to imitate prototypes found in the Alhambra, particularly the Court of the Lions.

Its architecture was also a model emulated in the &quot;Moresque&quot; architectural style, a historicist style that became fashionable in Europe in the 19th century, with the publications of Owen Jones being particularly important in establishing this influence. After Owen Jones published &quot;Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra&quot; in London from 1842 to 1845, a fanciful, ornamental, Alhambra-inspired Orientalist architectural style called &quot;Alhambresque&quot; became popular in the West in the 19th century.

The Alhambresque style was later absorbed in the Ottoman world, in what Ussama Makdisi called &quot;Ottoman Orientalism.&quot; Early use of Alhambresque motifs (such as &quot;sebka&quot;) is evident in buildings from the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz () in Istanbul, such as the monumental gate on Beyazıt Square (), now the entrance of Istanbul University. The mausoleum of Fuad Pasha (1869–70), who personally visited the Alhambra as Ottoman ambassador in 1844, is almost entirely in a &quot;Moresque&quot; style. The style was also employed in the Gezira Palace in Cairo, built to host royal guests for the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal. Khedive Isma&#x27;il even commissioned Owen Jones to design the interiors of this palace.

The Alhambra also inspired a number of buildings in Moorish Revival architecture:
*Isaac M. Wise Temple (synagogue in Cincinnati, Ohio)
*Villa Zorayda (villa in St. Augustine, Florida)
*Villa Alhambra (villa in Malta)

===In mathematics===

The Alhambra tiles are remarkable in that they contain nearly all, if not all, of the seventeen mathematically possible wallpaper groups. This is a unique accomplishment in world architecture. M. C. Escher&#x27;s visit in 1922 and study of the Moorish use of symmetries in the Alhambra tiles inspired his subsequent work on tessellation, which he called &quot;regular divisions of the plane&quot;.

<text>The Wizard of Id is a daily newspaper comic strip created by American cartoonists Brant Parker and Johnny Hart. Beginning November 16, 1964, the strip follows the antics of a large cast of characters in a shabby medieval kingdom called &quot;Id&quot;. The title is a play on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, combined with the Freudian psychological term &quot;id&quot;, which represents the instinctive and primal part of the human psyche.

In 1997, Brant Parker passed his illustrator&#x27;s duties on to his son, Jeff Parker, who had already been involved with creating &quot;Id&quot; for a decade. In 2002, the strip appeared in some 1,000 newspapers all over the world, syndicated by Creators Syndicate. Hart&#x27;s grandson Mason Mastroianni took over writing duties on the strip after Hart&#x27;s death in 2007. The new byline, &quot;B.C. by Mastroianni and Hart,&quot; appeared for the first time in another of their strips on January 3, 2010. On December 14, 2015, Jeff Parker also passed his duties on to Mastroianni.

==Overview==

===History===
In the early 1960s, Johnny Hart, having already created the successful &quot;B.C.&quot;, began collaborating with his friend, then-unpublished cartoonist Brant Parker, on a new comic strip. (Parker would later create or co-create the strips &quot;Goosemyer&quot;, &quot;Crock&quot; and &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;.) Having already drawn cartoons about the Stone Age, Hart advanced through time to the Middle Ages, taking the idea from a deck of playing cards. &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; was first syndicated on November 16, 1964, drawn by Parker and co-written by Parker and Hart.

On November 17, 2014, the strip formally celebrated its 50th anniversary, and a number of other strips, including &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;, &quot;Ballard Street&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Garfield&quot;, &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;, &quot;Pickles&quot;, &quot;Mutts&quot;, &quot;Pooch Café&quot;, &quot;The Brilliant Mind of Edison Lee&quot;, and &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; ran special 50th anniversary commemorative strips (e.g., Beetle called Sarge &quot;a fink,&quot; and ended up sharing a dungeon cell with Spookingdorf). &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; ran an otherwise-ordinary strip with a portrait of the Wizard in the last panel, while &quot;Speed Bump&quot; ran a cartoon of Harry Potter in a Wizard of Id T-shirt, &quot;Family Circus&quot; put a greeting on a book (being held upside down), and &quot;Blondie&quot; showed a greeting written on a cake in the first panel.

===Setting===
&quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; deals with the goings-on of the rundown and oppressed mythical kingdom of Id. It follows people from all corners of the kingdom, but concentrates on the court of a tyrannical, dwarfish monarch known only as &quot;the King&quot;. The strip&#x27;s humor occasionally satirizes modern American culture, and deliberate anachronisms are rampant. Technology changes to suit whatever a gag requires; a battle with spears and arrows might be followed by a peasant using an ATM.

In some strips, the king is elected to his monarchial position (albeit through rigged ballots). The aspects that stay the same, however, are that Id is in the middle of nowhere, home to a large castle surrounded by a moat. The king and his subjects run an inept army perpetually at war with &quot;the Huns&quot;, while the unhappy, overtaxed peasants (or &quot;Idiots&quot;) make little money as farmers and stablehands to keep modest lifestyles.

===Format===
&quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; follows a gag-a-day format, plus a color Sunday page. There are running gags relating to the main cast, to a variety of secondary, continuing characters, and to the kingdom itself. Occasionally it will run an extended sequence on a given theme over a week or two.

===Style===
According to Don Markstein&#x27;s &quot;Toonopedia&quot;, &quot;The strip&#x27;s humor style—quite contemporary, in contrast to its medieval setting—ranges from broad and low to pure black&quot;.

The style in which certain characters are drawn has changed from the early years of the strip to today. For example, the old style of the King&#x27;s head was more rectangular, he had a crown with identifiable card suits on it (club, diamond, heart), his mustache and beard always hid his mouth, and his beard frequently extended to a curved point when the King was shown in profile (see &quot;The Wondrous Wizard of Id&quot;, 1970, Fawcett Publications). In the new style, the King&#x27;s head is more trapezoidal with a slightly smaller and undecorated crown, he has a huge nose (even bigger than Rodney&#x27;s) which covers his mouth and chin, and when he opens his mouth it appears that his beard has been shaved off. Like Sir Rodney and other large-nosed characters in the comic, he often &quot;breaks the fourth wall&quot; and stares directly at the audience in the final frame of the strip to indicate disgust or embarrassment when the punchline is spoken, accentuating the huge bulbous shape of his nose.

On December 14, 2015, Mason Mastroianni took over the strip from Jeff Parker.

==Cast of characters==
===Main characters===
* The King: A pint-sized despot modeled after Napoleon; like many characters in the strip, the king is named simply after his role. Occasionally, his name is given as &quot;Id&quot;. &quot;Sire&quot; to his subjects, he is greedy, petty and vindictive, but he maintains a sense of humor. Jokes are often centered on his height (about three feet). He wears a crown and cape that makes him look like a playing card (and in the 1960s and 1970s he did resemble the Jack card with his crown decorated with the four card suits). From his throne room he hands out terrible, Draconian punishments for crimes (executions being quite common). He is only ever looking to win votes, power and money. He has a thin skin and a short temper (especially about his height), and main characters often find themselves chained to the wall or the rack if they thoughtlessly insult the king. He is hated by the peasants, who to his dismay often proclaim &quot;The king is a !&quot; On one occasion the King calls himself a &quot;fink.&quot; However, he is occasionally shown to have a quirky softer side, and it is mentioned his only friends are the moat monsters. His &quot;pets&quot; are a dragon and a St. Bernard dog named Bonapart; he rides Bonapart in fox hunts - although he can ride horses as well. An ancestor of the King - who resembles his descendant - was King of Id II who was beheaded by his successor King of Id III. In regard to the King&#x27;s parents: his father, who was king until his son overthrew him, is kept in a tower surrounded by &quot;The King of Id&quot; jack-in-the-box toys — the only gifts his son gives him; he also calls his son &quot;A Fink&quot;. His mother works as a charwoman and routinely complains and scolds her son — the only person who ever does so. He has a brother named Cyril. His coat of arms is a picture of his head on the body of a bull. The only time the King has ever won anything honestly is when he found out he was going to be selected to appear on bubble gum &quot;Tyrant Cards&quot; series. When the King was unmarried, he did once ask Snow White to introduce him to the Evil Queen so he could date the Queen; however by February 2016 the King has a Queen named Fanabella and a mother-in-law as well. In a comic crossover in connection with the 75th anniversary of the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot; the King and Julius Dithers were soul brothers. A running gag is that at Christmas the King tries to get presents from Santa Claus and always fails.
* The Wizard: The title character, he is the king&#x27;s royal wielder of magic, sometimes nicknamed &quot;Wiz&quot;. He is smart but sarcastic, good-natured but cynical, and is constantly dominated by his wife, Blanch. He wears a traditional pointed wizards&#x27; cap festooned with stars and crescent moons, like Merlin. From his basement, he works over a vat, where his spirit familiar lives. He is capable of powerful spells, but often his plans backfire on him. One time on the day of the Royal picnic a heavy rainstorm broke out. The Wizard tried to dispel the rain by repeating a spell for the rain to go away and to come again some other day; too late he remembers the last time it rained he recited this spell and that the other day is now the Royal picnic day; the angry king has him chained up in the dungeon under a perpetual shower of water! He is friendly to all the king&#x27;s subjects, but like most of them, he secretly considers the king to be a creep (or a fink). Both his parents are involved with magic. His father can turn himself invisible His 800-year-old mother is also a sorceress; every Mother&#x27;s Day, she receives a cat from her son.

* Blanch: The Wizard&#x27;s worse half; his domineering, meddlesome harridan of a wife. It has been said the Wizard married Blanch for her money, for she is considered extremely ugly by everyone in the kingdom. She nags at Wiz every day, and her cooking is awful. Her mother (who is never seen) is apparently just as bad. Occasionally though, she looks to him for romance, which he is hesitant to offer. She also heads the Women&#x27;s Liberation front in Id. One time the Wizard make a foolish comment to Blanch not to stand too long in an antique store else someone would hang a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign on her; Blanch put him into a vase; another time Gwen asked the Wizard why he did not marry a witch; he did not answer because as Blanch explained his teeth will not allow his tongue to give an answer. Once two Huns decided to Attack the Kingdom of ID-until they saw Blanch and lost heart for doing so!
* Sir Rodney (Beakmeister) aka &quot;Chicken-Hearted&quot; : His father was Sir Francis Beakmeister. Usually just called &quot;Rodney&quot;, he is the king&#x27;s chief knight and head of the hapless royal army and the Admiral of the Kingdom&#x27;s Navy. His standard is that of a yellow chicken on a white background. He is a tall, lanky man of dopey intelligence who wears blue chainmail and carries a spear. He is hopeless as a warrior, and his troops are just as incompetent. Rodney is at heart a coward; he is terrified of fighting and often pretends to be good at slaying dragons, while in fact he once bribed one, (known as &quot;Dragy&quot;). He has an enormous nose, the source of many jokes—and is always trying to win the King&#x27;s attention. He occasionally works as a spy, wearing a tree costume with a large hole to accommodate his nose. His horse is just as much a coward as Rodney is.
* Gwen: A beautiful but frustrated fair maiden who, as her blonde stereotype suggests, is quite clueless. She is adored by all but is in love only with Rodney. They sometimes date, but in his non-macho way he is usually too dense to return the romantic feelings she has for him. She often spends time commiserating with Blanch, or conversing with frogs who claim to be enchanted princes. On February 14, 2016, Rodney arranged with Cupid to give a &quot;Love hit&quot; on Gwen.
* Wellington J. Fransworth Spookingdorf III: Usually just called &quot;Spook&quot;, he is a miserable, comically destitute prisoner who for many years has lived in the dungeons beneath the castle. He is covered from head to hip with hair, sometimes being likened to a giant rat. His crime was one of a few mentioned things (when a visiting earl expressed an interest in meeting the only person to beat the king at croquet, he is introduced to the Spook, or when he called the King a &quot;two bit, four flushing, dirty, lowdown, indiscriminate clod&quot; in an early strip), but most of the time it is accepted that the king sentenced Spook to a lifetime in the dungeon for calling him a fink. He is treated poorly by the system, but his best friend is the warder Turnkey, posted outside his cell. He lives beneath the level of the moat, eating &quot;swill,&quot; a bland, disgusting slop similar to garbage. For a hobby, he attempts to escape frequently. He normally tunnels under the walls, only to have his plans ironically cut short. His favorite book is &quot;History&#x27;s Great Escapes&quot; (coincidentally his own autobiography) (strip of June 28, 1967, also published in &quot;Remember The Golden Rule&quot;). It is mentioned that his full name is Wellington J. Fransworth Spookingdorf the Third in the strip of August 20, 1970, featured in Volume No. 10 of the series. One time the King actually let the Spook out of his dungeon to vote- the Spook voted for the king&#x27;s opponent-and ended up falling into his dungeon again. Another time Spook was twice released from his dungeon but only to be the &quot;fox&quot; in a fox hunt. On the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Wizard of ID&quot; Beetle Bailey called Sgt Snorkel a &quot;Fink&quot; and ended up beaten up and in the dungeon beside the Spook. As of November 29, 2016, the Spook had failed in his 500th escape attempt.
* Turnkey: The guard who runs the dungeons but spends all his time sitting outside the Spook&#x27;s cell. In a way their lives are similar—he is stuck in the same place all day and he does not have an important place in the world. He sometimes expresses frustration about this to the Spook.

* Bung: The court jester, a chronic alcoholic who spends little time entertaining and most of his time in saloons or the royal wine cellar. He wears traditional jester&#x27;s garb with bells on the bonnet, but he is rarely seen to perform. Frequently drunk, he once declared, &quot;I&#x27;ve learned the secret to avoiding hangovers: Don&#x27;t sober up!&quot; (A &quot;bung&quot; is a cork in a barrel or bottle of an alcoholic beverage.) In cartoon tradition, his intoxicated state is portrayed by a prominent red nose surrounded by tiny, fizzing bubbles. 
* Larsen E. Pettifogger: Attorney-at-law in the kingdom of Id. An unscrupulous, incompetent shyster with a big pretentious nose and stovepipe hat, he lies and cheats to protect criminals. While inept as a lawyer, he is greedy and selfish (a common catchphrase of his is &quot;every man is innocent until proven broke&quot;), and does not mind imbibing alcohol at his clients&#x27; expense. Although it is generally accepted that he has never won a case, there have been a few occasions when his clients have been acquitted by chance. For example, once upon exiting the court, he remarked to the defendant, &quot;That was a close one. Once or twice there I thought the judge was going to wake up.&quot; On two occasions because of Pettifogger pleading, the King gave each of Pettifogger&#x27;s clients a &quot;suspended&quot; sentence-one executed by hanging and the other ended up hanging by his thumbs. Pettifogger has been the Spook&#x27;s lawyer on several occasions and is also the King&#x27;s stockbroker and is singularly unsuccessful. His appearance and manner are patterned directly after W.C. Fields, one of whose film and radio characters was named &quot;Larson E. Whipsnade&quot;. (&quot;Larsen E.&quot; is a pun on larceny while the word &quot;pettifogger&quot; means a less-than-scrupulous attorney.)
* Evil Spirit: An apparition who lives in the Wizard&#x27;s vat and takes form as a smoky puff of gas. He keeps the Wizard company while at work, but he is more childish and gullible than evil. It is sometimes mentioned he has a &quot;sewer wisp&quot; for a girlfriend.
* The Doc: The royal physician, the subject of many doctor jokes. He plays golf, for instance, charges outrageous fees, and is indifferent to the health and welfare of his patients. His name was only revealed once (in a strip reprinted in &quot;Strike The Sot!&quot;)—Dr. Puckerstein.
* The Duke: A vain, toadying nobleman who helps the King run the castle and shares in the duties of the government. He wears an Elizabethan ruff collar and a pageboy hairdo, is pompous and self-admiring, and he never likes to get his hands dirty. Like Rodney, he strives to impress the King at all times. He is often cited as the King&#x27;s &quot;P.R. man&quot;. His full title, according to a letter he once signed to a peasant requesting an autograph, is &quot;The Duke of Marinello&quot;.
* Lackey: The king&#x27;s personal servant. He never says much, but is loyal enough to stand by the throne and await the King&#x27;s every order. He is therefore often overworked. However, Lackey has displayed occasional resentment about his position; in one strip, when he informs the king that a vendor has arrived selling slaves, the indignant King orders Lackey to tell the visitor that the King does not believe in slavery. After confirming that the king is serious about this proclamation (&quot;You&#x27;re darned right!&quot;), Lackey leaves the room, remarking &quot;Tell him yourself, shorty.&quot;

===Supporting characters===
In addition to the main cast, several recurring jokes have run throughout the life of the comic strip for which certain characters come back from time to time.

* The Night Sentry: Ralph, a formerly unnamed tower guard who cries &quot;Twelve o&#x27;clock and all&#x27;s well&quot;, etc., but cannot resist ad-libbing sarcastic commentary—much to the annoyance of the King, who suffers from insomnia.
* The Stablehands: Two unnamed peasants, invariably holding pitchforks and shovels, and unhappy in their work. Hart and Parker would cut to them whenever they had a &quot;dung&quot; joke. The peasants and their work are also used as an analogy for low-level paper-pushing bureaucrats.
* Robbing Hood: A forest-dweller who, unlike the Robin Hood character he parodies, &quot;takes from the wretch and gives to the peer&quot;, (usually himself).
* The Lone Haranguer: A phantom heckler who frequently rides past the King&#x27;s window to shout &quot;The King is a fink!&quot; The King has suffered anxiety over the stranger, but he and Rodney have never succeeded in capturing or identifying him, their plans constantly backfiring on themselves. The name is a play on &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;.
* Troob: A local minstrel and poet, (a &quot;troubadour&quot;) who travels the kingdom writing songs and commentary on Id&#x27;s ways of life. He sometimes entertains the King on his lute, but his music is uninviting. He is one of the few people in Id to be streetwise enough to see the bigger picture of the state of the kingdom. His song describes the place well: &quot;The land of Id, &#x27;tis such delight, the land of milk and honey / No need to lock your doors at night, the King has all the money!&quot;
* Yodey: A stable boy whom Rodney is training to become a knight. He is a gigantic oaf, very strong but stupid and gullible. He looks up to Rodney to teach him, even though he is already more capable than Rodney is.
* Abra Cadaver: A Frankenstein-like monster the Wizard built out of old body parts. He is deranged but obedient, and is twice the size of the Wizard. The name is a play on &quot;abracadabra&quot; and &quot;cadaver&quot;.
* Bernie the Torch: An accident-prone peasant so unlucky that when he came out of hospital after being run over by a steamroller, a gargoyle fell on him. He was once hit by a meteorite during surgery, after getting run over by a horse.
* Magic Mirror: A talking mirror that lives to insult whoever happens to be addressing it, (usually either the King or Blanch).
* Henry: The Wizard&#x27;s pet dragon. The running gag is that keeping a dragon as a pet causes a lot of problems for the Wizard and Blanch, such as badly scratched doors, visits to the vet, or things that Henry might bring home.
* The Finks: Name of the Kingdom of Id basketball team
* The Huns: A tribe of raiders that often attack Id. They are depicted as large men completely covered in body hair like the Spook, with shaggy beards and horned &quot;Viking-style&quot; helmets, and armed with spears.

==In other media==
In 1969, Jim Henson and Don Sahlin produced a test pilot for &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;. By the time interest was expressed in the concept Henson was deeply involved in other projects and decided to not pursue it any further.

The comic was also adapted into a cartoon short in 1970, produced by Chuck Jones, directed by Abe Levitow and with voices from Paul Winchell and Don Messick.

Paul Williams in the early 1980s touted an Id feature film as upcoming in talk show appearances. &quot;I wanted to do The Wizard of Id as a feature. I went up to Endicott, New York and stayed with Johnny Hart, who became a really good friend, and actually made a deal with Columbia Pictures to do Wizard of Id as a feature. I was going to play the king. Then that whole David Begelman thing happened and it all fell apart.&quot;

Characters from the comic were featured in two educational computer games released in 1984, &quot;The Wizard of Id&#x27;s WizMath&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Id&#x27;s WizType&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; was named best humor strip by the National Cartoonists Society in 1971, 1976, 1980, 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Parker received a Reuben Award for his work on the strip. Dozens of paperback collections have been published since 1965, and some of the older titles were still in print as of 2010. In 2009, Titan Books began re-publishing the strips and is printing the complete daily and Sunday strips starting with 1971, publishing one annual collection per year.

==International syndication==
*The strip has been translated into Finnish as &quot;Velho&quot;, meaning &quot;wizard&quot;. A version in the Kainuu dialect called &quot;Näläkämoan noeta – Veleho kaenuuks&quot; was published in 2001.
*In Denmark it is called &quot;Troldkarlen Kogle&quot; and has previously appeared in the comic magazine &quot;Basserne&quot;
*In Italy, &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot; is known as &quot;Mago Wiz&quot; (&quot;Wiz The Sorcerer&quot;) and has been published in the comics magazines &quot;Il Mago&quot; and &quot;Linus&quot;, and in the science fiction magazine &quot;Urania&quot;, plus several hardcover editions also by Mondadori.
*The German version is called &quot;Magnus der Magier&quot; (&quot;Magnus the Magician&quot;).
*In Sweden it is called &quot;Trollkarlen från id&quot;.
*In the Netherlands it is called &quot;De Tovenaar van Fop&quot;. (&quot;The Wizard of Fool&quot;, &quot;fool&quot; in the sense of &quot;to trick&quot;.)
*The strip is known in many Spanish-speaking countries as &quot;El Mago Fedor&quot;. However, it is only published nowadays online on GoComics.com, under its English title, and has not been syndicated in South American newspapers since the mid-1990s (by that time practically all newspapers in the continent dropped them, as tastes began to change to more locally originated fare).
*In India it is published in English in the comics section of the English daily newspaper &quot;Deccan Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Times of India&quot;.
*In Pakistan it is published daily in the English newspaper &#x27;Dawn&#x27;.
*Treatment of the comic strip varies in individual countries, especially in monarchies. In Saudi Arabia, references to the king are deleted and replaced with &quot;the boss&quot;.

<text>A trans-Neptunian object (TNO), also written transneptunian object, is any minor planet in the Solar System that orbits the Sun at a greater average distance than Neptune, which has an orbital semi-major axis of 30.1 astronomical units (AU).

Typically, TNOs are further divided into the classical and resonant objects of the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc and detached objects with the sednoids being the most distant ones. As of February 2025, the catalog of minor planets contains 1006 numbered and more than 4,000 unnumbered TNOs. However, nearly 5900 objects with semimajor axis over 30 AU are present in the MPC catalog, with 1009 being numbered.

The first trans-Neptunian object to be discovered was Pluto in 1930. It took until 1992 to discover a second trans-Neptunian object orbiting the Sun directly, 15760 Albion. The most massive TNO known is Eris, followed by Pluto, , , and . More than 80 satellites have been discovered in orbit of trans-Neptunian objects. TNOs vary in color and are either grey-blue (BB) or very red (RR). They are thought to be composed of mixtures of rock, amorphous carbon and volatile ices such as water and methane, coated with tholins and other organic compounds.

Twelve minor planets with a semi-major axis greater than 150 AU and perihelion greater than 30 AU are known, which are called extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs).

== History ==

=== Discovery of Pluto ===
The orbit of each of the planets is slightly affected by the gravitational influences of the other planets. Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of Uranus and Neptune suggested that there were one or more additional planets beyond Neptune. The search for these led to the discovery of Pluto in February 1930, which was too small to explain the discrepancies. Revised estimates of Neptune&#x27;s mass from the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby in 1989 showed that the problem was spurious. Pluto was easiest to find because it has the highest apparent magnitude of all known trans-Neptunian objects. It also has a lower inclination to the ecliptic than most other large TNOs.

=== Subsequent discoveries ===
After Pluto&#x27;s discovery, American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh continued searching for some years for similar objects but found none. For a long time, no one searched for other TNOs as it was generally believed that Pluto, which up to August 2006 was classified as a planet, was the only major object beyond Neptune. Only after the 1992 discovery of a second TNO, 15760 Albion, did systematic searches for further such objects begin. A broad strip of the sky around the ecliptic was photographed and digitally evaluated for slowly moving objects. Hundreds of TNOs were found, with diameters in the range of 50 to 2,500 kilometers. Eris, the most massive TNO, was discovered in 2005, revisiting a long-running dispute within the scientific community over the classification of large TNOs, and whether objects like Pluto can be considered planets. Pluto and Eris were eventually classified as dwarf planets by the International Astronomical Union.

== Classification ==
According to their distance from the Sun and their orbital parameters, TNOs are classified in two large groups: the Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and the scattered disc objects (SDOs). The diagram to the right illustrates the distribution of known trans-Neptunian objects (up to 70 au) in relation to the orbits of the planets and the centaurs for reference. Different classes are represented in different colours. Resonant objects (including Neptune trojans) are plotted in red, classical Kuiper belt objects in blue. The scattered disc extends to the right, far beyond the diagram, with known objects at mean distances beyond 500 au (Sedna) and aphelia beyond 1,000  ().

=== KBOs ===
The EdgeworthKuiper belt contains objects with an average distance to the Sun of 30 to about 55 au, usually having close-to-circular orbits with a small inclination from the ecliptic. EdgeworthKuiper belt objects are further classified into the resonant trans-Neptunian object that are locked in an orbital resonance with Neptune, and the classical Kuiper belt objects, also called &quot;cubewanos&quot;, that have no such resonance, moving on almost circular orbits, unperturbed by Neptune. There are a large number of resonant subgroups, the largest being the twotinos (1:2 resonance) and the plutinos (2:3 resonance), named after their most prominent member, Pluto. Members of the classical EdgeworthKuiper belt include 15760 Albion, Quaoar and Makemake.

Another subclass of Kuiper belt objects is the so-called scattering objects (SO). These are non-resonant objects that come near enough to Neptune to have their orbits changed from time to time (such as causing changes in semi-major axis of at least 1.5 AU in 10 million years) and are thus undergoing gravitational scattering. Scattering objects are easier to detect than other trans-Neptunian objects of the same size because they come nearer to Earth, some having perihelia around 20 AU. Several are known with g-band absolute magnitude below 9, meaning that the estimated diameter is more than 100 km. It is estimated that there are between 240,000 and 830,000 scattering objects bigger than r-band absolute magnitude 12, corresponding to diameters greater than about 18 km. Scattering objects are hypothesized to be the source of the so-called Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), which have periods of less than 20 years.

=== SDOs ===
The scattered disc contains objects farther from the Sun, with very eccentric and inclined orbits. These orbits are non-resonant and non-planetary-orbit-crossing. A typical example is the most-massive-known TNO, Eris. Based on the Tisserand parameter relative to Neptune (TN), the objects in the scattered disc can be further divided into the &quot;typical&quot; scattered disc objects (SDOs, Scattered-near) with a TN of less than 3, and into the detached objects (ESDOs, Scattered-extended) with a TN greater than 3. In addition, detached objects have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2 The Sednoids are a further extreme sub-grouping of the detached objects with perihelia so distant that it is confirmed that their orbits cannot be explained by perturbations from the giant planets, nor by interaction with the galactic tides. However, a passing star could have moved them on their orbit.

== Physical characteristics ==

Given the apparent magnitude (&gt;20) of all but the biggest trans-Neptunian objects, the physical studies are limited to the following:
* thermal emissions for the largest objects (see size determination)
* colour indices, i.e. comparisons of the apparent magnitudes using different filters
* analysis of spectra, visual and infrared

Studying colours and spectra provides insight into the objects&#x27; origin and a potential correlation with other classes of objects, namely centaurs and some satellites of giant planets (Triton, Phoebe), suspected to originate in the Kuiper belt. However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, solar wind and micrometeorites. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer could be quite different from the regolith underneath, and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.

Small TNOs are thought to be low-density mixtures of rock and ice with some organic (carbon-containing) surface material such as tholins, detected in their spectra. On the other hand, the high density of , 2.6–3.3 g/cm3, suggests a very high non-ice content (compare with Pluto&#x27;s density: 1.86 g/cm3). The composition of some small TNOs could be similar to that of comets. Indeed, some centaurs undergo seasonal changes when they approach the Sun, making the boundary blurred &quot;(see 2060 Chiron and 7968 Elst–Pizarro)&quot;. However, population comparisons between centaurs and TNOs are still controversial.

=== Color indices ===


Colour indices are simple measures of the differences in the apparent magnitude of an object seen through blue (B), visible (V), i.e. green-yellow, and red (R) filters. The diagram illustrates known colour indices for all but the biggest objects (in slightly enhanced colour).
For reference, two moons, Triton and Phoebe, the centaur Pholus and the planet Mars are plotted &quot;(yellow labels, size not to scale)&quot;. Correlations between the colours and the orbital characteristics have been studied, to confirm theories of different origin of the different dynamic classes:
* Classical Kuiper belt object (cubewano) seem to be composed of two different colour populations: the so-called cold (inclination &lt;5°) population, displaying only red colours, and the so-called hot (higher inclination) population displaying the whole range of colours from blue to very red. A recent analysis based on the data from Deep Ecliptic Survey confirms this difference in colour between low-inclination (named &quot;Core&quot;) and high-inclination (named &quot;Halo&quot;) objects. Red colours of the Core objects together with their unperturbed orbits suggest that these objects could be a relic of the original population of the belt.
*Scattered disc objects show colour resemblances with hot classical objects pointing to a common origin.

While the relatively dimmer bodies, as well as the population as the whole, are reddish (V−I = 0.3–0.6), the bigger objects are often more neutral in colour (infrared index V−I &lt; 0.2). This distinction leads to suggestion that the surface of the largest bodies is covered with ices, hiding the redder, darker areas underneath.

=== Spectral type ===
Among TNOs, as among centaurs, there is a wide range of colors from blue-grey (neutral) to very red, but unlike the centaurs, bimodally grouped into grey and red centaurs, the distribution for TNOs appears to be uniform. The wide range of spectra differ in reflectivity in visible red and near infrared. Neutral objects present a flat spectrum, reflecting as much red and infrared as visible spectrum. Very red objects present a steep slope, reflecting much more in red and infrared.
A recent attempt at classification (common with centaurs) uses the total of four classes from BB (blue, or neutral color, average B−V 0.70, V−R 0.39, e.g. Orcus) to RR (very red, B−V 1.08, V−R 0.71, e.g. Sedna) with BR and IR as intermediate classes. BR (intermediate blue-red) and IR (moderately red) differ mostly in the infrared bands I, J and H.

Typical models of the surface include water ice, amorphous carbon, silicates and organic macromolecules, named tholins, created by intense radiation. Four major tholins are used to fit the reddening slope:
* Titan tholin, believed to be produced from a mixture of 90% N2 (nitrogen) and 10% (methane)
* Triton tholin, as above but with very low (0.1%) methane content
* (ethane) Ice tholin I, believed to be produced from a mixture of 86% and 14% C2H6 (ethane)
* (methanol) Ice tholin II, 80% H2O, 16% CH3OH (methanol) and 3% 
As an illustration of the two extreme classes BB and RR, the following compositions have been suggested
* for Sedna (RR very red): 24% Triton tholin, 7% carbon, 10% N2, 26% methanol, and 33% methane
* for Orcus (BB, grey/blue): 85% amorphous carbon, +4% Titan tholin, and 11% H2O ice

===Size determination and distribution ===
Characteristically, big (bright) objects are typically on inclined orbits, whereas the invariable plane regroups mostly small and dim objects.

It is difficult to estimate the diameter of TNOs. For very large objects, with very well known orbital elements (like Pluto), diameters can be precisely measured by occultation of stars. For other large TNOs, diameters can be estimated by thermal measurements. The intensity of light illuminating the object is known (from its distance to the Sun), and one assumes that most of its surface is in thermal equilibrium (usually not a bad assumption for an airless body). For a known albedo, it is possible to estimate the surface temperature, and correspondingly the intensity of heat radiation. Further, if the size of the object is known, it is possible to predict both the amount of visible light and emitted heat radiation reaching Earth. A simplifying factor is that the Sun emits almost all of its energy in visible light and at nearby frequencies, while at the cold temperatures of TNOs, the heat radiation is emitted at completely different wavelengths (the far infrared).

Thus there are two unknowns (albedo and size), which can be determined by two independent measurements (of the amount of reflected light and emitted infrared heat radiation). TNOs are so far from the Sun that they are very cold, hence producing black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth&#x27;s surface, but only from space using, e.g. the Spitzer Space Telescope. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs. For the majority of (small) objects, the diameter is estimated by assuming an albedo. However, the albedos found range from 0.50 down to 0.05, resulting in a size range of 1,200–3,700 km for an object of magnitude of 1.0.

== Notable objects ==


== Exploration ==
The only mission to date that primarily targeted a trans-Neptunian object was NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot;, which was launched in January 2006 and flew by the Pluto system in July 2015 and 486958 Arrokoth in January 2019.

In 2011, a design study explored a spacecraft survey of Quaoar, Sedna, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.

In 2019 one mission to TNOs included designs for orbital capture and multi-target scenarios.

Some TNOs that were studied in a design study paper were , , and Lempo.

The existence of planets beyond Neptune, ranging from less than an Earth mass (Sub-Earth) up to a brown dwarf has been often postulated for different theoretical reasons to explain several observed or speculated features of the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud. It was recently proposed to use ranging data from the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft to constrain the position of such a hypothesized body.

NASA has been working towards a dedicated Interstellar Precursor in the 21st century, one intentionally designed to reach the interstellar medium, and as part of this the flyby of objects like Sedna are also considered. Overall this type of spacecraft studies have proposed a launch in the 2020s, and would try to go a little faster than the Voyagers using existing technology. One 2018 design study for an Interstellar Precursor, included a visit of minor planet 50000 Quaoar, in the 2030s.

== Extreme trans-Neptunian objects ==


Among the extreme trans-Neptunian objects are three high-perihelion objects classified as sednoids: 90377 Sedna, , and 541132 Leleākūhonua. They are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 au. Their high perihelia keep them at a sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star or a member of the Sun&#x27;s birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.

<text>The Theogony (, , i.e. &quot;the genealogy or birth of the gods&quot;) is a poem by Hesiod (8th–7th century BC) describing the origins and genealogies of the Greek gods, composed . It is written in the Epic dialect of Ancient Greek and contains 1022 lines. It is one of the most important sources for the understanding of early Greek cosmology.

==Descriptions==
Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; is a large-scale synthesis of a vast variety of local Greek traditions concerning the gods, organized as a narrative that tells how they came to be and how they established permanent control over the cosmos. It is the first known Greek mythical cosmogony. The initial state of the universe is chaos, a dark indefinite void considered a divine primordial condition from which everything else appeared. Theogonies are a part of Greek mythology which embodies the desire to articulate reality as a whole; this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first later projects of speculative theorizing.

Further, in the &quot;Kings and Singers&quot; passage (80–103) Hesiod appropriates to himself the authority usually reserved to sacred kingship. The poet declares that it is he, where we might have expected some king instead, upon whom the Muses have bestowed the two gifts of a scepter and an authoritative voice (Hesiod, &quot;Theogony&quot; 30–3), which are the visible signs of kingship. It is not that this gesture is meant to make Hesiod a king. Rather, the point is that the authority of kingship now belongs to the poetic voice, the voice that is declaiming the &quot;Theogony&quot;.

Although it is often used as a sourcebook for Greek mythology, the &quot;Theogony&quot; is both more and less than that. In formal terms it is a hymn invoking Zeus and the Muses: parallel passages between it and the much shorter Homeric &quot;Hymn to the Muses&quot; make it clear that the &quot;Theogony&quot; developed out of a tradition of hymnic preludes with which an ancient Greek rhapsode would begin his performance at poetic competitions. It is necessary to see the &quot;Theogony&quot; not as the definitive source of Greek mythology, but rather as a snapshot of a dynamic tradition that happened to crystallize when Hesiod formulated the myths he knew—and to remember that the traditions have continued evolving since that time.

The written form of the &quot;Theogony&quot; was established in the 6th century BC. Even some conservative editors have concluded that the Typhon episode (820–68) is an interpolation.
Hesiod was probably influenced by some Near-Eastern traditions, such as the Babylonian Dynasty of Dunnum, which were mixed with local traditions, but they are more likely to be lingering traces from the Mycenaean tradition than the result of oriental contacts in Hesiod&#x27;s own time.
The decipherment of Hittite mythical texts, notably the &quot;Kingship in Heaven&quot; text first presented in 1946, with its castration mytheme, offers in the figure of Kumarbi an Anatolian parallel to Hesiod&#x27;s Uranus–Cronus conflict.

==The succession myth==
One of the principal components of the &quot;Theogony&quot; is the presentation of what is called the &quot;succession myth&quot;, which tells how Cronus overthrew Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos.

Uranus (Sky) initially produced eighteen children with his mother Gaia (Earth): the twelve Titans, the three Cyclopes, and the three Hecatoncheires (Hundred-Handers), but hating them, he hid them away somewhere inside Gaia. Angry and in distress, Gaia fashioned a sickle made of adamant and urged her children to punish their father. Only her son Cronus, the youngest Titan, was willing to do so. So Gaia hid Cronus in &quot;ambush&quot; and gave him the adamantine sickle, and when Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus reached out and castrated his father. This enabled the Titans to be born and Cronus to assume supreme command of the cosmos.

Cronus, having now taken over control of the cosmos from Uranus, wanted to ensure that he maintained control. Uranus and Gaia had prophesied to Cronus that one of Cronus&#x27; own children would overthrow him, so when Cronus married Rhea, he made sure to swallow each of the children she birthed: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus (in that order), to Rhea&#x27;s great sorrow. However, when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus, Rhea begged her parents Gaia and Uranus to help her save Zeus. So they sent Rhea to Lyctus on Crete to bear Zeus, and Gaia took the newborn Zeus to raise, hiding him deep in a cave beneath Mount Aigaion. Meanwhile, Rhea gave Cronus a huge stone wrapped in baby&#x27;s clothes which he swallowed thinking that it was another of Rhea&#x27;s children.

Zeus, now grown, forced Cronus (using some unspecified trickery of Gaia) to disgorge his other five children. Zeus then released his uncles the Cyclopes (apparently still imprisoned beneath the earth, along with the Hundred-Handers, where Uranus had originally confined them) who then provide Zeus with his great weapon, the thunderbolt, which had been hidden by Gaia. A great war was begun, the Titanomachy, between the new gods, Zeus and his siblings, and the old gods, Cronus and the Titans, for control of the cosmos. In the tenth year of that war, following Gaia&#x27;s counsel, Zeus released the Hundred-Handers, who joined the war against the Titans, helping Zeus to gain the upper hand. Zeus then cast the fury of his thunderbolt at the Titans, defeating them and throwing them into Tartarus, thus ending the Titanomachy.

A final threat to Zeus&#x27; power was to come in the form of the monster Typhon, son of Gaia and Tartarus. Zeus with his thunderbolt was quickly victorious, and Typhon was also imprisoned in Tartarus.

Zeus, by Gaia&#x27;s advice, was elected king of the gods, and he distributed various honors among the gods. Zeus then married his first wife Metis, but when he learned that Metis was fated to produce a son which might overthrow his rule, by the advice of Gaia and Uranus, Zeus swallowed Metis (while still pregnant with Athena). And so Zeus managed to end the cycle of succession and secure his eternal rule over the cosmos.

==The genealogies==

===The first gods===
The world began with the spontaneous generation of four beings: first arose Chaos (Chasm); then came Gaia (Earth), &quot;the ever-sure foundation of all&quot;; &quot;dim&quot; Tartarus, in the depths of the Earth; and Eros (Desire) &quot;fairest among the deathless gods&quot;.
From Chaos came Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night). And Nyx &quot;from union in love&quot; with Erebus produced Aether (Brightness) and Hemera (Day). From Gaia came Uranus (Sky), the Ourea (Mountains), and Pontus (Sea).




===Children of Gaia and Uranus===
Uranus mated with Gaia, and she gave birth to the twelve Titans: Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys and Cronus; the Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes and Arges; and the Hecatoncheires (&quot;Hundred-Handers&quot;): Cottus, Briareos, and Gyges.







===Children of Gaia and Uranus&#x27; blood, and Uranus&#x27; genitals===
When Cronus castrated Uranus, from Uranus&#x27; blood which splattered onto the earth, came the Erinyes (Furies), the Giants, and the Meliai. Cronus threw the severed genitals into the sea, around which foam developed and transformed into the goddess Aphrodite.




===Descendants of Nyx===
Meanwhile, Nyx (Night) alone produced children: Moros (Doom), Ker (Destiny), Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep), Oneiroi (Dreams), Momus (Blame), Oizys (Pain), Hesperides (Daughters of Night), Moirai (Fates), Keres (Destinies), Nemesis (Retribution), Apate (Deceit), Philotes (Love), Geras (Old Age), and Eris (Discord).

And from Eris alone, came Ponos (Hardship), Lethe (Forgetfulness), Limos (Starvation), Algea (Pains), Hysminai (Battles), Makhai (Wars), Phonoi (Murders), Androktasiai (Manslaughters), Neikea (Quarrels), Pseudea (Lies), Logoi (Stories), Amphillogiai (Disputes), Dysnomia (Anarchy), Ate (Ruin), and Horkos (Oath).







===Descendants of Gaia and Pontus===
After Uranus&#x27;s castration, Gaia mated with her son Pontus (Sea) producing a descendent line consisting primarily of sea deities, sea nymphs, and hybrid monsters. Their first child Nereus (Old Man of the Sea) married Doris, one of the Oceanid daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and they produced the Nereids, fifty sea nymphs, which included Amphitrite, Thetis, and Psamathe. Their second child Thaumas married Electra, another Oceanid, and their offspring were Iris (Rainbow) and the two Harpies: Aello and Ocypete.

Gaia and Pontus&#x27; third and fourth children, Phorcys and Ceto, married each other and produced the two Graiae: Pemphredo and Enyo, and the three Gorgons: Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. Poseidon mated with Medusa and two offspring, the winged horse Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor, were born when the hero Perseus cut off Medusa&#x27;s head. Chrysaor married Callirhoe, another Oceanid, and they produced the three-headed Geryon. Next comes the half-nymph half-snake Echidna (her mother is unclear, probably Ceto, or possibly Callirhoe). The last offspring of Ceto and Phorcys was a serpent (unnamed in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, later called Ladon, by Apollonius of Rhodes) who guards the golden apples. 







===Descendants of Echidna and Typhon ===
Gaia also mated with Tartarus to produce Typhon, whom Echidna married, producing several monstrous descendants. Their first three offspring were Orthus, Cerberus, and the Hydra. Next comes the Chimera (whose mother is unclear, either Echidna or the Hydra). Finally Orthus (his mate is unclear, either the Chimera or Echidna) produced two offspring: the Sphinx and the Nemean Lion.






===Descendants of the Titans===
The Titans, Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, and Cronus married their sisters Tethys, Theia, Phoebe and Rhea, and Crius married his half-sister Eurybia, the daughter of Gaia and her son, Pontus. From Oceanus and Tethys came the three thousand river gods (including Nilus [Nile], Alpheus, and Scamander) and three thousand Oceanid nymphs (including Doris, Electra, Callirhoe, Styx, Clymene, Metis, Eurynome, Perseis, and Idyia). From Hyperion and Theia came Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn), and from Crius and Eurybia came Astraios, Pallas, and Perses. From Eos and Astraios came the winds: Zephyrus, Boreas and Notos, Eosphoros (Dawn-bringer, i.e. Venus, the Morning Star), and the Stars. From Pallas and the Oceanid Styx came Zelus (Envy), Nike (Victory), Kratos (Power), and Bia (Force).

From Coeus and Phoebe came Leto and Asteria, who married Perses, producing Hekate, and from Cronus and his older sister, Rhea, came Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. The Titan Iapetos married the Oceanid Clymene and produced Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus.












===Children of Zeus and his seven wives===
Zeus married seven wives. His first wife was the Oceanid Metis, whom he impregnated with Athena, then, on the advice of Gaia and Uranus, swallowed Metis so that no son of his by Metis would overthrow him, as had been foretold. Zeus&#x27; second wife was his aunt the Titan Themis, who bore the three Horae (Seasons): Eunomia (Order), Dikē (Justice), Eirene (Peace); and the three Moirai (Fates): Clotho (Spinner), Lachesis (Allotter), and Atropos (Unbending). Zeus then married his third wife, another Oceanid, Eurynome, who bore the three Charites (Graces): Aglaea (Splendor), whom Hephaestus married, Euphrosyne (Joy), and Thalia (Good Cheer).

Zeus&#x27; fourth wife was his sister, Demeter, who bore Persephone. The fifth wife of Zeus was another aunt, the Titan Mnemosyne, from whom came the nine Muses: Clio, Euterpe, Thalia, Melpomene, Terpsichore, Erato, Polymnia, Urania, and Calliope. His sixth wife was the Titan Leto, who gave birth to Apollo and Artemis. Zeus&#x27; seventh and final wife was his sister Hera, the mother by Zeus of Hebe, Ares, and Eileithyia.

Zeus finally &quot;gave birth&quot; himself to Athena, from his head, which angered Hera so much that she produced, by herself, her own son Hephaestus, god of fire and blacksmiths.











===Other descendants of divine fathers===
From Poseidon and the Nereid Amphitrite was born Triton, and from Ares and Aphrodite came Phobos (Fear), Deimos (Terror), and Harmonia (Harmony). Zeus, with Atlas&#x27;s daughter Maia, produced Hermes, and with the mortal Alcmene, produced the hero Heracles, who married Hebe. Zeus and the mortal Semele, daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes, produced Dionysus, who married Ariadne, daughter of Minos, king of Crete. Helios and the Oceanid Perseis produced Circe, Aeetes, who became king of Colchis and married the Oceanid Idyia, producing Medea.








===Children of divine mothers with mortal fathers===
The goddess Demeter joined with the mortal Iasion to produce Plutus. In addition to Semele, the goddess Harmonia and the mortal Cadmus also produced Ino, Agave, Autonoe and Polydorus. Eos (Dawn) with the mortal Tithonus, produced the hero Memnon, and Emathion, and with Cephalus, produced Phaethon. Medea with the mortal Jason, produced Medius, the Nereid Psamathe with the mortal Aeacus, produced the hero Phocus, the Nereid Thetis, with Peleus produced the great warrior Achilles, and the goddess Aphrodite with the mortal Anchises produced the Trojan hero Aeneas. With the hero Odysseus, Circe would give birth to Agrius, Latinus, and Telegonus, and Atlas&#x27; daughter Calypso would also bear Odysseus two sons, Nausithoos and Nausinous.








==Prometheus==
The &quot;Theogony&quot;, after listing the offspring of the Titan Iapetus and the Oceanid Clymene, as Atlas, Menoitios, Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and telling briefly what happened to each, tells the story of Prometheus. When the gods and men met at Mekone to decide how sacrifices should be distributed, Prometheus sought to trick Zeus. Slaughtering an ox, he took the valuable fat and meat, and covered it with the ox&#x27;s stomach. Prometheus then took the bones and hid them with a thin glistening layer of fat. Prometheus asked Zeus&#x27; opinion on which offering pile he found more desirable, hoping to trick the god into selecting the less desirable portion. Though Zeus saw through the trick, he chose the fat covered bones, and so it was established that ever after men would burn the bones as sacrifice to the gods, keeping the choice meat and fat for themselves. But in punishment for this trick, an angry Zeus decided to deny mankind the use of fire. But Prometheus stole fire inside a fennel stalk, and gave it to humanity. Zeus then ordered the creation of the first woman Pandora as a new punishment for mankind. And Prometheus was chained to a cliff, where an eagle fed on his ever-regenerating liver every day, until eventually Zeus&#x27; son Heracles came to free him.

==Manuscripts==
The earliest existing manuscripts of the Theogony date from the end of the 13th century. An early example is found in &quot;Vaticanus gr. 1825&quot;. This manuscript dates to about 1310 based on watermarks. There are about 64 known manuscripts that date from 1600 AD or earlier.

==Influence on earliest Greek philosophy==

The heritage of Greek mythology already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole, and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of being was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought. Hesiod, impressed by necessity governing the ordering of things, discloses a definite pattern in the genesis and appearance of the gods. These ideas made something like &quot;cosmological&quot; speculation possible. The earliest rhetoric of reflection all centers about two interrelated things: the experience of wonder as a living involvement with the divine order of things; and the absolute conviction that, beyond the totality of things, reality forms a beautiful and harmonious whole.

In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, the origin (&quot;arche&quot;) is &quot;Chaos&quot;, a divine primordial condition, and there are the roots and the ends of the earth, sky, sea, and Tartarus. Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BC), believed that there were three pre-existent divine principles and called the water also Chaos. In the language of the archaic period (8th – 6th century BC), &quot;arche&quot; (or &quot;archai&quot;) designates the source, origin, or root of things that exist. If a thing is to be well established or founded, its &quot;arche&quot; or static point must be secure, and the most secure foundations are those provided by the gods: the indestructible, immutable, and eternal ordering of things.

In ancient Greek philosophy, &quot;arche&quot; is the element or first principle of all things, a permanent nature or substance which is conserved in the generation of the rest of it. From this, all things come to be, and into it they are resolved in a final state. It is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and rules all things. Thales (7th – 6th century BC), the first Greek philosopher, claimed that the first principle of all things is water. Anaximander (6th century BC) was the first philosopher who used the term &quot;arche&quot; for that which writers from Aristotle on call the &quot;substratum&quot;. Anaximander claimed that the beginning or first principle is an endless mass (&quot;Apeiron&quot;) subject to neither age nor decay, from which all things are being born and then they are destroyed there. A fragment from Xenophanes (6th century BC) shows the transition from &quot;Chaos&quot; to &quot;Apeiron&quot;: &quot;The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit of earth reaches down to the unlimited (i.e the Apeiron).&quot;

==Christian views of the Theogony==
John Milton, a Calvinist, viewed the Theogony as inspired by Satan. Milton&#x27;s view, as articulated in Paradise Lost, was that once Satan was cast out from heaven, he became the muse that inspired Hesiod. What Hesiod wrote, therefore, was a corruption of the &quot;actual&quot; events that happened in the cosmological struggle of Satan against God. In particular, Milton asserted that the triumph of Zeus (i.e., the supreme deity) through guile, negotiation and alliances, was a corruption of God&#x27;s omnipotence which did not require any ally.

Milton&#x27;s view echoes the views of early Christian patristic writers. Justin Martyr and Athenagoras of Athens, for example, asserted that heathen mythologies in general are demonic distortions of the &quot;true&quot; cosmological history.

==Other cosmogonies in ancient literature==

In the &quot;Theogony&quot; the initial state of the universe, or the origin (arche) is Chaos, a &quot;gaping void&quot; (abyss) considered as a divine primordial condition, from which appeared everything that exists. Then came Gaia (Earth), Tartarus (the cave-like space under the earth; the later-born Erebus is the darkness in this space), and Eros (representing sexual desire—the urge to reproduce—instead of the emotion of love as is the common misconception). Hesiod made an abstraction because his original &quot;chaos&quot; is something completely indefinite.

By contrast, in the Orphic cosmogony the unaging Chronos produced Aether and Chaos and made a silvery egg in divine Aether. From it appeared the androgynous god Phanes, identified by the Orphics as Eros, who becomes the creator of the world.

Some similar ideas appear in the Vedic and Hindu cosmologies. In the Vedic cosmology the universe is created from nothing by the great heat. Kāma (Desire) the primal seed of spirit, is the link which connected the existent with the non-existent In the Hindu cosmology, in the beginning there was nothing in the universe but only darkness and the divine essence who removed the darkness and created the primordial waters. His seed produced the &quot;universal germ&quot; (Hiranyagarbha), from which everything else appeared.

In the Babylonian creation story &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot; the universe was in a formless state and is described as a watery &quot;chaos&quot;. From it emerged two primary gods, the male Apsu and female Tiamat, and a third deity who is the &quot;maker&quot; Mummu and his power for the progression of cosmogonic births to begin.

Norse mythology also describes Ginnungagap as the primordial abyss from which sprang the first living creatures, including the giant Ymir whose body eventually became the world, whose blood became the seas, and so on; another version describes the origin of the world as a result of the fiery and cold parts of Hel colliding.
