<text>Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the &quot;white death&quot;, or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. Around 10% of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, kill about half of those affected. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.

Tuberculosis is spread from one person to the next through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of bodily fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.

Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

In 2018, one quarter of the world&#x27;s population was thought to have a latent infection of TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people developed active TB, resulting in 1.3 million deaths, making it the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease after COVID-19. As of 2018, most TB cases occurred in the WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%), and the Western Pacific (18%), with more than 50% of cases being diagnosed in seven countries: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), and Bangladesh (4%). By 2021, the number of new cases each year was decreasing by around 2% annually. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive, while 5–10% of people in the United States test positive via the tuberculin test. Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.

== History ==

Tuberculosis has existed since antiquity. The oldest unambiguously detected &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; gives evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then transferred to humans, or whether both bovine and human tuberculosis diverged from a common ancestor, remains unclear. A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as researchers previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show some prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000 to 2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest the presence of TB in the Americas from about AD 100.

Before the Industrial Revolution, folklore often associated tuberculosis with vampires. When one member of a family died from the disease, the other infected members would lose their health slowly. People believed this was caused by the original person with TB draining the life from the other family members.

=== Identification ===
Although Richard Morton established the pulmonary form associated with tubercles as a pathology in 1689, due to the variety of its symptoms, TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s. Benjamin Marten conjectured in 1720 that consumptions were caused by microbes which were spread by people living close to each other. In 1819, René Laennec claimed that tubercles were the cause of pulmonary tuberculosis. J. L. Schönlein first published the name &quot;tuberculosis&quot; (German: &quot;Tuberkulose&quot;) in 1832.

Between 1838 and 1845, John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky from 1839 onwards, brought a number of people with tuberculosis into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air; each died within a year. Hermann Brehmer opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in Görbersdorf (now Sokołowsko) in Silesia. In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin demonstrated that tuberculosis could be transmitted, via inoculation, from humans to animals and among animals. (Villemin&#x27;s findings were confirmed in 1867 and 1868 by John Burdon-Sanderson.)
Robert Koch identified and described the bacillus causing tuberculosis, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, on 24 March 1882. In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery.

=== Development of treatments ===
In Europe, rates of tuberculosis began to rise in the early 1600s to a peak level in the 1800s, when it caused nearly 25% of all deaths. In the 18th and 19th century, tuberculosis had become epidemic in Europe, showing a seasonal pattern. Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to &quot;consumption&quot;. By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France.

After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain. Campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were &quot;encouraged&quot; to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons. The sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention. What later became known as the Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (tuberculous arthritis) was opened in London in 1867. Whatever the benefits of the &quot;fresh air&quot; and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years ( 1916).

Robert Koch did not believe the cattle and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. During the first half of the 1900s, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced after the application of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a &quot;remedy&quot; for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it &quot;tuberculin&quot;. Although it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis. World Tuberculosis Day is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch&#x27;s original scientific announcement. When the Medical Research Council formed in Britain in 1913, it initially focused on tuberculosis research.

Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France, but achieved widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.
By the 1950s mortality in Europe had decreased about 90%. Improvements in sanitation, vaccination, and other public-health measures began significantly reducing rates of tuberculosis even before the arrival of streptomycin and other antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat. In 1946, the development of the antibiotic streptomycin made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality. Prior to the introduction of this medication, the only treatment was surgical intervention, including the &quot;pneumothorax technique&quot;, which involved collapsing an infected lung to &quot;rest&quot; it and to allow tuberculous lesions to heal.

=== Current reemergence ===
Because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves the removal of infected chest cavities (&quot;bullae&quot;) in the lungs to reduce the number of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of eliminating TB ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993.

== Signs and symptoms ==

There is a popular misconception that tuberculosis is purely a disease of the lungs that manifests as coughing. Tuberculosis may infect many organs, even though it most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.

General signs and symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Significant nail clubbing may also occur.

=== Pulmonary ===

If a tuberculosis infection does become active, it most commonly involves the lungs (in about 90% of cases). Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum. About 25% of people may not have any symptoms (i.e., they remain asymptomatic). Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding. Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones. The reason for this difference is not clear. It may be due to either better air flow, or poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs.

=== Extrapulmonary ===

In 15–20% of active cases, the infection spreads outside the lungs, causing other kinds of TB. These are collectively denoted as extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in people with a weakened immune system and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases. Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called &quot;disseminated tuberculosis&quot;; it is also known as miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB currently makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases.

== Causes ==

=== Mycobacteria ===
The main cause of TB is &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (MTB), a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus. The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics. It divides every 16 to 20 hours, which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide in less than an hour. Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer. If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly &quot;Gram-positive&quot; or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall. MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks. In nature, the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism, but &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; can be cultured in the laboratory.

Using histological stains on expectorated samples from phlegm (also called sputum), scientists can identify MTB under a microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it is classified as an acid-fast bacillus. The most common acid-fast staining techniques are the Ziehl–Neelsen stain and the Kinyoun stain, which dye acid-fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background. Auramine-rhodamine staining and fluorescence microscopy are also used.

The &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex (MTBC) includes four other TB-causing mycobacteria: &quot;M. bovis&quot;, &quot;M. africanum&quot;, &quot;M. canettii&quot;, and &quot;M. microti&quot;. &quot;M. africanum&quot; is not widespread, but it is a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. &quot;M. bovis&quot; was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. &quot;M. canettii&quot; is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. &quot;M. microti&quot; is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.

Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include &quot;M. leprae&quot;, &quot;M. avium&quot;, and &quot;M. kansasii&quot;. The latter two species are classified as &quot;nontuberculous mycobacteria&quot; (NTM) or atypical mycobacteria. NTM cause neither TB nor leprosy, but they do cause lung diseases that resemble TB.

=== Transmission ===

When people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 μm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).

==== Risk of transmission ====

People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others.

The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (&quot;overt&quot;) TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.

=== Risk factors ===

A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection or disease.

==== Active disease risk ====

The most important risk factor globally for developing active TB is concurrent HIV infection; 13% of those with TB are also infected with HIV. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates are high. Of those without HIV infection who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those co-infected with HIV develop the active disease.

Use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids and infliximab (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), is another important risk factor, especially in the developed world.

Other risk factors include: alcoholism, diabetes mellitus (3-fold increased risk), silicosis (30-fold increased risk), tobacco smoking (2-fold increased risk), indoor air pollution, malnutrition, young age, recently acquired TB infection, recreational drug use, severe kidney disease, low body weight, organ transplant, head and neck cancer, and genetic susceptibility (the overall importance of genetic risk factors remains undefined).

==== Infection susceptibility ====

Tobacco smoking increases the risk of infections (in addition to increasing the risk of active disease and death). Additional factors increasing infection susceptibility include young age.

== Pathogenesis ==

About 90% of those infected with &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), with only a 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, the risk of developing active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.

TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the alveolar air sacs of the lungs, where they invade and replicate within endosomes of alveolar macrophages. Macrophages identify the bacterium as foreign and attempt to eliminate it by phagocytosis. During this process, the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium. However, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has a thick, waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell.

The primary site of infection in the lungs, known as the Ghon focus, is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe, or the lower part of the upper lobe. Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream. This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung. This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites, such as peripheral lymph nodes, the kidneys, the brain, and the bones. All parts of the body can be affected by the disease, though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas, or thyroid.

Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, epithelioid cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system.

However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host&#x27;s immune system. Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.

If TB bacteria gain entry to the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny, white tubercles in the tissues. This severe form of TB disease, most common in young children and those with HIV, is called miliary tuberculosis. People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment (about 30%).

In many people, the infection waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages (bronchi) and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria and thus can spread the infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Active tuberculosis ===
Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world. IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.

A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.

Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.

=== Latent tuberculosis ===
The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by &quot;M. szulgai&quot;, &quot;M. marinum&quot;, and &quot;M. kansasii&quot;. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening people who are at high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays. While some have recommend testing health care workers, evidence of benefit for this is poor . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped recommending yearly testing of health care workers without known exposure in 2019.

== Prevention ==
Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.

=== Vaccines ===

The only available vaccine is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.

It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all children being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, Western Europe, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test&#x27;s usefulness as a screening tool. Several vaccines are being developed.

Intradermal MVA85A vaccine in addition to BCG injection is not effective in preventing tuberculosis.

=== Public health ===
Public health campaigns which have focused on overcrowding, public spitting and regular sanitation (including hand washing) during the 1800s helped to either interrupt or slow spread which when combined with contact tracing, isolation and treatment helped to dramatically curb the transmission of both tuberculosis and other airborne diseases which led to the elimination of tuberculosis as a major public health issue in most developed economies. Other risk factors which worsened TB spread such as malnutrition were also ameliorated, but since the emergence of HIV a new population of immunocompromised individuals was available for TB to infect.

==== Source control in the US ====


During the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, up to 35% of those affected by TB were also infected by HIV. Handling of TB-infected patients in US hospitals was known to create airborne TB that could infect others, especially in unventilated spaces.

Multiple US agencies rolled out new public health rules as a result of the TB spread: the CDC brought in new guidelines mandating HEPA filters and HEPA respirators, NIOSH pushed through new 42 CFR 84 respirator regulations in 1995 (like the N95), and OSHA created a proposed rule for TB in 1997, a result of pressure from groups like the &quot;Labor Coalition to Fight TB in the Workplace&quot;.

However, in 2003, OSHA dropped their proposed TB rules, citing a decline of TB in the US, and public disapproval.

==== Worldwide campaigns ====

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a &quot;global health emergency&quot; in 1993, and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015. A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis. A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs. In 2015, it launched the End TB Strategy to reduce deaths by 95% and incidence by 90% before 2035. The goal of tuberculosis elimination is being hampered by the lack of rapid testing, short and effective treatment courses, and completely effective vaccines.

The benefits and risks of giving anti-tubercular drugs to those exposed to MDR-TB is unclear. Making HAART therapy available to HIV-positive individuals significantly reduces the risk of progression to an active TB infection by up to 90% and can mitigate the spread through this population.

== Management ==
Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.

Active TB is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. The routine use of rifabutin instead of rifampicin in HIV-positive people with tuberculosis is of unclear benefit .

Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) at a dose of 100 mg per day has been shown to improve clinical signs and symptoms, reduce cavitary lesions, lower inflammatory markers, and increase the rate of sputum-negative conversion in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

=== Latent TB ===

Latent TB is treated with either isoniazid or rifampin alone, or a combination of isoniazid with either rifampicin or rifapentine.

The treatment takes three to nine months depending on the medications used. People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life.

Education or counselling may improve the latent tuberculosis treatment completion rates.

=== New onset ===

The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, , is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months. Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative. Treatment with anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months results in higher success rates when compared with treatment less than 6 months, even though the difference is small. Shorter treatment regimen may be recommended for those with compliance issues. There is also no evidence to support shorter anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens when compared to a 6-month treatment regimen. However, results presented in 2020 from an international, randomized, controlled clinical trial indicate that a four-month daily treatment regimen containing high-dose, or &quot;optimized&quot;, rifapentine with moxifloxacin (2PHZM/2PHM) is as safe and effective as the existing standard six-month daily regimen at curing drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) disease.

=== Recurrent disease ===

If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment. If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended.

=== Medication administration ===

Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker.

Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement. There is also not enough evidence to support intermittent rifampicin-containing therapy given two to three times a week has equal effectiveness as daily dose regimen on improving cure rates and reducing relapsing rates. There is also not enough evidence on effectiveness of giving intermittent twice or thrice weekly short course regimen compared to daily dosing regimen in treating children with tuberculosis.

=== Medication resistance ===

Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. There is some efficacy for linezolid to treat those with XDR-TB but side effects and discontinuation of medications were common. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.

XDR-TB is a term sometimes used to define &quot;extensively resistant&quot; TB, and constitutes one in ten cases of MDR-TB. Cases of XDR TB have been identified in more than 90% of countries.

For those with known rifampicin or MDR-TB, molecular tests such as the Genotype MTBDRsl Assay (performed on culture isolates or smear positive specimens) may be useful to detect second-line anti-tubercular drug resistance.

== Prognosis ==
Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, in the majority of cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.

The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression, such as that caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year. Studies using DNA fingerprinting of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought, with estimates that it might account for more than 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common. The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% , down from 8% in 1995.

In people with smear-positive pulmonary TB (without HIV co-infection), after 5 years without treatment, 50–60% die while 20–25% achieve spontaneous resolution (cure). TB is almost always fatal in those with untreated HIV co-infection and death rates are increased even with antiretroviral treatment of HIV.

== Epidemiology ==

Roughly one-quarter of the world&#x27;s population has been infected with &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; do not cause disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred (most of these occurring in developing countries). Of these, about 0.35 million occur in those also infected with HIV. In 2018, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious agent. The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002.

Tuberculosis incidence is seasonal, with peaks occurring every spring and summer. The reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to vitamin D deficiency during the winter. There are also studies linking tuberculosis to different weather conditions like low temperature, low humidity and low rainfall. It has been suggested that tuberculosis incidence rates may be connected to climate change.

=== At-risk groups ===

Tuberculosis is closely linked to both overcrowding and malnutrition, making it one of the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g., prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.

The rate of tuberculosis varies with age. In Africa, it primarily affects adolescents and young adults. However, in countries where incidence rates have declined dramatically (such as the United States), tuberculosis is mainly a disease of the elderly and immunocompromised (risk factors are listed above). Worldwide, 22 &quot;high-burden&quot; states or countries together experience 80% of cases as well as 83% of deaths.

In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times more common among the Indigenous peoples, especially in remote areas. Factors contributing to this include higher prevalence of predisposing health conditions and behaviours, and overcrowding and poverty. In some Canadian Indigenous groups, genetic susceptibility may play a role.

Socioeconomic status (SES) strongly affects TB risk. People of low SES are both more likely to contract TB and to be more severely affected by the disease. Those with low SES are more likely to be affected by risk factors for developing TB (e.g., malnutrition, indoor air pollution, HIV co-infection, etc.), and are additionally more likely to be exposed to crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. Inadequate healthcare also means that people with active disease who facilitate spread are not diagnosed and treated promptly; sick people thus remain in the infectious state and (continue to) spread the infection.

=== Geographical epidemiology ===

The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe; about 80% of the population in many African, Caribbean, South Asian, and eastern European countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the U.S. population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of many factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.

In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. In Europe, deaths from TB fell from 500 out of 100,000 in 1850 to 50 out of 100,000 by 1950. Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat to public health, such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research.

In 2010, rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139.

In 2023, tuberculosis overtook COVID-19 as the leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths globally, according to a World Health Organization. Around 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB last year, allowing them access to treatment—a record high since WHO’s tracking began in 1995 and an increase from 7.5 million cases in 2022. The report highlights ongoing obstacles in combating TB, including severe funding shortages that hinder efforts toward eradication. Although TB-related deaths decreased slightly to 1.25 million in 2023 from 1.32 million in 2022, the overall number of new cases rose marginally to an estimated 10.8 million.

==== Russia ====

Russia has achieved particularly dramatic progress with a decline in its TB mortality rate—from 61.9 per 100,000 in 1965 to 2.7 per 100,000 in 1993; however, mortality rate increased to 24 per 100,000 in 2005 and then recoiled to 11 per 100,000 by 2015.

==== China ====

China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014.

==== Africa ====

In 2007, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of TB was Eswatini, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. In 2017, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate as a % of the population was Lesotho, with 665 cases per 100,000 people.

In South Africa, 54,200 people died in 2022 from TB. The incidence rate was 468 per 100,000 people; in 2015, this was 988 per 100,000. The total incidence was 280,000 in 2022; in 2015, this was 552,000.

==== India ====

As of 2017, India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2,740,000 cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2000–2015, India&#x27;s estimated mortality rate dropped from 55 to 36 per 100,000 population per year with estimated 480 thousand people died of TB in 2015. In India a major proportion of tuberculosis patients are being treated by private partners and private hospitals. Evidence indicates that the tuberculosis national survey does not represent the number of cases that are diagnosed and recorded by private clinics and hospitals in India.

==== North America ====

In Canada, tuberculosis was endemic in some rural areas as of 1998. The tuberculosis case rate in Canada in 2021 was 4.8 per 100,000 persons. The rates were highest among Inuit (135.1 per 100,000), First Nations (16.1 per 100,000) and people born outside of Canada (12.3 per 100,000).

In the United States, Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB, and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 88% of all reported TB cases. The overall tuberculosis case rate in the United States was 2.9 per 100,000 persons in
2023, representing a 16% increase in cases compared to 2022.

In 2024, Long Beach, California authorized a public health emergency in response to a local outbreak of TB.

==== Western Europe ====

In 2017, in the United Kingdom, the national average was 9 per 100,000 and the highest incidence rates in Western Europe were 20 per 100,000 in Portugal.

== Society and culture ==

=== Names ===

Tuberculosis has been known by many names from the technical to the familiar. () is the Greek word for consumption, an old term for pulmonary tuberculosis; around 460 BCE, Hippocrates described phthisis as a disease of dry seasons. The abbreviation &quot;TB&quot; is short for &quot;tubercle bacillus&quot;. &quot;Consumption&quot; was the most common nineteenth century English word for the disease, and was also in use well into the twentieth century. The Latin root meaning &#x27;completely&#x27; is linked to meaning &#x27;to take up from under&#x27;. In &quot;The Life and Death of Mr Badman&quot; by John Bunyan, the author calls consumption &quot;the captain of all these men of death.&quot; &quot;Great white plague&quot; has also been used.

=== Art and literature ===


Tuberculosis was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, and was also known as &quot;the romantic disease&quot;. Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frédéric Chopin, the playwright Anton Chekhov, the novelists Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, Charlotte Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham, George Orwell, and Robert Louis Stevenson, and the artists Alice Neel, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Elizabeth Siddal, Marie Bashkirtseff, Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley and Amedeo Modigliani either had the disease or were surrounded by people who did. A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and toxaemia that it caused, allegedly helping them to see life more clearly and to act decisively.

Tuberculosis formed an often-reused theme in literature, as in Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;, set in a sanatorium; in music, as in Van Morrison&#x27;s song &quot;T.B. Sheets&quot;; in opera, as in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot;; in art, as in Munch&#x27;s painting of his ill sister; and in film, such as the 1945 &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; starring Ingrid Bergman as a nun with tuberculosis.

=== Public health efforts ===
In 2014, the WHO adopted the &quot;End TB&quot; strategy which aims to reduce TB incidence by 80% and TB deaths by 90% by 2030. The strategy contains a milestone to reduce TB incidence by 20% and TB deaths by 35% by 2020. However, by 2020 only a 9% reduction in incidence per population was achieved globally, with the European region achieving 19% and the African region achieving 16% reductions. Similarly, the number of deaths only fell by 14%, missing the 2020 milestone of a 35% reduction, with some regions making better progress (31% reduction in Europe and 19% in Africa). Correspondingly, also treatment, prevention and funding milestones were missed in 2020, for example only 6.3 million people were started on TB prevention short of the target of 30 million.

The World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. government are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test for use in low- and middle-income countries as of 2012. In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places have access to only sputum microscopy.

India had the highest total number of TB cases worldwide in 2010, in part due to poor disease management within the private and public health care sector. Programs such as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program are working to reduce TB levels among people receiving public health care.

A 2014 EIU-healthcare report finds there is a need to address apathy and urges for increased funding. The report cites among others Lucica Ditui &quot;[TB] is like an orphan. It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions.&quot;

Slow progress has led to frustration, expressed by the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: &quot;we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it.&quot; Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government as of 2014, although adherence is often variable. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations.

The government of Brazil provides universal TB care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to an increased level of education, income, and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed US$150 billion per year in &quot;high burden&quot; countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250 million rural migrants in China.

There is insufficient data to show that active contact tracing helps to improve case detection rates for tuberculosis. Interventions such as house-to-house visits, educational leaflets, mass media strategies, educational sessions may increase tuberculosis detection rates in short-term. There is no study that compares new methods of contact tracing such as social network analysis with existing contact tracing methods.

=== Stigma ===

Slow progress in preventing the disease may in part be due to stigma associated with TB. Stigma may be due to the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana, individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.

Stigma towards TB may result in delays in seeking treatment, lower treatment compliance, and family members keeping cause of death secret – allowing the disease to spread further. In contrast, in Russia stigma was associated with increased treatment compliance. TB stigma also affects socially marginalized individuals to a greater degree and varies between regions.

One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of &quot;TB clubs&quot;, where those infected may share experiences and offer support, or through counseling. Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma, and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence. Despite this, studies on the relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking , and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective. Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease, and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma, as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable. A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction.

== Research ==

The BCG vaccine has limitations and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches are used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, is in trials in South Africa as of 2006, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease.

To encourage further discovery, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development as of 2006, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments. A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership, the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, are involved with research. Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (US) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.

In 2012 a new medication regimen was approved in the US for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, using bedaquiline as well as existing drugs. There were initial concerns about the safety of this drug, but later research on larger groups found that this regimen improved health outcomes. By 2017 the drug was used in at least 89 countries. Another new drug is delamanid, which was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2013 to be used in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients, and by 2017 was used in at least 54 countries.

Steroids add-on therapy has not shown any benefits for active pulmonary tuberculosis infection.

== Other animals ==

Mycobacteria infect many different animals, including birds, fish, rodents, and reptiles. The subspecies &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, though, is rarely present in wild animals. An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand has been relatively successful. Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.

, tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US. It is believed that the animals originally acquired the disease from humans, a process called reverse zoonosis. Because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos.

<text>A triangle is a polygon with three corners and three sides, one of the basic shapes in geometry. The corners, also called &quot;vertices&quot;, are zero-dimensional points while the sides connecting them, also called &quot;edges&quot;, are one-dimensional line segments. A triangle has three internal angles, each one bounded by a pair of adjacent edges; the sum of angles of a triangle always equals a straight angle (180 degrees or π radians). The triangle is a plane figure and its interior is a planar region. Sometimes an arbitrary edge is chosen to be the &quot;base&quot;, in which case the opposite vertex is called the &quot;apex&quot;; the shortest segment between the base and apex is the &quot;height&quot;. The area of a triangle equals one-half the product of height and base length.

In Euclidean geometry, any two points determine a unique line segment situated within a unique straight line, and any three points that do not all lie on the same straight line determine a unique triangle situated within a unique flat plane. More generally, four points in three-dimensional Euclidean space determine a solid figure called &quot;tetrahedron&quot;. 

In non-Euclidean geometries, three &quot;straight&quot; segments (having zero curvature) also determine a &quot;triangle&quot;, for instance, a spherical triangle or hyperbolic triangle. A geodesic triangle is a region of a general two-dimensional surface enclosed by three sides that are straight relative to the surface (geodesics). A &quot; triangle&quot; is a shape with three curved sides, for instance, a &quot;circular triangle&quot; with circular-arc sides. (This article is about straight-sided triangles in Euclidean geometry, except where otherwise noted.)

Triangles are classified into different types based on their angles and the lengths of their sides. Relations between angles and side lengths are a major focus of trigonometry. In particular, the sine, cosine, and tangent functions relate side lengths and angles in right triangles.

== Definition, terminology, and types ==
A triangle is a figure consisting of three line segments, each of whose endpoints are connected. This forms a polygon with three sides and three angles. The terminology for categorizing triangles is more than two thousand years old, having been defined in Book One of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. The names used for modern classification are either a direct transliteration of Euclid&#x27;s Greek or their Latin translations.

Triangles have many types based on the length of the sides and the angles. A triangle whose sides are all the same length is an equilateral triangle, a triangle with two sides having the same length is an isosceles triangle, and a triangle with three different-length sides is a &quot;scalene triangle&quot;. A triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle is a right triangle, a triangle in which all of its angles are less than that angle is an acute triangle, and a triangle in which one of it angles is greater than that angle is an obtuse triangle. These definitions date back at least to Euclid.

== Appearances ==

All types of triangles are commonly found in real life. In man-made construction, the isosceles triangles may be found in the shape of gables and pediments, and the equilateral triangle can be found in the yield sign. The faces of the Great Pyramid of Giza are sometimes considered to be equilateral, but more accurate measurements show they are isosceles instead. Other appearances are in heraldic symbols as in the flag of Saint Lucia and flag of the Philippines.

Triangles also appear in three-dimensional objects. A polyhedron is a solid whose boundary is covered by flat polygonals known as the faces, sharp corners known as the vertices, and line segments known as the edges. Polyhedra in some cases can be classified, judging from the shape of their faces. For example, when polyhedra have all equilateral triangles as their faces, they are known as deltahedra. Antiprisms have alternating triangles on their sides. Pyramids and bipyramids are polyhedra with polygonal bases and triangles for lateral faces; the triangles are isosceles whenever they are right pyramids and bipyramids. The Kleetope of a polyhedron is a new polyhedron made by replacing each face of the original with a pyramid, and so the faces of a Kleetope will be triangles. More generally, triangles can be found in higher dimensions, as in the generalized notion of triangles known as the simplex, and the polytopes with triangular facets known as the simplicial polytopes.

== Properties ==
=== Points, lines, and circles associated with a triangle ===

Each triangle has many special points inside it, on its edges, or otherwise associated with it. They are constructed by finding three lines associated symmetrically with the three sides (or vertices) and then proving that the three lines meet in a single point. An important tool for proving the existence of these points is Ceva&#x27;s theorem, which gives a criterion for determining when three such lines are concurrent. Similarly, lines associated with a triangle are often constructed by proving that three symmetrically constructed points are collinear; here Menelaus&#x27; theorem gives a useful general criterion. In this section, just a few of the most commonly encountered constructions are explained.
A perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is a straight line passing through the midpoint of the side and being perpendicular to it, forming a right angle with it. The three perpendicular bisectors meet in a single point, the triangle&#x27;s circumcenter; this point is the center of the circumcircle, the circle passing through all three vertices. Thales&#x27; theorem implies that if the circumcenter is located on the side of the triangle, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. If the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is obtuse.

An altitude of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and perpendicular to the opposite side. This opposite side is called the base of the altitude, and the point where the altitude intersects the base (or its extension) is called the foot of the altitude. The length of the altitude is the distance between the base and the vertex. The three altitudes intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle. The orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute.
An angle bisector of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex that cuts the corresponding angle in half. The three angle bisectors intersect in a single point, the incenter, which is the center of the triangle&#x27;s incircle. The incircle is the circle that lies inside the triangle and touches all three sides. Its radius is called the inradius. There are three other important circles, the excircles; they lie outside the triangle and touch one side, as well as the extensions of the other two. The centers of the incircles and excircles form an orthocentric system. The midpoints of the three sides and the feet of the three altitudes all lie on a single circle, the triangle&#x27;s nine-point circle. The remaining three points for which it is named are the midpoints of the portion of altitude between the vertices and the orthocenter. The radius of the nine-point circle is half that of the circumcircle. It touches the incircle (at the Feuerbach point) and the three excircles. The orthocenter (blue point), the center of the nine-point circle (red), the centroid (orange), and the circumcenter (green) all lie on a single line, known as Euler&#x27;s line (red line). The center of the nine-point circle lies at the midpoint between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter is half that between the centroid and the orthocenter. Generally, the incircle&#x27;s center is not located on Euler&#x27;s line.

A median of a triangle is a straight line through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. The three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle&#x27;s centroid or geometric barycenter. The centroid of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its centroid in a uniform gravitational field. The centroid cuts every median in the ratio 2:1, i.e. the distance between a vertex and the centroid is twice the distance between the centroid and the midpoint of the opposite side. If one reflects a median in the angle bisector that passes through the same vertex, one obtains a &quot;symmedian&quot;. The three symmedians intersect in a single point, the symmedian point of the triangle.

=== Angles ===

The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate. This allows the determination of the measure of the third angle of any triangle, given the measure of two angles. An &quot;exterior angle&quot; of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees, and indeed, this is true for any convex polygon, no matter how many sides it has.

Another relation between the internal angles and triangles creates a new concept of trigonometric functions. The primary trigonometric functions are sine and cosine, as well as the other functions. They can be defined as the ratio between any two sides of a right triangle. In a scalene triangle, the trigonometric functions can be used to find the unknown measure of either a side or an internal angle; methods for doing so use the law of sines and the law of cosines.

Any three angles that add to 180° can be the internal angles of a triangle. Infinitely many triangles have the same angles, since specifying the angles of a triangle does not determine its size. (A degenerate triangle, whose vertices are collinear, has internal angles of 0° and 180°; whether such a shape counts as a triangle is a matter of convention.) The conditions for three angles formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3, each of them between 0° and 180°, to be the angles of a triangle can also be stated using trigonometric functions. For example, a triangle with angles formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 exists if and only if
formula_7

=== Similarity and congruence ===

Two triangles are said to be &quot;similar&quot;, if every angle of one triangle has the same measure as the corresponding angle in the other triangle. The corresponding sides of similar triangles have lengths that are in the same proportion, and this property is also sufficient to establish similarity.

Some basic theorems about similar triangles are:
* If and only if one pair of internal angles of two triangles have the same measure as each other, and another pair also have the same measure as each other, the triangles are similar.
* If and only if one pair of corresponding sides of two triangles are in the same proportion as another pair of corresponding sides, and their included angles have the same measure, then the triangles are similar. (The &quot;included angle&quot; for any two sides of a polygon is the internal angle between those two sides.)
* If and only if three pairs of corresponding sides of two triangles are all in the same proportion, then the triangles are similar.

Two triangles that are congruent have exactly the same size and shape. All pairs of congruent triangles are also similar, but not all pairs of similar triangles are congruent. Given two congruent triangles, all pairs of corresponding interior angles are equal in measure, and all pairs of corresponding sides have the same length. This is a total of six equalities, but three are often sufficient to prove congruence.

Some individually necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of triangles to be congruent are:
* SAS Postulate: Two sides in a triangle have the same length as two sides in the other triangle, and the included angles have the same measure.
* ASA: Two interior angles and the side between them in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (This is the basis of surveying by triangulation.)
* SSS: Each side of a triangle has the same length as the corresponding side of the other triangle.
* AAS: Two angles and a corresponding (non-included) side in a triangle have the same measure and length, respectively, as those in the other triangle. (This is sometimes referred to as &quot;AAcorrS&quot; and then includes ASA above.)

=== Area ===
In the Euclidean plane, area is defined by comparison with a square of side length , which has area 1. There are several ways to calculate the area of an arbitrary triangle. One of the oldest and simplest is to take half the product of the length of one side (the base) times the corresponding altitude :
formula_8

This formula can be proven by cutting up the triangle and an identical copy into pieces and rearranging the pieces into the shape of a rectangle of base and height .
If two sides and and their included angle formula_3 are known, then the altitude can be calculated using trigonometry, , so the area of the triangle is:
formula_10

Heron&#x27;s formula, named after Heron of Alexandria, is a formula for finding the area of a triangle from the lengths of its sides formula_11, formula_12, formula_13. Letting formula_14 be the semiperimeter,
formula_15
Because the ratios between areas of shapes in the same plane are preserved by affine transformations, the relative areas of triangles in any affine plane can be defined without reference to a notion of distance or squares. In any affine space (including Euclidean planes), every triangle with the same base and oriented area has its apex (the third vertex) on a line parallel to the base, and their common area is half of that of a parallelogram with the same base whose opposite side lies on the parallel line. This affine approach was developed in Book 1 of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.

Given affine coordinates (such as Cartesian coordinates) , , for the vertices of a triangle, its relative oriented area can be calculated using the shoelace formula,

formula_16

where formula_17 is the matrix determinant.

=== Possible side lengths ===

The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side. Conversely, some triangle with three given positive side lengths exists if and only if those side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. The sum of two side lengths can equal the length of the third side only in the case of a degenerate triangle, one with collinear vertices.

=== Rigidity ===
Unlike a rectangle, which may collapse into a parallelogram from pressure to one of its points, triangles are sturdy because specifying the lengths of all three sides determines the angles. Therefore, a triangle will not change shape unless its sides are bent or extended or broken or if its joints break; in essence, each of the three sides supports the other two. A rectangle, in contrast, is more dependent on the strength of its joints in a structural sense.

Triangles are strong in terms of rigidity, but while packed in a tessellating arrangement triangles are not as strong as hexagons under compression (hence the prevalence of hexagonal forms in nature). Tessellated triangles still maintain superior strength for cantilevering, however, which is why engineering makes use of tetrahedral trusses.

=== Triangulation ===

Triangulation means the partition of any planar object into a collection of triangles. For example, in polygon triangulation, a polygon is subdivided into multiple triangles that are attached edge-to-edge, with the property that their vertices coincide with the set of vertices of the polygon. In the case of a simple polygon with sides, there are formula_18 triangles that are separated by formula_19 diagonals. Triangulation of a simple polygon has a relationship to the ear, a vertex connected by two other vertices, the diagonal between which lies entirely within the polygon. The two ears theorem states that every simple polygon that is not itself a triangle has at least two ears.

== Location of a point ==
One way to identify locations of points in (or outside) a triangle is to place the triangle in an arbitrary location and orientation in the Cartesian plane, and to use Cartesian coordinates. While convenient for many purposes, this approach has the disadvantage of all points&#x27; coordinate values being dependent on the arbitrary placement in the plane.

Two systems avoid that feature, so that the coordinates of a point are not affected by moving the triangle, rotating it, or reflecting it as in a mirror, any of which gives a congruent triangle, or even by rescaling it to a similar triangle:
* Trilinear coordinates specify the relative distances of a point from the sides, so that coordinates formula_20 indicate that the ratio of the distance of the point from the first side to its distance from the second side is formula_21, etc.
* Barycentric coordinates of the form formula_22 specify the point&#x27;s location by the relative weights that would have to be put on the three vertices in order to balance the otherwise weightless triangle on the given point.

== Related figures ==
=== Figures inscribed in a triangle ===
As discussed above, every triangle has a unique inscribed circle (incircle) that is interior to the triangle and tangent to all three sides. Every triangle has a unique Steiner inellipse which is interior to the triangle and tangent at the midpoints of the sides. Marden&#x27;s theorem shows how to find the foci of this ellipse. This ellipse has the greatest area of any ellipse tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The Mandart inellipse of a triangle is the ellipse inscribed within the triangle tangent to its sides at the contact points of its excircles. For any ellipse inscribed in a triangle formula_23, let the foci be formula_24 and formula_25, then:
formula_26
From an interior point in a reference triangle, the nearest points on the three sides serve as the vertices of the pedal triangle of that point. If the interior point is the circumcenter of the reference triangle, the vertices of the pedal triangle are the midpoints of the reference triangle&#x27;s sides, and so the pedal triangle is called the midpoint triangle or medial triangle. The midpoint triangle subdivides the reference triangle into four congruent triangles which are similar to the reference triangle.

The intouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the three points of tangency of the reference triangle&#x27;s sides with its incircle. The extouch triangle of a reference triangle has its vertices at the points of tangency of the reference triangle&#x27;s excircles with its sides (not extended).
The inscribed squares tangent their vertices to the triangle&#x27;s sides is the special case of inscribed square problem, although the problem asking for a square whose vertices lie on a simple closed curve. A notable example of this figure relation is the Calabi triangle in which the vertices of every three squares are tangent to all obtuse triangle&#x27;s sides. Every acute triangle has three inscribed squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square&#x27;s vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). In a right triangle, two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle&#x27;s right angle, so a right triangle has only two &quot;distinct&quot; inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle&#x27;s longest side. Within a given triangle, a longer common side is associated with a smaller inscribed square. If an inscribed square has a side of length formula_27 and the triangle has a side of length formula_11, part of which side coincides with a side of the square, then formula_27, formula_11, formula_31 from the side formula_11, and the triangle&#x27;s area formula_33 are related according toformula_34The largest possible ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the triangle is 1/2, which occurs when formula_35, formula_36, and the altitude of the triangle from the base of length formula_11 is equal to formula_11. The smallest possible ratio of the side of one inscribed square to the side of another in the same non-obtuse triangle is formula_39. Both of these extreme cases occur for the isosceles right triangle.
The Lemoine hexagon is a cyclic hexagon with vertices given by the six intersections of the sides of a triangle with the three lines that are parallel to the sides and that pass through its symmedian point. In either its simple form or its self-intersecting form, the Lemoine hexagon is interior to the triangle with two vertices on each side of the triangle.

Every convex polygon with area formula_33 can be inscribed in a triangle of area at most equal to formula_41. Equality holds only if the polygon is a parallelogram.

=== Figures circumscribed about a triangle ===

The tangential triangle of a reference triangle (other than a right triangle) is the triangle whose sides are on the tangent lines to the reference triangle&#x27;s circumcircle at its vertices.

As mentioned above, every triangle has a unique circumcircle, a circle passing through all three vertices, whose center is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle&#x27;s sides. Furthermore, every triangle has a unique Steiner circumellipse, which passes through the triangle&#x27;s vertices and has its center at the triangle&#x27;s centroid. Of all ellipses going through the triangle&#x27;s vertices, it has the smallest area.

The Kiepert hyperbola is unique conic that passes through the triangle&#x27;s three vertices, its centroid, and its circumcenter.

Of all triangles contained in a given convex polygon, one with maximal area can be found in linear time; its vertices may be chosen as three of the vertices of the given polygon.

== Miscellaneous triangles ==
=== Circular triangles ===
A circular triangle is a triangle with circular arc edges. The edges of a circular triangle may be either convex (bending outward) or concave (bending inward). The intersection of three disks forms a circular triangle whose sides are all convex. An example of a circular triangle with three convex edges is a Reuleaux triangle, which can be made by intersecting three circles of equal size. The construction may be performed with a compass alone without needing a straightedge, by the Mohr–Mascheroni theorem. Alternatively, it can be constructed by rounding the sides of an equilateral triangle.

A special case of concave circular triangle can be seen in a pseudotriangle. A pseudotriangle is a simply-connected subset of the plane lying between three mutually tangent convex regions. These sides are three smoothed curved lines connecting their endpoints called the &quot;cusp points&quot;. Any pseudotriangle can be partitioned into many pseudotriangles with the boundaries of convex disks and bitangent lines, a process known as pseudo-triangulation. For formula_42 disks in a pseudotriangle, the partition gives formula_43 pseudotriangles and formula_44 bitangent lines. The convex hull of any pseudotriangle is a triangle.

=== Triangle in non-planar space ===
A non-planar triangle is a triangle not included in Euclidean space, roughly speaking a flat space. This means triangles may also be discovered in several spaces, as in hyperbolic space and spherical geometry. A triangle in hyperbolic space is called a hyperbolic triangle, and it can be obtained by drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface. Likewise, a triangle in spherical geometry is called a spherical triangle, and it can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere.

The triangles in both spaces have properties different from the triangles in Euclidean space. For example, as mentioned above, the internal angles of a triangle in Euclidean space always add up to 180°. However, the sum of the internal angles of a hyperbolic triangle is less than 180°, and for any spherical triangle, the sum is more than 180°. In particular, it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles equals 90°, adding up to a total of 270°. By Girard&#x27;s theorem, the sum of the angles of a triangle on a sphere is formula_45, where formula_46 is the fraction of the sphere&#x27;s area enclosed by the triangle.

In more general spaces, there are comparison theorems relating the properties of a triangle in the space to properties of a corresponding triangle in a model space like hyperbolic or elliptic space. For example, a CAT(k) space is characterized by such comparisons.

=== Fractal geometry ===
Fractal shapes based on triangles include the Sierpiński gasket and the Koch snowflake.

<doc id="30656" wikidata="Q83086" url="?curid=30656" title="Torino scale">
<text>The Torino scale is a method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets. It is intended as a communication tool for astronomers and the public to assess the seriousness of collision predictions, by combining probability statistics and known kinetic damage potentials into a single threat value. The Palermo scale is a similar, but more complex scale.

Near-Earth objects with a Torino scale of 1 are discovered several times a year, and may last a few weeks until they have a longer observation arc that eliminates any possibility of a collision. The only objects on the Torino scale that have ever ranked higher are asteroids 99942 Apophis, which had a rating of 4 for four days in late 2004, the highest recorded rating; , with a historical rating of 2 from February to May 2006; and , with a rating of 3 from January 27, 2025 to February 20, 2025.

==Overview==

The Torino scale uses an integer scale from 0 to 10. A 0 indicates an object has a negligibly small chance of collision with the Earth, compared with the usual &quot;background noise&quot; of collision events, or is too small to penetrate Earth&#x27;s atmosphere intact. A 10 indicates that a collision is certain, and the impacting object is large enough to precipitate a global disaster.

An object is assigned a 0 to 10 value based on its collision probability and the kinetic energy of the possible collision.

The Torino scale is defined only for potential impacts less than 100 years in the future.

&quot;For an object with multiple potential collisions on a set of dates, a Torino scale value should be determined for each date. It may be convenient to summarize such an object by the greatest Torino scale value within the set.&quot;

==History and naming==
The Torino scale was created by Professor Richard P. Binzel in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The first version, called &quot;A Near-Earth Object Hazard Index&quot;, was presented at a United Nations conference in 1995 and was published by Binzel in the subsequent conference proceedings (&quot;Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,&quot; volume 822, 1997.)

A revised version of the &quot;Hazard Index&quot; was presented at a June 1999 international conference on NEOs held in Torino (Turin), Italy. The conference participants voted to adopt the revised version, where the bestowed name &quot;Torino scale&quot; recognizes the spirit of international cooperation displayed at that conference toward research efforts to understand the hazards posed by NEOs. (&quot;Torino scale&quot; is the proper usage, not &quot;Turin scale.&quot;) This version was published in a subsequent peer-reviewed article.

Due to exaggerated press coverage of Level 1 asteroids, a rewording of the Torino scale was published in 2005, adding more details and renaming the categories: in particular, Level 1 was changed from &quot;Events meriting careful monitoring&quot; to &quot;Normal&quot;.

The Torino scale has served as the model for the Rio scale, which quantifies the validity and societal impact of SETI data.

== Definition ==

Ratings are assigned based on the parameters of impact calculations. Each rating has a defined meaning which is to inform the public.

=== Calculation of ratings ===
Ratings are determined on the basis of the impact probability (&quot;p&quot;), expressed as a real number between 0 for no chance of impact and 1 for a certain impact; and the estimated impact energy (&quot;E&quot;), expressed in megatons of TNT.

=== Meaning of ratings ===

The Torino scale also uses a color code scale: white, green, yellow, orange, red. Each color code has an overall meaning:

No incoming object has ever been rated above level 4, though over Earth&#x27;s history impacts have spanned the full range of damage described by the scale.

== Risk calculation ==
For NASA, a unit of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) calculates impact risks and assigns ratings in its Sentry Risk Table, while another unit of JPL, Solar System Dynamics (SSD) provides orbital and close approach data. For ESA, similar services are provided by its Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC), which maintains its own Risk List and Close Approaches List.

The basis for the risk evaluation is the most recent orbit calculation based on all known reliable observations. Along the calculated orbit, close approaches with Earth are determined. Due to measurement and model imprecision, the orbit calculation has an uncertainty, which can be quantified for the close approach distance. Assuming a two-dimensional Gaussian probability distribution in the plane perpendicular to the asteroid&#x27;s orbit (the B-plane), the uncertainty can be characterized by the standard deviation (sigma) the close approach point in the directions along the asteroid&#x27;s orbit and perpendicular to it, where the former is usually much larger. The one-sigma margin, which is used by ESA NEOCC one-sigma, means that the close approach point is within those bounds with a 68.3% probability, while the 3-sigma margin, used by NASA JPL SSD, corresponds to 99.7% probability. The probability of an impact is the integral of the probability distribution over the cross section of Earth in the B-plane.

When the close approach of a newly discovered asteroid is first put on a risk list with a significant risk, it is normal for the risk to first increase, regardless whether the potential impact will eventually be ruled out or confirmed with the help of additional observations. After discovery, Earth will be close to the center of the probability distribution, that is, the 3-sigma uncertainty margin will be much bigger than the nominal close encounter distance. With additional observations, the uncertainty will decrease, thus the 3-sigma uncertainty region will shrink, thus Earth will initially cover an increasing part of the probability distribution, resulting in increased risk, and potentially an increasing rating. If the real orbit bypasses Earth, with further observations, Earth will only intersect the tail of the probability distribution (the 3-sigma region will shrink to exclude the Earth) and the impact risk will fall towards zero; while in case the asteroid will hit the Earth, the probability distribution will contract towards its intersection (the 3-sigma region will shrink into Earth&#x27;s intersection in the B-plane) and the risk will rise towards 100%.

The Chicxulub impact, believed by most scientists to have been a significant factor in the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, has been estimated at 100 million (108) megatons. Were an equivalent impact predicted with a probability of 99% or more, it would rate 10 on the Torino scale. The impacts that created the Barringer Crater and the 1908 Tunguska event are both estimated to have been in the 3–10 megaton range, thus, if a similar impact had been predicted with near certainty, it would correspond to Torino scale 8. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor had a total kinetic energy prior to impact of about 0.5 megatons, thus, regardless of impact probability, it would only rate 0 on the Torino scale - despite breaking over 3600 windows and injuring around 1500 people. Between 2000 and 2013, 26 atmospheric asteroid impacts with an energy of 1–600 kilotons were detected by the network of infrasound sensors operated by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.

The biggest hydrogen bomb ever exploded, the Tsar Bomba, was around 50 megatons. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa was the equivalent of roughly 200 megatons.

The comet C/2013 A1, which passed close to Mars in 2014, was originally estimated to have a potential impact energy of 5 million to 24 billion megatons, and in March 2013 was estimated to have a Mars impact probability of ~1:1250, corresponding to the Martian equivalent of Torino scale 6. The impact probability was reduced to ~1:120000 in April 2013, corresponding to Torino scale 1 or 2.

<doc id="30658" wikidata="Q908717" url="?curid=30658" title="TWA Flight 800">
<text>Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TW800/TWA800) was a scheduled international passenger flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, United States, to Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy, with a stopover at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. On July 17, 1996, at approximately 8:31p.m. EDT, twelve minutes after takeoff, the Boeing 747-100 serving the flight exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, United States.

All 230 people on board died in the crash; it is the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history. Accident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning amid speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) initiated a parallel criminal investigation. Sixteen months later, the JTTF announced that no evidence of a criminal act had been found and closed its active investigation.

The four-year NTSB investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex, and costly air disaster investigation in U.S. history up to that time. The report&#x27;s conclusion was that the probable cause of the accident was the explosion of flammable fuel vapors in the center fuel tank. Although it could not be determined with certainty, the likely ignition source was a short circuit. Problems with the aircraft&#x27;s wiring were found, including evidence of arcing in the fuel quantity indication system (FQIS) wiring that enters the tank. The FQIS on Flight 800 is known to have been malfunctioning; the captain remarked about &quot;crazy&quot; readings from the system about two minutes and 30 seconds before the aircraft exploded. As a result of the investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future fuel-tank explosions.

==Accident==
On the day of the accident, the airplane departed from Ellinikon International Airport in Athens, Greece, as TWA Flight 881 and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport at about 4:38 p.m. The aircraft was then refueled and the crew was changed. The crew was led by 58-year-old Captain Ralph G. Kevorkian, who had flown for TWA for 31 years and the U.S. Air Force for nine years and had logged 18,700 flight hours, including 5,400 on the Boeing 747.

Captain/check airman Steven E. Snyder, 57, had flown for TWA for 32 years and had logged 17,200 flight hours, including 4,700 on the Boeing 747. Flight engineer/check airman Richard G. Campbell Jr., 63, had flown for TWA for 30 years and the U.S. Air Force for 12 years and had logged 18,500 flight hours, including 3,800 on the Boeing 747. Also with the crew was 25-year-old flight engineer trainee Oliver Krick, who previously served as a business pilot for four years and had 2,500 flight hours, including 30 on the Boeing 747. Krick had flown for TWA for 26 days and was starting the sixth leg of his initial operating experience training. Flight 800 was actually a training flight for Kevorkian, and he was seated in the captain&#x27;s (left) seat. Captain Snyder was seated in the first officer&#x27;s (right) seat monitoring Kevorkian&#x27;s progress. Flight Engineer Campbell was seated in the cockpit jump seat. Flight engineer trainee Krick was seated in the flight engineer&#x27;s seat being monitored by Campbell. The NTSB Final Report gives Oliver Krick&#x27;s age as being 24. The TWA press release gives 25. (TWA was correct, as Krick turned 25 on July 14, three days before the crash.)

The ground-maintenance crew locked out the thrust reverser for engine No. 3 (treated as a minimum equipment list item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, before Flight 800&#x27;s departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine’s thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was believed to have been triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the aircraft had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.

TWA 800 was scheduled to depart JFK for Charles de Gaulle Airport around 7:00 p.m., but the flight’s pushback was delayed until 8:02 p.m. by a disabled piece of ground equipment and a passenger/baggage mismatch. After the owner of the baggage in question was confirmed to be on board, the flight crew prepared for departure, and the aircraft pushed back from Gate 27 at the TWA Flight Center. The flight crew started the engines at 8:04 p.m. However, because of the previous maintenance undertaken on engine No. 3, the flight crew only started engines No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4. Engine No. 3 was started 10 minutes later during taxi at 8:14 p.m. The initial departure was uneventful, with the 747 taking off from Runway 22R five minutes later at 8:19 p.m.
 TWA 800 then received a series of heading changes and generally increasing altitude assignments as it climbed to its intended cruising altitude. Weather in the area was light winds with scattered clouds, with dusk lighting conditions. The last radio transmission from the airplane occurred at 8:30 p.m., when the flight crew received and then acknowledged instructions from Boston Center to climb to . The last recorded radar transponder return from the airplane was recorded by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar site at Trevose, Pennsylvania, at 8:31:12 p.m.
Thirty-eight seconds later, David McClaine, the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, a Boeing 737-221 registered N221US (which had suffered a near-crash of its own a month prior) reported to Boston ARTCC that he &quot;just saw an explosion out here&quot;, adding, &quot;we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here ... about or something like that, it just went down… into the water.&quot; Subsequently, many air traffic control facilities in the New York and Long Island areas received reports of an explosion from other pilots operating in the area. Many witnesses in the vicinity of the crash stated that they saw or heard explosions, accompanied by a large fireball(s) over the ocean, and observed debris, some of which was burning while falling into the water.
Various civilian, military, and police vessels reached the crash site within minutes of the initial water impact. They searched for survivors but found none, making TWA 800 the second-deadliest aircraft accident in United States history at that time, only exceeded by American Airlines Flight 191.

==Background==

=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft involved, manufactured in July 1971, was a Boeing 747-131 registered as N93119 with serial number 20083. It had completed 16,869 flights in 93,303 hours of operation and was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7AH turbofan engines.

=== Crew ===

On board TWA 800 were 230 people, including 18 crew and 20 off-duty employees, most of whom were crew meant to cover the Paris-Rome leg of the flight. Out of the 18 crew members, 17 crew members and 152 of the passengers were Americans; the remaining crew member was Italian, while the remaining passengers were of various other nationalities. Notable passengers included:
* Michel Breistroff, French ice hockey player
* Marcel Dadi, French guitarist
* David Hogan, American composer
* Jed Johnson, Andy Warhol&#x27;s partner of twelve years, interior designer, and director
* Pam Lychner, American crime victims&#x27; rights advocate and former TWA flight attendant
* Rico Puhlmann, German fashion photographer
* Courtney Elizabeth Johns, sister of Geoff Johns and the inspiration for the DC Comics superhero Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl
* Ana Maria Shorter, Wayne Shorter&#x27;s second wife, and the couple&#x27;s niece, Dalila, daughter of singer Jon Lucien
*Jack O&#x27;Hara, executive producer of ABC Sports, along with his wife and daughter. He was going to France to supervise coverage of the Tour de France in what was to be his last assignment for the network after being let go the previous week.

In addition, 16 students and five adult chaperones from the French Club of the Montoursville Area High School in Pennsylvania were on board.

==Initial investigation==
The NTSB was notified at approximately 8:50 p.m. on the day of the accident. A full &quot;go team&quot; was assembled in Washington, D.C., and arrived on the scene early the next morning. Meanwhile, initial witness descriptions led many to believe that the cause of the crash was a bomb or surface-to-air missile attack. As the NTSB does not investigate criminal activity, the United States Attorney General is empowered to declare an investigation to be potentially linked to a criminal act and to require the NTSB to relinquish control of the investigation to the FBI. In the case of TWA 800, the FBI initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB&#x27;s accident investigation.

===Search-and-recovery operations===
Search-and-recovery operations were conducted by federal, state, and local agencies, as well as by government contractors. Personnel in an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter of the New York Air National Guard witnessed the explosion from about away and arrived at the scene of the explosion while debris was still falling into the water, forcing the crew to retreat. They reported their sighting to the tower at Suffolk County Airport. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), side-scan sonar and laser line-scanning equipment were employed to search for and investigate underwater debris fields. Victims and wreckage were recovered by scuba divers and ROVs. Later, scallop trawlers were used to recover wreckage embedded in the sea floor. In one of the largest diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, often working in very difficult and dangerous conditions, more than 95% of the airplane wreckage was eventually recovered. The search-and-recovery effort identified three main areas of wreckage underwater, which were classified by color. The yellow, red, and green zones contained wreckage from the front, center, and rear sections of the airplane, respectively. The green zone with the aft portion of the aircraft was located the farthest along the flight path.

Pieces of wreckage were transported by boat to shore and then by truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York for storage, examination, and reconstruction. The facility became the command center and headquarters for the investigation. NTSB and FBI personnel were present to observe all transfers to preserve the evidentiary value of the wreckage. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers one week after the accident, and the machines were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C. for analysis. The victims&#x27; remains were transported to the Suffolk County Medical Examiner&#x27;s office in Hauppauge, New York.

===Tensions in the investigation===
Relatives of TWA 800 passengers and crew, as well as the media, gathered at the Ramada Plaza JFK Hotel. Many waited until the remains of their family members had been recovered, identified and released. This hotel became known as the &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; for its role in hosting families of victims of several airliner crashes.

Many grieving relatives became angry because of TWA&#x27;s delayed confirmation of the passenger list, conflicting information from agencies and officials and mistrust of the recovery operation&#x27;s priorities. Although NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis stated that all bodies were retrieved as soon as they were spotted and that wreckage was recovered only if divers believed that victims were hidden underneath, many families were suspicious that investigators were not truthful or were withholding information.

Anger and political pressure were also directed at Suffolk County medical examiner Charles V. Wetli as recovered bodies backlogged at the morgue. Under constant pressure to identify victims with minimal delay, pathologists worked long hours. While some victims&#x27; bodies were generally intact, most others were burned, fragmented, skeletonized, or decaying, necessitating identification using DNA testing and dental records. As the primary objective was to identify all remains rather than to perform detailed forensic autopsies, the thoroughness of the examinations was highly variable. Ultimately, the remains of all 230 victims were recovered and identified, and the final victim identification occurred more than 10 months after the crash.

With lines of authority unclear, differences in agendas and culture between the FBI and NTSB resulted in discord. The FBI, assuming that a criminal act had occurred, saw the NTSB as indecisive. Expressing frustration at the NTSB&#x27;s unwillingness to speculate on a cause, one FBI agent described the NTSB as &quot;No opinions. No nothing.&quot; Meanwhile, the NTSB was required to refute or minimize speculation about conclusions and evidence, frequently supplied to reporters by law-enforcement officials and politicians. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, an invited party to the NTSB investigation, criticized the undocumented removal by FBI agents of wreckage from the hangar where it was stored.

===Witness interviews===

Although considerable discrepancies existed among the many witness accounts, most had seen a &quot;streak of light,&quot; described by 38 of 258 witnesses as ascending, moving to a point where a large fireball appeared. Several witnesses reported that the fireball divided into two parts as it descended toward the water. Intense public interest arose regarding the witness reports, as did much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. These witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the FBI&#x27;s criminal investigation.

Approximately 80 FBI agents conducted interviews with potential witnesses daily. No verbatim records of the witness interviews were produced; instead, the agents who conducted the interviews wrote summaries that they then submitted. Witnesses were not asked to review or correct the summaries. Included in some of the witness summaries were drawings or diagrams of what the witnesses had observed.

Within days of the crash, the NTSB announced its intent to form its own witness group and to interview witnesses to the crash. After the FBI raised concerns about nongovernmental parties in the NTSB&#x27;s investigation having access to this information and possible prosecutorial difficulties resulting from multiple interviews of the same witnesses, the NTSB deferred and did not interview witnesses. A safety board investigator later reviewed FBI interview notes and briefed other board investigators on their contents. In November 1996, the FBI agreed to allow the NTSB access to summaries of witness accounts in which personally identifying information had been redacted and to conduct a limited number of witness interviews. In April 1998, the FBI provided the NTSB with the identities of the witnesses, but because of the time that had elapsed, a decision was made to rely on the original FBI documents rather than on reinterviewed witnesses.

==Further investigation and analysis==
Examination of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder data showed a normal takeoff and climb, with the aircraft in normal flight before both abruptly stopped at 8:31:12 p.m. At 8:29:15 p.m., Captain Kevorkian was heard to say, &quot;Look at that crazy fuel flow indicator there on number four... see that?&quot; A loud noise recorded on the last few tenths of a second of the CVR was similar to the last noises recorded from other airplanes that had experienced in-flight breakups. This, together with the distribution of wreckage and witness reports, indicated a sudden, catastrophic in-flight breakup of TWA 800.

===Possible causes of the in-flight breakup===
Investigators considered several possible causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and decompression, detonation of a high-energy explosive device such as a missile warhead exploding either upon impact with the airplane or just before impact, a bomb exploding inside the airplane or a fuel-air explosion in the center-wing fuel tank.

====Structural failure and decompression====
Close examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of structural faults such as fatigue, corrosion, or mechanical damage that could have caused the in-flight breakup. The breakup could have been initiated by an in-flight separation of the forward cargo door as had occurred in the Turkish Airlines Flight 981 or United Airlines Flight 811 accidents, but all evidence indicated that the door was closed and locked at impact. The NTSB concluded that &quot;the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a pre-existing condition resulting in a structural failure and decompression.&quot;

====Missile or bomb detonation====
A review of recorded data from long-range and airport surveillance radars revealed multiple contacts of airplanes or objects in TWA 800&#x27;s vicinity at the time of the accident. None of these contacts intersected TWA 800&#x27;s position at any time. Attention was drawn to data from the Islip, New York ARTCC facility that showed three tracks in the vicinity of TWA 800 that did not appear in any of the other radar data. None of these sequences intersected TWA 800&#x27;s position at any time. None of the reviewed data showed radar returns consistent with a missile or other projectile traveling toward TWA 800.

The NTSB addressed allegations that the Islip radar data showed groups of military surface targets converging suspiciously in an area around the accident and that an unidentified 30-knot radar track, from the crash site, was involved in foul play, as evidenced by its failure to divert from its course and assist with the search-and-rescue operations. Military records examined by the NTSB showed no military surface vessels within of TWA 800 at the time of the accident. In addition, the records indicated that the closest area scheduled for military use, warning area W-387A/B, was south.

The NTSB reviewed the 30-knot target track to determine why it had not diverted from its course to proceed to the area where the TWA 800 wreckage had fallen. TWA 800 was behind the target, and with the target&#x27;s occupants likely looking forward, they would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft&#x27;s breakup, subsequent explosions, or fireballs. The occupants of the target track were unlikely to have been able to hear the explosions over the sound of their craft&#x27;s engines and the noise of the hull traveling through water, especially if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin. Further, review of the Islip radar data for similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and cargo-vessel traffic.
Trace amounts of explosive residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate locations of the recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI as a piece of canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel). These samples were submitted to the FBI&#x27;s laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention. In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed bearing an unknown red/brown-shaded substance. According to the seat manufacturer, the locations and appearance of the substance were consistent with adhesive used in the construction of the seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as consistent with adhesives.

Further examination of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of a bomb or missile warhead (&quot;severe pitting, cratering, petalling or hot-gas washing&quot;). This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found. Of the 5% of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas was large enough to have covered all of the damage that would have been caused by the detonation of a bomb or missile. None of the victims&#x27; remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.

The NTSB considered the possibility that the explosive residue was the result of contamination from the aircraft&#x27;s use in transporting troops during the Gulf War in 1991 or its use in a dog-training explosive-detection exercise about one month before the accident. Testing conducted by the FAA&#x27;s Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after two days of immersion in seawater (nearly all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than two days). The NTSB concluded that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the explosive residue detected was transferred from military ships, ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots of military personnel onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation, and that the residue was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.

Although it was unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue found in the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that &quot;the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike.&quot;

====Fuel-air explosion in the center wing fuel tank====
To evaluate the sequence of structural breakup of the airplane, the NTSB formed the Sequencing Group, which examined individual pieces of the recovered structure, two-dimensional reconstructions or layouts of sections of the airplane and various-sized three-dimensional reconstructions of portions of the aircraft. In addition, the locations of pieces of wreckage at the time of recovery and differences in fire effects on pieces that are normally adjacent to each other were evaluated. The Sequencing Group concluded that the first event in the breakup sequence was a fracture in the wing center section of the aircraft caused by an &quot;overpressure event&quot; in the center-wing fuel tank (CWT). An overpressure event was defined as a rapid increase in pressure resulting in failure of the structure of the CWT.

Because no evidence was found that an explosive device detonated in this (or any other) area of the airplane, the overpressure event could only have been caused by a fuel-air explosion in the CWT. There were of fuel in the CWT of TWA 800; tests recreating the flight conditions showed the combination of liquid fuel and fuel-air vapor to be flammable. A major reason for the flammability of the fuel-air vapor in the CWT of the 747 was the large amount of heat generated and transferred to the CWT by air-conditioning packs located directly below the tank; with the CWT temperature raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an explosion.

Computer modeling and scale-model testing were used to predict and demonstrate how an explosion would progress in a 747 CWT. During this time, quenching was identified as an issue, a phenomenon in which the explosion would extinguish itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT. Because the research data regarding quenching were limited, a complete understanding of quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained unresolved.

To better determine whether a fuel-air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997 using a retired Air France 747 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, England. These tests simulated a fuel-air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane-air mixture, which failed the tank structure from overpressure. While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800, previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as those of Avianca Flight 203 and Philippine Airlines Flight 143 confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.

Ultimately, based on &quot;the accident airplane&#x27;s breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,&quot; the NTSB concluded that &quot;the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.&quot;

===In-flight breakup sequence and crippled flight===

Recovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after the separation of the forward fuselage and impacted the water in the green zone.

Fire damage and soot deposits on the recovered wreckage indicated that some areas of fire existed on the airplane as it continued in crippled flight after the loss of the forward fuselage. After about 34 seconds (based on information from witness documents), the outer portions of both the right and left wings failed. Shortly after, the left wing separated from what remained of the main fuselage, which resulted in further development of the fuel-fed fireballs as the pieces of wreckage fell to the ocean.

Only the FAA radar facility in North Truro, Massachusetts, using specialized processing software from the United States Air Force 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron, was capable of estimating the altitude of TWA 800 after it lost power due to the CWT explosion. Because of accuracy limitations, these radar data could not be used to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated. Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage. Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data (the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various sites differed). These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued in crippled flight, then pitched up while rolling to the left (north), climbing to a maximum altitude between from its last recorded altitude, .

====Analysis of reported witness observations====
At the start of the FBI&#x27;s investigation, because of the possibility that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, concluded that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This conclusion was reached after calculating how long the sound of the initial explosion took to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence. In all cases, the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.

As the investigation progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses. From November 1996 through April 1997, this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted) and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a New York Air National Guard HH-60 helicopter and C-130 airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy P-3 airplane that was flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.

In February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation, agreed to fully release the witness summaries to the NTSB. With access to these documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness group to review the documents. Because of the time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to reinterview the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original summaries of witness statements written by FBI agents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses. Despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage point and experience as an airline pilot.

The NTSB&#x27;s review of the released witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which 258 were characterized as &quot;streak of light&quot; witnesses (&quot;an object moving in the sky... variously described [as] a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting star, or something similar.&quot;) The NTSB witness group concluded that the streak of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258 streak-of-light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion.

Thirty-eight witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so, and these accounts &quot;seem[ed] to be inconsistent with the accident airplane&#x27;s flightpath.&quot; In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not &quot;appear to be consistent with the airplane&#x27;s calculated flightpath and other known aspects of the accident sequence.&quot; Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that based on their experience in previous investigations &quot;witness reports are often inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses&#x27; reports of the same events.&quot; The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as &quot;Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?&quot; and &quot;How long did the missile fly?&quot; could have biased interviewees&#x27; responses in some cases. The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they &quot;did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another&quot; and &quot;did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.&quot;

After missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack, they would have seen:
# a light from the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8 seconds
# the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds
# upon the missile striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT, another light, moving considerably more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds
# this light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward the ocean. None of the witness documents described such a scenario.

Because of their unique vantage points or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest: the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard US Airways Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in Westhampton Beach, New York and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach. Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile; analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA 800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.

The NTSB concluded, &quot;the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the postexplosion, preimpact breakup sequence&quot;. The NTSB further concluded, &quot;the witnesses&#x27; observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane&#x27;s burning wreckage falling toward the ocean&quot;.

===Possible ignition sources of the center wing fuel tank===
To determine what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.

====Missile fragment or small explosive charge====
Although the NTSB had already concluded that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA 800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike, was considered. Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT. Based on these simulations, the NTSB concluded that it was &quot;very unlikely&quot; that a warhead could have detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT without other missile fragments impacting the surrounding airplane structure, leaving distinctive impact marks.

Similarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source. Testing by the NTSB and the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency demonstrated that when the metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, petalling of the surface occurred where the charge was placed, with pitting on the adjacent surfaces and visible hot-gas washing damage in the surrounding area. Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics and none of the areas of missing wreckage was large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was &quot;very unlikely&quot;.

====Other potential sources====
The NTSB also investigated whether the fuel-air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by lightning strike, meteor strike, auto ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static electricity. After analysis, the investigation determined that these potential sources were &quot;very unlikely&quot; to have been the source of ignition.

====Fuel quantity indication system====
Because a combustible fuel-air mixture will always exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the 747&#x27;s tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the fuel quantity indication system (FQIS) are kept very low. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that associated with the FQIS.

For the FQIS to have been Flight 800&#x27;s ignition source, a transfer of higher-than-normal voltage to the FQIS would have needed to occur, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. The NTSB concluded, &quot;the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring.&quot;

Though the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800&#x27;s FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976. This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank. Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.

The captain&#x27;s CVR channel showed two &quot;dropouts&quot; of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the nose). This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the &quot;crazy&quot; readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 2 1/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended. Finally, the CWT fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640 pounds instead of the 300 pounds that had been loaded into that tank. Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus, the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short circuit to the FQIS wiring. The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short circuit from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, pinpointing the source of the necessary voltage was not possible.

==Report conclusions==
The NTSB investigation ended with the adoption of the board&#x27;s final report on August 23, 2000. The board determined that the probable cause of the TWA 800 accident was:
In addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found the following contributing factors to the accident:
During the course of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued 15 safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel tank and wiring-related issues. Among the recommendations was that significant consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as nitrogen-inerting systems for new airplane designs, and where feasible, for existing airplanes.

===Controversy===

After the accident, former Joint Chief of Staff Thomas Moorer and former White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger speculated that the airplane was destroyed by a missile, with a nearby U.S. Navy ship being the likely culprit. The NTSB&#x27;s conclusions about the cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published. The FBI&#x27;s earliest investigations and interviews, later used by the NTSB, were performed under the assumption of a missile attack, a fact noted in the NTSB&#x27;s final report. Six months into the investigation, the NTSB&#x27;s chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, &quot;All three theories—a bomb, a missile, or mechanical failure—remain.&quot; Speculation was fueled in part by early descriptions, visuals, and eyewitness accounts of the disaster that indicated a sudden explosion and trails of fire moving in an upward direction.

On June 19, 2013, the NTSB acknowledged in a press release that they received a petition for reconsideration of the investigation into the July 17, 1996, crash of TWA Flight 800. In 2014, the NTSB declined the petition to reopen the investigation. In a press release, the NTSB stated: &quot;After a thorough review of all the information provided by the petitioners, the NTSB denied the petition in its entirety because the evidence and analysis presented did not show the original findings were incorrect.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Many internet users responded to the incident; the resulting web traffic set records for internet activity at the time. CNN&#x27;s traffic quadrupled to 3.9 million views per day. The website of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had its traffic increase to 1.5 million views per day, 50% higher than its previous rate. In 1996, few U.S. government websites were updated daily, but the United States Navy&#x27;s crash website was constantly updated and had detailed information about the salvage of the crash site.

The wreckage was moved to an NTSB facility in Ashburn, Virginia, that was custom-built for the purpose. The reconstructed aircraft was used to train accident investigators until it was decommissioned in 2021.

On July 18, 2008, the United States Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters visited the facility and announced a final rule designed to prevent accidents caused by fuel-tank explosions. The rule required airlines to pump inert gas into the tanks. The rule covered the CWT on all new passenger and cargo airliners, and passenger planes built in most of the 1990s, but not on old cargo planes. The NTSB had first recommended such a rule just five months after the incident and 33 years after a similar recommendation issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of Safety on December 17, 1963, nine days after the crash of Pan Am Flight 214.

The crash of TWA Flight 800, and that of ValuJet Flight 592 earlier in 1996, prompted Congress to pass the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 as part of the federal aviation appropriations bill. Among other things, the act gives NTSB, instead of the particular airline involved, responsibility for coordinating services to the families of victims of fatal aircraft accidents in the United States. In addition, it restricts lawyers and other parties from contacting family members within 30 days of the accident.

During the investigation, the NTSB and the FBI clashed with each other. The agencies lacked a detailed protocol describing which agency should take the lead when whether an event was an accident or a criminal act was initially unclear. At the time of the crash, 49 CFR 831.5 specified that the NTSB&#x27;s aviation accident investigations have priority over all other federal investigations. After the TWA flight 800 investigation, the NTSB recognized the need for better clarity. to clarify the issue in 49 USC 1131(a)(2)(B), which was amended in 2000 to read: 
In 2005, the NTSB and the FBI entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that stated that, &quot;[i]n the immediate aftermath of a transportation accident, the NTSB is the presumptive lead investigative agency and will assume control of the accident scene.&quot; The FBI may still conduct a criminal investigation, but the NTSB investigation has priority. When investigative priority remains with the NTSB, the FBI must coordinate its investigative activities with the NTSB investigator-in-charge. This authority includes interviewing witnesses. The MOU states that: &quot;[t]his procedure is intended…to ensure that neither NTSB nor FBI investigative activity unnecessarily complicates or compromises the other agency&#x27;s investigation.&quot; The new statutory language and the MOU have improved coordination between the NTSB and FBI since the TWA Flight 800 accident. , NTSB and FBI personnel conduct joint exercises. Each agency can call upon the other&#x27;s laboratories and other assets. The NTSB and the FBI have designated liaisons to ensure that information flows between agencies and to coordinate on-scene operations.

Heidi Snow, the fiancée of Flight 800 victim Michel Breistroff, established the AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services nonprofit group together with families of victims of Pan Am Flight 103.

===Memorials===

The TWA Flight 800 International Memorial was dedicated in a parcel immediately adjoining the main pavilion at Smith Point County Park in Shirley, New York, on July 14, 2002. Funds for the memorial were raised by the Families of TWA Flight 800 Association. The memorial includes landscaped grounds, flags from the 13 countries of the victims, and a curved black granite memorial with the names engraved on one side and an illustration on the other of a wave releasing 230 seagulls. In July 2006, an abstract black granite statue of a lighthouse was added above a tomb holding many of the victims&#x27; personal belongings. The lighthouse statue was designed by Harry Edward Seaman, whose cousin died in the crash, and dedicated by George Pataki.

===Destruction of wreckage===
For almost 25 years, the wreckage of Flight 800 was kept by the NTSB and used as an accident-investigation teaching aid. By 2021, the methods taught using the wreckage were determined to no longer be relevant to modern accident investigation, which by then relied heavily on new technology, including three-dimensional laser-scanning techniques.

As the NTSB did not wish to renew the lease for the hangar in which it had stored the reassembled accident debris, it decommissioned the wreckage in July 2021. As the NTSB had agreements with the victims&#x27; families that the wreckage cannot be used in any kind of public memorial or be scuttled in the ocean, it plans to scan each piece of debris with a three-dimensional laser scanner, with the data being permanently archived, after which the wreckage will be destroyed and the metal recycled. Any parts of the plane that cannot be recycled will be disposed of in landfills. Destruction of the wreckage was scheduled for completion before the end of 2021. The wreckage was destroyed in June 2023 near the former Ashburn facility in which it was housed.

<text>Triangulum is a small constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for &quot;triangle&quot;, derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. The celestial cartographers Johann Bayer and John Flamsteed catalogued the constellation&#x27;s stars, giving six of them Bayer designations.

The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of apparent magnitudes 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. Iota Trianguli is a notable double star system, and there are three star systems with known planets located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the Triangulum Galaxy or Messier 33—a member of the Local Group. The first quasar ever observed, 3C 48, also lies within the boundaries of Triangulum.

==History and mythology==
In the Babylonian star catalogues, Triangulum, together with Gamma Andromedae, formed the constellation known as () &quot;The Plough&quot;. It is notable as the first constellation presented on (and giving its name to) a pair of tablets containing canonical star lists that were compiled around 1000 BC, the MUL.APIN. The Plough was the first constellation of the &quot;Way of Enlil&quot;—that is, the northernmost quarter of the Sun&#x27;s path, which corresponds to the 45 days on either side of summer solstice. Its first appearance in the pre-dawn sky (heliacal rising) in February marked the time to begin spring ploughing in Mesopotamia.

The Ancient Greeks called Triangulum &quot;Deltoton&quot; (Δελτωτόν), as the constellation resembled an upper-case Greek letter delta (Δ). It was transliterated by Roman writers, then later Latinised as Deltotum. Eratosthenes linked it with the Nile Delta, while the Roman writer Hyginus associated it with the triangular island of Sicily, formerly known as Trinacria due to its shape. It was also called &quot;Sicilia&quot;, because the Romans believed Ceres, patron goddess of Sicily, begged Jupiter to place the island in the heavens. Greek astronomers such as Hipparchos and Ptolemy called it &quot;Trigonon&quot; (Τρίγωνον), and later, it was Romanized as Trigonum. Other names referring to its shape include Tricuspis and Triquetrum. Alpha and Beta Trianguli were called &quot;Al Mīzān&quot;, which is Arabic for &quot;The Scale Beam&quot;. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma Andromedae and neighbouring stars including Beta, Gamma and Delta Trianguli were called &quot;Teen Ta Tseang Keun&quot; (天大将军, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s great general&quot;), representing honour in astrology and a great general in mythology.

Later, the 17th-century German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer called the constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, for the three regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius excised three faint stars—ι, 10 and 12 Trianguli—to form the new constellation of Triangulum Minus in his 1690 &quot;Firmamentum Sobiescianum&quot;, renaming the original as Triangulum Majus. The smaller constellation was not recognised by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) when the constellations were established in the 1920s.

==Characteristics==
A small constellation, Triangulum is bordered by Andromeda to the north and west, Pisces to the west and south, Aries to the south, and Perseus to the east. The centre of the constellation lies halfway between Gamma Andromedae and Alpha Arietis. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is &quot;Tri&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 14 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between 25.60° and 37.35°. Covering 132 square degrees and 0.320% of the night sky, Triangulum ranks 78th of the 88 constellations in size.

==Features==

Bayer catalogued five stars in the constellation, giving them the Bayer designations Alpha to Epsilon. John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in subsequent catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1&#x27;s coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the location that corresponds to any star in his &quot;Catalogus Britannicus&quot;; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s in error by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407. Baily also noted that 16 Trianguli was closer to Aries and included it in the latter constellation.

===Stars===
Three stars make up the long narrow triangle that gives the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white giant star Beta Trianguli of apparent magnitude 3.00, lying 127 light-years distant from Earth. It is actually a spectroscopic binary system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with 3.5 times the mass of the Sun that is beginning to expand and evolve off the main sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated to be a yellow-white F-type main-sequence star around 1.4 solar masses. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 31 days, and are surrounded by a ring of dust that extends from 50 to 400 AU away from the stars.

The second-brightest star, the yellow-white subgiant star Alpha Trianguli (3.41m) with a close dimmer companion, is also known as Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the apex of the triangle. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of Alpha Arietis. Making up the triangle is Gamma Trianguli, a white main sequence star of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about 112 light-years from Earth. It is around double the size of and around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta, it is surrounded by a dusty debris disk, which has a radius 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lying near Gamma and forming an optical triple system with it are Delta and 7 Trianguli. Delta is a spectroscopic binary system composed of two yellow main sequence stars of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart. This system is the closest in the constellation to the Earth. Only of magnitude 5.25, 7 Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from Earth.

Iota Trianguli is a double star whose components can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale blue star. Both of these are themselves close binaries. X Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 over a period of 0.97 days. RW Trianguli is a cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf primary and an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former is drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.

R Trianguli is a long period (Mira) variable that ranges from magnitude 6.2 to 11.7 over a period of 267 days. It is a red giant of spectral type M3.5-8e, lying around 960 light-years away. HD 12545, also known as XX Trianguli, is
an orange giant of spectral type K0III around 520 light-years distant with a visual magnitude of 8.42. A huge starspot larger than the diameter of the Sun was detected on its surface in 1999 by astronomers using Doppler imaging.

Two star systems appear to have planets. HD 9446 is a Sun-like star around 171 light-years distant that has two planets of masses 0.7 and 1.8 times that of Jupiter, with orbital periods of 30 and 193 days respectively. HD 13189 is an orange giant of spectral type K2II about 2–7 times as massive as the Sun with a planetary or brown dwarf companion between 8 and 20 times as massive as Jupiter, which takes 472 days to complete an orbit. It is one of the largest stars discovered to have a planetary companion.

===Deep-sky objects===
The Triangulum Galaxy, also known as Messier 33, was discovered by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough to be seen by the naked eye under dark skies. Being a diffuse object, it is challenging to see under light-polluted skies, even with a small telescope or binoculars, and low power is required to view it. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. It is believed to have been interacting with it from their velocities. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.

In addition to M33, there are several NGC galaxies of visual magnitudes 12 to 14. The largest of these include the 10 arcminute long magnitude 12 NGC 925 spiral galaxy and the 5 arcminute long magnitude 11.6 NGC 672 barred spiral galaxy. The latter is close by and appears to be interacting with IC 1727. The two are 88,000 light-years apart and lie around 18 million light-years away. These two plus another four nearby dwarf irregular galaxies constitute the NGC 672 group, and all six appear to have had a burst of star formation in the last ten million years. The group is thought connected to another group of six galaxies known as the NGC 784 group, named for its principal galaxy, the barred spiral NGC 784. Together with two isolated dwarf galaxies, these fourteen appear to be moving in a common direction and constitute a group possibly located on a dark matter filament. 3C 48 was the first quasar ever to be observed, although its true identity was not uncovered until after that of 3C 273 in 1963. It has an apparent magnitude of 16.2 and is located about 5 degrees northwest of Alpha Trianguli.

<text>Tucana (The Toucan) is a constellation in the southern sky, named after the toucan, a South American bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived in the late sixteenth century by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Tucana first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer&#x27;s star atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756. The constellations Tucana, Grus, Phoenix and Pavo are collectively known as the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

Tucana is not a prominent constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, one of the brightest globular clusters in the sky, and most of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

==History==
Tucana is one of the twelve constellations established by the astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the &quot;Eerste Schipvaart&quot;, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot; of 1603. Both Plancius and Bayer depict it as a toucan. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name &quot;Den Indiaenschen Exster, op Indies Lang ghenaemt&quot; &quot;the Indian magpie, named Lang in the Indies&quot;, by this meaning a particular bird with a long beak—a hornbill, a bird native to the East Indies. A 1603 celestial globe by Willem Blaeu depicts it with a . It was interpreted on Chinese charts as &quot;Niǎohuì&quot; &quot;bird&#x27;s beak&quot;, and in England as &quot;Brasilian Pye&quot;, while Johannes Kepler and Giovanni Battista Riccioli termed it &quot;Anser Americanus&quot; &quot;American Goose&quot;, and Caesius as &quot;Pica Indica&quot;. Tucana and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Grus and Pavo are collectively called the &quot;Southern Birds&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Irregular in shape, Tucana is bordered by Hydrus to the east, Grus and Phoenix to the north, Indus to the west and Octans to the south. Covering 295 square degrees, it ranks 48th of the 88 constellations in size. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Tuc&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −56.31° and −75.35°. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the 30th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and is circumpolar at latitudes south of the 50th parallel in the Southern Hemisphere.

==Features==

===Stars===
Although he depicted Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair of stars close together Lambda Tucanae, and a group of three stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, and it is now known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by Francis Baily, who felt the star was too faint to warrant a designation, and Kappa&#x27;s two components came to be known as Kappa1 and Kappa2.

The layout of the brighter stars of Tucana has been likened to a kite. Within the constellation&#x27;s boundaries are around 80 stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 7. At an apparent magnitude of 2.86, Alpha Tucanae is the brightest star in the constellation and marks the toucan&#x27;s head. It is an orange subgiant of spectral type K3III around 199 light-years distant from the Solar System. A cool star with a surface temperature of 4300 K, it is 424 times as luminous as the Sun and 37 times its diameter. It is 2.5 to 3 times as massive. Alpha Tucanae is a spectroscopic binary, which means that the two stars have not been individually resolved using a telescope, but the presence of the companion has been inferred from measuring changes in the spectrum of the primary. The orbital period of the binary system is 4197.7 days (11.5 years). Nothing is known about the companion. Two degrees southeast of Alpha is the red-hued Nu Tucanae, of spectral type M4III and lying around 290 light-years distant. It is classified as a semiregular variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +4.75 to +4.93. Described by Richard Hinckley Allen as bluish, Gamma Tucanae is a yellow-white sequence star of spectral type F4V and an apparent magnitude of 4.00 located around 75 light-years from Earth. It also marks the toucan&#x27;s beak.

Beta, Delta and Kappa are multiple star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near the tail of the toucan, Beta Tucanae&#x27;s two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able to be seen as a separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24—actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.
Lambda Tucanae is an optical double—that is, the name is given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close together from the Earth, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.

Epsilon Tucanae traditionally marks the toucan&#x27;s left leg. A B-type subgiant, it has a spectral type B9IV and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. It is approximately 373 light-years from Earth. It is around four times as massive as the Sun.

Theta Tucanae is a white A-type star around 423 light-years distant from Earth, which is actually a close binary system. The main star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study asteroseismology. It is around double the Sun&#x27;s mass, having siphoned off one whole solar mass from its companion, now a hydrogen-depleted dwarf star of around only 0.2 solar masses. The system shines with a combined light that varies between magnitudes 6.06 to 6.15 every 70 to 80 minutes.

Zeta Tucanae is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years away from the Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star are very similar to the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It appears to have a debris disk orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 astronomical units. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.

Five star systems have been found to have planets, four of which have been discovered by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in Chile. HD 4308 is a star with around 83% of the Sun&#x27;s mass located 72 light-years away with a super-Earth planet with an orbital period of around 15 days. HD 215497 is an orange star of spectral type K3V around 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet around the size of Saturn with a period of around 567 days. HD 221287 has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a super-Jovian planet. HD 7199 has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a planet with around 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. HD 219077 has a planet around 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a highly eccentric orbit.

===Deep-sky objects===

The second-brightest globular cluster in the sky after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) lies just west of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 billion years old. Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of blue stragglers, hot stars that are hypothesized to form from binary star mergers. 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Near to 47 Tucana on the sky, and often seen in wide-field photographs showing it, are two much more distant globular clusters associated with the SMC: NGC 121, 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster&#x27;s edge, and Lindsay 8.

NGC 362 is another globular cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster and among the brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it very close to the center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.

Located at the southern end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, tidal forces from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.

The Tucana Dwarf galaxy, which was discovered in 1990, is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of type dE5 that is an isolated member of the Local Group. It is located from the Solar System and around from the barycentre of the Local Group—the second most remote of all member galaxies after the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy.

The barred spiral galaxy NGC 7408 is located 3 degrees northwest of Delta Tucanae, and was initially mistaken for a planetary nebula.

In 1998, part of the constellation was the subject of a two-week observation program by the Hubble Space Telescope, which resulted in the Hubble Deep Field South. The potential area to be covered needed to be at the poles of the telescope&#x27;s orbit for continuous observing, with the final choice resting upon the discovery of a quasar, QSO J2233-606, in the field.

<text>Triangulum Australe is a small constellation in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name is Latin for &quot;the southern triangle&quot;, which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the acute, almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Petrus Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 &quot;Uranometria&quot;. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.

Alpha Trianguli Australis, known as Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the brightest star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.

The Great Attractor, the gravitational center of the Laniakea Supercluster which includes the Milky Way galaxy, straddles Triangulum Australe and the neighboring constellation Norma.

==History==

Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci explored the New World at the beginning of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king Manuel I of Portugal, which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or Apus. This was sent to his patron in Florence, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de&#x27; Medici, and published as &quot;Mundus Novus&quot; in 1504. The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman Petrus Plancius on a -cm diameter celestial globe published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer Jacob van Langren, where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of Argo Navis. His student Petrus Keyzer, along with Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman, coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel. Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in Johann Bayer&#x27;s celestial atlas &quot;Uranometria&quot; in 1603, where it was also given its current name.

Nicolas Louis de Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor&#x27;s level respectively in a set of draughtsman&#x27;s instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars. Also depicting it as a surveyor&#x27;s level, German Johann Bode gave it the alternate name of Libella in his &quot;Uranographia&quot;.

German poet and author Philippus Caesius saw the three main stars as representing the Three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (with Atria as Abraham). The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the stars of Triangulum Australe as the tail of the Rainbow Serpent, which stretched out from near Crux across to Scorpius. Overhead in October, the Rainbow Serpent &quot;gives Lightning a nudge&quot; to bring on the wet season rains in November.

==Characteristics==

Triangulum Australe is a small constellation bordered by Norma to the north, Circinus to the west, Apus to the south and Ara to the east. It lies near the Pointers (Alpha and Beta Centauri), with only Circinus in between. The constellation is located within the Milky Way, and hence has many stars. A roughly equilateral triangle, it is easily identifiable. Triangulum Australe lies too far south in the celestial southern hemisphere to be visible from Europe, yet is circumpolar from most of the southern hemisphere. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;TrA&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 18 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −60.26° and −70.51°. Triangulum Australe culminates each year at 9 p.m. on 23 August.

==Notable features==
===Bright stars===
In defining the constellation, Lacaille gave twelve stars Bayer designations of Alpha through to Lambda, with two close stars called Eta (one now known by its Henry Draper catalogue number), while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness. The three brightest stars, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, make up the triangle. Readily identified by its orange hue, Alpha Trianguli Australis is a bright giant star of spectral type K2 IIb-IIIa with an apparent magnitude of +1.91 that is the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. It lies away and has an absolute magnitude of −3.68 and is 5,500 times more luminous than the Sun. With a diameter 130 times that of the Sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at the centre of the Solar System. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation. Beta Trianguli Australis is a double star, the primary being a F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F1V, and an apparent magnitude of 2.85. Lying only away, it has an absolute magnitude of 2.38. Its companion, almost 3 arcminutes away, is a 13th-magnitude star which may or may not be in orbit around Beta. The remaining member of the triangle is Gamma Trianguli Australis with an apparent magnitude of 2.87. It is an A-type main sequence star of spectral class A1 V, which lies away.

Located outside the triangle near Beta, Delta Trianguli Australis is the fourth-brightest star at apparent magnitude +3.8. It is a yellow giant of spectral type G2Ib-II and lies away. Lying halfway between Beta and Gamma, Epsilon Trianguli Australis is an optical double. The brighter star, Epsilon Trianguli Australis A, is an orange K-type sub-giant of spectral type K1.5III with an apparent magnitude of +4.11. The optical companion, Epsilon Trianguli Australis B (or HD 138510), is a white main sequence star of spectral type A9IV/V which has an apparent magnitude of +9.32. Zeta Trianguli Australis appears as a star of apparent magnitude +4.91 and spectral class F9V, but is actually a spectroscopic binary with a near companion, probably a red dwarf. The pair orbit each other once every 13 days. A young star, its proper motion indicates it is a member of the Ursa Major moving group. Iota Trianguli Australis shows itself to be a multiple star system composed of a yellow and a white star when seen though a 7.5 cm telescope. The brighter star has a spectral type of F4IV and is a spectroscopic binary whose components are two yellow-white stars which orbit each other every 39.88 days. The primary is a Gamma Doradus variable, pulsating over a period of 1.45 days. The fainter star is not associated with the system, hence the system is an optical double. HD 147018 is a Sun-like star of apparent magnitude 8.3 and spectral type G9V, which was found to have two exoplanets, HD 147018 b and HD 147018 c, in 2009.

Of apparent magnitude 5.11, the yellow bright giant Kappa Trianguli Australis of spectral type G5IIa lies around distant from the Solar System. Eta Trianguli Australis (or Eta1 Trianguli Australis) is a Be star of spectral type B7IVe which is from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 5.89. Lacaille named a close-by star as Eta as well, which was inconsistently followed by Francis Baily, who used the name for the brighter or both stars in two different publications. Despite their faintness, Benjamin Gould upheld their Bayer designation as they were closer than 25 degrees to the south celestial pole. The second Eta is now designated as HD 150550. It is a variable star of average magnitude 6.53 and spectral type A1III.

===Variable stars===
Triangulum Australe contains several cepheid variables, all of which are too faint to be seen with the naked eye: R Trianguli Australis ranges from apparent magnitude 6.4 to 6.9 over a period of 3.389 days, S Trianguli Australis varies from magnitude 6.1 to 6.8 over 6.323 days, and U Trianguli Australis&#x27; brightness changes from 7.5 to 8.3 over 2.568 days. All three are yellow-white giants of spectral type F7Ib/II, F8II, and F8Ib/II respectively. RT Trianguli Australis is an unusual cepheid variable which shows strong absorption bands in molecular fragments of C2, ⫶CH and ⋅CN, and has been classified as a carbon cepheid of spectral type R. It varies between magnitudes 9.2 and 9.97 over 1.95 days. Lying nearby Gamma, X Trianguli Australis is a variable carbon star with an average magnitude of 5.63. It has two periods of around 385 and 455 days, and is of spectral type C5, 5(Nb).

EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, was first noticed in 1978 and officially described in 1980. It consists of a white dwarf and a donor star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. NR Trianguli Australis was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.

===Deep-sky objects===

Triangulum Australe has few deep-sky objects—one open cluster and a few planetary nebulae and faint galaxies. NGC 6025 is an open cluster with about 30 stars ranging from 7th to 9th magnitude. Located 3 degrees north and 1 east of Beta Trianguli Australis, it lies about away and is about in diameter. Its brightest star is MQ Trianguli Australis at apparent magnitude 7.1. NGC 5979, a planetary nebula of apparent magnitude 12.3, has a blue-green hue at higher magnifications, while Henize 2-138 is a smaller planetary nebula of magnitude 11.0. NGC 5938 is a remote spiral galaxy around 300 million light-years (90 megaparsecs) away. It is located 5 degrees south of Epsilon Trianguli Australis. ESO 69-6 is a pair of merging galaxies located about 600 million light-years (185 megaparsecs) away. Their contents have been dragged out in long tails by the interaction.

==In culture==
Triangulum Australe appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolizing the three states of the South Region.

It also appears as the only constellation used for the flag of secessionist movement The South Is My Country.

<text>Telescopium is a minor constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere, one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments. Its name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for telescope. Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould.

The brightest star in the constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen that are likely to be the result of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.

It had been hypothesized in 2020 that Telescopium would also host the first known visible star system with a black hole, QV Telescopii (HR 6819), however observations in 2022 indicated that this is a binary system of two main-sequence stars without a black hole instead.

==History==

Telescopium was introduced in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name &quot;le Telescope&quot;, depicting an aerial telescope, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to &quot;Telescopium&quot; by 1763.

The constellation was known by other names. It was called &quot;Tubus Astronomicus&quot; in the eighteenth century, during which time three constellations depicting telescopes were recognised—Tubus Herschelii Major between Gemini and Auriga and Tubus Herschelii Minor between Taurus and Orion, both of which had fallen out of use by the nineteenth century. Johann Bode called it the &quot;Astronomische Fernrohr&quot; in his 1805 &quot;Gestirne&quot; and kept its size, but later astronomers Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries. The much-reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations: Beta Telescopii became Eta Sagittarii, which it had been before Lacaille placed it in Telescopium, Gamma was placed in Scorpius and renamed G Scorpii by Gould, Theta Telescopii reverted to its old appellation of d Ophiuchi, and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis. Initially uncatalogued, the latter is now known as HR 6875. The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii—the open cluster Messier 7—was in what is now Scorpius, and Gould used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star, which he felt warranted a letter.

==Characteristics==

A small constellation, Telescopium is bordered by Sagittarius and Corona Australis to the north, Ara to the west, Pavo to the south, and Indus to the east, cornering on Microscopium to the northeast. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Tel&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a quadrilateral. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −45.09° and −56.98°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 33°N.

==Features==

===Stars===

Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 57 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. With a magnitude of 3.5, Alpha Telescopii is the brightest star in the constellation. It is a blue-white subgiant of spectral type B3IV which lies around 250 light-years away. It is radiating nearly 800 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity, and is estimated to be 5.2±0.4 times as massive and have 3.3±0.5 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. Close by Alpha Telescopii are the two blue-white stars sharing the designation of Delta Telescopii. Delta¹ Telescopii is of spectral type B6IV and apparent magnitude 4.9, while Delta² Telescopii is of spectral type B3III and magnitude 5.1. They form an optical double, as the stars are estimated to be around 710 and 1190 light-years away respectively. The faint (magnitude 12.23) Gliese 754, a red dwarf of spectral type M4.5V, is one of the nearest 100 stars to Earth at 19.3 light-years distant. Its eccentric orbit around the Galaxy indicates that it may have originated in the Milky Way&#x27;s thick disk.

At least four of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of spectral class K. The second brightest star in the constellation—at apparent magnitude 4.1—is Zeta Telescopii, an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III-IV. Around 1.53 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 512 times its luminosity. Located 127 light years away from Earth, it has been described as yellow or reddish in appearance. Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system: the brighter component, Epsilon Telescopii A, is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of +4.52, while the 13th magnitude companion, Epsilon Telescopii B, is 21 arcseconds away from the primary, and just visible with a 15 cm aperture telescope on a dark night. The system is 417 light-years away. Iota Telescopii and HD 169405—magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and K0.5III respectively—make up the quartet. They are around 370 and 497 light-years away from the Sun respectively. Another ageing star, Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type G9III and apparent magnitude of 5.18. Around 1.87 billion years old, this star of around 1.6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter. It is approximately 293 light-years from Earth, and is another optical double.

Xi Telescopii is an irregular variable star that ranges between magnitudes 4.89 and 4.94. Located 1079 light-years distant, it is a red giant of spectral type M2III that has a diameter around 5.6 times the Sun&#x27;s, and a luminosity around 2973 times that of the Sun. Another irregular variable, RX Telescopii is a red supergiant that varies between magnitudes 6.45 and 7.47, just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing conditions. BL Telescopii is an Algol-like eclipsing binary system that varies between apparent magnitudes 7.09 and 9.08 over a period of just over 778 days (2 years 48 days). The primary is a yellow supergiant that is itself intrinsically variable. Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9.6 to 16.5, RS Telescopii is a rare R Coronae Borealis variable—an extremely hydrogen-deficient supergiant thought to have arisen as the result of the merger of two white dwarfs; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012. The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by the star. As of 2012, four dimmings have been observed. PV Telescopii is a class B-type (blue) extreme helium star that is the prototype of a class of variables known as PV Telescopii variables. First discovered in 1952, it was found to have a very low level of hydrogen. One theory of its origin is that it is the result of a merger between a helium- and a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, the former will accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this will become an extreme helium star before cooling to become a white dwarf.
While RR Telescopii, also designated &quot;Nova Telescopii 1948&quot;, is often called a slow nova, it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6.0 in mid-1948. It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12. QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star, in this case the two are close enough to be tidally locked, facing one another. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it. This is due to the presence of the white dwarf&#x27;s strong magnetic field.

Although no star systems in Telescopium have confirmed planets, several have been found to have brown dwarf companions. A member of the 12-million-year-old Beta Pictoris moving group of stars that share a common proper motion through space, Eta Telescopii is a young white main sequence star of magnitude 5.0 and spectral type A0V. It has a debris disk and brown dwarf companion of spectral type M7V or M8V that is between 20 and 50 times as massive as Jupiter. The system is complex, as it has a common proper motion with (and is gravitationally bound to) the star HD 181327, which has its own debris disk. This latter star is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F6V of magnitude 7.0. PZ Telescopii is another young star with a debris disk and substellar brown dwarf companion, though at 24 million years of age appears too old to be part of the Beta Pictoris moving group. HD 191760 is a yellow subgiant—a star that is cooling and expanding off the main sequence—of spectral type G3IV/V. Estimated to be just over four billion years old, it is slightly (1.1 to 1.3 times) more massive as the Sun, 2.69 times as luminous, and has around 1.62 times its radius. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, it was found to have a brown dwarf around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average distance of 1.35 AU with a period of 505 days. This is an unusually close distance from the star, within a range that has been termed the brown-dwarf desert.
===Deep sky objects===
The Telescopium group is a group of twelve galaxies spanning three degrees in the northeastern part of the constellation, lying around 37 megaparsecs (120 million light-years) from our own galaxy. The brightest member is the elliptical galaxy NGC 6868, and to the west lies the spiral galaxy (or, perhaps, lenticular galaxy) NGC 6861. These are the brightest members of two respective subgroups within the galaxy group, and are heading toward a merger in the future.
The globular cluster NGC 6584 lies near Theta Arae and is 45,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is an Oosterhoff type I cluster, and contains at least 69 variable stars, most of which are RR Lyrae variables. The planetary nebula IC 4699 is of 13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii. IC 4889 is an elliptical galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.3, which can be found 2 degrees north-north-west of 5.3-magnitude Nu Telescopii. Observing it through a 40 cm telescope will reveal its central region and halo.
Occupying an area of around 4&#x27; × 2&#x27;, NGC 6845 is an interacting system of four galaxies—two spiral and two lenticular galaxies—that is estimated to be around 88 megaparsecs (287 million light-years) distant. SN 2008da was a type II supernova observed in one of the spiral galaxies, NGC 6845A, in June 2008. SN 1998bw was a luminous supernova observed in the spiral arm of the galaxy ESO184-G82 in April 1998, and is notable in that it is highly likely to be the source of the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425.

<doc id="30666" wikidata="Q205186" url="?curid=30666" title="Trivium">
<text>The trivium is the lower division of the seven liberal arts and comprises grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

The trivium is implicit in (&quot;On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot;) by Martianus Capella, but the term was not used until the Carolingian Renaissance, when it was coined in imitation of the earlier quadrivium. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in Plato&#x27;s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word &quot;trivium&quot; during the Middle Ages, but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in ancient Greece, by rhetoricians such as Isocrates. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the Classical education movement) and at the independent Oundle School in the United Kingdom.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word means &quot;the place where three roads meet&quot; ( + ); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the quadrivium, the upper (or &quot;further&quot;) division of the medieval education in the liberal arts, which consists of arithmetic (numbers as abstract concepts), geometry (numbers in space), music (numbers in time), and astronomy (numbers in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of classical antiquity.

== Description ==
Grammar teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student &quot;comes to terms&quot;, defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the law of identity: &quot;a tree is a tree, and not a cat&quot;.

Logic (also dialectic) is the &quot;mechanics&quot; of thought and of analysis, the process of composing sound arguments and identifying fallacious arguments and statements, and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted. Its aim is to calculate what is certainly true or false.
Rhetoric is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric). Its aim is to identify what is most probably true or false where logical certainty is not possible.

Aristotle defined rhetoric as &quot;the power of perceiving in every thing that which is capable of producing persuasion&quot;.

Sister Miriam Joseph, in &quot;The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric&quot; (2002), described the trivium as follows:

Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.
John Ayto wrote in the &quot;Dictionary of Word Origins&quot; (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven liberal arts; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word &quot;&quot; arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.

<text>The Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Holy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, also known as &quot;Holy Communion&quot; or &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;.

The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper. The four canonical gospels state that the Last Supper took place in the week of Passover, days after Jesus&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and before Jesus was crucified on Good Friday. During the meal, Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the apostles present, and foretells that before the next morning, Peter will thrice deny knowing him.

The three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to those present, saying &quot;This is my body given to you&quot;. The Gospel of John tells of Jesus washing the feet of the apostles, giving the new commandment &quot;to love one another as I have loved you&quot;, and includes the detailed Farewell Discourse by Jesus, calling the apostles who follow his teachings &quot;friends and not servants&quot;, as he prepares them for his departure.

Some scholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharistic traditions. Others see the account of the Last Supper as derived from 1st-century eucharistic practice as described by Paul in the mid-50s.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;Last Supper&quot; does not appear in the New Testament, but traditionally many Christians refer to such an event. The term &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; refers both to the biblical event and the act of &quot;Holy Communion&quot; and Eucharistic (&quot;thanksgiving&quot;) celebration within their liturgy. Evangelical Protestants also use the term &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;, but most do not use the terms &quot;Eucharist&quot; or the word &quot;Holy&quot; with the name &quot;Communion&quot;.

The Eastern Orthodox use the term &quot;Mystical Supper&quot; which refers both to the biblical event and the act of Eucharistic celebration within liturgy. The Russian Orthodox also use the term &quot;Secret Supper&quot; (, &quot;Taynaya vecherya&quot;).

==Scriptural basis==
The last meal that Jesus shared with his apostles is described in all four canonical Gospels as having taken place in the week of the Passover. This meal later became known as the Last Supper. The Last Supper was likely a retelling of the events of the last meal of Jesus among the early Christian community, and became a ritual which recounted that meal.

Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, which was likely written before the Gospels, includes a reference to the Last Supper but emphasizes the theological basis rather than giving a detailed description of the event or its background.

===Background and setting===
The overall narrative that is shared in all Gospel accounts that leads to the Last Supper is that after the triumphal entry into Jerusalem early in the week, and encounters with various people and the Jewish elders, Jesus and his disciples share a meal towards the end of the week. After the meal, Jesus is betrayed, arrested, tried, and then crucified.

Key events in the meal are the preparation of the disciples for the departure of Jesus, the predictions about the impending betrayal of Jesus, and the foretelling of the upcoming denial of Jesus by Apostle Peter.

===Prediction of Judas&#x27; betrayal===

In Matthew 26:24–25, Mark 14:18–21, Luke 22:21–23 and John 13:21–30, during the meal, Jesus predicted that one of the apostles present would betray him. Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each apostle&#x27;s assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present, and saying that there would be &quot;woe to the man who betrays the Son of man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.&quot;

In Matthew 26:23–25 and John 13:26–27, Judas is specifically identified as the traitor. In the Gospel of John, when asked about the traitor, Jesus states:

===Institution of the Eucharist===
The three Synoptic Gospel accounts describe the Last Supper as a Passover meal. Stéphane Saulnier argues they disagree with John, though Brant Pitre argues the Gospels can be reconciled in his &quot;Passover hypothesis&quot;, taking the Gospel of John&#x27;s allusions to the Passover lamb as applying to the seven-day festival rather than the meal. Each gives somewhat different versions of the order of the meal. In chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus prays thanks for the bread, divides it, and hands the pieces of bread to his disciples, saying &quot;Take, eat, this is my body.&quot; Later in the meal Jesus takes a cup of wine, offers another prayer, and gives it to those present, saying &quot;Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&#x27;s kingdom.&quot;

In chapter 22 of the Gospel of Luke, however, the wine is blessed and distributed before the bread, followed by the bread, then by a second, larger cup of wine, as well as somewhat different wordings. Additionally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples &quot;do this in remembrance of me.&quot; This event has been regarded by Christians of most denominations as the institution of the Eucharist. There is recorded celebration of the Eucharist by the early Christian community in Jerusalem.

The institution of the Eucharist is recorded in the three Synoptic Gospels and in Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians. As noted above, Jesus&#x27;s words differ slightly in each account. In addition, Luke 22:19b–20 is a disputed text which does not appear in some of the early manuscripts of Luke. Some scholars, therefore, believe that it is an interpolation, while others have argued that it is original.

A comparison of the accounts given in the Gospels and 1 Corinthians is shown in the table below, with text from the ASV. The disputed text from Luke 22:19b–20 is in .
Jesus&#x27; actions in sharing the bread and wine have been linked with Isaiah 53:12 which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in Exodus 24:8, Moses offered in order to seal a covenant with God. Some scholars interpret the description of Jesus&#x27; action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it.

Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread and wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that John 6:58–59 (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a Eucharistic nature and resonates with the &quot;words of institution&quot; used in the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.

===Prediction of Peter&#x27;s denial===

In Matthew 26:33–35, Mark 14:29–31, Luke 22:33–34 and John 13:36–8, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter will disown him three times before the rooster crows the next morning. The three Synoptic Gospels mention that after the arrest of Jesus, Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him. Peter then began to cry bitterly.

===Elements unique to the Gospel of John===
John 13 includes the account of the washing the feet of the Apostles by Jesus before the meal. In this episode, Apostle Peter objects and does not want to allow Jesus to wash his feet, but Jesus answers him, &quot;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me&quot;, after which Peter agrees.

In the Gospel of John, after the departure of Judas from the Last Supper, Jesus tells his remaining disciples that he will be with them for only a short time, then gives them a New Commandment, stating: &quot;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.&quot; Two similar statements also appear later in John 15:12: &quot;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you&quot;, and John 15:17: &quot;This is my command: Love each other.&quot;

At the Last Supper in the Gospel of John, Jesus gives an extended sermon to his disciples. This discourse resembles farewell speeches called testaments, in which a father or religious leader, often on the deathbed, leaves instructions for his children or followers.

This sermon is referred to as the Farewell Discourse of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian doctrine, particularly on the subject of Christology. John 17:1–26 is generally known as the &quot;Farewell Prayer&quot; or the &quot;High Priestly Prayer&quot;, given that it is an intercession for the coming Church. The prayer begins with Jesus&#x27;s petition for his glorification by the Father, given that completion of his work and continues to an intercession for the success of the works of his disciples and the community of his followers.

==Time and place==

===Date===
Historians estimate that the date of the crucifixion fell in the range AD 30–36. Isaac Newton and Colin Humphreys have ruled out the years 31, 32, 35, and 36 on astronomical grounds, leaving 7 April AD 30 and 3 April AD 33 as possible crucifixion dates. proposes narrowing down the date of the Last Supper as having occurred in the evening of Wednesday, 1 April AD 33, by revising Annie Jaubert&#x27;s double-Passover theory.

Historically, various attempts to reconcile the three synoptic accounts with John have been made, some of which are indicated in the Last Supper by Francis Mershman in the 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. The Maundy Thursday church tradition assumes that the Last Supper was held on the evening before the crucifixion day (although, strictly speaking, in no Gospel is it unequivocally said that this meal took place on the night before Jesus died).

A new approach to resolve this contrast was undertaken in the wake of the excavations at Qumran in the 1950s when Annie Jaubert argued that there were two Passover feast dates: while the official Jewish lunar calendar had Passover begin on a Friday evening in the year that Jesus died, a solar calendar was also used, for instance by the Essene community at Qumran, which always had the Passover feast begin on a Tuesday evening. According to Jaubert, Jesus would have celebrated the Passover on Tuesday, and the Jewish authorities three days later, on Friday.
Humphreys has disagreed with Jaubert&#x27;s proposal on the grounds that the Qumran solar Passover would always fall the official Jewish lunar Passover. He agrees with the approach of two Passover dates, and argues that the Last Supper took place on the evening of Wednesday 1 April 33, based on his recent discovery of the Essene, Samaritan, and Zealot calendar, which is based on Egyptian reckoning.

In a review of Humphreys&#x27; book, the Bible scholar William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which &quot;does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.&quot;

===Location===
According to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is today called The Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion, just outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, and is traditionally known as The Upper Room. This is based on the account in the Synoptic Gospels that states that Jesus had instructed two disciples (Luke 22:8 specifies that Jesus sent Peter and John) to go to &quot;the city&quot; to meet &quot;a man carrying a jar of water&quot;, who would lead them to a house, where they would find &quot;a large upper room furnished and ready&quot;. In this upper room they &quot;prepare the Passover&quot;.

No more specific indication of the location is given in the New Testament, and the &quot;city&quot; referred to may be a suburb of Jerusalem, such as Bethany, rather than Jerusalem itself.

A structure on Mount Zion in Jerusalem is currently called the Cenacle and is purported to be the location of the Last Supper. Bargil Pixner claims the original site is located beneath the current structure of the Cenacle on Mount Zion.

The traditional location is in an area that, according to archaeology, had a large Essene community, a point made by scholars who suspect a link between Jesus and the group.

Saint Mark&#x27;s Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the current cenaculum (crusader – 12th century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of 1st century Jerusalem were at least lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper story currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.

==Theology of the Last Supper==

Peter often displays amazement in feet washing depictions, as in John 13:8. St. Thomas Aquinas viewed The Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit as teachers and masters who provide lessons, at times by example. For Aquinas, the Last Supper and the Cross form the summit of the teaching that wisdom flows from intrinsic grace, rather than external power. For Aquinas, at the Last Supper Christ taught by example, showing the value of humility (as reflected in John&#x27;s foot washing narrative) and self-sacrifice, rather than by exhibiting external, miraculous powers.

Aquinas stated that based on John 15:15 (in the Farewell Discourse), in which Jesus said: &quot;No longer do I call you servants; ...but I have called you friends,&quot; those who are followers of Christ and partake in the sacrament of the Eucharist become his friends, as those gathered at the table of the Last Supper. For Aquinas, at the Last Supper Christ made the promise to be present in the sacrament of the Eucharist, and to be with those who partake in it, as he was with his disciples at the Last Supper.

John Calvin believed only in the two sacraments of Baptism and the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; (i.e., Eucharist). Thus, his analysis of the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper was an important part of his entire theology. Calvin related the Synoptic Gospel accounts of the Last Supper with the Bread of Life Discourse in John 6:35 that states: &quot;I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry.&quot;

Calvin also believed that the acts of Jesus at the Last Supper should be followed as an example, stating that just as Jesus gave thanks to the Father before breaking the bread, those who go to the Lord&#x27;s table to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist must give thanks for the &quot;boundless love of God&quot; and celebrate the sacrament with both joy and thanksgiving.

==Remembrances==

The institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary, the First Station of a so-called New Way of the Cross and by Christians as the &quot;inauguration of the New Covenant&quot;, mentioned by the prophet Jeremiah, fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus &quot;took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, &#x27;Take; this is my body.&#x27; And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, &#x27;This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the Passover ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become &quot;our Passover, sacrificed for us&quot;, and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.

These meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the Mass in the Catholic Church, and as the Divine Liturgy in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name &quot;Eucharist&quot; is from the Greek word &quot;εὐχαριστία&quot; (eucharistia) which means &quot;thanksgiving&quot;.

Early Christianity observed a ritual meal known as the &quot;agape feast&quot; These &quot;love feasts&quot; were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the Lord&#x27;s Day, to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.

==Passover parallels==

Since the late 20th century, with growing consciousness of the Jewish character of the early church and the improvement of Jewish-Christian relations, it became common among some evangelical groups to borrow Seder customs, like Haggadahs, and incorporated them in new rituals meant to mimic the Last Supper. As the earliest elements in the current Passover Seder (&quot;a fortiori&quot; the full-fledged ritual, which is first recorded in full only in the ninth century) are a rabbinic enactment instituted in remembrance of the Temple, which was still standing during the Last Supper, the Seder in Jesus&#x27; time would have been celebrated quite differently, however.

== In Islam ==
The fifth chapter in the Quran, &quot;Al-Ma&#x27;ida&quot; (the table) contains a reference to a meal (Sura 5:114) with a table sent down from God to ʿĪsá (i.e., Jesus) and the apostles (Hawariyyin). However, there is nothing in Sura 5:114 to indicate that Jesus was celebrating that meal regarding his impending death, especially as the Quran states that Jesus was never crucified to begin with. Thus, although Sura 5:114 refers to &quot;a meal&quot;, there is no indication that it is the Last Supper. However, some scholars believe that Jesus&#x27; manner of speech during which the table was sent down suggests that it was an affirmation of the apostles&#x27; resolves and to strengthen their faiths as the impending trial was about to befall them.

==Historicity==
According to John P. Meier and E. P. Sanders, Jesus having a final meal with his disciples is almost beyond dispute among scholars, and belongs to the framework of the narrative of Jesus&#x27; life. I. Howard Marshall states that any doubt about the historicity of the Last Supper should be abandoned.

Some Jesus Seminar scholars consider the Last Supper to have derived not from Jesus&#x27; last supper with the disciples but rather from the gentile tradition of memorial dinners for the dead. In their view, the Last Supper is a tradition associated mainly with the gentile churches that Paul established, rather than with the earlier, Jewish congregations. Such views echo that of 20th century Protestant theologian Rudolf Bultmann, who also believed the Eucharist to have originated in Gentile Christianity.

On the other hand, an increasing number of scholars have reasserted the historicity of the institution of the Eucharist, reinterpreting it from a Jewish eschatological point of view: according to Lutheran theologian Joachim Jeremias, for example, the Last Supper should be seen as a climax of a series of Messianic meals held by Jesus in anticipation of a new Exodus. Similar views are echoed in more recent works by Catholic biblical scholars such as John P. Meier and Brant Pitre, and by Anglican scholar N.T. Wright.

==Artistic depictions==

The Last Supper has been a popular subject in Christian art. Such depictions date back to early Christianity and can be seen in the Catacombs of Rome. Byzantine artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal. By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a favorite topic in Italian art.

There are three major themes in the depictions of the Last Supper: the first is the dramatic and dynamic depiction of Jesus&#x27;s announcement of his betrayal. The second is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the Eucharist. The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical. The third major theme is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left the supper. The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure. There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.

The best known depiction of the Last Supper is Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art, due to its high level of harmony.

Among other representations, Tintoretto&#x27;s depiction is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table, and Salvador Dali&#x27;s depiction combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of Surrealism.

== Music ==
The Lutheran Passion hymn &quot;Da der Herr Christ zu Tische saß&quot; (&quot;When the Lord Christ sat at the table&quot;) derives from a depiction of the Last Supper.

<text>The Tunguska event was a large explosion of between 3 and 50 megatons that occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in Yeniseysk Governorate (now Krasnoyarsk Krai), Russia, on the morning of 30 June 1908. The explosion over the sparsely populated East Siberian taiga felled an estimated 80 million trees over an area of of forest, and eyewitness accounts suggest up to three people may have died.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAO/NASA – ADS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion is attributed to a meteor air burst, the atmospheric explosion of a stony asteroid about wide. The asteroid approached from the east-south-east, probably with a relatively high speed of about . Though the incident is classified as an impact event, the object is thought to have exploded at an altitude of rather than hitting the Earth&#x27;s surface, leaving no impact crater.

The Tunguska event is the largest impact event on Earth in recorded history, though much larger impacts occurred in prehistoric times. An explosion of this magnitude would be capable of destroying a large metropolitan area. The event has been depicted in numerous works of fiction. The equivalent Torino scale rating for the impactor is 8: a certain collision with local destruction.

==Description==

On 30 June 1908 N.S. (cited as 17 June 1908 O.S. before the implementation of the Soviet calendar in 1918), at around 7:17 am local time, Evenki natives and Russian settlers in the hills northwest of Lake Baikal observed a bluish light, nearly as bright as the Sun, moving across the sky and leaving a thin trail. Closer to the horizon, there was a flash producing a billowing cloud, followed by a pillar of fire that cast a red light on the landscape. The pillar split in two and faded, turning to black. About ten minutes later, there was a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported that the source of the sound moved from the east to the north of them. The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away.

The explosion registered at seismic stations across Eurasia, and air waves from the blast were detected in Germany, Denmark, Croatia, and the United Kingdom – and as far away as Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and Washington, D.C. It is estimated that, in some places, the resulting shock wave was equivalent to an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale. 

Over the next few days, night skies in Asia and Europe were aglow. There are contemporaneous reports of brightly lit photographs being successfully taken at midnight (without the aid of flashbulbs) in Sweden and Scotland. It has been theorized that this sustained glowing effect was due to light passing through high-altitude ice particles that had formed at extremely low temperatures as a result of the explosion – a phenomenon that decades later was reproduced by Space Shuttles. In the United States, a Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory program at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California observed a months-long decrease in atmospheric transparency consistent with an increase in suspended dust particles.

===Selected eyewitness reports===

Though the region of Siberia in which the explosion occurred was very sparsely populated in 1908, there are accounts of the event from eyewitnesses, and regional newspapers reported the event shortly after it occurred.

==Scientific investigation==
Since the 1908 event, an estimated 1,000 scholarly papers (most in Russian) have been published about the Tunguska explosion. Owing to the site&#x27;s remoteness and the limited instrumentation available at the time of the event, modern scientific interpretations of its cause and magnitude have relied chiefly on damage assessments and geological studies conducted many years after the event. Estimates of its energy have ranged from .

Only more than a decade after the event did any scientific analysis of the region take place, in part due to the area&#x27;s isolation and significant political upheaval affecting Russia in the 1910s. In 1921, the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik led a team to the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin to conduct a survey for the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Although they never visited the central blast area, the many local accounts of the event led Kulik to believe that a giant meteorite impact had caused the event. Upon returning, he persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the suspected impact zone, based on the prospect of salvaging meteoric iron.

Kulik led a scientific expedition to the Tunguska blast site in 1927. He hired local Evenki hunters to guide his team to the centre of the blast area, where they expected to find an impact crater. To their surprise, there was no crater at ground zero. Instead they found a zone, roughly across, where the trees were scorched and devoid of branches, but still standing upright. Trees farther from the centre had been partly scorched and knocked down away from the centre, creating a large radial pattern of downed trees.

In the 1960s, it was established that the zone of levelled forest occupied an area of , its shape resembling a gigantic spread-eagled butterfly with a &quot;wingspan&quot; of and a &quot;body length&quot; of . Upon closer examination, Kulik found holes that he erroneously concluded were meteorite holes; he did not have the means at that time to excavate the holes.

During the next 10 years, there were three more expeditions to the area. Kulik found several dozen little &quot;pothole&quot; bogs, each in diameter, that he thought might be meteoric craters. After a laborious exercise in draining one of these bogs (the so-called &quot;Suslov&#x27;s crater&quot;, in diameter), he found an old tree stump on the bottom, ruling out the possibility that it was a meteoric crater. In 1938, Kulik arranged for an aerial photographic survey of the area covering the central part of the leveled forest (). The original negatives of these aerial photographs (1,500 negatives, each ) were burned in 1975 by order of Yevgeny Krinov, then Chairman of the Committee on Meteorites of the USSR Academy of Sciences, as part of an initiative to dispose of increasingly flammable nitrate film. Positive prints were preserved for further study in Tomsk.

Expeditions sent to the area in the 1950s and 1960s found microscopic silicate and magnetite spheres in siftings of the soil. Similar spheres were predicted to exist in the felled trees, although they could not be detected by contemporary means. Later expeditions did identify such spheres in the resin of the trees. Chemical analysis showed that the spheres contained high proportions of nickel relative to iron, which is also found in meteorites, leading to the conclusion they were of extraterrestrial origin. The concentration of the spheres in different regions of the soil was also found to be consistent with the expected distribution of debris from a meteor air burst. Later studies of the spheres found unusual ratios of numerous other metals relative to the surrounding environment, which was taken as further evidence of their extraterrestrial origin.

Chemical analysis of peat bogs from the area also revealed numerous anomalies considered consistent with an impact event. The isotopic signatures of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen at the layer of the bogs corresponding to 1908 were found to be inconsistent with the isotopic ratios measured in the adjacent layers, and this abnormality was not found in bogs outside the area. The region of the bogs showing these anomalous signatures also contains an unusually high proportion of iridium, similar to the iridium layer found in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. These unusual proportions are believed to result from debris from the falling body that deposited in the bogs. The nitrogen is believed to have been deposited as acid rain, a suspected fallout from the explosion.

Other scientists disagree: &quot;Some papers report that hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions with signatures similar to those of CI and CM carbonaceous chondrites were found in Tunguska peat layers dating from the TE (Kolesnikov et al. 1999, 2003) and that iridium anomalies were also observed (Hou et al. 1998, 2004). Measurements performed in other laboratories have not confirmed these results (Rocchia et al. 1990; Tositti et al. 2006).&quot;

Researcher John Anfinogenov has suggested that a boulder found at the event site, known as John&#x27;s stone, is a remnant of the meteorite, but oxygen isotope analysis of the quartzite suggests that it is of hydrothermal origin, and probably related to Permian-Triassic Siberian Traps magmatism.

In 2013, a team of researchers published the results of an analysis of micro-samples from a peat bog near the centre of the affected area, which show fragments that may be of extraterrestrial origin.

===Earth impactor model===

The leading scientific explanation for the explosion is a meteor air burst by an asteroid above the Earth&#x27;s surface.

Meteoroids enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from outer space every day, travelling at a speed of at least , the escape velocity of the Earth. The heat generated by compression of air in front of the body (ram pressure) as it travels through the atmosphere is immense and most meteoroids burn up or explode before they reach the ground. Early estimates of the energy of the Tunguska air burst ranged from to 30 megatons of TNT (130 PJ), depending on the exact height of the burst as estimated when the scaling laws from the effects of nuclear weapons are employed. More recent calculations that include the effect of the object&#x27;s momentum find that more of the energy was focused downward than would be the case from a nuclear explosion and estimate that the air burst had an energy range from 3 to 5 megatons of TNT (13 to 21 PJ). The 15-megaton (Mt) estimate represents an energy about 1,000 times greater than that of the Trinity nuclear test, and roughly equal to that of the United States&#x27; Castle Bravo nuclear test in 1954 (which measured 15.2 Mt) and one third that of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Tsar Bomba test in 1961. A 2019 paper suggests the explosive power of the Tunguska event may have been around 20–30 megatons.

Since the second half of the 20th century, close monitoring of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere through infrasound and satellite observation has shown that asteroid air bursts with energies comparable to those of nuclear weapons routinely occur, although Tunguska-sized events, on the order of 5–15 megatons, are much rarer. Eugene Shoemaker estimated that 20-kiloton events occur annually and that Tunguska-sized events occur about once every 300 years. More recent estimates place Tunguska-sized events at about once every thousand years, with 5-kiloton air bursts averaging about once per year. Most of these are thought to be caused by asteroid impactors, as opposed to mechanically weaker cometary materials, based on their typical penetration depths into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The largest asteroid air burst observed with modern instrumentation was the 500-kiloton Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, which shattered windows and produced meteorites.

==== Glancing impact hypothesis ====
In 2020, a group of Russian scientists used a range of computer models to calculate the passage of asteroids with diameters of 200, 100, and 50 metres at oblique angles across Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. They used a range of assumptions about the object&#x27;s composition as if it was made of iron, rock, or ice. The model that most closely matched the observed event was an iron asteroid up to 200 metres in diameter, travelling at 11.2 km per second, that glanced off the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and returned into solar orbit.

====Blast pattern====
The explosion&#x27;s effect on the trees near the explosion&#x27;s hypocentre was similar to the effects of the conventional Operation Blowdown. These effects are caused by the blast wave produced by large air-burst explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, but remain standing upright, while trees farther away are knocked over because the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.

Soviet experiments performed in the mid-1960s, with model forests (made of matches on wire stakes) and small explosive charges slid downward on wires, produced butterfly-shaped blast patterns similar to the pattern found at the Tunguska site. The experiments suggested that the object had approached at an angle of roughly 30 degrees from the ground and 115 degrees from north and had exploded in midair.

====Asteroid or comet====
In 1930, the British meteorologist and mathematician F. J. W. Whipple suggested that the Tunguska body was a small comet. A comet is composed of dust and volatiles, such as water ice and frozen gases, and could have been completely vaporised by the impact with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, leaving no obvious traces. The comet hypothesis was further supported by the glowing skies (or &quot;skyglows&quot; or &quot;bright nights&quot;) observed across Eurasia for several evenings after the impact, which are possibly explained by dust and ice that had been dispersed from the comet&#x27;s tail across the upper atmosphere. The cometary hypothesis gained a general acceptance among Soviet Tunguska investigators by the 1960s.

In 1978, Slovak astronomer Ľubor Kresák suggested that the body was a fragment of Comet Encke, a periodic comet with a period of just over three years that stays entirely within Jupiter&#x27;s orbit. It is also responsible for the Beta Taurids, an annual meteor shower with a maximum activity around 28–29 June. The Tunguska event coincided with that shower&#x27;s peak activity, the Tunguska object&#x27;s approximate trajectory is consistent with what would be expected from a fragment of Comet Encke, and a hypothetical risk corridor has now been calculated demonstrating that if the impactor had arrived a few minutes earlier it would have exploded over the US or Canada. It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground. Military satellites have been observing these explosions for decades. In 2019 astronomers searched for hypothesized asteroids ~100 metres in diameter from the Taurid swarm between 5–11 July, and 21 July – 10 August. , there have been no reports of discoveries of any such objects.

In 1983, astronomer Zdeněk Sekanina published a paper criticising the comet hypothesis. He pointed out that a body composed of cometary material, travelling through the atmosphere along such a shallow trajectory, ought to have disintegrated, whereas the Tunguska body apparently remained intact into the lower atmosphere. Sekanina also argued that the evidence pointed to a dense rocky object, probably of asteroidal origin. This hypothesis was further boosted in 2001, when Farinella, Foschini, &quot;et al.&quot; released a study calculating the probabilities based on orbital modelling extracted from the atmospheric trajectories of the Tunguska object. They concluded with a probability of 83% that the object moved on an asteroidal path originating from the asteroid belt, rather than on a cometary one (probability of 17%). Proponents of the comet hypothesis have suggested that the object was an extinct comet with a stony mantle that allowed it to penetrate the atmosphere.

The chief difficulty in the asteroid hypothesis is that a stony object should have produced a large crater where it struck the ground, but no such crater has been found. It has been hypothesised that the asteroid&#x27;s passage through the atmosphere caused pressures and temperatures to build up to a point where the asteroid abruptly disintegrated in a huge explosion. The destruction would have to have been so complete that no remnants of substantial size survived, and the material scattered into the upper atmosphere during the explosion would have caused the skyglows. Models published in 1993 suggested that the stony body would have been about across, with physical properties somewhere between an ordinary chondrite and a carbonaceous chondrite. Typical carbonaceous chondrite substance tends to be dissolved with water rather quickly unless it is frozen.

Christopher Chyba and others have proposed a process whereby a stony asteroid could have exhibited the Tunguska impactor&#x27;s behaviour. Their models show that when the forces opposing a body&#x27;s descent become greater than the cohesive force holding it together, it blows apart, releasing nearly all its energy at once. The result is no crater, with damage distributed over a fairly wide radius, and all the damage resulting from the thermal energy the blast releases.

During the 1990s, Italian researchers, coordinated by the physicist Giuseppe Longo from the University of Bologna, extracted resin from the core of the trees in the area of impact to examine trapped particles that were present during the 1908 event. They found high levels of material commonly found in rocky asteroids and rarely found in comets.

Kelly &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) contend that the impact was caused by a comet because of the sightings of noctilucent clouds following the impact, a phenomenon caused by massive amounts of water vapour in the upper atmosphere. They compared the noctilucent cloud phenomenon to the exhaust plume from NASA&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot; Space Shuttle. A team of Russian researchers led by Edward Drobyshevski in 2009 suggested that the near-Earth asteroid may be a possible candidate for the Tunguska object&#x27;s parent body as the asteroid made a close approach of from Earth on 27 June 1908, three days before the Tunguska impact. The team suspected that &#x27;s orbit likely fits with the Tunguska object&#x27;s modelled orbit, even with the effects of weak non-gravitational forces. In 2013, analysis of fragments from the Tunguska site by a joint US-European team was consistent with an iron meteorite.
The February 2013 Chelyabinsk bolide event provided ample data for scientists to create new models for the Tunguska event. Researchers used data from both Tunguska and Chelyabinsk to perform a statistical study of over 50 million combinations of bolide and entry properties that could produce Tunguska-scale damage when breaking apart or exploding at similar altitudes. Some models focused on combinations of properties which created scenarios with similar effects to the tree-fall pattern as well as the atmospheric and seismic pressure waves of Tunguska. Four different computer models produced similar results; they concluded that the likeliest candidate for the Tunguska impactor was a stony body between in diameter, entering the atmosphere at roughly , exploding at altitude, and releasing explosive energy equivalent to between 10 and 30 megatons. This is similar to the blast energy equivalent of the 1980 volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens. The researchers also concluded impactors of this size hit the Earth only at an average interval scale of millennia.

==== Lake Cheko ====

In June 2007, scientists from the University of Bologna identified a lake in the Tunguska region as a possible impact crater from the event. They do not dispute that the Tunguska body exploded in midair, but believe that a fragment survived the explosion and struck the ground. Lake Cheko is a small bowl-shaped lake about north-northwest of the hypocentre.

The hypothesis has been disputed by other impact crater specialists. A 1961 investigation had dismissed a modern origin of Lake Cheko, saying that the presence of metres-thick silt deposits on the lake bed suggests an age of at least 5,000 years, but more recent research suggests that only a metre or so of the sediment layer on the lake bed is &quot;normal lacustrine sedimentation&quot;, a depth consistent with an age of about 100 years. Acoustic-echo soundings of the lake floor support the hypothesis that the Tunguska event formed the lake. The soundings revealed a conical shape for the lake bed, which is consistent with an impact crater. Magnetic readings indicate a possible metre-sized chunk of rock below the lake&#x27;s deepest point that may be a fragment of the colliding body. Finally, the lake&#x27;s long axis points to the Tunguska explosion&#x27;s hypocentre, about away. Work is still being done at Lake Cheko to determine its origins.

The main points of the study are that:
In 2017, new research by Russian scientists pointed to a rejection of the theory that the Tunguska event created Lake Cheko. They used soil research to determine that the lake is 280 years old or even much older; in any case clearly older than the Tunguska event. In analyzing soils from the bottom of Lake Cheko, they identified a layer of radionuclide contamination from mid-20th century nuclear testing at Novaya Zemlya. The depth of this layer gave an average annual sedimentation rate of between 3.6 and 4.6 mm a year. These sedimentation values are less than half of the 1 cm/year calculated by Gasperini &quot;et al.&quot; in their 2009 publication on their analysis of the core they took from Lake Cheko in 1999. The Russian scientists in 2017 counted at least 280 such annual varves in the 1260 mm long core sample pulled from the bottom of the lake, representing an age older than the Tunguska event.

Additionally, there are problems with impact physics: It is unlikely that a stony meteorite in the right size range would have the mechanical strength necessary to survive atmospheric passage intact while retaining a velocity high enough to excavate a crater that size on reaching the ground.

===Geophysical hypotheses===
Though scientific consensus is that the Tunguska explosion was caused by the impact of a small asteroid, there are some dissenters. Astrophysicist Wolfgang Kundt has proposed that the Tunguska event was caused by the release and subsequent explosion of 10 million tons of natural gas from within the Earth&#x27;s crust. The basic idea is that natural gas leaked out of the crust and then rose to its equal-density height in the atmosphere; from there, it drifted downwind, in a sort of wick, which eventually found an ignition source such as lightning. Once the gas was ignited, the fire streaked along the wick, and then down to the source of the leak in the ground, whereupon there was an explosion.

The similar verneshot hypothesis has also been proposed as a possible cause of the Tunguska event. Other research has proposed a geophysical mechanism for the event.

==Similar event==
A smaller air burst occurred over a populated area on 15 February 2013, at Chelyabinsk in the Ural district of Russia. The exploding meteoroid was determined to have been an asteroid that measured about across. It had an estimated initial mass of 11,000 tonnes and exploded with an energy release of approximately 500 kilotons. The air burst inflicted over 1,200 injuries, mainly from broken glass falling from windows shattered by its shock wave.

==In fiction==

In fiction, many alternative explanations for the event appear. The notion that it was caused by an alien spaceship is a popular one that gained prominence following the publication of Russian science fiction writer Alexander Kazantsev&#x27;s 1946 short story &quot;Explosion&quot;. The idea that the cause was the impact of a micro black hole has also appeared.

<doc id="30674" wikidata="Q3182893" url="?curid=30674" title="The Terrorist (1998 film)">
<text>The Terrorist () is an Indian Tamil-language film directed by Santosh Sivan. The film portrays a period in the life of a 19-year-old woman, Malli (Ayesha Dharker), sent to assassinate a leader in South Asia through a suicide bombing. It stars Dharker, K. Krishna and Sonu Sisupal. Released in 1998, the film was shot in 15 days, with natural lighting, on a shoestring budget of ₹25 lakh (worth ₹2.2 crore in 2021 prices).

The film won a number of awards at international film festivals. Actor John Malkovich first saw the film at the 1998 Cairo International Film Festival and subsequently adopted the film as a kind of post-facto executive producer (the reissued film&#x27;s titles read &quot;John Malkovich Presents&quot;). Critic Roger Ebert has included the film in his series of &quot;Great Movies&quot; reviews. Ebert concludes his review with the following line: &quot;Every time I see the film, I feel a great sadness, that a human imagination could be so limited that it sees its own extinction as a victory.&quot; The film that proved his mastery over the visual language was &quot;The Terrorist&quot; which has become a textbook of sorts for visual communication students, with scenes from the movie being used by Michael Chapman, Martin Scorsese’s cinematographer, to explain the tenets of cinematography during workshops. According to film critic Roger Ebert, it was a film ‘scripted by the camera’. Says Sivan: &quot;One day I got a call from Samuel Lee Jackson who was interested to cast the heroine of &quot;The Terrorist&quot;, Ayesha, in a Hollywood film.&quot;

== Plot ==
The movie focuses on a 19-year-old woman named Malli (based on Kalaivani Rajaratnam), who joined a terrorist organisation at a very young age after her brother was killed in the cause. She volunteers herself to become a suicide bomber in an assassination mission. As the plot moves forward, she discovers the importance of human life, after realising she is pregnant. This causes Malli to question her determination to complete the mission.

== Cast ==
* Ayesha Dharker as Malli
* Vishnu Vardhan as Thyagu
* Bhanu Prakash as Perumal
* K. Krishna as Lover
* Sonu Sisupal as Leader
* Anuradha

== Inspiration ==
While campaigning in the 1991 Indian general election, former prime minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a female suicide bomber, Kalaivani Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam was affiliated with the Black Tigers, a cadre of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

Film critic Roger Ebert noted that Santosh Sivan &quot;was inspired by the assassination of the Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. But in the movie, no country is identified, no name is attached to her target, and no ideology or religion is attached to her movement.&quot;

<text>A tool is an object that can extend an individual&#x27;s ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.

Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for the preparation of food, hunting, the manufacture of weapons, and the working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts and crafts such as pottery, along with the construction of housing, businesses, infrastructure, and transportation. The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools. The introduction of widespread automation in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor.

By extension, concepts that support systematic or investigative thought are often referred to as &quot;tools&quot; or &quot;toolkits&quot;.

== Definition ==
While a common-sense understanding of the meaning of tool is widespread, several formal definitions have been proposed.

In 1981, Benjamin Beck published a widely used definition of tool use. This has been modified to:Other, briefer definitions have been proposed:

== History ==


Anthropologists believe that the use of tools was an important step in the evolution of mankind. Because tools are used extensively by both humans (Homo sapiens) and wild chimpanzees, it is widely assumed that the first routine use of tools took place prior to the divergence between the two ape species. These early tools, however, were likely made of perishable materials such as sticks, or consisted of unmodified stones that cannot be distinguished from other stones as tools.

Stone artifacts date back to about 2.5 million years ago. However, a 2010 study suggests the hominin species &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements. This finding pushes back the earliest known use of stone tools among hominins to about 3.4 million years ago. Finds of actual tools date back at least 2.6 million years in Ethiopia. One of the earliest distinguishable stone tool forms is the hand axe.

Up until recently, weapons found in digs were the only tools of &quot;early man&quot; that were studied and given importance. Now, more tools are recognized as culturally and historically relevant. As well as hunting, other activities required tools such as preparing food, &quot;...nutting, leatherworking, grain harvesting and woodworking...&quot; Included in this group are &quot;flake stone tools&quot;.

Tools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the food chain; by inventing tools, they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not, such as using a spear or bow to kill prey, since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals&#x27; skins. &quot;Man the hunter&quot; as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned. Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites, it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators&#x27; carcasses rather than killing their own food.

=== Timeline of ancient tool development ===
Many tools were made in prehistory or in the early centuries of recorded history, but archaeological evidence can provide dates of development and use.
* Olduvai stone technology (Oldowan) 2.5 million years ago (scrapers; to butcher dead animals)
* Huts, 2 million years ago.

Several of the six classic simple machines (wheel and axle, lever, pulley, inclined plane, wedge, and screw) were invented in Mesopotamia. The wheel and axle mechanism first appeared with the potter&#x27;s wheel, invented in what is now Iraq during the 5th millennium BC. This led to the invention of the wheeled vehicle in Mesopotamia during the early 4th millennium BC. The lever was used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia , and then in ancient Egyptian technology . The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC.

The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911–609 BC). The Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screw pumps, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the &#x27;lost wax&#x27; process. The Jerwan Aqueduct ( is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete. The earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills date back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC, specifically in the Persian Empire before 350 BC, in the regions of Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Persia (Iran). This pioneering use of water power constituted perhaps the first use of mechanical energy.

Mechanical devices experienced a major expansion in their use in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome with the systematic employment of new energy sources, especially waterwheels. Their use expanded through the Dark Ages with the addition of windmills.

=== Machine tools ===
Machine tools occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the Industrial Revolution. Pre-industrial machinery was built by various craftsmenmillwrights built water and windmills, carpenters made wooden framing, and smiths and turners made metal parts. Wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity, and the various joints tended to rack (work loose) over time. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, machines with metal parts and frames became more common.

Other important uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners, such as machine screws, bolts, and nuts. There was also the need for precision in making parts. Precision would allow better working machinery, interchangeability of parts, and standardization of threaded fasteners. The demand for metal parts led to the development of several machine tools. They have their origins in the tools developed in the 18th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch-produce small mechanisms. Before the advent of machine tools, metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers, files, scrapers, saws, and chisels. Consequently, the use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum. Hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve. With their inherent precision, machine tools enabled the economical production of interchangeable parts.

Examples of machine tools include:
* Broaching machine
* Drill press
* Gear shaper
* Hobbing machine
* Hone
* Lathe
* Screw machines
* Milling machine
* Shear (sheet metal)
* Shaper
* Bandsaw
* Planer
* Stewart platform mills
* Grinding machines
Advocates of nanotechnology expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size.

==Types==
One can classify tools according to their basic functions:
* Cutting and edge tools, such as the knife, sickle, scythe, hatchet, and axe, are wedge-shaped implements that produce a shearing force along a narrow face. Ideally, the edge of the tool needs to be harder than the material being cut or the blade will become dulled with repeated use. But even resilient tools will require periodic sharpening, which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge. Other examples of cutting tools include gouges and drill bits.
* Moving tools move large and tiny items. Many are levers which give the user a mechanical advantage. Examples of force-concentrating tools include the hammer which moves a nail or the maul which moves a stake. These operate by applying physical compression to a surface. In the case of the screwdriver, the force is rotational and called torque. By contrast, an anvil concentrates force on an object being hammered by &quot;preventing&quot; it from moving away when struck. Writing implements deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge. Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with pliers, a glove, a wrench, etc. likewise move items by applying torque (rotational force).
* Tools that enact chemical changes, including temperature and ignition, such as lighters and blowtorches.
* Guiding, measuring and perception tools include the ruler, glasses, square, sensors, straightedge, theodolite, microscope, monitor, clock, phone, printer
* Shaping tools, such as molds, jigs, trowels.
* Fastening tools, such as welders, soldering irons, rivet guns, nail guns, or glue guns.
* Information and data manipulation tools, such as computers, IDE, spreadsheets

Some tools may be combinations of other tools. An alarm-clock is for example a combination of a measuring tool (the clock) and a perception tool (the alarm). This enables the alarm-clock to be a tool that falls outside of all the categories mentioned above.

There is some debate on whether to consider protective gear items as tools, because they do not directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work. Personal protective equipment includes such items as gloves, safety glasses, ear defenders and biohazard suits.

== Function ==
=== Tool substitution ===
Often, by design or coincidence, a tool may share key functional attributes with one or more other tools. In this case, some tools can substitute for other tools, either as a makeshift solution or as a matter of practical efficiency. &quot;One tool does it all&quot; is a motto of some importance for workers who cannot practically carry every specialized tool to the location of every work task, such as a carpenter who does not necessarily work in a shop all day and needs to do jobs in a customer&#x27;s house. Tool substitution may be divided broadly into two classes: substitution &quot;by-design&quot;, or &quot;multi-purpose&quot;, and substitution as makeshift. Substitution &quot;by-design&quot; would be tools that are designed specifically to accomplish multiple tasks using only that one tool.

Substitution is &quot;makeshift&quot; when human ingenuity comes into play and a tool is used for an unintended purpose, such as using a long screwdriver to separate a cars control arm from a ball joint, instead of using a tuning fork. In many cases, the designed secondary functions of tools are not widely known. For example, many wood-cutting hand saws integrate a square by incorporating a specially-shaped handle, that allows 90° and 45° angles to be marked by aligning the appropriate part of the handle with an edge, and scribing along the back edge of the saw. The latter is illustrated by the saying &quot;All tools can be used as hammers&quot;. Nearly all tools can be used to function as a hammer, even though few tools are intentionally designed for it and even fewer work as well as the original.

Tools are often used to substitute for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices. In many cases a cheap tool could be used to occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could be replaced with pliers. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screwdriver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a rotary tool would be considered the substitution &quot;by-design&quot;, or &quot;multi-purpose&quot;. This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. &quot;Multi-purpose&quot; tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so one could say that a power drill is a &quot;multi-purpose&quot; tool.

===Multi-use tools===

A multi-tool is a hand tool that incorporates several tools into a single, portable device; the Swiss Army knife represents one of the earliest examples. Other tools have a primary purpose but also incorporate other functionality – for example, lineman&#x27;s pliers incorporate a gripper and cutter and are often used as a hammer; and some hand saws incorporate a square in the right-angle between the blade&#x27;s dull edge and the saw&#x27;s handle. This would also be the category of &quot;multi-purpose&quot; tools, since they are also multiple tools in one (multi-use and multi-purpose can be used interchangeably – compare hand axe). These types of tools were specifically made to catch the eye of many different craftsman who traveled to do their work. To these workers these types of tools were revolutionary because they were one tool or one device that could do several different things. With this new revolution of tools, the traveling craftsman would not have to carry so many tools with them to job sites, in that their space would be limited to the vehicle or to the beast of burden they were driving. Multi-use tools solve the problem of having to deal with many different tools.

==Use by other animals==
Tool use by animals is a phenomenon in which an animal uses any kind of tool in order to achieve a goal such as acquiring food and water, grooming, defense, communication, recreation or construction. Originally thought to be a skill possessed only by humans, some tool use requires a sophisticated level of cognition. There is considerable discussion about the definition of what constitutes a tool and therefore which behaviours can be considered true examples of tool use. Observation has confirmed that a number of species can use tools including monkeys, apes, elephants, several birds, and sea otters. Now the unique relationship of humans with tools is considered to be that we are the only species that uses tools to make &quot;other&quot; tools.
 Primates are well known for using tools for hunting or gathering food and water, cover for rain, and self-defense. Chimpanzees have often been the object of study in regard to their usage of tools, most famously by Jane Goodall; these animals are closely related to humans. Wild tool-use in other primates, especially among apes and monkeys, is considered relatively common, though its full extent remains poorly documented, as many primates in the wild are mainly only observed distantly or briefly when in their natural environments and living without human influence. Some novel tool-use by primates may arise in a localized or isolated manner within certain unique primate cultures, being transmitted and practiced among socially connected primates through cultural learning. Many famous researchers, such as Charles Darwin in his book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, mentioned tool-use in monkeys (such as baboons).

Among other mammals, both wild and captive elephants are known to create tools using their trunks and feet, mainly for swatting flies, scratching, plugging up waterholes that they have dug (to close them up again so the water does not evaporate), and reaching food that is out of reach. Many other social mammals particularly have been observed engaging in tool-use. A group of dolphins in Shark Bay uses sea sponges to protect their beaks while foraging. Sea otters will use rocks or other hard objects to dislodge food (such as abalone) and break open shellfish. Many or most mammals of the order Carnivora have been observed using tools, often to trap or break open the shells of prey, as well as for scratching.

Corvids (such as crows, ravens and rooks) are well known for their large brains (among birds) and tool use. New Caledonian crows are among the only animals that create their own tools. They mainly manufacture probes out of twigs and wood (and sometimes metal wire) to catch or impale larvae. Tool use in some birds may be best exemplified in nest intricacy. Tailorbirds manufacture &#x27;pouches&#x27; to make their nests in. Some birds, such as weaver birds, build complex nests utilizing a diverse array of objects and materials, many of which are specifically chosen by certain birds for their unique qualities. Woodpecker finches insert twigs into trees in order to catch or impale larvae. Parrots may use tools to wedge nuts so that they can crack open the outer shell of nuts without launching away the inner contents. Some birds take advantage of human activity, such as carrion crows in Japan, which drop nuts in front of cars to crack them open.

Several species of fish use tools to hunt and crack open shellfish, extract food that is out of reach, or clear an area for nesting. Among cephalopods (and perhaps uniquely or to an extent unobserved among invertebrates), octopuses are known to use tools relatively frequently, such as gathering coconut shells to create a shelter or using rocks to create barriers.

==Non-material usage==
By extension, concepts which support systematic or investigative thought are often referred to as &quot;tools&quot;, for example Vanessa Dye refers to &quot;tools of reflection&quot; and &quot;tools to help sharpen your professional practice&quot; for trainee teachers, illustrating the connection between physical and conceptual tools by quoting the French scientist Claude Bernaud: Similarly, a decision-making process &quot;developed to help women and their partners make confident and informed decisions when planning where to give birth&quot; is described as a &quot;Birth Choice tool&quot;: and the idea of a &quot;toolkit&quot; is used by the International Labour Organization to describe a set of processes applicable to improving global labour relations.

A telephone is a communication tool that interfaces between two people engaged in conversation at one level. It also interfaces between each user and the communication network at another level. It is in the domain of media and communications technology that a counter-intuitive aspect of our relationships with our tools first began to gain popular recognition. John M. Culkin famously said, &quot;We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us&quot;. One set of scholars expanded on this to say: &quot;Humans create inspiring and empowering technologies but also are influenced, augmented, manipulated, and even imprisoned by technology&quot;.

<text>The New York Times (NYT) is an American daily newspaper based in New York City. &quot;The New York Times&quot; covers domestic, national, and international news, and publishes opinion pieces, investigative reports, and reviews. As one of the longest-running newspapers in the United States, the &quot;Times&quot; serves as one of the country&#x27;s newspapers of record. , &quot;The New York Times&quot; had 9.13 million total and 8.83 million online subscribers, both by significant margins the highest numbers for any newspaper in the United States; the total also included 296,330 print subscribers, making the &quot;Times&quot; the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States, following &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, also based in New York City. &quot;The New York Times&quot; is published by the New York Times Company; since 1896, the company has been chaired by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, whose current chairman and the paper&#x27;s publisher is A. G. Sulzberger. The &quot;Times&quot; is headquartered at The New York Times Building in Midtown Manhattan.

The &quot;Times&quot; was founded as the conservative &quot;New-York Daily Times&quot; in 1851, and came to national recognition in the 1870s with its aggressive coverage of corrupt politician William M. Tweed. Following the Panic of 1893, &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot; publisher Adolph Ochs gained a controlling interest in the company. In 1935, Ochs was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who began a push into European news. Sulzberger&#x27;s son-in-law Arthur Ochs became publisher in 1963, adapting to a changing newspaper industry and introducing radical changes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; was involved in the landmark 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, which restricted the ability of public officials to sue the media for defamation.

In 1971, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, an internal Department of Defense document detailing the United States&#x27;s historical involvement in the Vietnam War, despite pushback from then-president Richard Nixon. In the landmark decision &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment guaranteed the right to publish the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. In the 1980s, the &quot;Times&quot; began a two-decade progression to digital technology and launched nytimes.com in 1996. In the 21st century, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has shifted its publication online amid the global decline of newspapers.

The &quot;Times&quot; has expanded to several other publications, including &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. In addition, the paper has produced several television series, podcasts—including &quot;The Daily&quot;—and games through &quot;The New York Times Games&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has been involved in several controversies in its history. The &quot;Times&quot; maintains several regional bureaus staffed with journalists across six continents, and has received 137 Pulitzer Prizes as of 2023, the most of any publication, among other accolades.
==History==
===1851–1896===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; was established in 1851 by &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; journalists Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones. The &quot;Times&quot; experienced significant circulation, particularly among conservatives; &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; publisher Horace Greeley praised the &quot;New-York Daily Times&quot;. During the American Civil War, &quot;Times&quot; correspondents gathered information directly from Confederate states. In 1869, Jones inherited the paper from Raymond, who had changed its name to &quot;The New-York Times&quot;. Under Jones, the &quot;Times&quot; began to publish a series of articles criticizing Tammany Hall political boss William M. Tweed, despite vehement opposition from other New York newspapers. In 1871, &quot;The New-York Times&quot; published Tammany Hall&#x27;s accounting books; Tweed was tried in 1873 and sentenced to twelve years in prison. The &quot;Times&quot; earned national recognition for its coverage of Tweed. In 1891, Jones died, creating a management imbroglio in which his children had insufficient business acumen to inherit the company and his will prevented an acquisition of the &quot;Times&quot;. Editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller, editorial editor Edward Cary, and correspondent George F. Spinney established a company to manage &quot;The New-York Times&quot;, but faced financial difficulties during the Panic of 1893.

===1896–1945===

In August 1896, &quot;Chattanooga Times&quot; publisher Adolph Ochs acquired &quot;The New-York Times&quot;, implementing significant alterations to the newspaper&#x27;s structure. Ochs established the &quot;Times&quot; as a merchant&#x27;s newspaper and removed the hyphen from the newspaper&#x27;s name. In 1905, &quot;The New York Times&quot; opened Times Tower, marking expansion. The &quot;Times&quot; experienced a political realignment in the 1910s amid several disagreements within the Republican Party. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, as other newspapers were cautious about bulletins circulated by the Associated Press. Through managing editor Carr Van Anda, the &quot;Times&quot; focused on scientific advancements, reporting on Albert Einstein&#x27;s then-unknown theory of general relativity and becoming involved in the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. In April 1935, Ochs died, leaving his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger as publisher. The Great Depression forced Sulzberger to reduce &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s operations, and developments in the New York newspaper landscape resulted in the formation of larger newspapers, such as the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;. In contrast to Ochs, Sulzberger encouraged wirephotography.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; extensively covered World War II through large headlines, reporting on exclusive stories such as the Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état. Amid the war, Sulzberger began expanding the &quot;Times&quot;″s operations further, acquiring WQXR-FM in 1944—the first non-&quot;Times&quot; investment since the Jones era—and established a fashion show in Times Hall. Despite reductions as a result of conscription, &quot;The New York Times&quot; retained the largest journalism staff of any newspaper. The &quot;Times&quot;″s print edition became available internationally during the war through the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service; &quot;The New York Times Overseas Weekly&quot; later became available in Japan through &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; and in Germany through the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;. The international edition would develop into a separate newspaper. Journalist William L. Laurence publicized the atomic bomb race between the United States and Germany, resulting in the Federal Bureau of Investigation seizing copies of the &quot;Times&quot;. The United States government recruited Laurence to document the Manhattan Project in April 1945. Laurence became the only witness of the Manhattan Project, a detail realized by employees of &quot;The New York Times&quot; following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

===1945–1998===

Following World War II, &quot;The New York Times&quot; continued to expand. The &quot;Times&quot; was subject to investigations from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, a McCarthyist subcommittee that investigated purported communism from within press institutions. Arthur Hays Sulzberger&#x27;s decision to dismiss a copyreader who had pleaded the Fifth Amendment drew ire from within the &quot;Times&quot; and from external organizations. In April 1961, Sulzberger resigned, appointing his son-in-law, The New York Times Company president Orvil Dryfoos. Under Dryfoos, &quot;The New York Times&quot; established a newspaper based in Los Angeles. In 1962, the implementation of automated printing presses in response to increasing costs mounted fears over technological unemployment. The New York Typographical Union staged a strike in December, altering the media consumption of New Yorkers. The strike left New York with three remaining newspapers—the &quot;Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;—by its conclusion in March 1963. In May, Dryfoos died of a heart ailment. Following weeks of ambiguity, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger became &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s publisher.

Technological advancements leveraged by newspapers such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and improvements in coverage from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; necessitated adaptations to nascent computing. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published &quot;Heed Their Rising Voices&quot; in 1960, a full-page advertisement purchased by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. criticizing law enforcement in Montgomery, Alabama for their response to the civil rights movement. Montgomery Public Safety commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the &quot;Times&quot; for defamation. In &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the verdict in Alabama county court and the Supreme Court of Alabama violated the First Amendment. The decision is considered to be landmark. After financial losses, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ended its international edition, acquiring a stake in the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot;, forming the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; initially published the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, facing opposition from then-president Richard Nixon. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s favor in &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; (1971), allowing the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to publish the papers.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; remained cautious in its initial coverage of the Watergate scandal. As Congress began investigating the scandal, the &quot;Times&quot; furthered its coverage, publishing details on the Huston Plan, alleged wiretapping of reporters and officials, and testimony from James W. McCord Jr. that the Committee for the Re-Election of the President paid the conspirators off. The exodus of readers to suburban New York newspapers, such as &quot;Newsday&quot; and Gannett papers, adversely affected &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s circulation. Contemporary newspapers balked at additional sections; &quot;Time&quot; devoted a cover for its criticism and &quot;New York&quot; wrote that the &quot;Times&quot; was engaging in &quot;middle-class self-absorption&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot; were the subject of a strike in 1978, allowing emerging newspapers to leverage halted coverage. The &quot;Times&quot; deliberately avoided coverage of the AIDS epidemic, running its first front-page article in May 1983. Max Frankel&#x27;s editorial coverage of the epidemic, with mentions of anal intercourse, contrasted with then-executive editor A. M. Rosenthal&#x27;s puritan approach, intentionally avoiding descriptions of the luridity of gay venues.

Following years of waning interest in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sulzberger resigned in January 1992, appointing his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., as publisher. The Internet represented a generational shift within the &quot;Times&quot;; Sulzberger, who negotiated The New York Times Company&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1993, derided the Internet, while his son expressed antithetical views. @times appeared on America Online&#x27;s website in May 1994 as an extension of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, featuring news articles, film reviews, sports news, and business articles. Despite opposition, several employees of the &quot;Times&quot; had begun to access the Internet. The online success of publications that traditionally co-existed with the &quot;Times&quot;—such as America Online, Yahoo, and CNN—and the expansion of websites such as Monster.com and Craigslist that threatened &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s classified advertisement model increased efforts to develop a website. nytimes.com debuted on January 19 and was formally announced three days later. The &quot;Times&quot; published domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski&#x27;s essay &quot;Industrial Society and Its Future&quot; in 1995, contributing to his arrest after his brother David recognized the essay&#x27;s penmanship.

===1998–present===

Following the establishment of nytimes.com, &quot;The New York Times&quot; retained its journalistic hesitancy under executive editor Joseph Lelyveld, refusing to publish an article reporting on the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal from Drudge Report. nytimes.com editors conflicted with print editors on several occasions, including wrongfully naming security guard Richard Jewell as the suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and covering the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in greater detail than the print edition. The New York Times Electronic Media Company was adversely affected by the dot-com crash. The &quot;Times&quot; extensively covered the September 11 attacks. The following day&#x27;s print issue contained sixty-six articles, the work of over three hundred dispatched reporters. Journalist Judith Miller was the recipient of a package containing a white powder during the 2001 anthrax attacks, furthering anxiety within &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In September 2002, Miller and military correspondent Michael R. Gordon wrote an article for the &quot;Times&quot; claiming that Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes. The article was cited by then-president George W. Bush to claim that Iraq was constructing weapons of mass destruction; the theoretical use of aluminum tubes to produce nuclear material was speculation. In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, beginning the Iraq War.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; attracted controversy after thirty-six articles from journalist Jayson Blair were discovered to be plagiarized. Criticism over then-executive editor Howell Raines and then-managing editor Gerald M. Boyd mounted following the scandal, culminating in a town hall in which a deputy editor criticized Raines for failing to question Blair&#x27;s sources in article he wrote on the D.C. sniper attacks. In June 2003, Raines and Boyd resigned. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. appointed Bill Keller as executive editor. Miller continued to report on the Iraq War as a journalistic embed covering the country&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction program. Keller and then-Washington bureau chief Jill Abramson unsuccessfully attempted to subside criticism. Conservative media criticized the &quot;Times&quot; over its coverage of missing explosives from the Al Qa&#x27;qaa weapons facility. An article in December 2005 disclosing warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency contributed to further criticism from the George W. Bush administration and the Senate&#x27;s refusal to renew the Patriot Act. In the Plame affair, a Central Intelligence Agency inquiry found that Miller had become aware of Valerie Plame&#x27;s identity through then-vice president Dick Cheney&#x27;s chief of staff Scooter Libby, resulting in Miller&#x27;s resignation.

During the Great Recession, &quot;The New York Times&quot; suffered significant fiscal difficulties as a consequence of the subprime mortgage crisis and a decline in classified advertising. Exacerbated by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s revitalization of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; through his acquisition of Dow Jones &amp; Company, The New York Times Company began enacting measures to reduce the newsroom budget. The company was forced to borrow $250 million (equivalent to $ million in ) from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and fired over one hundred employees by 2010. nytimes.com&#x27;s coverage of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, resulting in the resignation of then-New York governor Eliot Spitzer, furthered the legitimacy of the website as a journalistic medium. The &quot;Times&quot;″s economic downturn renewed discussions of an online paywall; &quot;The New York Times&quot; implemented a paywall in March 2011. Abramson succeeded Keller, continuing her characteristic investigations into corporate and government malfeasance into the &quot;Times&quot;″s coverage. Following conflicts with newly appointed chief executive Mark Thompson&#x27;s ambitions, Abramson was dismissed by Sulzberger Jr., who named Dean Baquet as her replacement.

Leading up to the 2016 presidential election, &quot;The New York Times&quot; elevated the Hillary Clinton email controversy into a national issue. Donald Trump&#x27;s upset victory contributed to an increase in subscriptions to the &quot;Times&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; experienced unprecedented indignation from Trump, who referred to publications such as the &quot;Times&quot; as &quot;enemies of the people&quot; at the Conservative Political Action Conference and tweeted his disdain for the newspaper and CNN. In October 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article by journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey alleging that dozens of women had accused film producer and The Weinstein Company co-chairman Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. The investigation resulted in Weinstein&#x27;s resignation and conviction, precipitated the Weinstein effect, and served as a catalyst for the #MeToo movement. The New York Times Company vacated the public editor position and eliminated the copy desk in November. Sulzberger Jr. announced his resignation in December 2017, appointing his son, A. G. Sulzberger, as publisher.

Trump&#x27;s relationship—equally diplomatic and negative—marked Sulzberger&#x27;s tenure. In September 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published &quot;I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration&quot;, an anonymous essay by a self-described Trump administration official later revealed to be Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor. The animosity—which extended to nearly three hundred instances of Trump disparaging the &quot;Times&quot; by May 2019—culminated in Trump ordering federal agencies to cancel their subscriptions to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in October 2019. Trump&#x27;s tax returns have been the subject of three separate investigations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the &quot;Times&quot; began implementing data services and graphs. On May 23, 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s front page solely featured &quot;U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, An Incalculable Loss&quot;, a subset of the 100,000 people in the United States who died of COVID-19, the first time that the &quot;Times&quot;″s front page lacked images since they were introduced. Since 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has focused on broader diversification, developing online games and producing television series. The New York Times Company acquired &quot;The Athletic&quot; in January 2022.

==Organization==
===Management===
Since 1896, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has been published by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, having previously been published by Henry Jarvis Raymond until 1869 and by George Jones until 1896. Adolph Ochs published the &quot;Times&quot; until his death in 1935, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Sulzberger was publisher until 1961 and was succeeded by Orvil Dryfoos, his son-in-law, who served in the position until his death in 1963. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger succeeded Dryfoos until his resignation in 1992. His son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., served as publisher until 2018. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s current publisher is A. G. Sulzberger, Sulzberger Jr.&#x27;s son. As of 2023, the &quot;Times&quot;″s executive editor is Joseph Kahn and the paper&#x27;s managing editors are Marc Lacey and Carolyn Ryan, having been appointed in June 2022. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s deputy managing editors are Sam Dolnick, Monica Drake, and Steve Duenes, and the paper&#x27;s assistant managing editors are Matthew Ericson, Jonathan Galinsky, Hannah Poferl, Sam Sifton, Karron Skog, and Michael Slackman.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; is owned by The New York Times Company, a publicly traded company. The New York Times Company, in addition to the &quot;Times&quot;, owns &quot;Wirecutter&quot;, &quot;The Athletic&quot;, The New York Times Cooking, and The New York Times Games, and acquired Serial Productions and Audm. The New York Times Company holds undisclosed minority investments in multiple other businesses, and formerly owned &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and several radio and television stations. The New York Times Company is majority-owned by the Ochs-Sulzberger family through elevated shares in the company&#x27;s dual-class stock structure held largely in a trust, in effect since the 1950s; as of 2022, the family holds ninety-five percent of The New York Times Company&#x27;s Class B shares, allowing it to elect seventy percent of the company&#x27;s board of directors. Class A shareholders have restrictive voting rights. As of 2023, The New York Times Company&#x27;s chief executive is Meredith Kopit Levien, the company&#x27;s former chief operating officer who was appointed in September 2020.

===Journalists===

As of March 2023, The New York Times Company employs 5,800 individuals, including 1,700 journalists according to deputy managing editor Sam Dolnick. Journalists for &quot;The New York Times&quot; may not run for public office, provide financial support to political candidates or causes, endorse candidates, or demonstrate public support for causes or movements. Journalists are subject to the guidelines established in &quot;Ethical Journalism&quot; and &quot;Guidelines on Integrity&quot;. According to the former, &quot;Times&quot; journalists must abstain from using sources with a personal relationship to them and must not accept reimbursements or inducements from individuals who may be written about in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, with exceptions for gifts of nominal value. The latter requires attribution and exact quotations, though exceptions are made for linguistic anomalies. Staff writers are expected to ensure the veracity of all written claims, but may delegate researching obscure facts to the research desk. In March 2021, the &quot;Times&quot; established a committee to avoid journalistic conflicts of interest with work written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, following columnist David Brooks&#x27;s resignation from the Aspen Institute for his undisclosed work on the initiative Weave.

===Editorial board===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial board was established in 1896 by Adolph Ochs. With the opinion department, the editorial board is independent of the newsroom. Then-editor-in-chief Charles Ransom Miller served as opinion editor from 1883 until his death in 1922. Rollo Ogden succeeded Miller until his death in 1937. From 1937 to 1938, John Huston Finley served as opinion editor; in a prearranged plan, Charles Merz succeeded Finley. Merz served in the position until his retirement in 1961. John Bertram Oakes served as opinion editor from 1961 to 1976, when then-publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger appointed Max Frankel. Frankel served in the position until 1986, when he was appointed as executive editor. Jack Rosenthal was the opinion editor from 1986 to 1993. Howell Raines succeeded Rosenthal until 2001, when he was made executive editor. Gail Collins succeeded Raines until her resignation in 2006. From 2007 to 2016, Andrew Rosenthal was the opinion editor. James Bennet succeeded Rosenthal until his resignation in 2020. , the editorial board comprises thirteen opinion writers. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s opinion editor is Kathleen Kingsbury and the deputy opinion editor is Patrick Healy.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s editorial board was initially opposed to liberal beliefs, opposing women&#x27;s suffrage in 1900 and 1914. The editorial board began to espouse progressive beliefs during Oakes&#x27; tenure, conflicting with the Ochs-Sulzberger family, of which Oakes was a member as Adolph Ochs&#x27;s nephew; in 1976, Oakes publicly disagreed with Sulzberger&#x27;s endorsement of Daniel Patrick Moynihan over Bella Abzug in the 1976 Senate Democratic primaries in a letter sent from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Under Rosenthal, the editorial board took positions supporting assault weapons legislation and the legalization of marijuana, but publicly criticized the Obama administration over its portrayal of terrorism. In presidential elections, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has endorsed a total of twelve Republican candidates and thirty-two Democratic candidates, and has endorsed the Democrat in every election since 1960. With the exception of Wendell Willkie, Republicans endorsed by the &quot;Times&quot; have won the presidency. In 2016, the editorial board issued an anti-endorsement against Donald Trump for the first time in its history. In February 2020, the editorial board reduced its presence from several editorials each day to occasional editorials for events deemed particularly significant. Since August 2024, the board no longer endorses candidates in local or congressional races in New York.

===Unionization===

Since 1940, editorial, media, and technology workers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; have been represented by the New York Times Guild. The Times Guild, along with the Times Tech Guild, are represented by the NewsGuild-CWA. In 1940, Arthur Hays Sulzberger was called upon by the National Labor Relations Board amid accusations that he had discouraged Guild membership in the &quot;Times&quot;. Over the next few years, the Guild would ratify several contracts, expanding to editorial and news staff in 1942 and maintenance workers in 1943. The New York Times Guild has walked out several times in its history, including for six and a half hours in 1981 and in 2017, when copy editors and reporters walked out at lunchtime in response to the elimination of the copy desk. On December 7, 2022, the union held a one-day strike, the first interruption to &quot;The New York Times&quot; since 1978. The New York Times Guild reached an agreement in May 2023 to increase minimum salaries for employees and a retroactive bonus. The Times Tech Guild is the largest technology union with collective bargaining rights in the United States. The guild held a second strike beginning on November 4, 2024, threatening the &quot;Times&quot;″s coverage of the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Content==
===Circulation===
As of August 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has 10.8 million subscribers, with 10.2 million online subscribers and 600,000 print subscribers, the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States behind &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The New York Times Company intends to have fifteen million subscribers by 2027. The &quot;Times&quot;″s shift towards subscription-based revenue with the debut of an online paywall in 2011 contributed to subscription revenue exceeding advertising revenue the following year, furthered by the 2016 presidential election and Donald Trump. In 2022, &quot;Vox&quot; wrote that &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s subscribers skew &quot;older, richer, whiter, and more liberal&quot;; to reflect the general population of the United States, the &quot;Times&quot; has attempted to alter its audience by acquiring &quot;The Athletic&quot;, investing in verticals such as &quot;The New York Times Games&quot;, and beginning a marketing campaign showing diverse subscribers to the &quot;Times&quot;. The New York Times Company chief executive Meredith Kopit Levien stated that the average age of subscribers has remained constant.

===Newsletters===
In October 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; began publishing &quot;DealBook&quot;, a financial newsletter edited by Andrew Ross Sorkin. The &quot;Times&quot; had intended to publish the newsletter in September, but delayed its debut following the September 11 attacks. A website for &quot;DealBook&quot; was established in March 2006. &quot;The New York Times&quot; began shifting towards &quot;DealBook&quot; as part of the newspaper&#x27;s financial coverage in November 2010 with a renewed website and a presence in the &quot;Times&quot;″s print edition. In 2011, the &quot;Times&quot; began hosting the DealBook Summit, an annual conference hosted by Sorkin. During the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;The New York Times&quot; hosted the DealBook Online Summit in 2020 and 2021. The 2022 DealBook Summit featured—among other speakers—former vice president Mike Pence and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, culminating in an interview with former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried; FTX had filed for bankruptcy several weeks prior. The 2023 DealBook Summit&#x27;s speakers included vice president Kamala Harris, Israeli president Isaac Herzog, and businessman Elon Musk.

In June 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; licensed the political blog &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; in a three-year agreement. The blog, written by Nate Silver, had garnered attention during the 2008 presidential election for predicting the elections in forty-nine of fifty states. &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; appeared on nytimes.com in August. According to Silver, several offers were made for the blog; Silver wrote that a merger of unequals must allow for editorial sovereignty and resources from the acquirer, comparing himself to Groucho Marx. According to &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; drew as much as a fifth of the traffic to nytimes.com during the 2012 presidential election. In July 2013, &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; was sold to ESPN. In an article following Silver&#x27;s exit, public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that he was disruptive to the &quot;Times&quot;″s culture for his perspective on probability-based predictions and scorn for polling—having stated that punditry is &quot;fundamentally useless&quot;, comparing him to Billy Beane, who implemented sabermetrics in baseball. According to Sullivan, his work was criticized by several notable political journalists.

&quot;The New Republic&quot; obtained a memo in November 2013 revealing then-Washington bureau chief David Leonhardt&#x27;s ambitions to establish a data-driven newsletter with presidential historian Michael Beschloss, graphic designer Amanda Cox, economist Justin Wolfers, and &quot;The New Republic&quot; journalist Nate Cohn. By March, Leonhardt had amassed fifteen employees from within &quot;The New York Times&quot;; the newsletter&#x27;s staff included individuals who had created the &quot;Times&quot;″s dialect quiz, fourth down analyzer, and a calculator for determining buying or renting a home. &quot;The Upshot&quot; debuted in April 2014. &quot;Fast Company&quot; reviewed an article about Illinois Secure Choice—a state-funded retirement saving system—as &quot;neither a terse news item, nor a formal financial advice column, nor a politically charged response to economic policy&quot;, citing its informal and neutral tone. &quot;The Upshot&quot; developed &quot;the needle&quot; for the 2016 presidential election and 2020 presidential elections, a thermometer dial displaying the probability of a candidate winning. In January 2016, Cox was named editor of &quot;The Upshot&quot;. Kevin Quealy was named editor in June 2022.

===Political positions===
According to an internal readership poll conducted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019, eighty-four percent of readers identified as liberal.

===Crossword===

In February 1942, &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword debuted in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;; according to Richard Shepard, the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 convinced then-publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger of the necessity of a crossword.

===Cooking===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; has published recipes since the 1850s and has had a separate food section since the 1940s. In 1961, restaurant critic Craig Claiborne published &quot;The New York Times Cookbook&quot;, an unauthorized cookbook that drew from the &quot;Times&quot;″s recipes. Since 2010, former food editor Amanda Hesser has published &quot;The Essential New York Times Cookbook&quot;, a compendium of recipes from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Innovation Report&quot; in 2014 revealed that the &quot;Times&quot; had attempted to establish a cooking website since 1998, but faced difficulties with the absence of a defined data structure. In September 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; introduced NYT Cooking, an application and website. Edited by food editor Sam Sifton, the &quot;Times&quot;″s cooking website features 21,000 recipes as of 2022. NYT Cooking features videos as part of an effort by Sifton to hire two former &quot;Tasty&quot; employees from BuzzFeed. In August 2023, NYT Cooking added personalized recommendations through the cosine similarity of text embeddings of recipe titles. The website also features no-recipe recipes, a concept proposed by Sifton.

In May 2016, The New York Times Company announced a partnership with startup Chef&#x27;d to form a meal delivery service that would deliver ingredients from The New York Times Cooking recipes to subscribers; Chef&#x27;d shut down in July 2018 after failing to accrue capital and secure financing. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported in September 2022 that the &quot;Times&quot; would expand its delivery options to cooking kits curated by chefs such as Nina Compton, Chintan Pandya, and Naoko Takei Moore. That month, the staff of NYT Cooking went on tour with Compton, Pandya, and Moore in Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York City, culminating in a food festival. In addition, &quot;The New York Times&quot; offered its own wine club originally operated by the Global Wine Company. The New York Times Wine Club was established in August 2009, during a dramatic decrease in advertising revenue. By 2021, the wine club was managed by Lot18, a company that provides proprietary labels. Lot18 managed the Williams Sonoma Wine Club and its own wine club Tasting Room.

===Archives===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; archives its articles in a basement annex beneath its building known as &quot;the morgue&quot;, a venture started by managing editor Carr Van Anda in 1907. The morgue comprises news clippings, a pictures library, and the &quot;Times&quot;″s book and periodicals library. As of 2014, it is the largest library of any media company, dating back to 1851. In November 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; partnered with Google to digitize the Archival Library. Additionally, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has maintained a virtual microfilm reader known as TimesMachine since 2014. The service launched with archives from 1851 to 1980; in 2016, TimesMachine expanded to include archives from 1981 to 2002. The &quot;Times&quot; built a pipeline to take in TIFF images, article metadata in XML and an INI file of Cartesian geometry describing the boundaries of the page, and convert it into a PNG of image tiles and JSON containing the information in the XML and INI files. The image tiles are generated using GDAL and displayed using Leaflet, using data from a content delivery network. The &quot;Times&quot; ran optical character recognition on the articles using Tesseract and shingled and fuzzy string matched the result.

===Content management system===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; uses a proprietary content management system known as Scoop for its online content and the Microsoft Word-based content management system CCI for its print content. Scoop was developed in 2008 to serve as a secondary content management system for editors working in CCI to publish their content on the &quot;Times&quot;″s website; as part of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s online endeavors, editors now write their content in Scoop and send their work to CCI for print publication. Since its introduction, Scoop has superseded several processes within the &quot;Times&quot;, including print edition planning and collaboration, and features tools such as multimedia integration, notifications, content tagging, and drafts. &quot;The New York Times&quot; uses private articles for high-profile opinion pieces, such as those written by Russian president Vladimir Putin and actress Angelina Jolie, and for high-level investigations. In January 2012, the &quot;Times&quot; released Integrated Content Editor (ICE), a revision tracking tool for WordPress and TinyMCE. ICE is integrated within the &quot;Times&quot;″s workflow by providing a unified text editor for print and online editors, reducing the divide between print and online operations.

By 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; began developing a new authoring tool to its content management system known as Oak, in an attempt to further the &quot;Times&quot;″s visual efforts in articles and reduce the discrepancy between the mediums in print and online articles. The system reduces the input of editors and supports additional visual mediums in an editor that resembles the appearance of the article. Oak is based on ProseMirror, a JavaScript rich-text editor toolkit, and retains the revision tracking and commenting functionalities of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s previous systems. Additionally, Oak supports predefined article headers. In 2019, Oak was updated to support collaborative editing using Firebase to update editors&#x27;s cursor status. Several Google Cloud Functions and Google Cloud Tasks allow articles to be previewed as they will be printed, and the &quot;Times&quot;″s primary MySQL database is regularly updated to update editors on the article status.

==Style and design==
===Style guide===

Since 1895, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has maintained a manual of style in several forms. &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; was published on the &quot;Times&quot;″s intranet in 1999.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; uses honorifics when referring to individuals. With the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;″s removal of honorifics in 2000 and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s omission of courtesy titles in May 2023, the &quot;Times&quot; is the only national newspaper that continues to use honorifics. According to former copy editor Merrill Perlman, &quot;The New York Times&quot; continues to use honorifics as a &quot;sign of civility&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot;″s use of courtesy titles led to an apocryphal rumor that the paper had referred to singer Meat Loaf as &quot;Mr. Loaf&quot;. Several exceptions have been made; the former sports section and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; do not use honorifics. A leaked memo following the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011 revealed that editors were given a last-minute instruction to omit the honorific from Osama bin Laden&#x27;s name, consistent with deceased figures of historic significance, such as Adolf Hitler, Napoleon, and Vladimir Lenin. &quot;The New York Times&quot; uses academic and military titles for individuals prominently serving in that position. In 1986, the &quot;Times&quot; began to use Ms., and introduced the gender-neutral title Mx. in 2015. &quot;The New York Times&quot; uses initials when a subject has expressed a preference, such as Donald Trump.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; maintains a strict but not absolute obscenity policy, including phrases. In a review of the Canadian hardcore punk band Fucked Up, music critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote that the band&#x27;s name—entirely rendered in asterisks—would not be printed in the &quot;Times&quot; &quot;unless an American president, or someone similar, says it by mistake&quot;; &quot;The New York Times&quot; did not repeat then-vice president Dick Cheney&#x27;s use of &quot;fuck&quot; against then-senator Patrick Leahy in 2004 or then-vice president Joe Biden&#x27;s remarks that the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 was a &quot;big fucking deal&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot;″s profanity policy has been tested by former president Donald Trump. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published Trump&#x27;s &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape in October 2016, containing the words &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;pussy&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot;, and &quot;tits&quot;, the first time the publication had published an expletive on its front page, and repeated an explicit phrase for fellatio stated by then-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci in July 2017. &quot;The New York Times&quot; omitted Trump&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;shithole countries&quot; from its headline in favor of &quot;vulgar language&quot; in January 2018. The &quot;Times&quot; banned certain words, such as &quot;bitch&quot;, &quot;whore&quot;, and &quot;sluts&quot;, from &quot;Wordle&quot; in 2022.

===Headlines===
Journalists for &quot;The New York Times&quot; do not write their own headlines, but rather copy editors who specifically write headlines. The &quot;Times&quot;″s guidelines insist headline editors get to the main point of an article but avoid giving away endings, if present. Other guidelines include using slang &quot;sparingly&quot;, avoiding tabloid headlines, not ending a line on a preposition, article, or adjective, and chiefly, not to pun. &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; states that wordplay, such as &quot;Rubber Industry Bounces Back&quot;, is to be tested on a colleague as a canary is to be tested in a coal mine; &quot;when no song bursts forth, start rewriting&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has amended headlines due to controversy. In 2019, following two back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the &quot;Times&quot; used the headline, &quot;Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism&quot;, to describe then-president Donald Trump&#x27;s words after the shootings. After criticism from &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; founder Nate Silver, the headline was changed to, &quot;Assailing Hate But Not Guns&quot;.

Online, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s headlines do not face the same length restrictions as headlines that appear in print; print headlines must fit within a column, often six words. Additionally, headlines must &quot;break&quot; properly, containing a complete thought on each line without splitting up prepositions and adverbs. Writers may edit a headline to fit an article more aptly if further developments occur. The &quot;Times&quot; uses A/B testing for articles on the front page, placing two headlines against each other. At the end of the test, the headlines that receives more traffic is chosen. The alteration of a headline regarding intercepted Russian data used in the Mueller special counsel investigation was noted by Trump in a March 2017 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, in which he claimed that the headline used the word &quot;wiretapped&quot; in the print version of the paper on January 20, while the digital article on January 19 omitted the word. The headline was intentionally changed in the print version to use &quot;wiretapped&quot; in order to fit within the print guidelines.

===Nameplate===
The nameplate of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has been unaltered since 1967. In creating the initial nameplate, Henry Jarvis Raymond took as his model the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;, which used a Blackletter style called Textura, popularized following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and regional variations of Alcuin&#x27;s script, as well as a period. With the change to &quot;The New-York Times&quot; on September 14, 1857, the nameplate followed. Under George Jones, the terminals of the &quot;N&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; were intentionally exaggerated into swashes. The nameplate in the January 15, 1894, issue trimmed the terminals once more, smoothed the edges, and turned the stem supporting the &quot;T&quot; into an ornament. The hyphen was dropped on December 1, 1896, after Adolph Ochs purchased the paper. The descender of the &quot;h&quot; was shortened on December 30, 1914. The largest change to the nameplate was introduced on February 21, 1967, when type designer Ed Benguiat redesigned the logo, most prominently turning the arrow ornament into a diamond. Notoriously, the new logo dropped the period that had followed the word &quot;Times&quot; up until that point; one reader compared the omission of the period to &quot;performing plastic surgery on Helen of Troy.&quot; Picture editor John Radosta worked with a New York University professor to determine that dropping the period saved the paper ().

==Print edition==
===Design and layout===
As of December 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has printed sixty thousand issues, a statistic represented in the paper&#x27;s masthead to the right of the volume number, the &quot;Times&quot;″s years in publication written in Roman numerals. The volume and issues are separated by four dots representing the edition number of that issue; on the day of the 2000 presidential election, the &quot;Times&quot; was revised four separate times, necessitating the use of an em dash in place of an ellipsis. The em dash issue was printed hundreds times over before being replaced by the one-dot issue. Despite efforts by newsroom employees to recycle copies sent to &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s office, several copies were kept, including one put on display at the Museum at The Times. From February 7, 1898, to December 31, 1999, the &quot;Times&quot;″s issue number was incorrect by five hundred issues, an error suspected by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to be the result of a careless front page type editor. The misreporting was noticed by news editor Aaron Donovan, who was calculating the number of issues in a spreadsheet and noticed the discrepancy. &quot;The New York Times&quot; celebrated fifty thousand issues on March 14, 1995, an observance that should have occurred on July 26, 1996.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has reduced the physical size of its print edition while retaining its broadsheet format. &quot;The New-York Daily Times&quot; debuted at across. By the 1950s, the &quot;Times&quot; was being printed at across. In 1953, an increase in paper costs to () a ton increased newsprint costs to million () On December 28, 1953, the pages were reduced to . On February 14, 1955, a further reduction to occurred, followed by . On August 6, 2007, the largest cut occurred when the pages were reduced to , a decision that other broadsheets had previously considered. Then-executive editor Bill Keller stated that a narrower paper would be more beneficial to the reader but acknowledged a net loss in article space of five percent. In 1985, The New York Times Company established a minority stake in a million () newsprint plant in Clermont, Quebec through Donahue Malbaie. The company sold its equity interest in Donahue Malbaie in 2017.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; often uses large, bolded headlines for major events. For the print version of the &quot;Times&quot;, these headlines are written by one copy editor, reviewed by two other copy editors, approved by the masthead editors, and polished by other print editors. The process is completed before 8 p.m., but it may be repeated if further development occur, as did take place during the 2020 presidential election. On the day Joe Biden was declared the winner, &quot;The New York Times&quot; utilized a &quot;hammer headline&quot; reading, &quot;Biden Beats Trump&quot;, in all caps and bolded. A dozen journalists discussed several potential headlines, such as &quot;It&#x27;s Biden&quot; or &quot;Biden&#x27;s Moment&quot;, and prepared for a Donald Trump victory, in which they would use &quot;Trump Prevails&quot;. During Trump&#x27;s first impeachment, the &quot;Times&quot; drafted the hammer headline, &quot;Trump Impeached&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; altered the ligatures between the E and the A, as not doing so would leave a noticeable gap due to the stem of the A sloping away from the E. The &quot;Times&quot; reused the tight kerning for &quot;Biden Beats Trump&quot; and Trump&#x27;s second impeachment, which simply read, &quot;Impeached&quot;.

In cases where two major events occur on the same day or immediately after each other, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has used a &quot;paddle wheel&quot; headline, where both headlines are used but split by a line. The term dates back to August 8, 1959, when it was revealed that the United States was monitoring Soviet missile firings and when Explorer 6—shaped like a paddle wheel—launched. Since then, the paddle wheel has been used several times, including on January 21, 1981, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in minutes before Iran released fifty-two American hostages, ending the Iran hostage crisis. At the time, most newspapers favored the end of the hostage crisis, but the &quot;Times&quot; placed the inauguration above the crisis. Since 1981, the paddle wheel has been used twice; on July 26, 2000, when the 2000 Camp David Summit ended without an agreement and when Bush announced that Dick Cheney would be his running mate, and on June 24, 2016, when the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum passed, beginning Brexit, and when the Supreme Court deadlocked in &quot;United States v. Texas&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has run editorials from its editorial board on the front page twice. On June 13, 1920, the &quot;Times&quot; ran an editorial opposing Warren G. Harding, who was nominated during that year&#x27;s Republican Party presidential primaries. Amid growing acceptance to run editorials on the front pages from publications such as the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, &quot;The Patriot-News&quot;, &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, and &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial on its front page on December 5, 2015, following a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, in which fourteen people were killed. The editorial advocates for the prohibition of &quot;slightly modified combat rifles&quot; used in the San Bernardino shooting and &quot;certain kinds of ammunition&quot;. Conservative figures, including Texas senator Ted Cruz, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; editor Bill Kristol, &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; co-anchor Steve Doocy, and then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie criticized the &quot;Times&quot;. Talk radio host Erick Erickson acquired an issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to fire several rounds into the paper, posting a picture online.

===Printing process===

Since 1997, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s primary distribution center is located in College Point, Queens. The facility is and employs 170 people as of 2017. The College Point distribution center prints 300,000 to 800,000 newspapers daily. On most occasions, presses start before 11 p.m. and finish before 3 a.m. A robotic crane grabs a roll of newsprint and several rollers ensure ink can be printed on paper. The final newspapers are wrapped in plastic and shipped out. As of 2018, the College Point facility accounted for 41 percent of production. Other copies are printed at 26 other publications, such as &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot;, and the &quot;Courier Journal&quot;. With the decline of newspapers, particularly regional publications, the &quot;Times&quot; must travel further; for example, newspapers for Hawaii are flown from San Francisco on United Airlines, and Sunday papers are flown from Los Angeles on Hawaiian Airlines. Computer glitches, mechanical issues, and weather phenomena affect circulation but do not stop the paper from reaching customers. The College Point facility prints over two dozen other papers, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has halted its printing process several times to account for major developments. The first printing stoppage occurred on March 31, 1968, when then-president Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term. Other press stoppages include May 19, 1994, for the death of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and July 17, 1996, for Trans World Airlines Flight 800. The 2000 presidential election necessitated two press stoppages. Al Gore appeared to concede on November 8, forcing then-executive editor Joseph Lelyveld to stop the &quot;Times&quot;″s presses to print a new headline, &quot;Bush Appears to Defeat Gore&quot;, with a story that stated George W. Bush was elected president. However, Gore held off his concession speech over doubts over Florida. Lelyveld reran the headline, &quot;Bush and Gore Vie for an Edge&quot;. Since 2000, three printing stoppages have been issued for the death of William Rehnquist on September 3, 2005, for the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011, and for the passage of the Marriage Equality Act in the New York State Assembly and subsequent signage by then-governor Andrew Cuomo on June 24, 2011.

==Online platforms==
===Website===
The New York Times website is hosted at nytimes.com. It has undergone several major redesigns and infrastructure developments since its debut. In April 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; redesigned its website with an emphasis on multimedia. In preparation for Super Tuesday in February 2008, the &quot;Times&quot; developed a live election system using the Associated Press&#x27;s File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service and a Ruby on Rails application; nytimes.com experienced its largest traffic on Super Tuesday and the day after.

===Applications===
The NYTimes application debuted with the introduction of the App Store on July 10, 2008. &quot;Engadget&quot;″s Scott McNulty wrote critically of the app, negatively comparing it to &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s mobile website. An iPad version with select articles was released on April 3, 2010, with the release of the first-generation iPad. In October, &quot;The New York Times&quot; expanded NYT Editors&#x27; Choice to include the paper&#x27;s full articles. NYT for iPad was free until 2011. The &quot;Times&quot; applications on iPhone and iPad began offering in-app subscriptions in July 2011. The &quot;Times&quot; released a web application for iPad—featuring a format summarizing trending headlines on Twitter—and a Windows 8 application in October 2012.

Efforts to ensure profitability through an online magazine and a &quot;Need to Know&quot; subscription emerged in &quot;Adweek&quot; in July 2013. In March 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced three applications—NYT Now, an application that offers pertinent news in a blog format, and two unnamed applications, later known as NYT Opinion and NYT Cooking—to diversify its product laterals.

===Podcasts===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; manages several podcasts, including multiple podcasts with Serial Productions. The &quot;Times&quot;″s longest-running podcast is &quot;The Book Review Podcast&quot;, debuting as &quot;Inside The New York Times Book Review&quot; in April 2006.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s defining podcast is &quot;The Daily&quot;, a daily news podcast hosted by Michael Barbaro and, since March 2022, Sabrina Tavernise. The podcast debuted on February 1, 2017.

In October 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; began testing &quot;New York Times Audio&quot;, an application featuring podcasts from the &quot;Times&quot;, audio versions of articles—including from other publications through Audm, and archives from &quot;This American Life&quot;. The application debuted in May 2023 exclusively on iOS for &quot;Times&quot; subscribers. New York Times Audio includes exclusive podcasts such as &quot;The Headlines&quot;, a daily news recap, and &quot;Shorts&quot;, short audio stories under ten minutes. In addition, a &quot;Reporter Reads&quot; section features &quot;Times&quot; journalists reading their articles and providing commentary.

===Games===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has used video games as part of its journalistic efforts, among the first publications to do so, contributing to an increase in Internet traffic; the publication has also developed its own video games. In 2014, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; introduced &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;, a word game in which players guess words from a set of letters in a honeycomb and are awarded points for the length of the word and receive extra points if the word is a pangram. The game was proposed by Will Shortz, created by Frank Longo, and has been maintained by Sam Ezersky. In May 2018, &quot;Spelling Bee&quot; was published on nytimes.com, furthering its popularity. In February 2019, the &quot;Times&quot; introduced &quot;Letter Boxed&quot;, in which players form words from letters placed on the edges of a square box, followed in June 2019 by &quot;Tiles&quot;, a matching game in which players form sequences of tile pairings, and &quot;Vertex&quot;, in which players connect vertices to assemble an image. In July 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; introduced &quot;Connections&quot;, in which players identify groups of words that are connected by a common property. In April, the &quot;Times&quot; introduced &quot;Digits&quot;, a game that required using operations on different values to reach a set number; &quot;Digits&quot; was shut down in August. In March 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; released &quot;Strands&quot;, a themed word search.

In January 2022, The New York Times Company acquired &quot;Wordle&quot;, a word game developed by Josh Wardle in 2021, at a valuation in the &quot;low-seven figures&quot;. The acquisition was proposed by David Perpich, a member of the Sulzberger family who proposed the purchase to Knight over Slack after reading about the game. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; purportedly considered acquiring &quot;Wordle&quot;, according to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. At the 2022 Game Developers Conference, Wardle stated that he was overwhelmed by the volume of &quot;Wordle&quot; facsimiles and overzealous monetization practices in other games. Concerns over &quot;The New York Times&quot; monetizing &quot;Wordle&quot; by implementing a paywall mounted; &quot;Wordle&quot; is a client-side browser game and can be played offline by downloading its webpage. &quot;Wordle&quot; moved to the &quot;Times&quot;″s servers and website in February. The game was added to the NYT Games application in August, necessitating it be rewritten in the JavaScript library React. In November, &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced that Tracy Bennett would be the &quot;Wordle&quot;″s editor.

==Other publications==
===&quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;===

&quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe Magazine&quot; are the only weekly Sunday magazines following &quot;The Washington Post Magazine&quot;″s cancellation in December 2022.

===&quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot;===
===&quot;The New York Times in Spanish&quot;===
In February 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; introduced a Spanish website, &quot;The New York Times en Español&quot;. The website, intended to be read on mobile devices, would contain translated articles from the &quot;Times&quot; and reporting from journalists based in Mexico City. The &quot;Times en Español&quot;″s style editor is Paulina Chavira, who has advocated for pluralistic Spanish to accommodate the variety of nationalities in the newsroom&#x27;s journalists and wrote a stylebook for &quot;The New York Times en Español&quot; Articles the &quot;Times&quot; intends to publish in Spanish are sent to a translation agency and adapted for Spanish writing conventions; the present progressive tense may be used for forthcoming events in English, but other tenses are preferable in Spanish. The &quot;Times en Español&quot; consults the Real Academia Española and Fundéu and frequently modifies the use of diacritics—such as using an acute accent for the Cártel de Sinaloa but not the Cartel de Medellín—and using the gender-neutral pronoun &quot;elle&quot;. Headlines in &quot;The New York Times en Español&quot; are not capitalized. The &quot;Times en Español&quot; publishes &quot;El Times&quot;, a newsletter led by Elda Cantú intended for all Spanish speakers. In September 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ended &quot;The New York Times en Español&quot;″s separate operations. A study published in &quot;The Translator&quot; in 2023 found that the &quot;Times en Español&quot; engaged in tabloidization.

===&quot;The New York Times in Chinese&quot;===
In June 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; introduced a Chinese website, , in response to Chinese editions created by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Conscious to censorship, the &quot;Times&quot; established servers outside of China and affirmed that the website would uphold the paper&#x27;s journalistic standards; the government of China had previously blocked articles from nytimes.com through the Great Firewall, and the website was blocked in China until August 2001 after then-general secretary Jiang Zemin met with journalists from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Then-foreign editor Joseph Kahn assisted in the establishment of cn.nytimes.com, an effort that contributed to his appointment as executive editor in April 2022. In October, published an article detailing the wealth of then-premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s family. In response, the government of China blocked access to nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com and references to the &quot;Times&quot; and Wen were censored on microblogging service Sina Weibo. In March 2015, a mirror of and the website for GreatFire were the targets for a government-sanctioned distributed denial of service attack on GitHub in March 2015, disabling access to the service for several days. Chinese authorities requested the removal of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s news applications from the App Store in December 2016.

==Awards and recognition==
===Awards===

As of 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has received 137 Pulitzer Prizes, the most of any publication.

===Recognition===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; is considered a newspaper of record in the United States. The &quot;Times&quot; is the largest metropolitan newspaper in the United States; as of 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; is the second-largest newspaper by print circulation in the United States behind &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

A study published in &quot;Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values&quot; in 2013 found that &quot;The New York Times&quot; received more citations in academic journals than the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, &quot;Research Policy&quot;, or the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. With sixteen million unique records, the &quot;Times&quot; is the third-most referenced source in Common Crawl, a collection of online material used in datasets such as GPT-3, behind Wikipedia and a United States patent database.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Max Norman wrote in March 2023 that the &quot;Times&quot; has shaped mainstream English usage. In a January 2018 article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Margaret Sullivan stated that &quot;The New York Times&quot; affects the &quot;whole media and political ecosystem&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s nascent success has led to concerns over media consolidation, particularly amid the decline of newspapers. In 2006, economists Lisa George and Joel Waldfogel examined the consequences of the &quot;Times&quot;″s national distribution strategy and audience with circulation of local newspapers, finding that local circulation decreased among college-educated readers. The effect of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in this manner was observed in &quot;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead&quot;, the newspaper of record for Fargo, North Dakota. &quot;Axios&quot; founder Jim VandeHei opined that the &quot;Times&quot; is &quot;going to basically be a monopoly&quot; in an opinion piece written by then-media columnist and former &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; editor-in-chief Ben Smith; in the article, Smith cites the strength of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s journalistic workforce, broadening content, and the expropriation of &quot;Gawker&quot; editor-in-chief Choire Sicha, &quot;Recode&quot; editor-in-chief Kara Swisher, and &quot;Quartz&quot; editor-in-chief Kevin Delaney. Smith compared the &quot;Times&quot; to the New York Yankees during their 1927 season containing Murderers&#x27; Row.

==Controversies==

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has received criticism for its coverage of the Israel–Hamas war, and the paper has been accused of holding both an anti-Palestinian and an anti-Israeli bias. In April 2024, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that an internal memorandum from November 2023 instructed journalists to reduce using the terms &quot;genocide&quot; and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and to avoid using the phrase &quot;occupied territory&quot; in the context of Palestinian land, &quot;Palestine&quot; except in rare circumstances, and the term &quot;refugee camps&quot; to describe areas of Gaza despite recognition from the United Nations. A spokesperson from the &quot;Times&quot; stated that issuing guidance was standard practice. An analysis by &quot;The Intercept&quot; noted that &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Israeli deaths as a massacre nearly sixty times, but had only described Palestinian deaths as a massacre once.
In December 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigation titled &quot;&#x27;Screams Without Words&#x27;: How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7&quot;, alleging that Hamas weaponized sexual and gender-based violence during its armed incursion on Israel. The investigation was the subject of an article from &quot;The Intercept&quot; questioning the journalistic acumen of Anat Schwartz, a filmmaker involved in the inquiry who had no prior reporting experience and agreed with a post stating Israel should &quot;violate any norm, on the way to victory&quot;, doubting the veracity of the opening claim that Gal Abdush was raped in a timespan disputed by her family, and alleging that the &quot;Times&quot; was pressured by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. &quot;The New York Times&quot; initiated an inquiry that received criticism from NewsGuild of New York president Susan DeCarava for purported racial targeting; the &quot;Times&quot;″s investigation concluded in ambiguity, but found that journalistic material was handled improperly.

===Transgender people===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has received criticism regarding its coverage of transgender people. When it published an opinion piece by Weill Cornell Medicine professor Richard A. Friedman called &quot;How Changeable Is Gender?&quot; in August 2015, &quot;Vox&quot;″s German Lopez criticized Friedman as suggesting that parents and doctors might be right in letting children suffer from severe dysphoria in case something changes down the line, and as implying that conversion therapy may work for transgender children. In February 2023, nearly one thousand current and former &quot;Times&quot; writers and contributors wrote an open letter addressed to standards editor Philip B. Corbett, criticizing the paper&#x27;s coverage of transgender, non⁠-⁠binary, and gender-nonconforming people; some of the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; articles have been cited in state legislatures attempting to justify criminalizing gender-affirming care. Contributors wrote in the open letter that &quot;the &quot;Times&quot; has in recent years treated gender diversity with an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language, while publishing reporting on trans children that omits relevant information about its sources.&quot;

<text>, sometimes stylized as Toho Company, Ltd., Toho Company, or simply Toho, is a Japanese entertainment company that primarily engages in producing and distributing films and exhibiting stage plays. It is headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is one of the core companies of the Osaka-based Hankyu Hanshin Toho Group. Toho is best known for producing and distributing many of Ishirō Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s &quot;kaiju&quot; and &quot;tokusatsu&quot; films as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa and the anime of Studio Ghibli, CoMix Wave Films, TMS Entertainment, and OLM, Inc. The company has released the majority of the highest-grossing Japanese films, and through its subsidiaries, is the largest film importer in Japan.

Toho&#x27;s most famous creation is Godzilla, featured in 33 of the company&#x27;s films. Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Mechagodzilla are described as Toho&#x27;s Big Five due to their numerous appearances throughout the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, as well as spin-offs. Toho has also been involved in the production of numerous anime titles. Its subdivisions are Toho-Towa Company, Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor of Universal Pictures via NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan), Towa Pictures Company Limited (Japanese exclusive theatrical distributor of Paramount Pictures), Toho Pictures Incorporated, Toho International Inc., Toho E. B. Company Limited, and Toho Music Corporation &amp; Toho Costume Company Limited. The company is the largest shareholder (7.96%) of Fuji Media Holdings Inc.

Toho is one of the four members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ), is the largest of Japan&#x27;s Big Four film studios, and is the only film studio that is a component of the Nikkei 225 index.

==History==

Toho was created by the founder of the Hankyu Railway, Ichizō Kobayashi, in 1932 as the . It managed much of the kabuki in Tokyo and, among other properties, the eponymous Tokyo Takarazuka Theatre and the Imperial Garden Theater in Tokyo; Toho and Shochiku enjoyed a duopoly over theaters in Tokyo for many years.

=== Labor disputes (1946–1948) ===
After the end of World War II, the new Occupation government allowed and encouraged the formation of labor unions, which had been banned under the Imperial government. During a general strike of film studio employees beginning in October 1946, a group of Toho&#x27;s ten top stars led by Denjiro Okochi split from the main Toho union along with 445 employees. During the resolution of the strike, a closed-shop provision with the main union led to the establishment of the Shintoho Company, which comprised the members of the dissenting union and former Toho facilities. 

The loss of major stars led to the hiring and training of new stars, including Toshiro Mifune. The contract made after the strike stipulated that Toho would only produce films approved by a committee that included union members, which led to filmmakers gaining unprecedented creative and productive control over their films. While Toho produced only thirteen films in 1947, six Toho films, including &quot;One Wonderful Sunday&quot;, directed by Akira Kurosawa, were ranked among the best ten films of the year in Kinema Junpo. However, each film had double or triple the budget of films produced by other studios, and the company suffered severe losses.

In 1948, the new Toho president Tetsuzo Watanabe ordered a return of the wartime quota of 24 films per year and the end of control over production by the union. In April, Toho management announced the dismissal of 1200 employees, with the aim of both cutting expenses and eliminating Communist leaders from the union. Negotiations failed and the union occupied the studio on April 15, joined by activists from the Japan Communist Party and other organizations, erecting barricades and closing the main gates. 

On August 13, the Tokyo District Court decided in Toho&#x27;s favor, and on the morning of August 19, a district police chief arrived at the front gate to read out the court decision. Two thousand policemen surrounded the studio, reinforced by soldiers, three airplanes, and several armored cars and tanks sent by the U.S. Eighth Army. The union leaders agreed to end their occupation on the condition the union was not disbanded.

Toho was severely weakened after the strikes and produced only four films in 1948 and five films in 1949, and continued to distribute Shintoho films until the end of 1949.

=== International expansion (1953–present) ===

In May 1953, Toho established Toho International, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary intended to target North American and Latin American markets. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was among the first films offered for foreign sales.

Toho and Shochiku competed with the influx of Hollywood films and boosted the film industry by focusing on new directors of the likes of Akira Kurosawa, Kon Ichikawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Ishirō Honda, and Kaneto Shindo.

After several successful film exports to the United States during the 1950s through Henry G. Saperstein, Toho took over the La Brea Theatre in Los Angeles to show its films without the need to sell them to a distributor. It was known as the Toho Theatre from the late 1960s until the 1970s. Toho also had a theater in San Francisco and opened a theater in New York City in 1963. The Shintoho Company, which existed until 1961, was named New Toho because it broke off from the original company. Toho has contributed to the production of some American films, including Sam Raimi&#x27;s 1998 film, &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; and Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s 2020 military science fiction/kaiju film, &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;.

In 2019, Toho invested ¥15.4 billion ($14 million) into their Los Angeles-based subsidiary Toho International Inc. as part of their &quot;Toho Vision 2021 Medium-term Management Strategy&quot;, a strategy to increase content, platform, real-estate, beat JPY50 billion profits, and increase character businesses on Toho intellectual properties such as Godzilla. Hiroyasu Matsuoka was named the representative director of the US subsidiary.

In 2020, Toho acquired a 34.8% stake in the animation studio TIA, with ILCA and Anima each retaining a 32.6% stake. In 2022, Toho acquired Anima&#x27;s 32.6% stake to take a controlling 67.4% stake in TIA, making the studio a subsidiary, and ultimately renaming the studio into Toho Animation Studios.

In December 2023, Toho announced their intent to acquire a 25% stake in Fifth Season for $225 million via Toho International. Following the completion of the deal, Fifth Season will be valued at $900 million; CJ ENM will remain the majority shareholder in the company, with former owner Endeavor also continuing to serve as a strategic shareholder. CEOs Graham Taylor and Chris Rice stated that this investment would empower the company to continue the expansion of its premium slate and create opportunities for collaboration between Fifth Season, Toho and CJ ENM to produce global content as well as content produced in Japan.

Following the success of &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot; (2023) as their first self-distributed film in the U.S., Toho declared in March 2024 that Godzilla is their &quot;Intellectual property (IP) treasure&quot; and they had regained retailing rights overseas (which were once abandoned), and now are able to sell, advertise, and distribute their own products to consumers outside Japan directly. The company also said that the film winning Best Visual Effects at the 96th Academy Awards is helping them gain more recognition and advancing more business extension overseas.

<text>In physical geography, tundra () is a type of biome where tree growth is hindered by frigid temperatures and short growing seasons. There are three regions and associated types of tundra: Arctic, Alpine, and Antarctic.

Tundra vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges, grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. The tundra soil is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. The soil also contains large amounts of biomass and decomposed biomass that has been stored as methane and carbon dioxide in the permafrost, making the tundra soil a carbon sink. As global warming heats the ecosystem and causes soil thawing, the permafrost carbon cycle accelerates and releases much of these soil-contained greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, creating a feedback cycle that changes climate.

== Etymology ==
The term is a Russian word adapted from the Sámi languages.

== Arctic == 
Arctic tundra occurs in the far Northern Hemisphere, north of the taiga belt. The word &quot;tundra&quot; usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is permafrost, or permanently frozen soil. (It may also refer to the treeless plain in general so that northern Sápmi would be included.) Permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern Russia and Canada. The polar tundra is home to several peoples who are mostly nomadic reindeer herders, such as the Nganasan and Nenets in the permafrost area (and the Sami in Sápmi).
Arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year. The soil there is frozen from down, making it impossible for trees to grow there. Instead, bare and sometimes rocky land can only support certain kinds of Arctic vegetation, low-growing plants such as moss, heath (Ericaceae varieties such as crowberry and black bearberry), and lichen.

There are two main seasons, winter and summer, in the polar tundra areas. During the winter it is very cold, dark, and windy with the average temperature around , sometimes dipping as low as . However, extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south (for example, Russia&#x27;s, Canada&#x27;s, and Alaska&#x27;s lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line). During the summer, temperatures rise somewhat, and the top layer of seasonally-frozen soil melts, leaving the ground very soggy. The tundra is covered in marshes, lakes, bogs, and streams during the warm months. Generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about but can often drop to or even below freezing. Arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of habitat conservation programs. In Canada and Russia, many of these areas are protected through a national Biodiversity Action Plan.
Tundra tends to be windy, with winds often blowing upwards of . However, it is desert-like, with only about of precipitation falling per year (the summer is typically the season of maximum precipitation). Although precipitation is light, evaporation is also relatively minimal. During the summer, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce, but because the ground below this is frozen, the water cannot sink any lower, so the water forms the lakes and marshes found during the summer months. There is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain. Research in Alaska has shown fire-event return intervals (FRIs) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years, with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter highland areas.

The biodiversity of tundra is low: 1,700 species of vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found, although millions of birds migrate there each year for the marshes. There are also a few fish species. There are few species with large populations. Notable plants in the Arctic tundra include blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium uliginosum&quot;), crowberry (&quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;), reindeer lichen (&quot;Cladonia rangiferina&quot;), lingonberry (&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot;), and Labrador tea (&quot;Rhododendron groenlandicum&quot;). Notable animals include reindeer (caribou), musk ox, Arctic hare, Arctic fox, snowy owl, ptarmigan, northern red-backed voles, lemmings, the mosquito, and even polar bears near the ocean. Tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards.

Due to the harsh climate of Arctic tundra, regions of this kind have seen little human activity, even though they are sometimes rich in natural resources such as petroleum, natural gas, and uranium. In recent times this has begun to change in Alaska, Russia, and some other parts of the world: for example, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug produces 90% of Russia&#x27;s natural gas. 

=== Relationship to climate change ===

A severe threat to tundra is global warming, which causes permafrost to thaw. The thawing of the permafrost in a given area on human time scales (decades or centuries) could radically change which species can survive there. It also represents a significant risk to infrastructure built on top of permafrost, such as roads and pipelines. 
In locations where dead vegetation and peat have accumulated, there is a risk of wildfire, such as the of tundra which burned in 2007 on the north slope of the Brooks Range in Alaska. Such events may both result from and contribute to global warming.

Carbon emissions from permafrost thaw contribute to the same warming which facilitates the thaw, making it a positive climate change feedback. The warming also intensifies Arctic water cycle, and the increased amounts of warmer rain are another factor which increases permafrost thaw depths.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimates that carbon dioxide and methane released from permafrost could amount to the equivalent of 14–175 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per of warming. For comparison, by 2019, &quot;annual&quot; anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide alone stood around 40 billion tonnes. A 2018 perspectives article discussing tipping points in the climate system activated around of global warming suggested that at this threshold, permafrost thaw would add a further to global temperatures by 2100, with a range of 

== Antarctic ==


Antarctic tundra occurs on Antarctica and on several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, including South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. Most of Antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation, and most of the continent is covered by ice fields or cold deserts. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the Antarctic Peninsula, have areas of rocky soil that support plant life. The flora presently consists of around 300–400 species of lichens, 100 mosses, 25 liverworts, and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica&#x27;s two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (&quot;Deschampsia antarctica&quot;) and Antarctic pearlwort (&quot;Colobanthus quitensis&quot;), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.
In contrast with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands. The Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion includes the Bounty Islands, Auckland Islands, Antipodes Islands, the Campbell Island group, and Macquarie Island. Species endemic to this ecoregion include &quot;Corybas dienemus&quot; and &quot;Corybas sulcatus&quot;, the only subantarctic orchids; the royal penguin; and the Antipodean albatross.

There is some ambiguity on whether Magellanic moorland, on the west coast of Patagonia, should be considered tundra or not. Phytogeographer Edmundo Pisano called it tundra () since he considered the low temperatures key to restrict plant growth. More recent approaches have since recognized it as a temperate grassland, restricting southern tundra to coastal Antarctica and its islands.

The flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Antarctic Islands (south of 60° south latitude) are protected by the Antarctic Treaty.

== Alpine ==


Alpine tundra does not contain trees because the climate and soils at high altitude block tree growth. The cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by the low air temperatures, and is similar to polar climate. Alpine tundra is generally better drained than arctic soils. Alpine tundra transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone (the treeline) are known as &quot;Krummholz&quot;. Alpine tundra can be affected by woody plant encroachment.

Alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide. The flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by plants that grow close to the ground, including perennial grasses, sedges, forbs, cushion plants, mosses, and lichens. The flora is adapted to the harsh conditions of the alpine environment, which include low temperatures, dryness, ultraviolet radiation, and a short growing season.

== Climatic classification ==
Tundra climates ordinarily fit the Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;, signifying a local climate in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (), but no month with an average temperature in excess of . The cold limit generally meets the &quot;EF&quot; climates of permanent ice and snows; the warm-summer limit generally corresponds with the poleward or altitudinal limit of trees, where they grade into the subarctic climates designated &quot;Dfd&quot;, &quot;Dwd&quot; and &quot;Dsd&quot; (extreme winters as in parts of Siberia), &quot;Dfc&quot; typical in Alaska, Canada, mountain areas of Scandinavia, European Russia, and Western Siberia (cold winters with months of freezing).

Despite the potential diversity of climates in the &quot;ET&quot; category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative wet and dry seasons, this category is rarely subdivided, although, for example, Wainwright, Alaska can be classified &quot;ETw&quot; and Provideniya, Russia &quot;ETs&quot;, with most of the rest of the tundra fitting into the &quot;ETf&quot; subcategory. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure of water in the chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.

<text>The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven portal fantasy novels by British author C. S. Lewis. Illustrated by Pauline Baynes and originally published between 1950 and 1956, the series is set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals. It narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of the Narnian world. Except in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, the protagonists are all children from the real world who are magically transported to Narnia, where they are sometimes called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; to its eventual destruction in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; is considered a classic of children&#x27;s literature and is Lewis&#x27;s best-selling work, having sold 120 million copies in 47 languages. The series has been adapted for radio, television, the stage, film, and video games.

==Background and conception==
Although Lewis originally conceived what would become &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; in 1939 (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914), he did not finish writing the first book &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; until 1949. &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of presentation. The original illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the &quot;Narnia&quot; books that are still used in the editions published today. Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, the final book in the saga. The series was first referred to as &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by fellow children&#x27;s author Roger Lancelyn Green in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Night under Narnia&quot;.

Lewis described the origin of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; in an essay entitled &quot;It All Began with a Picture&quot;:
Shortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls named Margaret, Mary and Katherine came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis&#x27;s home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children&#x27;s story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:
In &quot;It All Began with a Picture&quot; C. S. Lewis continues:
Although Lewis pleaded ignorance about the source of his inspiration for Aslan, Jared Lobdell, digging into Lewis&#x27;s history to explore the making of the series, suggests Charles Williams&#x27;s 1931 novel &quot;The Place of the Lion&quot; as a likely influence.

The manuscript for &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was complete by the end of March 1949.

===Name===
The name &quot;Narnia&quot; is based on Narni, Italy, written in Latin as &quot;Narnia&quot;. Green wrote:
==Publication history==

&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&#x27;s&quot; seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in Braille.

The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. The first edition of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was released in London on 16 October 1950. Although three more books, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; and &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, were already complete, they were not released immediately at that time, but instead appeared (along with &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;) one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). The last two books (&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;) were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in 1955 and 1956.

In the United States, the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers, and later by HarperCollins. The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, while at the same time Scholastic, Inc. produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. HarperCollins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. As noted below (see Reading order), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, whereas HarperCollins, at the suggestion of Lewis&#x27;s stepson, opted to use the series&#x27; internal chronological order when they won the rights to it in 1994. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of HarperCollins.

==Books==
The seven books that make up &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; are presented here in order of original publication date:
===&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950)===

&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, completed by the end of March 1949 and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, Londoners who were evacuated to the English countryside following the outbreak of World War II. They discover a wardrobe in Professor Digory Kirke&#x27;s house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil White Witch, who has reigned for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.

===&quot;Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia&quot; (1951)===

Completed after Christmas 1949 and published on 15 October 1951, &quot;Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia&quot; tells the story of the Pevensie children&#x27;s second trip to Narnia, a year (on Earth) after their first. They are drawn back by the power of Susan&#x27;s horn, blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia as they knew it is no more, as 1,300 years have passed, their castle is in ruins, and all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan&#x27;s magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, Miraz, who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.

===&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; (1952)===

Written between January and February 1950 and published on 15 September 1952, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their cousin, Eustace Scrubb, return to Narnia, three Narnian years (and one Earth year) after their last departure. Once there, they join Caspian&#x27;s voyage on the ship &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; to find the seven lords who were banished when Miraz took over the throne. This perilous journey brings them face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan&#x27;s country at the edge of the world.

===&quot;The Silver Chair&quot; (1953)===

Completed at the beginning of March 1951 and published 7 September 1953, &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children, focusing instead on Eustace. Several months after &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate Jill Pole. They are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian&#x27;s son Rilian, who disappeared ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother&#x27;s death. Fifty years have passed in Narnia since the events from &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;; Eustace is still a child, but Caspian, barely an adult in the previous book, is now an old man. Eustace and Jill, with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, face danger and betrayal on their quest to find Rilian.

===&quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; (1954)===

Begun in March and completed at the end of July 1950, &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; was published on 6 September 1954. The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. The protagonists, a young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree, both begin in bondage in the country of Calormen. By &quot;chance&quot;, they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet Aravis and her talking horse Hwin, who are also fleeing to Narnia.

===&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (1955)===

Completed in February 1954
and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; serves as a prequel and presents Narnia&#x27;s origin story: how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings given to them by Digory&#x27;s uncle. In the dying world of Charn they awaken Queen Jadis, and another world turns out to be the beginnings of the Narnian world (where Jadis later becomes the White Witch). The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor by the time he hosts the Pevensie children in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; 40 years later.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot; (1956)===

Completed in March 1953 and published 4 September 1956, &quot;The Last Battle&quot; chronicles the end of the world of Narnia. Approximately two hundred Narnian years after the events of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape Shift, who tricks Puzzle the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan, thereby precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and King Tirian. This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the series, but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the &quot;true&quot; Narnia.

==Reading order==

Fans of the series often have strong opinions about the order in which the books should be read. The issue revolves around the placement of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; and &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.

When first published, the books were not numbered. The first American publisher, Macmillan, enumerated them according to their original publication order, while some early British editions specified the internal chronological order. When HarperCollins took over the series rights in 1994, they adopted the internal chronological order. To make the case for the internal chronological order, Lewis&#x27;s stepson, Douglas Gresham, quoted Lewis&#x27;s 1957 reply to a letter from an American fan who was having an argument with his mother about the order:

:I think I agree with your [chronological] order for reading the books more than with your mother&#x27;s. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote &quot;The Lion&quot; I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote &quot;P. Caspian&quot; as a sequel and still didn&#x27;t think there would be any more, and when I had done &quot;The Voyage&quot; I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I&#x27;m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.

In the 2005 HarperCollins adult editions of the books, the publisher cites this letter to assert Lewis&#x27;s preference for the numbering they adopted by including this notice on the copyright page:

:Although &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; was written several years after C. S. Lewis first began &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series. HarperCollins is happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred.

Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against this view and continues, saying, &quot;Most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis&#x27;s deepest intentions.&quot; Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could have changed the books&#x27; order in his lifetime had he so desired. They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;—that the mysterious wardrobe, as a narrative device, is a much better introduction to Narnia than &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, where the word &quot;Narnia&quot; appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader. Moreover, they say, it is clear from the texts themselves that &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was intended to be read first. When Aslan is first mentioned in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, for example, the narrator says that &quot;None of the children knew who Aslan was, any more than you do&quot;—which is nonsensical if one has already read &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. Other similar textual examples are also cited.

Doris Meyer, author of &quot;C. S. Lewis in Context&quot; and &quot;Bareface: A Guide to C.S. Lewis&#x27;s Last Novel&quot;, writes that rearranging the stories chronologically &quot;lessens the impact of the individual stories&quot; and &quot;obscures the literary structures as a whole&quot;. Peter Schakel devotes an entire chapter to this topic in his book &quot;Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds&quot;, and in &quot;Reading with the Heart: The Way into Narnia&quot; he writes:

:The only reason to read &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; first […] is for the chronological order of events, and that, as every story teller knows, is quite unimportant as a reason. Often the early events in a sequence have a greater impact or effect as a flashback, told after later events which provide background and establish perspective. So it is […] with the &quot;Chronicles&quot;. The artistry, the archetypes, and the pattern of Christian thought all make it preferable to read the books in the order of their publication.

==Main characters==

===Aslan===

Aslan, the Great Lion, is the titular lion of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan is a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea. He is a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual) who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit, as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which he may have appeared in an alternative reality. In his book &quot;Miracles&quot;, C.S. Lewis argues that the possible existence of other worlds with other sentient life-forms should not deter or detract from being Christian:

===Pevensie family===
The four Pevensie siblings are the main human protagonists of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. Varying combinations of some or all of them appear in five of the seven novels. They are introduced in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (although their surname is not revealed until &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;), and eventually become Kings and Queens of Narnia reigning as a tetrarchy. Although introduced in the series as children, the siblings grow up into adults while reigning in Narnia. They go back to being children once they get back to their own world, but feature as adults in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; during their Narnian reign.

All four appear in &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;; in the latter, however, Aslan tells Peter and Susan that they will not return, as they are getting too old. Susan, Lucy, and Edmund appear in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;—Peter is said to be away fighting giants on the other side of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund appear in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, where Aslan tells them, too, that they are getting too old. Peter, Edmund, and Lucy appear as Kings and Queens in Aslan&#x27;s Country in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;; Susan does not. Asked by a child in 1958 if he would please write another book entitled &quot;Susan of Narnia&quot; so that the entire Pevensie family would be reunited, C. S. Lewis replied: &quot;I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of you to write and tell me. There&#x27;s no use just asking me to write more. When stories come into my mind I have to write them, and when they don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t!&quot;

====Lucy Pevensie====

Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most. In &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe, and (with Susan) witnesses Aslan&#x27;s execution and resurrection. She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them. In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the Dufflepuds. As an adult in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard. Although a minor character in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view.

====Edmund Pevensie====

Edmund is the second child to enter Narnia in &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, where he falls under the White Witch&#x27;s spell from eating the Turkish delight she gives him. Instantiating the book&#x27;s Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, he betrays his siblings to the White Witch, but quickly realizes her true nature and her evil intentions, and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan&#x27;s life. He is named King Edmund the Just. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, he supports Lucy; in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, he leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and, later, the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard.

====Susan Pevensie====

In &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again. She is named Queen Susan the Gentle. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, however, she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when the latter is called by Aslan to guide them. As an adult queen in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, she is courted by Prince Rabadash of Calormen, but refuses his marriage proposal, and his angry response leads the story to its climax. In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, she has stopped believing in Narnia and remembers it only as a childhood game, though Lewis mentioned in a letter to a fan that he thought she may eventually believe again: &quot;The books don&#x27;t tell us what happened to Susan… But there is plenty of time for her to mend, and perhaps she will get to Aslan&#x27;s country in the end—in her own way.&quot;

====Peter Pevensie====

Peter is the eldest of the Pevensies. In &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, he kills Maugrim, a talking wolf, to save Susan, and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch. Aslan names him High King, and he is known as Peter the Magnificent. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, he duels the usurper King Miraz to restore Caspian&#x27;s throne. In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the final time.

===Eustace Scrubb===

Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and his subsequent improved character is rewarded when Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

===Jill Pole===

Jill Pole is a schoolmate of Eustace Scrubb. She appears in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and returns in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. In &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian&#x27;s lost son. In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.

===Professor Digory Kirke===

Digory Kirke is the nephew referred to in the title of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. He first appears as a minor character in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, known only as &quot;The Professor&quot;, who hosts the Pevensie children when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy&#x27;s story of having found a country in the back of the wardrobe. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, the young Digory, thanks to his uncle&#x27;s magical experimentation, inadvertently brings Jadis from her dying homeworld of Charn to the newly created world of Narnia; to rectify his mistake, Aslan sends him to fetch a magical apple which will protect Narnia and heal his dying mother. He returns in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

===Polly Plummer===

Polly Plummer appears in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke. She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory&#x27;s uncle) into touching a magic ring which transports her to the Wood between the Worlds and leaves her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair&#x27;s adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. She appears at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

===Tumnus===

Tumnus the Faun, called &quot;Mr Tumnus&quot; by Lucy, is featured prominently in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and also appears in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. He is the first creature Lucy meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series; he invites her to his home with the intention of betraying her to Jadis, but quickly repents and befriends her. In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, he devises the Narnian delegation&#x27;s plan of escape from Calormen. He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s initial inspiration for the entire series was a mental image of a faun in a snowy wood; Tumnus is that faun.

===Caspian===

Caspian is first introduced in the book titled after him, as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz. Fleeing potential assassination by his uncle, he becomes leader of the Old Narnian rebellion against the Telmarine occupation. With the help of the Pevensies, he defeats Miraz&#x27;s army and becomes King Caspian X of Narnia. In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, he leads an expedition out into the eastern ocean to find Seven Lords, whom Miraz had exiled, and ultimately to reach Aslan&#x27;s Country. In &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, he makes two brief appearances as an old, dying man, but at the end is resurrected in Aslan&#x27;s Country.

===Trumpkin===

Trumpkin the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;; he is one of Caspian&#x27;s rescuers and a leading figure in the &quot;Old Narnian&quot; rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel to the Old Narnian camp. In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, we learn that Caspian has made him his Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very deaf) in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;.

===Reepicheep===

Reepicheep the Mouse is the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;. Utterly fearless, infallibly courteous, and obsessed with honour, he is badly wounded in the final battle but healed by Lucy and Aslan. In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, his role is greatly expanded; he becomes a visionary as well as a warrior, and ultimately his willing self-exile to Aslan&#x27;s Country breaks the enchantment on the last three of the Lost Lords, thus achieving the final goal of the quest. Lewis identified Reepicheep as &quot;specially&quot; exemplifying the latter book&#x27;s theme of &quot;the spiritual life&quot;. Reepicheep makes one final cameo appearance at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, in Aslan&#x27;s Country.

===Puddleglum===

Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. Though always comically pessimistic, he provides the voice of reason and as such intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.

===Shasta / Cor===

Shasta, later known as Cor of Archenland, is the principal character in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;. Born the eldest son and heir of King Lune of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin, Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman&#x27;s son in Calormen. With the help of the talking horse Bree, Shasta escapes from being sold into slavery and makes his way northward to Narnia. On the journey his companion Aravis learns of an imminent Calormene surprise attack on Archenland; Shasta warns the Archenlanders in time and discovers his true identity and original name. At the end of the story he marries Aravis and becomes King of Archenland.

===Aravis===

Aravis, daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, is a character in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;. Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome Ahoshta, she joins Shasta on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as Prince Cor, and becomes queen of Archenland at his side.

===Bree===

Bree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta&#x27;s mount and mentor in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;. A Talking Horse of Narnia, he wandered into Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman&#x27;s war-horse; when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries out their joint escape. Though friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until his encounter with Aslan late in the story.

===Tirian===

The last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. Having rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned by the villainous ape Shift but released by Eustace and Jill. Together they fight faithfully to the last and are welcomed into Aslan&#x27;s Kingdom.

===Antagonists===

====Jadis, the White Witch====

Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main villain of &quot;The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;—the only antagonist to appear in more than one Narnia book. In &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, she is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter; she turns her enemies into statues and kills Aslan on the Stone Table, but is killed by him in battle after his resurrection. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, she is wakened from a magical sleep by Digory in the dead world of Charn and inadvertently brought to Victorian London before being transported to Narnia, where she steals an apple to grant her the gift of immortality.

====Miraz====

King Miraz is the lead villain of &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;. Prior to the book&#x27;s opening he has killed King Caspian IX, father of the titular Prince Caspian, and usurped his throne as king of the Telmarine colonizers in Narnia. He raises Caspian as his heir, but seeks to kill him after his own son is born. As the story progresses he leads the Telmarine war against the Old Narnian rebellion; he is defeated in single combat by Peter and then murdered by one of his own lords.

====Lady of the Green Kirtle====

The Lady of the Green Kirtle is the lead villain of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, and is also referred to in that book as &quot;the Queen of Underland&quot; or simply as &quot;the Witch&quot;. She rules an underground kingdom through magical mind-control. Prior to the events of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, she has murdered Caspian&#x27;s Queen and then seduced and abducted his son Prince Rilian. She encounters the protagonists on their quest and sends them astray. Confronted by them later, she attempts to enslave them magically; when that fails, she attacks them in the form of a serpent and is killed.

====Rabadash====

Prince Rabadash, heir to the throne of Calormen, is the primary antagonist of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;. Hot-headed, arrogant, and entitled, he brings Queen Susan of Narnia—along with a small retinue of Narnians, including King Edmund—to Calormen in the hope that Susan will marry him. When the Narnians realize that Rabadash may force Susan to accept his marriage proposal, they spirit Susan out of Calormen by ship. Incensed, Rabadash launches a surprise attack on Archenland with the ultimate intention of raiding Narnia and taking Susan captive. His plan is foiled when Shasta and Aravis warn the Archenlanders of his impending strike. After being captured by Edmund, Rabadash blasphemes against Aslan. Aslan then temporarily transforms him into a donkey as punishment.

====Shift the Ape====

Shift is the most prominent villain of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. He is an elderly Talking Ape—Lewis does not specify what kind of ape, but Pauline Baynes&#x27; illustrations depict him as a chimpanzee. He persuades the naïve donkey Puzzle to pretend to be Aslan (wearing a lion-skin) in order to seize control of Narnia, and proceeds to cut down the forests, enslave the other Talking Beasts, and invite the Calormenes to invade. He loses control of the situation due to over-indulging in alcohol, and is eventually swallowed up by the evil Calormene god Tash.

=== Title characters ===
* &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; – Digory Kirke (Andrew Ketterley is the magician)
* &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; – Aslan, Jadis
* &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; – Bree, Shasta
* &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; – Prince Caspian

===Appearances of main characters===


==Narnian geography==
&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; describes the world in which Narnia exists as one major landmass encircled by an ocean. Narnia&#x27;s capital sits on the eastern edge of the landmass on the shores of the Great Eastern Ocean. This ocean contains the islands explored in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. On the main landmass Lewis places the countries of Narnia, Archenland, Calormen, and Telmar, along with a variety of other areas that are not described as countries. The author also provides glimpses of more fantastic locations that exist in and around the main world of Narnia, including an edge and an underworld.

==Influences==

===Lewis&#x27;s life===
Lewis&#x27;s early life has parallels with &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy&#x27;s discovery of Narnia in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis&#x27;s goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

===Influences from mythology and cosmology===
Drew Trotter, president of the Center for Christian Study, noted that the producers of the film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; felt that the books&#x27; plots adhere to the archetypal &quot;monomyth&quot; pattern as detailed in Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;.

Lewis was widely read in medieval Celtic literature, an influence reflected throughout the books, and most strongly in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.&quot; The entire book imitates one of the immrama, a type of traditional Old Irish tale that combines elements of Christianity and Irish mythology to tell the story of a hero&#x27;s sea journey to the Otherworld.

====&quot;Planet Narnia&quot;====

Michael Ward&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Planet Narnia&quot; proposes that each of the seven books related to one of the seven moving heavenly bodies or &quot;planets&quot; known in the Middle Ages according to the Ptolemaic geocentric model of cosmology (a theme to which Lewis returned habitually throughout his work). At that time, each of these heavenly bodies was believed to have certain attributes, and Ward contends that these attributes were deliberately but subtly used by Lewis to furnish elements of the stories of each book:
:In &quot;The Lion&quot; [the child protagonists] become monarchs under sovereign Jove; in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; they harden under strong Mars; in &quot;The &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;&quot; they drink light under searching Sol; in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; they learn obedience under subordinate Luna; in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; they come to love poetry under eloquent Mercury; in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; they gain life-giving fruit under fertile Venus; and in &quot;The Last Battle&quot; they suffer and die under chilling Saturn.

Lewis&#x27;s interest in the literary symbolism of medieval and Renaissance astrology is more overtly referenced in other works such as his study of medieval cosmology &quot;The Discarded Image&quot;, and in his early poetry as well as in &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;. Narnia scholar Paul F. Ford finds Ward&#x27;s assertion that Lewis intended &quot;The Chronicles&quot; to be an embodiment of medieval astrology implausible, though Ford addresses an earlier (2003) version of Ward&#x27;s thesis (also called &quot;Planet Narnia&quot;, published in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;). Ford argues that Lewis did not start with a coherent plan for the books, but Ward&#x27;s book answers this by arguing that the astrological associations grew in the writing:
:Jupiter was... [Lewis&#x27;s] favourite planet, part of the &quot;habitual furniture&quot; of his mind... &quot;The Lion&quot; was thus the first example of that &quot;idea that he wanted to try out&quot;. &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;&quot; naturally followed because Mars and Sol were both already connected in his mind with the merits of the Alexander technique... at some point after commencing &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; he resolved to treat all seven planets, for seven such treatments of his idea would mean that he had &quot;worked it out to the full&quot;.

A quantitative analysis on the imagery in the different books of &quot;The Chronicles&quot; gives mixed support to Ward&#x27;s thesis: &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; do indeed employ concepts associated with, respectively, Sol, Luna, Mercury, and Venus, far more often than chance would predict, but &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; fall short of statistical correlation with their proposed planets.

===Influences from literature===
George MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858) influenced the structure and setting of &quot;The Chronicles&quot;. It was a work that was &quot; a great balm to the soul&quot;.

Plato was an undeniable influence on Lewis&#x27;s writing of &quot;The Chronicles&quot;. Most clearly, Digory explicitly invokes Plato&#x27;s name at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, to explain how the old version of Narnia is but a shadow of the newly revealed &quot;true&quot; Narnia. Plato&#x27;s influence is also apparent in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; when the Queen of the Underland attempts to convince the protagonists that the surface world is not real. She echoes the logic of Plato&#x27;s Cave by comparing the sun to a nearby lamp, arguing that reality is only that which is perceived in the immediate physical vicinity.

The White Witch in &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; shares many features, both of appearance and character, with the villainous Duessa of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;, a work Lewis studied in detail. Like Duessa, she falsely styles herself Queen; she leads astray the erring Edmund with false temptations; she turns people into stone as Duessa turns them into trees. Both villains wear opulent robes and deck their conveyances out with bells. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; Jadis takes on echoes of Satan from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;: she climbs over the wall of the paradisal garden in contempt of the command to enter only by the gate, and proceeds to tempt Digory as Satan tempted Eve, with lies and half-truths. Similarly, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; recalls both the snake-woman Errour in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and Satan&#x27;s transformation into a snake in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

Lewis read Edith Nesbit&#x27;s children&#x27;s books as a child and was greatly fond of them. He described &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; around the time of its completion as &quot;a children&#x27;s book in the tradition of E. Nesbit&quot;. &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; in particular bears strong resemblances to Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906). This novel focuses on four children living in London who discover a magic amulet. Their father is away and their mother is ill, as is the case with Digory. They manage to transport the queen of ancient Babylon to London and she is the cause of a riot; likewise, Polly and Digory transport Queen Jadis to London, sparking a very similar incident.

Marsha Daigle-Williamson argues that Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; had a significant impact on Lewis&#x27;s writings. In the Narnia series, she identifies this influence as most apparent in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; and &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. Daigle-Williamson identifies the plot of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; as a Dantean journey with a parallel structure and similar themes. She likewise draws numerous connections between &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; and the events of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;.

Colin Duriez, writing on the shared elements found in both Lewis&#x27;s and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s works, highlights the thematic similarities between Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;Imram&quot; and Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

==Influences on other works==
&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; is considered a classic of children&#x27;s literature.

===Influences on literature===
&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; has been a significant influence on both adult and children&#x27;s fantasy literature in the post-World War II era. In 1976, the scholar Susan Cornell Poskanzer praised Lewis for his &quot;strangely powerful fantasies&quot;. Poskanzer argued that children could relate to &quot;Narnia&quot; books because the heroes and heroines were realistic characters, each with their own distinctive voice and personality. Furthermore, the protagonists become powerful kings and queens who decide the fate of kingdoms, while the adults in the &quot;Narnia&quot; books tended to be buffoons, which by inverting the normal order of things was pleasing to many youngsters. However, Poskanzer criticized Lewis for what she regarded as scenes of gratuitous violence, which she felt were upsetting to children. Poskanzer also noted Lewis presented his Christian message subtly enough as to avoid boring children with overt sermonizing.

Examples include:

Philip Pullman&#x27;s fantasy series, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, is seen as a response to &quot;The Chronicles&quot;. Pullman is a self-described atheist who wholly rejects the spiritual themes that permeate &quot;The Chronicles&quot;, yet his series nonetheless addresses many of the same issues and introduces some similar character types, including talking animals. In another parallel, the first books in each series – Pullman&#x27;s &quot;Northern Lights&quot; and &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; – both open with a young girl hiding in a wardrobe.

Bill Willingham&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Fables&quot; makes reference at least twice to a king called &quot;The Great Lion&quot;, a thinly veiled reference to Aslan. The series avoids explicitly referring to any characters or works that are not in the public domain.

The novel &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot; by Katherine Paterson has Leslie, one of the main characters, reveal to Jesse her love of Lewis&#x27;s books, subsequently lending him &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; so that he can learn how to behave like a king. Her book also features the island name &quot;Terabithia&quot;, which sounds similar to Terebinthia, a Narnian island that appears in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. Katherine Paterson herself acknowledges that Terabithia is likely to be derived from Terebinthia:
I thought I had made it up. Then, rereading &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; by C. S. Lewis, I realized that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the terebinth tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously.&quot;

Science-fiction author Greg Egan&#x27;s short story &quot;Oracle&quot; depicts a parallel universe in which an author nicknamed Jack (Lewis&#x27;s nickname) has written novels about the fictional &quot;Kingdom of Nesica&quot;, and whose wife is dying of cancer, paralleling the death of Lewis&#x27;s wife Joy Davidman. Several Narnian allegories are also used to explore issues of religion and faith versus science and knowledge.

Lev Grossman&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller &quot;The Magicians&quot; is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book&#x27;s plot revolves heavily around a place very like the &quot;wood between the worlds&quot; from &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; is echoed in the title of the book.

J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of &quot;The Chronicles&quot; on her work: &quot;I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King&#x27;s Cross Station – it dissolves and he&#x27;s on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there&#x27;s the train for Hogwarts.&quot; Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: &quot;Narnia is literally a different world&quot;, she says, &quot;whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn&#x27;t much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn&#x27;t think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn&#x27;t very subliminal.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry&#x27;s neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.

The comic book series &quot;Pakkins&#x27; Land&quot; by Gary and Rhoda Shipman in which a young child finds himself in a magical world filled with talking animals, including a lion character named King Aryah, has been compared favorably to the &quot;Narnia&quot; series. The Shipmans have cited the influence of C.S. Lewis and the &quot;Narnia&quot; series in response to reader letters.

===Influences on popular culture===
As with any popular long-lived work, contemporary culture abounds with references to the lion Aslan, travelling via wardrobe and direct mentions of &quot;The Chronicles&quot;. Examples include:
Charlotte Staples Lewis, a character first seen early in the fourth season of the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;, is named in reference to C. S. Lewis. &quot;Lost&quot; producer Damon Lindelof said that this was a clue to the direction the show would take during the season. The book &quot;Ultimate Lost and Philosophy&quot;, edited by William Irwin and Sharon Kaye, contains a comprehensive essay on &quot;Lost&quot; plot motifs based on &quot;The Chronicles&quot;.

The second SNL Digital Short by Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell features a humorous nerdcore hip hop song titled &quot;Chronicles of Narnia (Lazy Sunday)&quot;, which focuses on the performers&#x27; plan to see &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; at a cinema. It was described by &quot;Slate&quot; magazine as one of the most culturally significant &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits in many years, and an important commentary on the state of rap. Swedish Christian power metal band Narnia, whose songs are mainly about the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; or the Bible, feature Aslan on all their album covers. The song &quot;Further Up, Further In&quot; from the album &quot;Room to Roam&quot; by Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys is heavily influenced by &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. The title is taken from a passage in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, and one verse of the song describes sailing to the end of the world to meet a king, similar to the ending of &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. C. S. Lewis is explicitly acknowledged as an influence in the liner notes of the 1990 compact disc.

During interviews, the primary creator of the Japanese anime and gaming series &quot;Digimon&quot; has said that he was inspired and influenced by &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;.

Its influence extends even to fan fiction: under the pen name Edonohana, Rachel Manija Brown wrote &quot;No Reservations: Narnia&quot;, which imagined Anthony Bourdain exploring Narnia and its cuisine in the style of his &quot;No Reservations&quot; TV show and book. Bourdain himself praised the fic&#x27;s writing and &quot;frankly a bit frightening&quot; attention to detail.

==Christian themes==
Lewis had authored a number of works on Christian apologetics and other literature with Christian-based themes before writing the &quot;Narnia&quot; books. The character Aslan is widely accepted by literary academia as being based on Jesus Christ. Lewis did not initially plan to incorporate Christian theological concepts into his &quot;Narnia&quot; stories. Lewis maintained that the &quot;Narnia&quot; books were not allegorical, preferring to term their Christian aspects a &quot;supposition&quot;.

&quot;The Chronicles&quot; have, consequently, a large Christian following, and are widely used to promote Christian ideas. However, some Christians object that &quot;The Chronicles&quot; promote &quot;soft-sell paganism and occultism&quot; due to recurring pagan imagery and themes.

==Criticism==
===Consistency===
Gertrude Ward noted that &quot;When Lewis wrote &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, he clearly meant to create a world where there were no human beings at all. As the titles of Mr. Tumnus&#x27; books testify, in this world human beings are creatures of myth, while its common daily reality includes fauns and other creatures which are myth in our world. This worked well for the first volume of the series, but for later volumes Lewis thought up plots which required having more human beings in this world. In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; he still kept the original structure and explained that more humans had arrived from our world at a later time, overrunning Narnia. However, later on he gave in and changed the entire concept of this worldthere have always been very many humans in this world, and Narnia is just one very special country with a lot of talking animals and fauns and dwarves etc. In this revised world, with a great human empire to the south of Narnia and human principality just next door, the White Witch would not have suspected Edmund of being a dwarf who shaved his beardthere would be far more simple and obvious explanations for his origin. And in fact, in this revised world it is not entirely clear why were the four Pevensie children singled out for the Thrones of Narnia, over so many other humans in the world. […] Still, we just have to live with these discrepancies, and enjoy each Narnia book on its own merits.&quot;

===Accusations of gender stereotyping===

In later years, both Lewis and the &quot;Chronicles&quot; have been criticised (often by other authors of fantasy fiction) for gender role stereotyping, though other authors have defended Lewis in this area. Most allegations of sexism centre on the description of Susan Pevensie in &quot;The Last Battle&quot; when Lewis writes that Susan is &quot;no longer a friend of Narnia&quot; and interested &quot;in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations&quot;.

Philip Pullman, inimical to Lewis on many fronts, calls the &quot;Narnia&quot; stories &quot;monumentally disparaging of women&quot;. His interpretation of the Susan passages reflects this view:
In fantasy author Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;The Problem of Susan&quot; (2004), an elderly woman, Professor Hastings, deals with the grief and trauma of her entire family&#x27;s death in a train crash. Although the woman&#x27;s maiden name is not revealed, details throughout the story strongly imply that this character is the elderly Susan Pevensie. The story is written for an adult audience and deals with issues of sexuality and violence and through it Gaiman presents a critique of Lewis&#x27;s treatment of Susan, as well as the problem of evil as it relates to punishment and salvation.

Lewis supporters cite the positive roles of women in the series, including Jill Pole in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, Aravis Tarkheena in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, Polly Plummer in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew,&quot; and particularly Lucy Pevensie in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Alan Jacobs, an English professor at Wheaton College, asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series (Jacobs, 2008: 259). In her contribution to &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy&quot;, Karin Fry, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, notes that &quot;the most sympathetic female characters in &quot;The Chronicles&quot; are consistently the ones who question the traditional roles of women and prove their worth to Aslan through actively engaging in the adventures just like the boys.&quot; Fry goes on to say:
Nathan Ross notes that &quot;Much of the plot of &#x27;Wardrobe&#x27; is told exclusively from the point of view of Susan and Lucy. It is the girls who witness Aslan being killed and coming back to life – a unique experience from which the boys are excluded. Throughout, going through many highly frightening and shocking moments, Susan and Lucy behave with grown up courage and responsibility. Their experiences are told in full, over several chapters, while what the boys do at the same time – preparing an army and going into battle – is relegated to the background. This arrangement of material clearly implies that what girls saw and did was the more important. Given the commonly held interpretation – that Aslan is Jesus Christ and that what the girls saw was a no less than a reenacting of the Crucifixion – this order of priorities makes perfect sense&quot;.

Taking a different stance altogether, Monika B. Hilder provides a thorough examination of the feminine ethos apparent in each book of the series, and proposes that critics tend to misread Lewis&#x27;s representation of gender. As she puts it &quot;...we assume that Lewis is sexist when he is in fact applauding the &#x27;feminine&#x27; heroic. To the extent that we have not examined our own chauvinism, we demean the &#x27;feminine&#x27; qualities and extol the &#x27;masculine&#x27; – not noticing that Lewis does the opposite.&quot;

===Accusations of racism===

In addition to sexism, Pullman and others have also accused the Narnia series of fostering racism. Over the alleged racism in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, newspaper editor Kyrie O&#x27;Connor wrote:
Gregg Easterbrook, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, stated that &quot;the Calormenes, are unmistakable Muslim stand-ins&quot;, while novelist Philip Hensher raises specific concerns that a reader might gain the impression that Islam is a &quot;Satanic cult&quot;. In rebuttal to this charge, at an address to a C. S. Lewis conference, Devin Brown argued that there are too many dissimilarities between the Calormene religion and Islam, particularly in the areas of polytheism and human sacrifice, for Lewis&#x27;s writing to be regarded as critical of Islam.

Nicholas Wanberg has argued, echoing claims by Mervyn Nicholson, that accusations of racism in the books are &quot;an oversimplification&quot;, but he asserts that the stories employ beliefs about human aesthetics, including equating dark skin with ugliness, that have been traditionally associated with racist thought.

Critics also argue whether Lewis&#x27;s work presents a positive or negative view of colonialism. Nicole DuPlessis favors the anticolonial view, claiming &quot;the negative effects of colonial exploitations and the themes of animals&#x27; rights and responsibility to the environment are emphasized in Lewis&#x27;s construction of a community of living things. Through the negative examples of illegitimate rulers, Lewis constructs the &#x27;correct&#x27; relationship between humans and nature, providing examples of rulers like Caspian who fulfil their responsibilities to the environment.&quot; Clare Etcherling counters with her claim that &quot;those &#x27;illegitimate&#x27; rulers are often very dark-skinned&quot; and that the only &quot;legitimate rulers are those sons and daughters of Adam and Eve who adhere to Christian conceptions of morality and stewardship – either white English children (such as Peter) or Narnians who possess characteristics valued and cultivated by the British (such as Caspian).&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
Various books from &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; have been adapted for television over the years.

&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was first adapted in 1967. Comprising ten episodes of thirty minutes each, the screenplay was written by Trevor Preston, and directed by Helen Standage.

&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was adapted again in 1979, this time as an animated cartoon co-produced by Bill Melendez and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, with a screenplay by David D. Connell.

Between 1988 and 1990, the first four books (as published) were adapted by the BBC as three TV serials. They were also aired in America on the PBS/Disney show WonderWorks. They were nominated for a total of 16 awards, including an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot; and a number of BAFTA awards including Best Children&#x27;s Programme (Entertainment/Drama) in 1988, 1989 and 1990.

=== Film ===
==== Walden Media ====

Sceptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically, Lewis never sold the film rights to the &quot;Narnia&quot; series. In answering a letter with a question posed by a child in 1957, asking if the Narnia series could please be on television, C. S. Lewis wrote back: &quot;They&#x27;d be no good on TV. Humanised beasts can&#x27;t be presented to the &quot;eye&quot; without at once becoming either hideous or ridiculous. I wish the idiots who run the film world [would] realize that there are stories which are for the &quot;ear&quot; alone.&quot;

The first novel adapted was &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. Released in December 2005, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was produced by Walden Media, distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, and directed by Andrew Adamson, with a screenplay by Ann Peacock, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The second novel adapted was &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;. Released in 2008, it was co-produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures, co-written and directed by Andrew Adamson, with Screenwriters including Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely. In December 2008, Disney pulled out of financing the remainder of the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; film series. However, Walden Media and 20th Century Fox eventually co-produced &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, which was released in December 2010.

In May 2012, producer Douglas Gresham confirmed that Walden Media&#x27;s contract with the C.S. Lewis Estate had expired, and that there was a moratorium on producing any &quot;Narnia&quot; films outside of Walden Media. On 1 October 2013, it was announced that the C.S. Lewis Company had entered into an agreement with the Mark Gordon Company to jointly develop and produce &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair&quot;. On 26 April 2017, Joe Johnston was hired to direct the film. In October, Johnston said filming is expected to begin in late 2018. In November 2018, these plans were halted because Netflix had begun developing adaptations of the entire series.

==== Netflix ====
On 3 October 2018, the C.S. Lewis Company announced that Netflix had acquired the rights to new film and television series adaptations of the &quot;Narnia&quot; books. According to &quot;Fortune&quot;, this was the first time that rights to the entire &quot;Narnia&quot; catalogue had been held by a single company. Entertainment One, which had acquired production rights to a fourth &quot;Narnia&quot; film, also joined the series. Mark Gordon, Douglas Gresham and Vincent Sieber were announced as executive producers.

===Radio===
The BBC produced dramatisations of all seven novels starting in the late 1980s and running into the 90s starring Maurice Denham as Professor Kirke. They were Originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 In the UK. BBC Audiobooks released both audio cassette and compact disc versions of the series.

Between 1998 and 2002, Focus on the Family produced radio dramatisations by Paul McCusker of the entire series through its Radio Theatre programme. Over one hundred performers took part including Paul Scofield as the storyteller and David Suchet as Aslan. Accompanied by an original orchestral score and cinema-quality digital sound design, the series was hosted by Lewis&#x27;s stepson Douglas Gresham and ran for just over 22 hours. Recordings of the entire adaptation were released on compact disc between 1999 and 2003.

===Stage===
Many stage adaptations of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; have been produced over the years.

In 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; at London&#x27;s Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from &quot;The Chronicles&quot; were also staged, including &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; (1986), &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; (1990).

In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; that Douglas Gresham, Lewis&#x27;s stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis&#x27;s intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.

The Royal Shakespeare Company premiered &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey. The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards.

In 2022, The Logos Theater, of Taylors, South Carolina, created a stage adaptation of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, with later performances at the Museum of the Bible and Ark Encounter.

<doc id="30689" wikidata="Q1363603" url="?curid=30689" title="Take Me Out to the Ball Game">
<text>&quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; is a 1908 Tin Pan Alley song by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer which has become the unofficial anthem of North American baseball, although neither of its authors had attended a game before writing the song. The song&#x27;s chorus is traditionally sung as part of the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game. Fans are generally encouraged to sing along, and at many ballparks, the words &quot;home team&quot; are replaced with the team name.

&quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; is one of the three-most recognizable songs in the US, along with &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; However, most people are only familiar with the chorus.

==History==
Jack Norworth, while riding a subway train, was inspired by a sign that said &quot;Baseball Today – Polo Grounds&quot;. In the song, Katie&#x27;s (and later Nelly&#x27;s) beau calls to ask her out to see a show. She accepts the date, but only if her date will take her out to the baseball game. The words were set to music by Albert Von Tilzer. (Norworth and Von Tilzer finally saw their first Major League Baseball games 32 and 20 years later, respectively.) The song was first sung by Norworth&#x27;s then-wife Nora Bayes and popularized by many other vaudeville acts. It was played at a ballpark for the first known time in 1934, at a high-school game in Los Angeles; it was played later that year during the fourth game of the 1934 World Series.

Norworth wrote an alternative version of the song in 1927. (Norworth and Bayes were famous for writing and performing such smash hits as &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot;.) With the sale of so many records, sheet music, and piano rolls, the song became one of the most popular hits of 1908. The Haydn Quartet singing group, led by popular tenor Harry MacDonough, recorded a successful version on Victor Records.

Its use became popularized by Harry Caray, the announcer of the Chicago White Sox, when he began singing it during the seventh-inning stretch in 1976. He continued the tradition when he became the announcer for the Chicago Cubs in 1982 and games were nationally broadcast.

The most famous recording of the song was credited to &quot;Billy Murray and the Haydn Quartet&quot;, even though Murray did not sing on it. The confusion, nonetheless, is so pervasive that, when &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America as one of the 365 top &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;, the song was credited to Billy Murray, implying his recording of it as having received the most votes among songs from the first decade. The first recorded version was by Edward Meeker. Meeker&#x27;s recording was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Below are the lyrics of the 1908 version, which is out of copyright.

Though not so indicated in the lyrics, the chorus is usually sung with a pause in the middle of the word &quot;Cracker&quot;, giving &#x27;Cracker Jack&#x27; a pronunciation &quot;Crac—ker Jack&quot;. Also, there is a noticeable pause between the first and second words &quot;root&quot;.

==Recordings==
The song (or at least its chorus) has been recorded or cited countless times since it was written. The original music and 1908 lyrics of the song are now in the public domain in the United States (worldwide copyright remains until 70 years after the composers&#x27; deaths). The copyright to the revised 1927 lyrics entered the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2023. It has been used as an instrumental underscore or introduction to many films or skits having to do with baseball.

The first verse of the 1927 version is sung by Dan Hornsby for Columbia Records 1544-D (148277). The Hoosier Hot Shots recorded the song in 1936. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra at the start of the MGM musical film, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; (1949), a movie that also features a song about the famous and fictitious double play combination, &quot;O&#x27;Brien to Ryan to Goldberg&quot;.

In the early to mid-1980s, the Kidsongs Kids recorded a different version of this song for &quot;A Day at Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, a Major League Baseball ad campaign featured versions of the song performed by musicians of several different genres. An alternative rock version by the Goo Goo Dolls was also recorded. Multiple genre Louisiana singer-songwriter Dr. John and pop singer Carly Simon both recorded different versions of the song for the PBS documentary series &quot;Baseball&quot;, by Ken Burns.

In 2001, Nike aired a commercial featuring a diverse group of Major League Baseball players singing lines of the song in their native languages. The players and languages featured were Ken Griffey Jr. (American English), Alex Rodriguez (Caribbean Spanish), Chan Ho Park (Korean), Kazuhiro Sasaki (Japanese), Graeme Lloyd (Australian English), Éric Gagné (Québécois French), Andruw Jones (Dutch), John Franco (Italian), Iván Rodríguez (Caribbean Spanish), and Mark McGwire (American English).

==In popular culture==
The iconic song has been used and alluded to in many different ways since its inception.
*The 2001 children&#x27;s book &quot;Take Me Out of the Bathtub and other Silly Dilly Songs&quot; by Alan Katz and David Catrow, featuring silly words to well-known tunes, recast the end of the chorus as &quot;I used one, two, three bars of soap. Take me out...I&#x27;m clean!&quot; in its title number.
*In 2002, as a bonus feature in the video game &quot;MLB Slugfest 2003&quot;, nu metal band Dry Kill Logic recorded an original song (alongside an accompanying music video) for the game entitled &quot;Riot at the Bat Rack&quot;, which is loosely based on &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;.
*In 2006, Jim Burke authored and illustrated a children&#x27;s book version of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;.
*In 2008, Andy Strasberg, Bob Thompson and Tim Wiles (from the Baseball Hall of Fame) wrote a comprehensive book on the history of the song, &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Hit: The Story of &#x27;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;&#x27;. The book, published by Hal Leonard Books, included a CD with 16 different recordings of the song from various points in time, ranging from a 1908 recording by Fred Lambert, to a seventh-inning-stretch recording by Harry Caray.
*Also in 2008, a parody of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; was sung during an episode of the third season of the American game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; on NBC. The contestant of that episode, Garrett Smith, was a baseball aficionado and a proud Atlanta Braves fan who even hoped to play for the team as a catcher. However, the lyrics were changed to lyrics that showed disdain for Smith, as this was a song that was penned by the Banker who then encouraged the in-studio audience to sing it to him.
*From March 13, 2015, the tune of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; was adopted as the departure melody for trains on the Tokyo Metro Namboku Line at Kōrakuen Station in Tokyo, Japan. Baseball is popular in Japan, and Korakuen Station is one of the closest stations to the Tokyo Dome baseball stadium.
*In September 2016, the Miami Marlins paid tribute to the pitcher José Fernández, who had died in a boating accident earlier that month, with a trumpet rendition during a pregame ceremony.
*In October 2016, actor Bill Murray, a Chicago Cubs fan, impersonated Daffy Duck as he gave his rendition of the chorus of &#x27;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&#x27; while at game 3 of the 2016 World Series, held at Wrigley Field.
*The piece for narrator and orchestra &quot;Lifting the Curse&quot; with music by Julian Wachner and spoken text by Bill Littlefield extensively quotes the song in full orchestral array. It has been recorded on CD with The Landmarks Orchestra (Boston), Littlefield narrating.
*Prior to the NWSL&#x27;s Chicago Red Stars game against Bay FC at Wrigley Field on June 8, 2024, the Red Stars created a promotional video at the stadium featuring a modified version of the song that referenced soccer instead of baseball. The video also honored to Katie Casey, the original subject of the song.
*On July 5, 2024, during a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers game&#x27;s 7th inning stretch, popular VTuber Gawr Gura performed the song at Dodger Stadium as part of a promotional crossover between Hololive Production and Major League Baseball. Accordingly, the lyric &quot;the home team&quot; was changed to &quot;the Dodgers&quot; in her performance.
*The second episode of the 2024 Philippine drama &quot;Pulang Araw&quot; featured the song&#x27;s chorus.

== Recognition and awards ==
* 2008: The song won the Songwriters Hall of Fame Towering Song Award

<text>Tai chi is an ancient Chinese martial art. Initially developed for combat and self-defense, for most practitioners it has evolved into a sport and form of exercise. As an exercise, tai chi is performed as gentle, low-impact movement in which practitioners perform a series of deliberate, flowing motions while focusing on deep, slow breaths. Often referred to as &quot;meditation in motion&quot;, tai chi aims to concentrate and balance the body&#x27;s &quot;qi&quot; (vital energy), providing benefits to mental and physical health.

Many forms of tai chi are practiced, both traditional and modern. While the precise origins are not known, the earliest documented practice is from Chen Village and Zhabao Village in Henan, which are located a few hundred miles from the Shaolin Monastery on Song Mountain. Most modern styles trace their development to the five traditional schools: Chen, Yang, Wu (Hao), Wu, and Sun. Practitioners such as Yang Chengfu and Sun Lutang in the early 20th century promoted the art for its health benefits. Tai chi was included in the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;tai chi&quot;, the most common English spelling, is not a standard romanization of the Chinese name for the art (). The Chinese name was first commonly written in English using the Wade–Giles system as &quot;&quot;tai chi chüan&quot;. But English speakers abbreviated it to &quot;tai chi&quot;&quot; and dropped the mark of aspiration. Since the late twentieth century, pinyin has been officially adopted in China and replaced Wade–Giles as the most popular system for romanizing Chinese. In pinyin, tai chi is spelled &quot;taijiquan&quot; (). In English, tai chi is sometimes referred to as &quot;shadowboxing&quot;.

The etymology of tai chi&#x27;s Chinese name is somewhat uncertain because of the lack of a record of spoken usage. Before the mid-nineteenth century, it appears that outsiders generically described the art as &quot;zhanquan&quot; (, &quot;touch boxing&quot;), &quot;Long Boxing&quot;(), &quot;mianquan&quot; or &quot;shisan shi&quot; (, &quot;the thirteen techniques&quot;). In the mid-nineteenth century, the art began to be associated with the philosophy of &quot;taiji&quot; (see Conceptual background). This association may have originated in the writings of the founders of Wu (Hao)-style tai chi, perhaps inspired by a tai chi classic attributed to the semi-mythical Wang Zongyue that begins with the words &quot;&quot;Taiji&quot; is born from &quot;Wuji&quot;; it is the mother of Yin and Yang&quot;. However, as the Wu (Hao) founders had no financial need to promote their art, their contributions to the &quot;tai chi classics&quot; were not distributed widely for many years. The first public association between &quot;taiji&quot; and the art was a poem by Imperial Court scholar Weng Tonghe describing a tai chi performance by Yang Luchan. It is not clear whether Weng was making a new connection or whether the new name was already in use. Written evidence for the Yang family&#x27;s adoption of the name &quot;taiji&quot; first appeared in a later text, possibly completed in 1875 by Yang Luchan&#x27;s son, Yang Banhou, or no later than the first decade of the twentieth century by one or more of Yang Banhou&#x27;s disciples. By the second decade of the twentieth century, Yang Chengfu&#x27;s disciples and Sun Lutang were using the term &quot;taijiquan&quot; in their publications, including in the titles of some of the tai chi classics. It then appeared in a book by a Chen family member, Chen Xin, published after he died in 1929.

== Philosophical background ==
Chinese philosophy, particularly Taoist and Confucian thought, forms the conceptual background to tai chi. Early tai chi texts include embedded quotations from early Chinese classics like the &quot;I Ching&quot;, &quot;Great Learning&quot;, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, as well as from famous Chinese thinkers like Zhu Xi, Zhou Dunyi, and Mencius.

Early tai chi sources are grounded in &quot;Taiji&quot; cosmology. &quot;Taiji&quot; cosmology appears in both Taoist and Confucian philosophy, where it represents the single source or mother of yin and yang (represented by the &quot;taijitu&quot; symbol ). Tai chi also draws on Chinese theories of the body, particularly Taoist &quot;neidan&quot; (internal alchemy) teachings on &quot;qi&quot; (vital energy) and on the three &quot;dantian&quot;. Cheng Man-ch&#x27;ing emphasizes the Taoist background of tai chi and states that it &quot;enables us to reach the stage of undifferentiated pure yang, which is exactly the same as Laozi&#x27;s &#x27;concentrating the qi and developing softness&#x27;&quot;.

As such, tai chi considers itself an &quot;internal&quot; (&quot;neijia&quot;) martial art focused on developing &quot;qi&quot;. In China, tai chi is categorized under the &quot;Wudang&quot; group of Chinese martial arts—that is, arts applied with internal power. Although the term &quot;Wudang&quot; suggests these arts originated in the Wudang Mountains, it is used only to distinguish the skills, theories, and applications of &quot;neijia&quot; from those of the Shaolin grouping, or &quot;waijia&quot; (hard/external styles).

Tai chi also adopts the Taoist ideals of softness overcoming hardness, of &quot;wu wei&quot; (effortless action), and of yielding into its martial art technique while also retaining Taoist ideas of spiritual self-cultivation.

Tai chi&#x27;s path is one of developing naturalness by relaxing, attending inward, and slowing mind, body, and breath. This allows the practitioner to become less tense, to drop conditioned habits, to let go of thoughts, to allow &quot;qi&quot; to flow smoothly, and thus to flow with the &quot;Tao&quot;. It is thus a kind of moving meditation that allows us to let go of the self and experience no-mind (&quot;wuxin&quot;) and spontaneity (&quot;ziran&quot;).

A key aspect of tai chi philosophy is to work with the flow of &quot;yin&quot; (softness) and &quot;yang&quot; (hardness) elements. When two forces push each other with equal force, neither side moves. Motion cannot occur until one side yields. Therefore, a key principle in tai chi is to avoid using force directly against force (hardness against hardness). Laozi provided the archetype for this in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; when he wrote, &quot;The soft and the pliable will defeat the hard and strong.&quot; Conversely, when in possession of leverage, one may want to use hardness to force the opponent to become soft. Traditionally, tai chi uses both soft and hard. Yin is said to be the mother of Yang, using soft power to create hard power.

Traditional schools also emphasize that one is expected to show &quot;wude&quot; (&quot;martial virtue/heroism&quot;), to protect the defenseless, and to show mercy to one&#x27;s opponents.

In December 2020, the 15th regular session of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage included tai chi in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

== Practice ==
Traditionally, the foundational tai chi practice consists of learning and practicing a specific solo forms or routines (&quot;taolu)&quot;. This entails learning a routine sequence of movements that emphasize a straight spine, abdominal breathing and a natural range of motion. Tai chi relies on knowing the appropriate change in response to outside forces, as well as on yielding to and redirecting an attack, rather than meeting it with opposing force. Physical fitness is also seen as an important step towards effective self-defense.

Tai chi movements were inspired by animals, especially birds and leopards.

There are also numerous other supporting solo practices such as:
* Sitting meditation: The empty, focus and calm the mind and aid in opening the microcosmic orbit.
* Standing meditation (&quot;zhan zhuang&quot;) to raise the &quot;yang qi&quot;
* &quot;Qigong&quot; to mobilize the &quot;qi&quot;
* Acupressure massage to develop awareness of &quot;qi&quot; channels
* Traditional Chinese medicine is taught to advanced students in some traditional schools.

There is no scientific evidence for the existence of qi,
nor any demonstrating the effectiveness of acupressure
or traditional Chinese medicine
beyond that of placebo treatment.

Further training entails learning &quot;tuishou&quot; (push hands drills)&quot;, sanshou&quot; (striking techniques), free sparring, grappling training, and weapons training.

The fundamental training concepts of the art are detailed in a few dozen classical texts originally written in classical Chinese by tai chi masters, the &quot;tai chi classics&quot;. In these texts, it is noted that the physiological and kinesiological aspects of the body&#x27;s movements are characterized by the circular motion and rotation of the pelvis, based on the metaphors of the pelvis as the hub and the arms and feet as the spokes of a wheel. Furthermore, the respiration of breath is coordinated with the physical movements in a state of deep relaxation, rather than muscular tension.

Tai chi is a complete martial art system with a full range of bare-hand movement sets and weapon forms, such as the &quot;jian&quot; (straight sword), &quot;dao&quot; (curved sword), and &quot;qiang&quot; (spear), which are based on the dynamic relationship between &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;. While tai chi is typified by its slow movements, many styles (including the three most popular: Yang, Wu, and Chen) have secondary, faster-paced forms. Some traditional schools teach martial applications of the postures of different forms (taolu).

=== Solo practices ===


&quot;Taolu&quot; (solo &quot;forms&quot;) are choreographed sets of movements practiced alone or in unison as a group. Tai chi is often characterized by slow movements in Taolu practice, and one of the reasons is to develop body awareness. Accurate, repeated practice of the solo routine is said to retrain posture, encourage circulation throughout students&#x27; bodies, maintain flexibility, and familiarize students with the martial sequences implied by the forms. Usually performed standing, solo forms have also been adapted for seated practice.

=== Weapon practice ===

Tai chi practices involving weapons also exist. Weapons training and fencing applications often employ:
* the &quot;jian&quot;, a straight double-edged sword, practiced as &quot;taijijian&quot;;
* the &quot;dao&quot;, a heavier curved saber, sometimes called a broadsword;
* the &quot;tieshan&quot;, a folding fan, also called &quot;shan&quot; and practiced as &quot;taijishan&quot;;
* the &quot;gun&quot;, a 2 m long wooden staff and practiced as &quot;taijigun&quot;;
* the &quot;qiang&quot;, a 2 m long spear or a 4 m long lance.

More exotic weapons include:
* the large &quot;dadao&quot; and &quot;podao&quot; sabres;
* the &quot;ji&quot;, or halberd;
* the cane;
* the &quot;sheng biao&quot;, or rope dart;
* the &quot;sanjiegun&quot;, or three sectional staff;
* the &quot;feng huo lun&quot;, or wind-and-fire wheels;
* the lasso;
* the whip, chain whip and steel whip.
== History ==
=== Early development ===
Tai chi&#x27;s formative influences came from practices undertaken in Taoist and Buddhist monasteries, such as Wudang, Shaolin, and The Thousand Year Temple in Henan. The early development of tai chi proper is connected with Henan&#x27;s Thousand Year Temple and a nexus of nearby villages: Chen Village, Tang Village, Wangbao Village, and Zhaobao Town. These villages were closely connected, shared an interest in the martial arts and many went to study at Thousand Year Temple (which was a syncretic temple with elements from the three teachings). documents from these villages, mostly dating to the 17th century, are some of the earliest sources for the practice of tai chi.

Some traditionalists claim that tai chi is a purely Chinese art that comes from ancient Taoism and Confucianism. These schools believe that tai chi theory and practice were formulated by Taoist monk Zhang Sanfeng in the 12th century. These stories are often filled with legendary and hagiographical content and lack historical support.

Modern historians point out that the earliest reference indicating a connection between Zhang Sanfeng and martial arts is actually a 17th-century piece called &quot;Epitaph for Wang Zhengnan&quot; (1669), composed by Huang Zongxi (1610–1695). Aside from this single source, the other claims of connections between tai chi and Zhang Sanfeng appeared no earlier than the 19th century. According to Douglas Wile, &quot;there is no record of a Zhang Sanfeng in the Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there is no mention in the Ming (1368–1644) histories or hagiographies of Zhang Sanfeng of any connection between the immortal and the martial arts.&quot;

Another common theory for the origin of tai chi is that it was created by Chen Wangting (1580–1660) while living in Chen Village (陳家溝), Henan. The other four contemporary traditional tai chi styles (Yang, Sun, Wu and Wu/Hao) trace their teachings back to Chen village in the early 1800s.

Yang Luchan (1799–1872), the founder of the popular Yang style, trained with the Chen family for 18 years before he started to teach in Beijing, which strongly suggests that his work was heavily influenced by the Chen family art. Martial arts historian Xu Zhen claimed that the tai chi of Chen Village was influenced by the &quot;Taizu changquan&quot; style practiced at nearby Shaolin Monastery, while Tang Hao thought it was derived from a treatise by Ming dynasty general Qi Jiguang, &quot;Jixiao Xinshu&quot; (&quot;New Treatise on Military Efficiency&quot;), which discussed several martial arts styles including &quot;Taizu changquan&quot;.

=== Standardization ===

Under the Nationalist government, the Central Guo Shu Institute () in Chongqing under the direction of Chen Pan-ling () in 1936 created a unified form combining elements of Chen, Yang, Sun and Wu forms. This was called Guo Shu Taiji (). After the retreat of the Nationalists to Taiwan in 1949, Chen Pan-ling continued to propagate the form where it is now called 99 Taiji. This frame formed the structure of Wang Shu-jin&#x27;s taiji form.

In 1956, the Chinese government sponsored the Chinese Sports Committee (CSC), which brought together four &quot;wushu&quot; teachers to truncate the Yang family hand form to 24 postures. This was an attempt to standardize tai chi for &quot;wushu&quot; tournaments as they wanted to create a routine that would be much less difficult to learn than the classical 88 to 108 posture solo hand forms.

Another 1950s form is the &quot;97 movements combined tai chi form&quot;, which blends Yang, Wu, Sun, Chen, and Fu styles.

In 1976, they developed a slightly longer demonstration form that would not require the traditional forms&#x27; memory, balance, and coordination. This became the &quot;Combined 48 Forms&quot; that were created by three &quot;wushu&quot; coaches, headed by Men Hui Feng. The combined forms simplified and combined classical forms from the original Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun styles. Other competitive forms were designed to be completed within a six-minute time limit.

In the late 1980s, CSC standardized more competition forms for the four major styles as well as combined forms. These five sets of forms were created by different teams, and later approved by a committee of &quot;wushu&quot; coaches in China. These forms were named after their style: the &quot;Chen-style national competition form&quot; is the &quot;56 Forms&quot;. The combined forms are &quot;The 42-Form&quot; or simply the &quot;Competition Form&quot;.

In the 11th Asian Games of 1990, &quot;wushu&quot; was included as an item for competition for the first time with the &quot;42-Form&quot; representing tai chi. The International Wushu Federation (IWUF) applied for &quot;wushu&quot; to be part of the Olympic games.

Tai chi was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2020 for China.

== Styles ==

=== Chinese origin ===
The five major styles of tai chi are named for the Chinese families who originated them:

* Chen style () of Chen Wangting (1580–1660)
* Yang style () of Yang Luchan (1799–1872)
* Wu/Hao style () of Wu Yuxiang (1812–1880) and Hao Weizhen (1842–1920)
* Wu style () of Wu Quanyou (1834–1902) and his son Wu Jianquan (1870–1942)
* Sun style () of Sun Lutang (1861–1932)

The most popular is Yang, followed by Wu, Chen, Sun, and Wu/Hao. The styles share underlying theory, but their training differs.

Dozens of new styles, hybrid styles, and offshoots followed, although the family schools are accepted as standard by the international community. Other important styles are Zhaobao tai chi, a close cousin of Chen style, which is recognized by Western practitioners; Fu style, created by Fu Zhensong, which evolved from Chen, Sun and Yang styles, and incorporates movements from &quot;baguazhang&quot;; and Cheng Man-ch&#x27;ing style, which simplifies Yang style.

Around the world in the 20th and 21st centuries, some Chinese emigrants who had learned tai chi in China continued to practice it together in their new communities.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====
Choy Hok Pang, a disciple of Yang Chengfu, was the first known proponent of tai chi to openly teach in the United States, beginning in 1939. His son and student Choy Kam Man emigrated to San Francisco from Hong Kong in 1949 to teach tai chi in Chinatown. Choy Kam Man taught until he died in 1994.

Sophia Delza, a professional dancer and student of Ma Yueliang, performed the first known public demonstration of tai chi in the United States at the New York City Museum of Modern Art in 1954. She wrote the first English language book on tai chi, &quot;T&#x27;ai-chi Ch&#x27;üan: Body and Mind in Harmony&quot;, in 1961. She taught regular classes at Carnegie Hall, the Actors Studio, and the United Nations.

Cheng Man-ch&#x27;ing opened his school Shr Jung tai chi after he moved to New York from Taiwan in 1964. Unlike the older generation of practitioners, Cheng was cultured and educated in American ways, and thus was able to transcribe Yang&#x27;s dictation into a written manuscript that became the de facto manual for Yang style. Cheng felt Yang&#x27;s traditional 108-movement form was unnecessarily long and repetitive, which makes it difficult to learn. He thus created a shortened 37-movement version that he taught in his schools. Cheng&#x27;s form became the dominant form in the eastern United States until other teachers immigrated in larger numbers in the 1990s. He taught until his death in 1975.

==== Canada ====
Moy Lin-shin arrived in Toronto, Canada, from China in 1970, where he started teaching tai chi and related internal arts.

=== Europe ===
==== United Kingdom ====
Norwegian Pytt Geddes was the first European to teach tai chi in Britain, holding classes at The Place in London in the early 1960s. She had first encountered tai chi in Shanghai in 1948, and studied with Choy Hok Pang and his son Choy Kam Man (who both also taught in the United States) while living in Hong Kong in the late 1950s.

== Yin and yang ==

More traditional practitioners hold that the two aspects of health and martial arts make up the art&#x27;s &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;. The &quot;family&quot; schools present their teachings in a martial art context, whatever the intention of their students.

== Health ==

Tai chi&#x27;s health training concentrates on relieving stress on the body and mind. In the 21st century, tai chi classes that purely emphasize health are popular in hospitals, clinics, community centers and senior centers. Tai chi&#x27;s low-stress training method for seniors has become better known.

Clinical studies exploring tai chi&#x27;s effect on specific diseases and health conditions exist, though there are insufficient studies with consistent approaches to generate a comprehensive conclusion.

Tai chi has been promoted for treating various ailments, and is supported by the Parkinson&#x27;s Foundation and Diabetes Australia, among others. However, medical evidence of effectiveness is lacking. A 2017 systematic review found that it decreased falls in older people.

A 2011 comprehensive overview of systematic reviews of tai chi recommended tai chi to older people for its physical and psychological benefits. It found positive results for fall prevention and overall mental health. No conclusive evidence showed benefit for most of the conditions researched, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diabetes, cancer and arthritis.

A 2015 systematic review found that tai chi could be performed by those with chronic medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and osteoarthritis without negative effects, and found favorable effects on functional exercise capacity.

In 2015 the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to identify any that were suitable for coverage by health insurance. Tai chi was one of 17 therapies evaluated. The study concluded that low-quality evidence suggests that tai chi may have some beneficial health effects when compared to control in a limited number of populations for a limited number of outcomes.

A 2020 review of 13 studies found that tai chi had positive effect on the quality of life and depressive symptoms of older adults with chronic conditions who lived in community settings.

In 2022, the U.S.A agency the National Institutes of Health published an analysis of various health claims, studies and findings. They concluded the evidence was of low quality, but that it appears to have a small positive effect on quality of life.

=== Sport and self-defense ===

In its martial aspect, tai chi emphasizes defense over attack, and replies to hard forces with soft forces and vice versa.

Practitioners test their skills against students from other schools and martial arts styles in &quot;tuishou&quot; (&quot;pushing hands&quot;) and &quot;sanshou&quot; competition.

<text>Lisa Beamer (née Brosious; born April 10, 1969) is an American writer. The widow of Todd Beamer, a victim of the United Airlines Flight 93 crash as part of the September 11 attacks against the United States in 2001, she has become best known for her actions following the disaster.

She is a 1991 graduate of Wheaton College; she gave the 2011 commencement address at Wheaton.

==Post-9/11 career==
At the time of the attacks, Lisa Beamer was five months pregnant with her daughter, Morgan Kay, who was born on January 9, 2002. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the pregnant Beamer had a high profile, with more than 200 media appearances in six months. She was introduced by President George W. Bush at a commemoration ceremony. Shortly after the attacks, she set up the Todd M. Beamer Memorial Foundation, which was initially run by a family friend. The organization sought to trademark the phrase &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll,&quot; which was the subject of some criticism after some accused her of seeking to profit from her husband&#x27;s death.

In 2003, Beamer and co-author Ken Abraham wrote a book about Todd and her attempts to deal with her grief over his death, &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll!: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Courage&quot;, about Todd and Beamer&#x27;s life before the crash and her life since. Royalties from the book were donated to the Todd M. Beamer Foundation, which was founded in 2001 by Beamer and others to help children who have suffered trauma. The organization was later renamed Heroic Choices. As of 2007, Heroic Choices was struggling to maintain financial viability. According to the Board Chair, &quot;[as with any charity created after 9/11], the farther you get away from the event, the more difficult it is to raise funds.&quot;

<doc id="30696" wikidata="Q849158" url="?curid=30696" title="Green Party of the United States">
<text>The Green Party of the United States (GPUS) is a federation of Green state political parties in the United States. The party promotes green politics, specifically environmentalism; nonviolence; social justice; participatory democracy; anti-war; anti-racism. it is the fourth-largest political party in the United States by voter registration, behind the Libertarian Party.

The direct predecessor of the GPUS was the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). In the late 1990s, the ASGP, which formed in 1996, had increasingly distanced itself from the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA), America&#x27;s then-primary green organization which had formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence, a collection of local green groups active since 1984. In 2001, the GPUS was officially founded as the ASGP split from the G/GPUSA. After its founding, the GPUS soon became the primary national green organization in the country, surpassing the G/GPUSA. John Rensenbrink and Howie Hawkins were co-founders of the Green Party.

The Greens (as ASGP) first gained widespread public attention during the 2000 presidential election, when the ticket composed of Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke won 2.7% of the popular vote, raising questions as to whether they spoiled the election in favor of George W. Bush. Nader has dismissed the notion that he and other Green candidates are spoilers.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The political movement that began in 1985 as the decentralized Committees of Correspondence evolved into a more centralized structure by 1990, opening a national clearinghouse and forming governing bodies, bylaws and a platform as the Green Committees of Correspondence; by 1990, it was known simply as The Greens. The organization conducted grassroots organizing efforts, educational activities and electoral campaigns.

Internal divisions arose between members who saw electoral politics as ultimately corrupting and supported the notion of an &quot;anti-party party&quot; formed by Petra Kelly and other leaders of the Greens in Germany vs. those who saw electoral strategies as a crucial engine of social change. A struggle for the direction of the organization culminated in a &quot;compromise agreement&quot;, ratified in 1990 at the Greens National Congress in Elkins, West Virginia and in which both strategies would be accommodated within the same 527 political organization renamed the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA). It was recognized by the FEC as a national political party in 1991.

The compromise agreement subsequently collapsed and two Green Party organizations co-existed in the United States until 2019 when the Greens/Green Party USA was dissolved. The Green Politics Network was organized in 1990 and the National Association of Statewide Green Parties formed by 1994. Divisions between those pressing to break onto the national political stage and those aiming to grow roots at the local level continued to widen during the 1990s. The Association of State Green Parties (ASGP) encouraged and backed Nader&#x27;s presidential runs in 1996 and 2000. By 2001, the push to separate electoral activity from the G/GPUSA issue-based organizing led to the Boston Proposal and the subsequent rise of the Green Party of the United States. The G/GPUSA lost most of its affiliates in the next few months and dropped its FEC national party status in the year 2005.

== Structure and composition ==
=== Committees ===
The Green Party has two national committees recognized by the Federal Election Commission (FEC):
* The Green National Committee (GNC)
* The Green Senatorial Campaign Committee (GSCC)

==== Green National Committee ====

The GNC is composed of delegates elected by affiliated state parties. The state parties also appoint delegates to serve on the various standing committees of the GNC. The National Committee elects a steering committee of seven co-chairs, a secretary and a treasurer to oversee daily operations. The National Committee performs most of its business online, but it also holds an annual national meeting to conduct business in person.

=== Caucuses ===
Five Identity Caucuses have achieved representation on the GNC:
* National Black Caucus
* Latinx Caucus
* Lavender Greens Caucus (LGBTQIA+)
* National Women&#x27;s Caucus
* Young Ecosocialists

Other caucuses have worked toward formal recognition by the GNC:
* Disability Caucus
* Labor Caucus
* Indigenous Caucus
* Elder Caucus

== Ideology ==

=== Values ===
The Green Party of the United States follows the ideals of green politics, which are based on the Four Pillars, namely:
# Ecological wisdom,
# Social justice,
# Grassroots democracy, and
# Nonviolence.

The Ten Key Values, which expand upon the Four Pillars, are as follows:
# Grassroots democracy,
# Social justice and equal opportunity,
# Ecological wisdom,
# Nonviolence,
# Decentralization,
# Community-based economics,
# Feminism and gender equity,
# Respect for diversity,
# Personal and global responsibility, and
# Future focus and sustainability.

The Green Party doesn&#x27;t accept donations from corporations, political action committees (PACs), 527(c) organizations or soft money. The party&#x27;s platforms and rhetoric harshly criticize corporate influence and control over government, media, and society at large.

=== Eco-socialism ===
In 2016, the Green Party passed a motion in favor of rejecting both capitalism and state socialism, supporting instead an &quot;alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power&quot;. The motion states the change that the party says could be described as promoting &quot;ecological socialism&quot;, &quot;communalism&quot;, or perhaps the &quot;cooperative commonwealth&quot;. The Green Party rejection of both state socialism and capitalism and their promotion of communalism which was created by libertarian socialist Murray Bookchin places the Green Party into the ideology of libertarian socialism. The eco-socialist economy the Green Party of the United States wants to create is similar to the market socialist mutualist economics of Proudhon which consists of a large sector of democratically controlled public enterprises, a large sector of cooperative enterprises, and a smaller sector of small businesses and self-employed. Consumer goods and services would be sold to consumers in the market by cooperatives, public enterprises, and small businesses. Services that would be for free include health care, education, child care, and urban mass transit. Goods and services that would be available at low cost would include public housing, power, broadband, and water. Howie Hawkins who was nominated by the Green Party to run for president of the United States in 2020 identifies as a libertarian socialist.

== Political positions ==
=== Economic and social issues ===
==== Healthcare ====
The Green Party supports the implementation of a single-payer healthcare system and the abolition of private health insurance in the United States. They have also called for contraception and abortion procedures to be available on demand. The Green Party has called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, an act that prohibits the use of federal taxpayer funds for abortions, unless in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.

==== Education ====
The Green Party calls for providing tuition-free college at public universities and vocational schools, increasing funding for after-school and daycare programs, cancelling all student loan debt, and repealing the No Child Left Behind Act. They are strongly against the dissolution of public schools and the privatization of education.

==== Green New Deal ====
In 2006, the Green Party developed a Green New Deal that would ultimately serve as a transitional plan to a 100% clean, renewable energy including solar and wind energy by 2030 utilizing a carbon tax, jobs guarantee, tuition-free college, single-payer healthcare and a focus on using public programs.

Howie Hawkins focused his gubernatorial campaign on the Green New Deal, which was the first time the policy was introduced. Jill Stein also developed her presidential campaign based on the Green New Deal.

==== Criminal justice ====
The Green Party favors the abolition of the death penalty, repeal of three-strikes laws, banning of private prisons, legalization of marijuana, and decriminalization of other drugs.

==== Racial justice ====
The Green Party advocates for &quot;complete and full&quot; reparations to the African American community, as well the removal of the Confederate flag from all government buildings.

==== LGBT+ rights ====
The party supports same-sex marriage, the right of access to medical and surgical treatment for transgender and gender-nonconforming people, and withdrawing foreign aid to countries with poor LGBT+ rights records. The party opposes gender-critical feminism.

==== Youth rights ====
The party supports youth rights. They reject the idea that young people are property of their parents or guardians. They support providing mothers with prenatal care. They oppose child abuse and neglect and support young people&#x27;s rights to food, shelter, healthcare, and education. They support greater student input into their education and sex education and oppose advertisements in schools. They support lowering the voting age to 16.

==== Fundraising and position on Super PACs ====
In the early decades of Green organizing in the United States, the prevailing American system of money-dominated elections was universally rejected by Greens, so that some Greens were reluctant to have Greens participate in the election system at all because they deemed the campaign finance system inherently corrupt. Other Greens felt strongly that the Green Party should develop in the electoral arena and many of these Greens felt that adopting an alternative model of campaign finance, emphasizing self-imposed contribution limits, would present a wholesome and attractive contrast to the odious campaign finance practices of the money-dominated major parties.

Over the years, some state Green parties have come to place less emphasis on the principle of self-imposed limits than they did in the past. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that Green Party fundraising (for candidates&#x27; campaigns and for the party itself) still tends to rely on relatively small contributions and that Greens generally decry not only the rise of the Super PACs, but also the big-money system, which some Greens criticize as plutocracy.

Some Greens feel that the Green Party&#x27;s position should be simply to follow the laws and regulations of campaign finance. Other Greens argue that it would injure the Green Party not to practice a principled stand against the anti-democratic influence of money in the political process. Candidates for office, like Jill Stein, the 2012 and 2016 Green Party nominee for the President of the United States, typically rely on smaller donations to fund their campaigns.

=== Foreign policy ===
The Green Party calls on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, and sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and Non-Proliferation Treaty. Additionally, it supports cutting the defense budget in half, as well as prohibiting all arms sales to foreign countries.

The Green Party supports the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to decrease sanctions while limiting Iran&#x27;s capacity to make nuclear weapons.

The Green Party advocates for the Palestinian right of return and cutting all U.S. aid to Israel. It has also expressed support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. The Green Party supports &quot;...the creation of one secular, democratic state for Palestinians and Israelis on the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan as the national home of both peoples, with Jerusalem as its capital.&quot;

The Green Party called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war and condemned Israeli war crimes in the Gaza Strip.

== Membership ==
The Green Party&#x27;s membership encompasses the fourth-highest percentage of registered voters in the United States, with a total membership of 234,120.
The Green Party has its strongest popular support on the Pacific Coast, Upper Great Lakes, and Northeast, as reflected in the geographical distribution of Green candidates elected. , Californians have elected 55 of the 226 office-holding Greens nationwide. Other states with high numbers of Green elected officials include Pennsylvania (31), Wisconsin (23), Massachusetts (18) and Maine (17). Maine has the highest per capita number of Green elected officials in the country and the largest Green registration percentage with more than 29,273 Greens comprising 2.95% of the electorate . Madison, Wisconsin is the city with the most Green elected officials (8), followed by Portland, Maine (7).

The 2016 presidential campaign of Jill Stein got substantive support from counties and precincts with a high percentage of Native American population. For instance, in Sioux County (North Dakota, 84.1% Native American), Stein gained her best county-wide result: 10.4% of the votes. In Rolette County (also North Dakota, 77% Native American), she got 4.7% of the votes. Other majority Native American counties where Stein did above state average are Menominee (WI), Roosevelt (MT) and several precincts in Alaska.

At its peak in 2004, the Green Party had 319,000 registered members in states allowing party registration and tens of thousands of members and contributors in the rest of the country.

== Officeholders ==

, 143 officeholders in the United States were affiliated with the Green Party. The party has not had any representation in federal or statewide offices.

Previously in 2016, the majority of them were in California, several in Illinois, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with five or fewer in ten other states. These included one mayor and one deputy mayor and fourteen county or city commissioners (or equivalent). The remainder were members of school boards, clerks and other local administrative bodies and positions.

Several Green Party members have been elected to state-level office, though not always as affiliates of the party. John Eder was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, re-elected in 2004, but defeated in 2006. Audie Bock was elected to the California State Assembly in 1999, but switched her registration to independent seven months later running as such in the 2000 election. Richard Carroll was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2008, but switched parties to become a Democrat five months after his election. Fred Smith was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives in 2012, but re-registered as a Democrat in 2014. In 2010, former Green Party leader Ben Chipman was elected to the Maine House of Representatives as an unenrolled candidate and was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. He has since registered as a Democrat, and is serving in the Maine Senate.

Gayle McLaughlin was twice elected mayor of Richmond, California, defeating two Democrats in 2006 and then reelected in 2010; and elected to City Council in 2014 after completing her second term as mayor. With a population of over 100,000 people, it was the largest American city with a Green mayor. Fairfax, California; Arcata, California; Sebastopol, California; and New Paltz, New York are the only towns in the United States to have had a Green Party majority in their town councils. Twin Ridges Elementary in Nevada County, California held the first Green Party majority school board in the United States.

On September 21, 2017, Ralph Chapman, a member of the Maine House of Representatives, switched his party registration from unaffiliated to Green, providing the Green Party with their first state-level representative since 2014. Henry John Bear became a member of the Green Party in the same year as Chapman, giving the Maine Green Independent Party and GPUS its second currently-serving state representative, though Bear is a nonvoting tribal member of the Maine House of Representatives.

Though several Green congressional candidates have topped 20%, no nominee of the Green Party has been elected to office in the federal government. In 2016, Mark Salazar set a new record for a Green Party nominee for Congress. Running in the Arizona 8th district against incumbent Republican Congressman Trent Franks, Salazar received 93,954 votes or 31.43%.

== Criticism and controversies ==
=== Spoiler campaigns ===
Campaigns run by the Green Party have been seen by some analysts and academics as tossing the election outcomes in favor of Republican candidates – most notably George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016. In 2019, former Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader told the &quot;Washingtonian&quot; that, while he still does not consider himself a spoiler, he regretted not entering the 2000 Democratic primary.

A 2020 &quot;New York Times&quot; article highlighted instances where supporters of a Republican candidate worked to get the Green Party on ballots in close races hoping that it would split votes away from Democratic candidate, including during the 2020 presidential election.

In September 2024, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Green Party&#x27;s political strategy as &quot;predatory&quot;, alleging that they have failed to build political power at the local level while only &quot;show[ing] up every four years&quot; to run presidential candidates. She contrasted their approach with that of the Working Families Party.

On November 1, 2024, Green parties across Europe urged Jill Stein to drop out and endorse Kamala Harris, arguing that Stein risked electing Donald Trump by staying in the race.

On December 27, 2024, James Skoufis accused the Green Party of spoiling the 2024 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania in favor of Dave McCormick.

=== Russia ===
The United States Senate&#x27;s probe into Russian election interference investigated Jill Stein and the Green Party for potential collusion and looked to better understand why and how Russia was promoting the party. &quot;Politico&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Russian state actors covertly promoted Stein and other Green Party candidates on Facebook prior to the 2016 elections. NBC News reported that a &quot;growing body of evidence [exists] that [shows] the Russians worked to boost the Stein campaign as part of the effort to siphon support away from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and tilt the election to Trump.&quot; NBC News additionally documented over 100 instances where Stein appeared on Russian state media, receiving favorable coverage. In 2015, Stein was photographed dining at the same table as Russian president Vladimir Putin at the RT 10th anniversary gala in Moscow, leading to further controversy. Stein contended that she had no contact with Putin at the dinner and described the situation as a &quot;non-event&quot;. One of the possible Green Party 2016 VP candidates worked for RT while the VP candidate Stein ultimately chose also often appeared on the network criticizing NATO as &#x27;Gangster states&#x27;. Stein also met with Sergey Lavrov at an RT Gala in New York.

Stein&#x27;s 2016 foreign policy positions regarding Russian topics have been considered by some to have mirrored those of the Russian government, in some instances, including concerning the annexation of Crimea. Stein condemned Russia&#x27;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but claimed that Russia was provoked by NATO&#x27;s eastward expansion.

=== Allegations of irregularities in primary elections ===
On October 16, 2019, a joint candidate letter called for reform in the Green Party&#x27;s presidential primary process in response to the party&#x27;s announcement that it would remove unrecognized candidates from its website list that November, an effort which Green candidates claimed was being to done to help the Hawkins campaign secure the party&#x27;s nomination. This was followed by allegations of conflicts of interest among the party&#x27;s leadership, members of which the candidates believed were helping party co-founder Howie Hawkins, and of an alleged overlooking of a violation of Green Party rules that would have disqualified Hawkins from running as a Green, due to him also seeking the Socialist Party&#x27;s nomination.

After the 2020 Green Party Nominating Convention named Hawkins as their presidential candidate, runner-up Dario Hunter announced that he would run as an independent candidate. Hunter cited alleged irregularities and undemocratic processes throughout the primary, arguing that party leaders had committed &quot;ethical lapses&quot; to ensure Hawkins&#x27; nomination, and criticizing Hawkins for what he saw as his &quot;imperialist perspective&quot; and &quot;CIA talking points.&quot;

<doc id="30697" wikidata="Q187204" url="?curid=30697" title="Triple jump">
<text>The triple jump, sometimes referred to as the hop, step and jump or the hop, skip and jump, is a track and field event, similar to long jump. As a group, the two events are referred to as the &quot;horizontal jumps&quot;. The competitor runs down the track and performs a hop, a bound and then a jump into the sand pit. The triple jump was inspired by accounts of lengthy jumps at the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympics event since the Games&#x27; inception in 1896.

According to World Athletics rules, &quot;the hop shall be made so that an athlete lands first on the same foot
as that from which he has taken off; in the step he shall land on the
other foot, from which, subsequently, the jump is performed.&quot;

The male world record holder is Jonathan Edwards of the United Kingdom, with a jump of . The female world record holder is Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela, with a jump of .

==History==
Historical sources on the ancient Olympic Games occasionally mention jumps of 15 metres or more. This led sports historians to conclude that these must have been a series of jumps, thus providing the basis for the triple jump. However, there is no evidence for the triple jump being included in the ancient Olympic Games, and the recorded extraordinary distances may be due to the artistic license of the authors of victory poems, rather than attempts to report accurate results.

The triple jump was a part of the inaugural modern Olympics in 1896 in Athens, although at the time it consisted of two hops on the same foot and then a jump. The first modern Olympic champion, James Connolly, was a triple jumper. Early Olympics also included the standing triple jump, although this has since been removed from the Olympic program and is rarely performed in competition today. The women&#x27;s triple jump was introduced into the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.

In Irish mythology the geal-ruith (triple jump) was an event contested in the ancient Irish Tailteann Games as early as 1829 BC.

==Technique==

===Approach===

The approach is one of the most important parts of an athlete&#x27;s jump. The athlete sprints down a runway to a takeoff mark, from which the triple jump is measured. The takeoff mark is commonly either a piece of wood or similar material embedded in the runway, or a rectangle painted on the runway surface. In modern championships, a strip of plasticine, tape, or modeling clay is attached to the far edge of the board to record athletes overstepping or &quot;scratching&quot; the mark, defined by the trailing edge of the board. These boards are placed at different places on the runway depending on how far the athlete can jump. Typically the boards are set 40 ft, 32 ft, and 24 ft from the pit. These are the most common boards seen at the high school and collegiate levels, but boards can be placed anywhere on the runway. There are three phases of the triple jump: the &quot;hop&quot; phase, the &quot;bound&quot; or &quot;step&quot; phase, and the &quot;jump&quot; phase. They all play an important role in the jump itself. These three phases are executed in one continuous sequence. The athlete has to maintain a good speed through each phase. They should also try to stay consistent to avoid fouls.

===Hop===

The hop begins with the athlete jumping from the take-off board on one leg, which for descriptive purposes, will be the right leg. Precise placement of the foot on the take-off is important for the athlete to avoid a foul. The objective of the first phase is to hop &quot;out&quot;, with athletes focusing all momentum forward. The hop landing phase is very active, involving a powerful backward &quot;pawing&quot; action of the right leg, with the right take-off foot landing heel first on the runway.

===Step===

The hop landing also marks the beginning of the step phase, where the athlete utilizes the backward momentum of the right leg to immediately execute a powerful jump forward and upwards, the left leg assisting the take-off with a hip flexion thrust similar to a bounding motion. This leads to the step-phase mid-air position, with the right take-off leg trailing flexed at the knee, and the left leg now leading flexed at the hip and knee. The jumper then holds this position for as long as possible, before extending the knee of the leading left leg and then immediately beginning a powerful backward motion of the whole left leg, again landing on the runway with a powerful backward pawing action. The takeoff leg should be fully extended with the drive leg thigh just below parallel to the ground. The takeoff leg stays extended behind the body with the heel held high. The drive leg extends with a flexed ankle and snaps downward for a quick transition into the jump phase. The athlete tries to take the farthest step they can while maintaining balance and control, using techniques such as pulling their leg up as high as possible.

===Jump===

The step landing forms the take-off of the final phase (the jump), where the athlete utilizes the backward force from the left leg to take off again. The jump phase is very similar to the long jump although most athletes have lost too much speed by this time to manage a full hitch kick, and mostly used is a hang or sail technique.

When landing in the sand-filled pit, the jumper should aim to avoid sitting back on landing or placing either hand behind the feet. The sandpit usually begins 13m from the take-off board for male international competition or 11m from the board for international female and club-level male competition. Each phase of the triple jump should get progressively higher, and there should be a regular rhythm to the three landings.

===Foul===

A &quot;foul&quot;, also known as a &quot;scratch&quot;, or missed jump, occurs when a jumper oversteps the takeoff mark, misses the pit entirely, does not use the correct foot sequence throughout the phases, or does not perform the attempt in the allotted amount of time (usually about 90 seconds). When a jumper &quot;scratches&quot;, the seated official will raise a red flag, and the jumper who was &quot;on deck&quot;, or up next, prepares to jump.

It shall not be considered a foul if an athlete while jumping, should touch or scrape the ground with his/her &quot;sleeping leg&quot;. Also called a &quot;scrape foul&quot;, &quot;sleeping leg&quot; touch violations were ruled as fouls before the mid-1980s. The IAAF changed the rules following outrage at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow when Soviet field officials in the Men&#x27;s Triple Jump ruled as foul eight of the twelve jumps made by two leading competitors (from Brazil and Australia) thus helping two Soviet jumpers win the gold and silver medals.

<text>Trinitrotoluene (), more commonly known as TNT (and more specifically 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, and by its preferred IUPAC name 2-methyl-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene), is a chemical compound with the formula C6H2(NO2)3CH3. TNT is occasionally used as a reagent in chemical synthesis, but it is best known as an explosive material with convenient handling properties. The explosive yield of TNT is considered to be the standard comparative convention of bombs and asteroid impacts. In chemistry, TNT is used to generate charge transfer salts.

== History ==
TNT was first synthesized in 1861 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and was originally used as a yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not recognized for three decades, mainly because it was so much less sensitive than other explosives known at the time. Its explosive properties were discovered in 1891 by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann. TNT can be safely poured when liquid into shell cases, and is so insensitive that in 1910 it was exempted from the UK&#x27;s Explosives Act 1875 and was not considered an explosive for the purposes of manufacture and storage.

The German armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902. TNT-filled armour-piercing shells would explode after they had penetrated the armour of British capital ships, whereas the British Lyddite-filled shells tended to explode upon striking armour, thus expending much of their energy outside the ship. The British started replacing Lyddite with TNT in 1907.

The United States Navy continued filling armour-piercing shells with explosive D after some other nations had switched to TNT, but began filling naval mines, bombs, depth charges, and torpedo warheads with burster charges of crude grade B TNT with the color of brown sugar and requiring an explosive booster charge of granular crystallized grade A TNT for detonation. High-explosive shells were filled with grade A TNT, which became preferred for other uses as industrial chemical capacity became available for removing xylene and similar hydrocarbons from the toluene feedstock and other nitrotoluene isomer byproducts from the nitrating reactions.

== Preparation ==
In industry, TNT is produced in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused.

After nitration, TNT can either be purified by crystallization from an organic solvent or stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. The rinse water from sulfitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.

Control of nitrogen oxides in feed nitric acid is very important because free nitrogen dioxide can result in oxidation of the methyl group of toluene. This reaction is highly exothermic and carries with it the risk of a runaway reaction leading to an explosion.

In the laboratory, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is produced by a two-step process. A nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono- and di-nitrotoluene isomers, with careful cooling to maintain temperature. The nitrated toluenes are then separated, washed with dilute sodium bicarbonate to remove oxides of nitrogen, and then carefully nitrated with a mixture of fuming nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

X-ray crystallographic analysis determined that each of the three planar nitro groups is substantially rotated out of the plane of the benzene ring.

== Applications ==
TNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing (popularly known as fracking), a process used to acquire oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.

TNT is valued partly because of its insensitivity to shock and friction, with reduced risk of accidental detonation compared to more sensitive explosives such as nitroglycerin. TNT melts at 80 °C (176 °F), far below the temperature at which it will spontaneously detonate, allowing it to be poured or safely combined with other explosives. TNT neither absorbs nor dissolves in water, which allows it to be used effectively in wet environments. To detonate, TNT must be triggered by a pressure wave from a starter explosive, called an explosive booster.

Although blocks of TNT are available in various sizes (e.g. 250 g, 500 g, 1,000 g), it is more commonly encountered in synergistic explosive blends comprising a variable percentage of TNT plus other ingredients. Examples of explosive blends containing TNT include:
* Amatex (ammonium nitrate and RDX)
* Amatol (ammonium nitrate)
* Baratol (barium nitrate and wax)
* Composition B (RDX and paraffin wax)
* Composition H6
* Cyclotol (RDX)
* Ednatol
* Hexanite (hexanitrodiphenylamine)
* Minol
* Octol
* Pentolite
* Picratol
* Tetrytol
* Torpex
* Tritonal

== Explosive character ==
Upon detonation, TNT undergoes a decomposition equivalent to the reaction
: 2 C7H5N3O6 → 3 N2 + 5 H2 + 12 CO + 2 C
plus some of the reactions
: + CO → + C
and
: 2 CO → + C.
The reaction is exothermic but has a high activation energy in the gas phase (~62 kcal/mol). The condensed phases (solid or liquid) show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal/mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities. Because of the production of carbon, TNT explosions have a sooty appearance. Because TNT has an excess of carbon, explosive mixtures with oxygen-rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than TNT alone. During the 20th century amatol, a mixture of TNT with ammonium nitrate, was a widely used military explosive.

TNT can be detonated with a high velocity initiator or by efficient concussion. For many years, TNT used to be the reference point for the Figure of Insensitivity. TNT had a rating of exactly 100 on the &quot;F of I&quot; scale. The reference has since been changed to a more sensitive explosive called RDX, which has an F of I rating of 80.

== Energy content ==

The energy density of TNT is used as a reference point for many other explosives, including nuclear weapons, as their energy content is measured in equivalent tonnes (metric tons, t) of TNT. The energy used by NIST to define the equivalent is 4.184 GJ/t.

For safety assessments, it has been stated that the detonation of TNT, depending on circumstances, can release 2.673–6.702 GJ/t.

The heat of combustion however is 14.5 GJ/t (14.5 MJ/kg or 4.027 kWh/kg), which requires that the carbon in TNT fully react with atmospheric oxygen, which does not occur in the initial event.

For comparison, gunpowder contains 3 MJ/kg, dynamite contains 7.5 MJ/kg, and gasoline contains 47.2 MJ/kg (though gasoline requires an oxidant, so an optimized gasoline and O2 mixture contains 10.4 MJ/kg).

== Detection ==
Various methods can be used to detect TNT, including optical and electrochemical sensors and explosive-sniffing dogs. In 2013, researchers from the Indian Institutes of Technology using noble-metal quantum clusters could detect TNT at the sub-zeptomolar (10−18 mol/m3) level.

== Safety and toxicity ==
TNT is poisonous, and skin contact can cause skin irritation, causing the skin to turn a bright yellow-orange color. During the First World War, female munition workers who handled the chemical found that their skin turned bright yellow, which resulted in their acquiring the nickname &quot;canary girls&quot; or simply &quot;canaries&quot;.

People exposed to TNT over a prolonged period tend to experience anemia and abnormal liver functions. Blood and liver effects, spleen enlargement and other harmful effects on the immune system have also been found in animals that ingested or breathed trinitrotoluene. There is evidence that TNT adversely affects male fertility. TNT is listed as a possible human carcinogen, with carcinogenic effects demonstrated in animal experiments with rats, although effects upon humans so far amount to none (according to IRIS of March 15, 2000). Consumption of TNT produces red urine through the presence of breakdown products and not blood as sometimes believed.

Some military testing grounds are contaminated with wastewater from munitions programs, including contamination of surface and subsurface waters which may be colored pink because of the presence of TNT. Such contamination, called &quot;pink water&quot;, may be difficult and expensive to remedy.

TNT is prone to exudation of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of trinitrotoluene when projectiles containing TNT are stored at higher temperatures in warmer climates. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze screw thread can form &quot;fire channels&quot;, increasing the risk of accidental detonation. Fuze malfunction can also result from the liquid migrating into the fuze mechanism. Calcium silicate is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.

===Pink and red water===
Pink water and red water are two distinct types of wastewater related to trinitrotoluene. Pink water is produced from equipment washing processes after munitions filling or demilitarization operations, and as such is generally saturated with the maximum amount of TNT that will dissolve in water (about 150 parts per million (ppm).) However it has an indefinite composition that depends on the exact process; in particular, it may also contain cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) if the plant uses TNT/RDX mixtures, or HMX if TNT/HMX is used. Red water (also known as &quot;Sellite water&quot;) is produced during the process used to purify the crude TNT. It has a complex composition containing more than a dozen aromatic compounds, but the principal components are inorganic salts (sodium sulfate, sodium sulfite, sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate) and sulfonated nitroaromatics.

Pink and red water are colorless at the time of generation; the color is produced by photolytic reactions under the influence of sunlight. Despite the names, red and pink water are not necessarily different shades; the color depends mainly on the duration of solar exposure. If exposed long enough, &quot;pink&quot; water may turn various shades of pink, red, rusty orange, or black.

Because of the toxicity of TNT, the discharge of pink water to the environment has been prohibited in the US and many other countries for decades, but ground contamination may exist in very old plants. However, RDX and tetryl contamination is usually considered more problematic, as TNT has very low soil mobility. Red water is significantly more toxic and as such it has always been considered hazardous waste. It has traditionally been disposed of by evaporation to dryness (as the toxic components are not volatile), followed by incineration. Much research has been conducted to develop better disposal processes.

== Ecological impact ==
Because of its suitability in construction and demolition, TNT has become the most widely used explosive and thus its toxicity is the most characterized and reported. Residual TNT from manufacture, storage, and use can pollute water, soil, the atmosphere, and the biosphere.

The concentration of TNT in contaminated soil can reach 50 g/kg of soil, where the highest concentrations can be found on or near the surface. In September 2001, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) declared TNT a pollutant whose removal is a priority. The USEPA maintains that TNT levels in soil should not exceed 17.2 milligrams per kilogram of soil and 0.01 milligrams per litre of water.

=== Aqueous solubility ===
Dissolution is a measure of the rate that solid TNT in contact with water is dissolved. The relatively low aqueous solubility of TNT causes solid particles to be continuously released to the environment over extended periods of time. Studies have shown that TNT dissolves more slowly in saline water than in freshwater. However, when salinity is altered, TNT dissolves at the same speed. Because TNT is moderately soluble in water, it can migrate through subsurface soil, and cause groundwater contamination.

=== Soil adsorption ===
Adsorption is a measure of the distribution between soluble and sediment adsorbed contaminants following attainment of equilibrium. TNT and its transformation products are known to adsorb to surface soils and sediments, where they undergo reactive transformation or remained stored. The movement or organic contaminants through soils is a function of their ability to associate with the mobile phase (water) and a stationary phase (soil). Materials that associate strongly with soils move slowly through soil. The association constant for TNT with soil is 2.7 to 11 L/kg of soil. This means that TNT has a one- to tenfold tendency to adhere to soil particulates than not when introduced into the soil. Hydrogen bonding and ion exchange are two suggested mechanisms of adsorption between the nitro functional groups and soil colloids.

The number of functional groups on TNT influences the ability to adsorb into soil. Adsorption coefficient values have been shown to increase with an increase in the number of amino groups. Thus, adsorption of the TNT decomposition product 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DANT) was greater than that for 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), which was greater than that for TNT. Lower adsorption coefficients for 2,6-DNT compared to 2,4-DNT can be attributed to the steric hindrance of the NO2 group in the ortho position.

Research has shown that in freshwater environments, with high abundances of Ca2+, the adsorption of TNT and its transformation products to soils and sediments may be lower than observed in a saline environment, dominated by K+ and Na+. Therefore, when considering the adsorption of TNT, the type of soil or sediment and the ionic composition and strength of the ground water are important factors.

The association constants for TNT and its degradation products with clays have been determined. Clay minerals have a significant effect on the adsorption of energetic compounds. Soil properties, such as organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity have significant impacts on the adsorption coefficients.

Additional studies have shown that the mobility of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower &quot;than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.&quot; Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent. The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from &quot;sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with humic acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils&quot;. From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.

Compared to other explosives, TNT has a higher association constant with soil, meaning it adheres more with soil than with water. Conversely, other explosives, such as RDX and HMX with low association constants (ranging from 0.06 to 7.3 L/kg and 0 to 1.6 L/kg respectively) can move more rapidly in water.

=== Chemical breakdown ===
TNT is a reactive molecule and is particularly prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation in the presence of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like hydrogen sulfide, Fe2+, or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic and photochemical degradation.

Soils with high clay contents or small particle sizes and high total organic carbon content have been shown to promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include reduction of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form dimers. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT, is energetically favored, and therefore is observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.

The transformation of TNT is significantly enhanced under anaerobic conditions as well as under highly reducing conditions. TNT transformations in soils can occur both biologically and abiotically.

Photolysis is a major process that impacts the transformation of energetic compounds. The alteration of a molecule in photolysis occurs by direct absorption of light energy or by the transfer of energy from a photosensitized compound. Phototransformation of TNT &quot;results in the formation of nitrobenzenes, benzaldehydes, azodicarboxylic acids, and nitrophenols, as a result of the oxidation of methyl groups, reduction of nitro groups, and dimer formation.&quot;

Evidence of the photolysis of TNT has been seen due to the color change to pink of TNT-containing wastewaters when exposed to sunlight. Photolysis is more rapid in river water than in distilled water. Ultimately, photolysis affects the fate of TNT primarily in the aquatic environment but could also affect the fate of TNT in soil when the soil surface is exposed to sunlight.

=== Biodegradation ===
The ligninolytic physiological phase and manganese peroxidase system of fungi can cause a very limited amount of mineralization of TNT in a liquid culture, though not in soil. An organism capable of the remediation of large amounts of TNT in soil has yet to be discovered. Both wild and transgenic plants can phytoremediate explosives from soil and water.

<doc id="30699" wikidata="Q15779" url="?curid=30699" title="Toluene">
<text>Toluene (), also known as toluol (), is a substituted aromatic hydrocarbon with the chemical formula , often abbreviated as , where Ph stands for the phenyl group. It is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid with the odor associated with paint thinners. It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, consisting of a methyl group (CH3) attached to a phenyl group by a single bond. As such, its systematic IUPAC name is methylbenzene. Toluene is predominantly used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent.

As the solvent in some types of paint thinner, permanent markers, contact cement and certain types of glue, toluene is sometimes used as a recreational inhalant and has the potential of causing severe neurological harm.

==History==
The compound was first isolated in 1837 through a distillation of pine oil by Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Filip Neriusz Walter, who named it &quot;rétinnaphte&quot;. In 1841, Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville isolated a hydrocarbon from balsam of Tolu (an aromatic extract from the tropical Colombian tree &quot;Myroxylon balsamum&quot;), which Deville recognized as similar to Walter&#x27;s &quot;rétinnaphte&quot; and to benzene; hence he called the new hydrocarbon &quot;benzoène&quot;. In 1843, Jöns Jacob Berzelius recommended the name &quot;toluin&quot;. In 1850, French chemist Auguste Cahours isolated from a distillate of wood a hydrocarbon which he recognized as similar to Deville&#x27;s &quot;benzoène&quot; and which Cahours named &quot;toluène&quot;.

==Chemical properties==
The distance between carbon atoms in the toluene ring is 0.1399 nm. The C-CH3 bond is longer at 0.1524 nm, while the average C-H bond length is 0.111 nm.

===Ring reactions===
Toluene reacts as a normal aromatic hydrocarbon in electrophilic aromatic substitution. Because the methyl group has greater electron-releasing properties than a hydrogen atom in the same position, toluene is more reactive than benzene toward electrophiles. It undergoes sulfonation to give &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonic acid, and chlorination by Cl2 in the presence of FeCl3 to give ortho and para isomers of chlorotoluene.

Nitration of toluene gives mono-, di-, and trinitrotoluene, all of which are widely used. Dinitrotoluene is the precursor to toluene diisocyanate, a precursor to polyurethane foam. Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is an explosive.

Complete hydrogenation of toluene gives methylcyclohexane. The reaction requires a high pressure of hydrogen and a catalyst.

===Side chain reactions===
The C-H bonds of the methyl group in toluene are benzylic, therefore they are weaker than C-H bonds in simpler alkanes. Reflecting this weakness, the methyl group in toluene undergoes a variety of free radical reactions. For example, when heated with &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of AIBN, toluene converts to benzyl bromide. The same conversion can be effected with elemental bromine in the presence of UV light or even sunlight.

Toluene may also be brominated by treating it with HBr and H2O2 in the presence of light.

:C6H5CH3 + Br2 → C6H5CH2Br + HBr

Benzoic acid and benzaldehyde are produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. Typical catalysts include cobalt or manganese naphthenates. Related but laboratory-scale oxidations involve the use of potassium permanganate to yield benzoic acid and chromyl chloride to yield benzaldehyde (Étard reaction).

The methyl group in toluene undergoes deprotonation only with very strong bases; its p&quot;K&quot;a is estimated using acidity trends to be approximately 43 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its ion pair acidity is extrapolated to be 41.2 in cyclohexylamine (Cesium Cyclohexylamide) using a Bronsted correlation.

=== Miscibility ===
Toluene is miscible (soluble in all proportions) with ethanol, benzene, diethyl ether, acetone, chloroform, glacial acetic acid and carbon disulfide, but immiscible with water.

==Production==
Toluene occurs naturally at low levels in crude oil and is a byproduct in the production of gasoline by a catalytic reformer or ethylene cracker. It is also a byproduct of the production of coke from coal. Final separation and purification is done by any of the distillation or solvent extraction processes used for BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene isomers).

===Other preparative routes===
Toluene can be prepared by a variety of methods. For example, benzene reacts with methanol in presence of a solid acid to give toluene and water:
:&lt;chem&gt;C6H6 + CH3OH -&gt;[t^o]C6H5CH3 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

==Uses==
Toluene is one of the most abundantly produced chemicals. Its main uses are (1) as a precursor to benzene and xylenes, (2) as a solvent for thinners, paints, lacquers, adhesives, and (3) as an additive for gasoline.

===Precursor to benzene and xylenes===
Toluene is converted to benzene via hydrodealkylation:
:C6H5CH3 + H2 → C6H6 + CH4

Its transalkylation gives a mixture of benzene and xylenes.
===Solvent===
Toluene is widely used in the paint, dye, rubber, chemical, glue, printing, and pharmaceutical industries as a solvent. Nail polish, paintbrush cleaners, and stain removers may contain toluene. Manufacturing of explosives (TNT) uses it as well. Toluene is also found in cigarette smoke and car exhaust. If not in contact with air, toluene can remain unchanged in soil or water for a long time.

Toluene is a common solvent, e.g. for paints, paint thinners, silicone sealants, many chemical reactants, rubber, printing ink, adhesives (glues), lacquers, leather tanners, and disinfectants.

=== Fuel ===
Toluene is an octane booster in gasoline fuels for internal combustion engines as well as jet fuel and turbocharged engines in Formula One.

In Australia in 2003, toluene was found to have been illegally combined with petrol in fuel outlets for sale as standard vehicular fuel. Toluene incurs no fuel excise tax, while other fuels are taxed at more than 40%, providing a greater profit margin for fuel suppliers. The extent of toluene substitution is claimed to be 60%.

===Niche applications===
In the laboratory, toluene is used as a solvent for carbon nanomaterials, including nanotubes and fullerenes, and it can also be used as a fullerene indicator. The color of the toluene solution of C60 is bright purple. Toluene is used as a cement for fine polystyrene kits (by dissolving and then fusing surfaces) as it can be applied very precisely by brush and contains none of the bulk of an adhesive. Toluene can be used to break open red blood cells in order to extract hemoglobin in biochemistry experiments. Toluene has also been used as a coolant for its good heat transfer capabilities in sodium cold traps used in nuclear reactor system loops. Toluene had also been used in the process of removing the cocaine from coca leaves in the production of Coca-Cola syrup.

==Toxicology and metabolism==

The environmental and toxicological effects of toluene have been extensively studied.

Toluene is irritating to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It is absorbed slowly through the skin. It can cause systemic toxicity by inhalation or ingestion. Inhalation is the most common route of exposure. Symptoms of toluene poisoning include central nervous system effects (headache, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, euphoria, tremors, hallucinations, seizures, and coma), chemical pneumonitis, respiratory depression, ventricular arrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances.

Inhalation of toluene in low to moderate levels can cause tiredness, confusion, weakness, drunken-type actions, memory loss, nausea, loss of appetite, hearing loss, and colour vision loss. Some of these symptoms usually disappear when exposure is stopped. Inhaling high levels of toluene in a short time may cause light-headedness, nausea, or sleepiness, unconsciousness, and even death. Toluene is, however, much less toxic than benzene, and as a consequence, largely replaced it as an aromatic solvent in chemical preparation. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that the carcinogenic potential of toluene cannot be evaluated due to insufficient information. In 2013, worldwide sales of toluene amounted to about 24.5 billion US dollars.

Toluene occurs as an indoor air pollutant in a number of processes including electrosurgery, and can be removed from the air with an activated carbon filter.

Similarly to many other solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane and some alkylbenzenes, toluene has been shown to act as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist and GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator. Additionally, toluene has been shown to display antidepressant-like effects in rodents in the forced swim test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST), likely due to its NMDA antagonist properties.

Toluene is sometimes used as a recreational inhalant (&quot;glue sniffing&quot;), likely on account of its euphoric and dissociative effects.

Toluene inhibits excitatory ion channels such as the NMDA receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. It also potentiates the function of inhibitory ion channels, such as the GABAA and glycine receptors. In addition, toluene disrupts voltage-gated calcium channels and ATP-gated ion channels.

=== Recreational use ===
Toluene is used as an intoxicative inhalant in a manner unintended by manufacturers. People inhale toluene-containing products (e.g., paint thinner, contact cement, correction pens, model glue, etc.) for its intoxicating effect. The possession and use of toluene and products containing it are regulated in many jurisdictions, for the supposed reason of preventing minors from obtaining these products for recreational drug purposes. As of 2007, 24 US states had laws penalizing use, possession with intent to use, and/or distribution of such inhalants. In 2005 the European Union banned the general sale of products consisting of greater than 0.5% toluene.

===Bioremediation===
Several types of fungi including &quot;Cladophialophora&quot;, &quot;Exophiala&quot;, &quot;Leptodontidium&quot; (syn. &quot;Leptodontium&quot;), &quot;Pseudeurotium zonatum&quot;, and &quot;Cladosporium sphaerospermum&quot;, and certain species of bacteria can degrade toluene using it as a source of carbon and energy.

<text>The Computer Contradictionary is a non-fiction book by Stan Kelly-Bootle that compiles a satirical list of definitions of computer industry terms. It was originally published as &#x27;The devil&#x27;s DP dictionary&#x27;. it is an example of &quot;cynical lexicography&quot; in the tradition of Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Rather than offering a factual account of usage, its definitions are largely made up by the author.

The book was published in May 1995 by MIT Press and is an update of Kelly-Bootle&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s DP Dictionary&quot; which appeared in 1981.

== Examples ==
:Endless loop. See: &quot;Loop, endless&quot;

:Loop, endless. See: &quot;Endless loop&quot;

:Recursion. See: &quot;Recursion&quot;

==Reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; panned the book, wrote that it was &quot;smartly-titled&quot; but was an &quot;awfully stupid book&quot;. &quot;ACM Computing Reviews&quot; recommended dipping into it because &quot;a dictionary is a difficult read&quot;.

<text>The Great Divorce is a novel by the British author C. S. Lewis, published in 1945, based on a theological dream vision of his in which he reflects on the Christian conceptions of Heaven and Hell.

The working title was &quot;Who Goes Home?&quot; but the final name was changed at the publisher&#x27;s insistence. The title refers to William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;. &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; was first printed as a serial in an Anglican newspaper called &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1944 and 1945 and soon thereafter in book form.

==Sources==
Lewis&#x27;s diverse sources for this work include the works of St. Augustine, Dante Aligheri, John Milton, John Bunyan, Emanuel Swedenborg and Lewis Carroll, as well as an American science fiction author whose name Lewis had forgotten but whose work he mentions in his preface George MacDonald, whom Lewis utilizes as a character in the story, Dante, Prudentius and Jeremy Taylor are alluded to in the text of chapter 9.

==Plot summary==
The narrator inexplicably finds himself in a grim and joyless city, the &quot;grey town&quot;, where it rains continuously, even indoors, which is either Hell or Purgatory depending on whether or not one stays there. He eventually finds a bus stop for those who desire an excursion to some other place. (&quot;The grey town&quot; is only called such; the destination later turns out to be the foothills of Heaven). He waits in line for the bus and listens to the arguments between his fellow passengers. As they await the bus&#x27;s arrival, many of them quit the line in disgust before the bus pulls up. The driver is an angel who casually shields his face from the passengers. Once the few remaining passengers have boarded, the bus flies upward, off the pavement into the grey, rainy sky.

The ascending bus breaks out of the rain clouds into a clear, pre-dawn sky, and as it rises its occupants&#x27; bodies change from being normal and solid into being transparent, faint, and vapor-like. When it reaches its destination the passengers on the bus— including the narrator—are gradually revealed to be ghosts. Although the country they disembark into is the most beautiful they have ever seen, every feature of the landscape, including streams of water and blades of grass, is unyieldingly solid compared to themselves: It causes them immense pain even to walk on the grass, whose blades pierce their shadowy feet, and even a single leaf is far too heavy for any to lift.

Shining figures, men and women whom they have known on Earth, come to meet them and to urge them to repent and walk into Heaven proper. They promise as the ghosts travel onward and upward that they will become more solid and thus feel less and less discomfort, and more truly real; this process is also in an aside called &quot;thickening&quot;. These luminous psychopomps, deemed &quot;spirits&quot; to distinguish them from the insubstantial ghosts, offer to help them journey toward the mountains and the sunrise. (One of the earlier ghosts, the narrator learns with a start, had committed suicide by throwing himself under a train, whereas one of the final spirits had died peacefully in bed in a nursing home.)

Almost all of the ghosts choose to return to the grey town instead, giving various reasons and excuses. Much of the interest of the book lies in the recognition it awakens of the plausibility and familiarity–and the thinness and self-deception–of the excuses which the ghosts ultimately refuse to abandon, even though to do so would bring them to &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;joy forevermore&quot;. A former bishop refuses, having grown so used to framing his faith in abstract, pseudo-intellectual terms that he can no longer definitively say whether he believes in God; an artist refuses, arguing that he must preserve the reputation of his school of painting; a bitter cynic predicts that Heaven is a trick; a bully (&quot;Big Man&quot;) is offended that people he believes beneath him are there; a nagging wife is angry that she will not be allowed to dominate her husband in Heaven. However one man corrupted on Earth by lust, which rides on his ghost in the form of an ugly lizard, permits an angel to kill the lizard and becomes a little more solid, and journeys forward, out of the narrative.

The narrator, a writer when alive, is met by the writer George MacDonald; the narrator hails MacDonald as his mentor, just as Dante did when first meeting Virgil in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;; and MacDonald becomes the narrator&#x27;s guide in his journey, just as Virgil became Dante&#x27;s. MacDonald explains that it is possible for a soul to choose to remain in Heaven despite having been in the grey town; for such souls, the goodness of Heaven will work backwards into their lives, turning even their worst sorrows into joy, and changing their experience on Earth to an extension of Heaven. Conversely, the evil of Hell works so that if a soul remains in, or returns to, the grey town, even any remembered happiness from life on Earth will lose its meaning, and the soul&#x27;s experience on Earth would retrospectively become Hell.

Few of the ghosts realize that the grey town is, in fact, Hell. Indeed, it is not that much different from the life they led on Earth –joyless, friendless, monotonous and uncomfortable. It merely expand its sprawl forever with its new occupants, and becomes more and more isolating, with some characters whispering their fear of the &quot;night&quot; that is eventually to come. According to MacDonald, whilst it &quot;is&quot; possible to leave Hell and enter Heaven, doing so requires turning away from the cherished evils (repentance) that took them to Hell in the first place; or, as is characterized by Lewis, embracing ultimate and unceasing joy itself. This is most grossly and strikingly illustrated in an encounter of a blessed woman who had come to meet her husband: She is surrounded by gleaming attendants whilst he shrinks down to invisibility as he uses a collared tragedian who is chained to him—representative of his persistent use of the self-punishing emotional blackmail of others—to speak for him. The narrator is unsure whether her husband had become an insect crawling on this chain, or if his sin had, ultimately, consumed him.

Penultimately MacDonald has the narrator crouch down to look at a tiny crack in the soil, and tells him that the bus came up through a crack no bigger than that, which contained the once vast grey town, which is actually minuscule to the point of being invisible compared with the immensity of Heaven and reality. An inconclusive dialogue about the unfathomable mysteries of eschatology and soteriology ensues in which the visions of Swedenbourg and Hildegard of Bingen, the crux of the matter being eternity vis-à-vis time.

In answer to the narrator&#x27;s question, MacDonald confirms that when he writes about it &quot;Of course you should tell them it is a dream!&quot; Toward this end, the narrator expresses his terror of remaining a ghost in the advent of full daybreak in Heaven, comparing the weight of the sunlight on a ghost as like having large blocks fall on one&#x27;s body –at which point his falling books awaken him at his desk during The Blitz.

The framing of the dream follows that of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; in which the protagonist dreams of judgment day in the House of the Interpreter. The (metaphysical) use of chess imagery as well as the correspondence of dream elements to aspects of the narrator&#x27;s waking life is reminiscent of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. The book ends with the narrator awakening from his dream of Heaven into the unpleasant reality of wartime Britain, in conscious imitation of the &quot;First Part&quot; of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the last sentence of which is: &quot;So I awoke, and behold: It was a Dream.&quot;

==Stage adaptation==
Philadelphia playwright and actor Anthony Lawton&#x27;s original adaptation of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; has been staged several times by Lantern Theater Company, including a weeklong run in February 2012. It also was adapted by Robert Smyth at Lamb&#x27;s Players Theatre in San Diego, California, in 2004, and was included in their mainstage season for that year. Smyth originally adapted it for a C. S. Lewis conference in Oxford and Cambridge, England, before securing permission to include it in their season a year later.

In 2007 the Magis Theatre Company of New York City presented their adaptation in an off-Broadway run at Theatre 315 in the Theatre District with music by award-winning composer Elizabeth Swados and puppets by Ralph Lee. Lauded by the &quot;New York Times&quot; for its imagination, theatrical skill and daring, theatre critic Neil Genzlinger called the production thought provoking &quot;with plenty to say to those interested in matters of the spirit.&quot; In the following years Magis worked closely with the C. S. Lewis estate to make its adaptation available to over a dozen theatre companies from Canada to Ecuador. The Taproot Theatre of Seattle chose the Magis adaptation to open its new Theater Space in 2010 and extended the run due to popular demand. The Pacific Theatre Company presented the Magis adaptation in its 2010–2011 season.

In late 2012, the Fellowship for the Performing Arts received permission from the C. S. Lewis estate to produce a stage version of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. The production premiered in Phoenix on 14 December 2013, toured throughout the United States from 2014 to 2016, opened briefly in 2020 and resumed in 2021.

==Motion picture==
In 2010, Mpower Pictures and Beloved Pictures announced that they were working on a film adaptation of &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. Stephen McEveety was to lead the production team and author N. D. Wilson had been tapped to write the script. A first draft of the script was finalized by N.D. Wilson in 2011. A 2013 release was originally planned for the film. As of 2025 it has not yet been produced.

<doc id="30707" wikidata="Q1068323" url="?curid=30707" title="Temporomandibular joint dysfunction">
<text>Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, TMJD) is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) and the temporomandibular joints (the joints which connect the mandible to the skull). The most important feature is pain, followed by restricted mandibular movement, and noises from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) during jaw movement. Although TMD is not life-threatening, it can be detrimental to quality of life; this is because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage.

In this article, the term &quot;temporomandibular disorder&quot; is taken to mean any disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint, and &quot;temporomandibular joint dysfunction&quot; (here also abbreviated to TMD) is taken to mean symptomatic (e.g. pain, limitation of movement, clicking) dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint. However, there is no single, globally accepted term or definition concerning this topic.
TMDs have a range of causes and often co-occur with a number of overlapping medical conditions, including headaches, fibromyalgia, back pain, and irritable bowel. However, these factors are poorly understood, and there is disagreement as to their relative importance. There are many treatments available, although there is a general lack of evidence for any treatment in TMD, and no widely accepted treatment protocol. Common treatments include provision of occlusal splints, psychosocial interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, and pain medication or others. Most sources agree that no irreversible treatment should be carried out for TMD.
The prevalence of TMD in the global population is 34%. It varies by continent: the highest rate is in South America at 47%, followed by Asia at 33%, Europe at 29%, and North America at 26%. About 20% to 30% of the adult population are affected to some degree. Usually people affected by TMD are between 20 and 40 years of age, and it is more common in females than males. TMD is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain (i.e. toothache).
==Classification==
TMD is considered by some to be one of the 4 major symptom complexes in chronic orofacial pain, along with burning mouth syndrome, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia. TMD has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or rheumatological disorder. It has also been called a functional pain syndrome, and a psychogenic disorder. It is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between TMD and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, headache, chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain.

===Definitions and terminology===
Frequently, TMD has been treated as a single syndrome, but the prevailing modern view is that TMD is a cluster of related disorders with many common features. Indeed, some have suggested that, in the future, the term &#x27;TMD&#x27; may be discarded as the different causes are fully identified and separated into different conditions. Sometimes, &quot;temporomandibular joint dysfunction&quot; is described as the most common form of temporomandibular disorder, whereas many other sources use the term &#x27;temporomandibular disorder&#x27; synonymously, or instead of the term &#x27;temporomandibular joint dysfunction&#x27;. In turn, the term &#x27;temporomandibular disorder&#x27; is defined as &quot;musculoskeletal disorders affecting the temporomandibular joints and their associated musculature. It is a collective term which represents a diverse group of pathologies involving the temporomandibular joint, the muscles of mastication, or both&quot;. Another definition of temporomandibular disorders is &quot;a group of conditions with similar signs and symptoms that affect the temporomandibular joints, the muscles of mastication, or both.&quot; &#x27;Temporomandibular disorder&#x27; is a term that creates confusion since it refers to a group of similarly symptomatic conditions, whilst many sources use the term temporomandibular disorders as a vague description, rather than a specific syndrome, and refer to any condition which may affect the temporomandibular joints (see table). The temporomandibular joint is susceptible to a huge range of diseases, some rarer than others, and there is no implication that all of these will cause any symptoms or limitation in function at all.

The preferred terms in medical publications is to an extent influenced by geographic location. For example, in the United Kingdom, the term &#x27;pain dysfunction syndrome&#x27; is in common use. In the United States, the term &#x27;temporomandibular disorder&#x27; is generally favored. The American Academy of Orofacial Pain uses &#x27;temporomandibular disorder&#x27;, whilst the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research uses &#x27;temporomandibular joint disorder&#x27;. A more complete list of synonyms for this topic is extensive, with some being more commonly used than others. In addition to those already mentioned, examples include &#x27;temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular joint syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular dysfunction syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular dysfunction&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular disorder&#x27;, &#x27;temporomandibular syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;facial arthromyalgia&#x27;, &#x27;myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome&#x27;, &#x27;craniomandibular dysfunction&#x27; (CMD), &#x27;myofacial pain dysfunction&#x27;, &#x27;masticatory myalgia&#x27;, &#x27;mandibular dysfunction&#x27;, and &#x27;Costen&#x27;s syndrome&#x27;.

The lack of standardization in terms is not restricted to medical papers. Notable internationally recognized sources vary in both their preferred term, and their offered definition. For example:

===By cause and symptoms===
It has been suggested that TMD may develop following physical trauma, particularly whiplash injury, although the evidence for this is not conclusive. This type of TMD is sometimes termed &quot;posttraumatic TMD&quot; (pTMD) to distinguish it from TMD of unknown cause, sometimes termed &quot;idiopathic TMD&quot; (iTMD). Sometimes muscle-related (myogenous) TMD (also termed myogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to myofascial pain and dysfunction) is distinguished from joint-related TMD (also termed arthogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to true articular disease), based upon whether the muscles of mastication or the TMJs themselves are predominantly involved. This classification, which effectively divides TMD into 2 syndromes, is followed by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain. However, since most people with TMD could be placed into both of these groups, which makes a single diagnosis difficult when this classification is used. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) allows for multiple diagnoses in an attempt to overcome the problems with other classifications. RDC/TMD considers temporomandibular disorders in 2 axes; axis I is the physical aspects, and axis II involves assessment of psychological status, mandibular function and TMD-related psychosocial disability. Axis I is further divided into 3 general groups. Group I are muscle disorders, group II are disc displacements and group III are joint disorders, although it is common for people with TMD to fit into more than one of these groups.

===By duration===
Sometimes distinction is made between acute TMD, where symptoms last for less than 3 months, and chronic TMD, where symptoms last for more than 3 months. Not much is known about acute TMD since these individuals do not typically attend in secondary care (hospital).

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation. The symptoms will usually involve more than one of the various components of the masticatory system, muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, bones, connective tissue, or the teeth.

The three classically described, cardinal signs and symptoms of TMD are:
# Pain and tenderness on palpation in the muscles of mastication, or of the joint itself (preauricular pain – pain felt just in front of the ear). Pain is the defining feature of TMD and is usually aggravated by manipulation or function, such as when chewing, clenching, or yawning, and is often worse upon waking. The character of the pain is usually dull or aching, poorly localized, and intermittent, although it can sometimes be constant. The pain is more usually unilateral (located on one side) rather than bilateral. It is rarely severe. 
# Limited range of mandibular movement, which may cause difficulty eating or even talking. There may be locking of the jaw, or stiffness in the jaw muscles and the joints, especially present upon waking. There may also be incoordination, asymmetry or deviation of mandibular movement. 
# Noises from the joint during mandibular movement, which may be intermittent. Joint noises may be described as clicking, popping, or crepitus (grating).

TMJ dysfunction is commonly associated with symptoms affecting cervical spine dysfunction and altered head and cervical spine posture.

Other signs and symptoms have also been described, although these are less common and less significant than the cardinal signs and symptoms listed above. Examples include:
* Headache (possibly), e.g. pain in the occipital region (the back of the head), or the forehead; or other types of facial pain including migraine, tension headache, or myofascial pain.
* Pain elsewhere, such as the teeth or neck.
* Diminished auditory acuity (hearing loss). 
* Tinnitus (occasionally). 
* Dizziness. 
* Sensation of malocclusion (feeling that the teeth do not meet together properly).

==Causes==
TMD is a symptom complex (i.e. a group of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a particular disease), which is thought to be caused by multiple, poorly understood factors, but the exact etiology is unknown. There are factors which appear to predispose to TMD (genetic, hormonal, anatomical), factors which may precipitate it (trauma, occlusal changes, parafunction), and also factors which may prolong it (stress and again parafunction). Overall, two hypotheses have dominated research into the causes of TMD, namely a psychosocial model and a theory of occlusal dysharmony. Interest in occlusal factors as a causative factor in TMD was especially widespread in the past, and the theory has since fallen out of favor and become controversial due to lack of evidence.

===Disc displacement===
In people with TMD, it has been shown that the lower head of lateral pterygoid contracts during mouth closing (when it should relax), and is often tender to palpation. To theorize upon this observation, some have suggested that due to a tear in the back of the joint capsule, the articular disc may be displaced forwards (anterior disc displacement), stopping the upper head of lateral pterygoid from acting to stabilize the disc as it would do normally. As a biologic compensatory mechanism, the lower head tries to fill this role, hence the abnormal muscle activity during mouth closure. There is some evidence that anterior disc displacement is present in a proportion of TMD cases. Anterior disc displacement with reduction refers to abnormal forward movement of the disc during opening which reduces upon closing. Anterior disc displacement without reduction refers to an abnormal forward, bunched-up position of the articular disc which does not reduce. In this latter scenario, the disc is not intermediary between the condyle and the articular fossa as it should be, and hence the articular surfaces of the bones themselves are exposed to a greater degree of wear (which may predispose to osteoarthritis in later life).

===Degenerative joint disease===
The general term &quot;degenerative joint disease&quot; refers to arthritis (both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) and arthrosis. The term arthrosis may cause confusion since in the specialized TMD literature it means something slightly different from in the wider medical literature. In medicine generally, arthrosis can be a nonspecific term for a joint, any disease of a joint (or specifically degenerative joint disease), and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis. In the specialized literature that has evolved around TMD research, arthrosis is differentiated from arthritis by the presence of low and no inflammation respectively. Both are however equally degenerative. The TMJs are sometimes described as one of the most used joints in the body. Over time, either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint, wear and degeneration can occur, termed osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune joint disease, can also affect the TMJs. Degenerative joint diseases may lead to defects in the shape of the tissues of the joint, limitation of function (e.g. restricted mandibular movements), and joint pain.

===Psychosocial factors===
Emotional stress (anxiety, depression, anger) may increase pain by causing autonomic, visceral and skeletal activity and by reduced inhibition via the descending pathways of the limbic system. The interactions of these biological systems have been described as a vicious &quot;anxiety-pain-tension&quot; cycle which is thought to be frequently involved in TMD. Put simply, stress and anxiety cause grinding of teeth and sustained muscular contraction in the face. This produces pain which causes further anxiety which in turn causes prolonged muscular spasm at trigger points, vasoconstriction, ischemia and release of pain mediators. The pain discourages use of the masticatory system (a similar phenomenon in other chronic pain conditions is termed &quot;fear avoidance&quot; behavior), which leads to reduced muscle flexibility, tone, strength and endurance. This manifests as limited mouth opening and a sensation that the teeth are not fitting properly.

Persons with TMD have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders than people without TMD. People with TMD have been shown to have higher levels of anxiety, depression, somatization and sleep deprivation, and these could be considered important risk factors for the development of TMD. In the 6 months before the onset, 50–70% of people with TMD report experiencing stressful life events (e.g. involving work, money, health or relationship loss). It has been postulated that such events induce anxiety and cause increased jaw muscle activity. Muscular hyperactivity has also been shown in people with TMD whilst taking examinations or watching horror films.

Others argue that a link between muscular hyperactivity and TMD has not been convincingly demonstrated, and that emotional distress may be more of a consequence of pain rather than a cause.

===Bruxism===
Bruxism is an oral parafunctional activity where there is excessive clenching and grinding of the teeth. It can occur during sleep or whilst awake. The cause of bruxism itself is not completely understood, but psychosocial factors appear to be implicated in awake bruxism and dopaminergic dysfunction and other central nervous system mechanisms may be involved in sleep bruxism. If TMD pain and limitation of mandibular movement are greatest upon waking, and then slowly resolve throughout the day, this may indicate sleep bruxism. Conversely, awake bruxism tends to cause symptoms that slowly get worse throughout the day, and there may be no pain at all upon waking.

The relationship of bruxism with TMD is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD. Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism. Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism. A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when more strict diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower. Self-reported bruxism is probably a poor method of identifying bruxism. There are also very many people who grind their teeth and who do not develop TMD. Bruxism and other parafunctional activities may play a role in perpetuating symptoms in some cases.

Other parafunctional habits such as pen chewing, lip and cheek biting (which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum or linea alba), are also suggested to contribute to the development of TMD. Other parafunctional activities might include jaw thrusting, excessive gum chewing, nail biting and eating very hard foods.

===Trauma===
Trauma, both micro and macrotrauma, is sometimes identified as a possible cause of TMD; however, the evidence for this is not strong. Prolonged mouth opening (hyper-extension) is also suggested as a possible cause. It is thought that this leads to microtrauma and subsequent muscular hyperactivity. This may occur during dental treatment, with oral intubation whilst under a general anesthetic, during singing or wind instrument practice (really these can be thought of as parafunctional activities). Damage may be incurred during violent yawning, laughing, road traffic accidents, sports injuries, interpersonal violence, or during dental treatment, (such as tooth extraction).

It has been proposed that a link exists between whiplash injuries (sudden neck hyper-extension usually occurring in road traffic accidents), and the development of TMD. This has been termed &quot;post-traumatic TMD&quot;, to separate it from &quot;idiopathic TMD&quot;. Despite multiple studies having been performed over the years, the cumulative evidence has been described as conflicting, with moderate evidence that TMD can occasionally follow whiplash injury. The research that suggests a link appears to demonstrate a low to moderate incidence of TMD following whiplash injury, and that pTMD has a poorer response to treatment than TMD which has not developed in relation to trauma.

===Occlusal factors===
Occlusal factors as an etiologic factor in TMD is a controversial topic. Abnormalities of occlusion (problems with the bite) are often blamed for TMD but there is no evidence that these factors are involved. Occlusal abnormalities are incredibly common, and most people with occlusal abnormalities do not have TMD. Although occlusal features may affect observed electrical activity in masticatory muscles, there are no statistically significant differences in the number of occlusal abnormalities in people with TMD and in people without TMD. There is also no evidence for a causal link between orthodontic treatment and TMD. The modern, mainstream view is that the vast majority of people with TMD, occlusal factors are not related. Theories of occlusal factors in TMD are largely of historical interest. A causal relationship between occlusal factors and TMD was championed by Ramfjord in the 1960s. A small minority of dentists continue to prescribe occlusal adjustments in the belief that this will prevent or treat TMD despite the existence of systematic reviews of the subject which state that there is no evidence for such practices, and the vast majority of opinion being that no irreversible treatment should be carried out in TMD (see Occlusal adjustment).

===Genetic factors===
TMD does not obviously run in families like a genetic disease. It has been suggested that a genetic predisposition for developing TMD (and chronic pain syndromes generally) could exist. This has been postulated to be explained by variations of the gene which codes for the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) which may produce 3 different phenotypes with regards pain sensitivity. COMT (together with monoamine oxidase) is involved in breaking down catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). The variation of the COMT gene which produces less of this enzyme is associated with a high sensitivity to pain. Females with this variation, are at 2–3 times greater risk of developing TMD than females without this variant. However this theory is controversial since there is conflicting evidence.

===Hormonal factors===
Since females are more often affected by TMD than males, the female sex hormone estrogen has been suggested to be involved. The results of one study suggested that the periods of highest pain in TMD can be correlated with rapid periods of change in the circulating estrogen level. Low estrogen was also correlated to higher pain. In the menstrual cycle, estrogen levels fluctuate rapidly during ovulation, and also rapidly increases just before menstruation and rapidly decreases during menstruation. Post-menopausal females who are treated with hormone replacement therapy are more likely to develop TMD, or may experience an exacerbation if they already had TMD. Several possible mechanisms by which estrogen might be involved in TMD symptoms have been proposed. Estrogen may play a role in modulating joint inflammation, nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal nerve, muscle reflexes to pain and μ-opioid receptors.

===Possible associations===
TMD has been suggested to be associated with other conditions or factors, with varying degrees of evidence and some more commonly than others. 75% of people with TMD qualify for a fibromyalgia diagnosis and, conversely, 18% of people with fibromyalgia met diagnostic criteria for TMD. A possible link between many of these chronic pain conditions has been hypothesized to be due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, and they have been collectively termed &quot;central sensitivity syndromes&quot;, although other apparent associations cannot be explained in this manner. Recently a plethora of research has substantiated a causal relationship between TMD and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Severe TMD restricts oral airway opening, and can result in a retrognathic posture that results in glossal blockage of the oropharynx as the tongue relaxes in sleep. This mechanism is exacerbated by alcohol consumption, as well as other chemicals that result in reduced myotonic status of the oropharynx.

* Obstructive sleep apnea. 
* Headache.
* Chronic neck pain.
* Chronic back pain. 
* Systemic joint laxity. 
* Rheumatoid arthritis.
* Irritable bowel syndrome.
* Interstitial cystitis.
* Regular scuba diving.

==Pathophysiology==
===Anatomy and physiology===

====Temporomandibular joints====

The temporomandibular joints are the dual articulation of the mandible with the skull. Each TMJ is classed as a &quot;ginglymoarthrodial&quot; joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint, and involves the condylar process of the mandible below, and the articular fossa (or glenoid fossa) of the temporal bone above. Between these articular surfaces is the articular disc (or meniscus), which is a biconcave, transversely oval disc composed of dense fibrous connective tissue. Each TMJ is covered by a fibrous capsule. There are tight fibers connecting the mandible to the disc, and loose fibers which connect the disc to the temporal bone, meaning there are in effect 2 joint capsules, creating an upper joint space and a lower joint space, with the articular disc in between. The synovial membrane of the TMJ lines the inside of the fibrous capsule apart from the articular surfaces and the disc. This membrane secretes synovial fluid, which is both a lubricant to fill the joint spaces, and a means to convey nutrients to the tissues inside the joint. Behind the disc is loose vascular tissue termed the &quot;bilaminar region&quot; which serves as a posterior attachment for the disc and also fills with blood to fill the space created when the head of the condyle translates down the articular eminence. Due to its concave shape, sometimes the articular disc is described as having an anterior band, intermediate zone and a posterior band. When the mouth is opened, the initial movement of the mandibular condyle is rotational, and this involves mainly the lower joint space, and when the mouth is opened further, the movement of the condyle is translational, involving mainly the upper joint space. This translation movement is achieved by the condylar head sliding down the articular eminence, which constitutes the front border of the articular fossa. The function of the articular eminence is to limit the forwards movement of the condyle. The ligament directly associated with the TMJ is the temporomandibular ligament, also termed the lateral ligament, which really is a thickening of the lateral aspect of the fibrous capsule. The stylomandibular ligament and the sphenomandibular ligament are not directly associated with the joint capsule. Together, these ligaments act to restrict the extreme movements of the joint.

====Muscles of mastication====

The muscles of mastication are paired on each side and work together to produce the movements of the mandible. The main muscles involved are the masseter, temporalis and medial and lateral pterygoid muscles.

They can be thought of in terms of the directions they move the mandible, with most being involved in more than one type of movement due to the variation in the orientation of muscle fibers within some of these muscles.

* Protrusion – Lateral and medial pterygoid.
* Retraction – Posterior fibers of temporalis (and the digastric and geniohyoid muscles to a lesser extent).
* Elevation – Anterior and middle fibers of temporalis, the superficial and deep fibers of masseter and the medial pterygoid.
* Lateral movements – Medial and lateral pterygoid (the ipsilateral temporalis and the pterygoid muscles of the contralateral side pull the mandible to the ipsilateral side).

Each lateral pterygoid muscle is composed of 2 heads, the upper or superior head and the lower or inferior head. The lower head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts at a depression on the neck of mandibular condyle, just below the articular surface, termed the pterygoid fovea. The upper head originates from the infratemporal surface and the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The upper head also inserts at the fovea, but a part may be attached directly to the joint capsule and to the anterior and medial borders of the articular disc. The 2 parts of lateral pterygoid have different actions. The lower head contracts during mouth opening, and the upper head contracts during mouth closing. The function of the lower head is to steady the articular disc as it moves back with the condyle into the articular fossa. It is relaxed during mouth closure.

===Mechanisms of symptoms===

====Joint noises====
Noises from the TMJs are a symptom of dysfunction of these joints. The sounds commonly produced by TMD are usually described as a &quot;click&quot; or a &quot;pop&quot; when a single sound is heard and as &quot;crepitation&quot; or &quot;crepitus&quot; when there are multiple, grating, rough sounds. Most joint sounds are due to internal derangement of the joint, which is instability or abnormal position of the articular disc. Clicking often accompanies either jaw opening or closing, and usually occurs towards the end of the movement. The noise indicates that the articular disc has suddenly moved to and from a temporarily displaced position (disk displacement with reduction) to allow completion of a phase of movement of the mandible. If the disc displaces and does not reduce (move back into position) this may be associated with locking. Clicking alone is not diagnostic of TMD since it is present in high proportion of the general population, mostly in people who have no pain. Crepitus often indicates arthritic changes in the joint, and may occur at any time during mandibular movement, especially lateral movements. Perforation of the disc may also cause crepitus. Due to the proximity of the TMJ to the ear canal, joint noises are perceived to be much louder to the individual than to others. Often people with TMD are surprised that what sounds to them like very loud noises cannot be heard at all by others next to them. However, it is occasionally possible for loud joint noises to be easily heard by others in some cases and this can be a source of embarrassment e.g. when eating in company.

====Pain====
Pain symptoms in TMD can be thought of as originating from the joint (arthralgia), or from the muscles (myofascial), or both. There is a poor correlation between TMD pain severity and evidence of tissue pathology.

Generally, degenerative joint changes are associated with greater pain.

=====Myofascial Pain=====
Pain originating from the muscles of mastication as a result of abnormal muscular function or hyperactivity. The muscular pain is frequently, but not always, associated with daytime clenching or nocturnal bruxism.

====Limitation of mandibular movement====
The jaw deviates to the affected side during opening, and restricted mouth opening usually signifies that both TMJs are involved, but severe trismus rarely occurs. If the greatest reduction in movement occurs upon waking then this may indicate that there is concomitant sleep bruxism. In other cases the limitation in movement gets worse throughout the day.

The jaw may lock entirely.

Limitation of mandibular movement itself may lead to further problems involving the TMJs and the muscles of mastication. Changes in the synovial membrane may lead to a reduction in lubrication of the joint and contribute to degenerative joint changes. The muscles become weak, and fibrosis may occur. All these factors may lead to a further limitation of jaw movement and increase in pain.

Degenerative joint disease, such as osteoarthritis or organic degeneration of the articular surfaces, recurrent fibrous or bony ankylosis, developmental abnormality, or pathologic lesions within the TMJ. Myofascial pain syndrome.

=====Referred TMD pain=====
Sometimes TMD pain can radiate or be referred from its cause (i.e. the TMJ or the muscles of mastication) and be felt as headaches, earache or toothache.

Due to the proximity of the ear to the temporomandibular joint, TMJ pain can often be confused with ear pain. The pain may be referred in around half of all patients and experienced as otalgia (earache). Conversely, TMD is an important possible cause of secondary otalgia. Treatment of TMD may then significantly reduce symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus, as well as atypical facial pain. Despite some of these findings, some researchers question whether TMJD therapy can reduce symptoms in the ear, and there is currently an ongoing debate to settle the controversy.

==Diagnosis==

Pain is the most common reason for people with TMD to seek medical advice. 
Joint noises may require auscultation with a stethoscope to detect. Clicks of the joint may also be palpated, over the joint itself in the preauricular region, or via a finger inserted in the external acoustic meatus, which lies directly behind the TMJ.
The differential diagnosis is with degenerative joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, otitis media, parotitis, mandibular osteomyelitis, Eagle syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, oromandibular dystonia, deafferentation pains, and psychogenic pain.

===Diagnostic criteria===
Various diagnostic systems have been described. Some consider the Research Diagnostic Criteria method the gold standard. Abbreviated to &quot;RDC/TMD&quot;, this was first introduced in 1992 by Dworkin and LeResche in an attempt to classify temporomandibular disorders by etiology and apply universal standards for research into TMD. This method involves 2 diagnostic axes, namely axis I, the physical diagnosis, and axis II, the psychologic diagnosis. Axis I contains 3 different groups which can occur in combinations of 2 or all 3 groups, (see table).

McNeill 1997 described TMD diagnostic criteria as follows:

* Pain in muscles of mastication, the TMJ, or the periauricular area (around the ear), which is usually made worse by manipulation or function.
* Asymmetric mandibular movement with or without clicking.
* Limitation of mandibular movements.
* Pain present for a minimum of 3 months.

The International Headache Society&#x27;s diagnostic criteria for &quot;headache or facial pain attributed to temporomandibular joint disorder&quot; is similar to the above:

* A. Recurrent pain in one or more regions of the head or face fulfilling criteria C and D
* B. X-ray, MRI or bone scintigraphy demonstrate TMJ disorder
* C. Evidence that pain can be attributed to the TMJ disorder, based on at least one of the following:
** pain is precipitated by jaw movements or chewing of hard or tough food
** reduced range of or irregular jaw opening
** noise from one or both TMJs during jaw movements
** tenderness of the joint capsule(s) of one or both TMJs
* D. Headache resolves within 3 months, and does not recur, after successful treatment of the TMJ disorder

=== Medical imaging ===
The advantages brought about by diagnostic imaging mainly lie within diagnosing TMD of articular origin. Additional benefits of imaging the TMJ are as follows:

* Assess the integrity of anatomical structures in suspicion of disorders
* Staging the extent of any pathology
* Monitoring and staging the progress of disease
* Determining the effects of treatment

When clinical examination alone is unable to bring sufficient detail to ascertain the state of the TMJ, imaging methods can act as an adjuvant to clinical examination in the diagnosis of TMD.

==== Plain radiography ====
This method of imaging allows the visualisation of the joint&#x27;s mineralised areas, therefore excluding the cartilage and soft tissues. A disadvantage of plain radiography is that images are prone to superimposition from surrounding anatomical structures, thereby complicating radiographic interpretation. It was concluded that there is no evidence to support the use of plain radiography in the diagnosis of joint erosions and osteophytes. It is reasonable to conclude that plain film can only be used to diagnose extensive lesions.

==== Panoramic tomography ====
The distortion brought about by panoramic imaging decreases its overall reliability. Data concluded from a systematic review showed that only extensive erosions and large osteophytes can be detected by panoramic imaging.

==== Computerised tomography (CT) ====
Studies have shown that tomography of the TMJ provided supplementary information that supersedes what is obtainable from clinical examination alone. However, the issues lies in the fact that it is impossible to determine whether certain patient groups would benefit more or less from a radiographic examination.

The main indications of CT and CBCT examinations are to assess the bony components of the TMJ, specifically the location and extent of any abnormalities present.

The introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging allowed a lower radiation dose to patients, in comparison to conventional CT. Hintze et al. compared CBCT and CT techniques and their ability to detect morphological TMJ changes. No significant difference was concluded in terms of their diagnostic accuracy.

==== Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ====
MRI is the optimal choice for the imaging of soft tissues surrounding the TMJ. It allows three-dimensional evaluation of the axial, coronal and sagittal plane. It is the gold standard method for assessing disc position and is sensitive for intra-articular degenerative alterations.

Indications for MRI are pre-auricular pain, detection of joint clicking and crepitus, frequent incidents of subluxation and jaw dislocation, limited mouth opening with terminal stiffness, suspicion of neoplastic growth, and osteoarthritic symptoms. It is also useful for assessing the integrity of neural tissues, which may produce orofacial pain when compressed.

MRI provides evaluation of pathology such as necrosis and oedema all without any exposure to ionizing radiation. However, there is a high cost associated with this method of imaging, due to the need for sophisticated facilities. Caution should be taken in patient selection, as MRI is contraindicated in those with claustrophobic tendencies, pacemakers and metallic heart valves, ferromagnetic foreign bodies and pregnant women.

==== Ultrasound ====
Where internal TMJ disorders are concerned, ultrasound (US) imaging can be a useful alternative in assessing the position of the disc While having significant diagnostic sensitivity, US has inadequate specificity when identifying osteoarthrosis. Moreover, it is not accurate enough for the diagnosis of cortical and articular disc morphology based on the findings done related to morphological alterations. However, with US, identification of effusion in individuals with inflammatory conditions associated with pain is possible and confirmed by MRI

US can be a useful alternative in initial investigation of internal TMJ dysfunctions especially in MRI contraindicated individuals despite its limitations. in addition to being less costly, US provides a quick and comfortable real-time imaging without exposing the individual to ionizing radiation

US is commonly assessed in the differential diagnosis of alterations of glandular and neighbouring structures, such as the TMJ and the masseter muscle. Symptoms of sialendenitis and sialothiasis cases can be confused with Eagle syndrome, TMD, myofascial and nerve pain, and other pain of the orofacial region.

US assessment is also indicated where there is need to identify the correct position of the joint spaces for infiltrative procedures, arthrocentesis, and viscosupplementation. This is due to the fact that US provides a dynamic and real-time location of the component of the joints, while providing adequate lubrication and washing, which can be confirmed by the joint space increase post-treatment.

==Management==
TMD can be difficult to manage, and since the disorder transcends the boundaries between several health-care disciplines – in particular, dentistry and neurology, the treatment may often involve multiple approaches and be multidisciplinary. Most who are involved in treating and researching TMD now agree that any treatment carried out should not permanently alter the jaw or teeth, and should be reversible. To avoid permanent change, over-the-counter or prescription pain medications may be prescribed.

===Psychosocial and behavioral interventions===
Given the important role that psychosocial factors appear to play in TMD, psychosocial interventions could be viewed to be central to management of the condition. There is a suggestion that treatment of factors that modulate pain sensitivity such as mood disorders, anxiety and fatigue, may be important in the treatment of TMD, which often tends to attempt to address the pain directly.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in TMD and has been shown to be efficacious by meta analyses.

Hypnosis is suggested by some to be appropriate for TMD. Studies have suggested that it may even be more beneficial than occlusal splint therapy, and has comparable effects to relaxation techniques.

Relaxation techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, and meditation. It has been suggested that TMD involves increased sensitivity to external stimuli leading to an increased sympathetic (&quot;fight or flight&quot;) response with cardiovascular and respiratory alterations. Relaxation techniques cause reduced sympathetic activity, including muscle relaxation and reducing sensitivity to external stimuli, and provoke a general sense of well-being and reduced anxiety.

===Devices===
Occlusal splints (also termed bite plates or intra-oral appliances) are often used by dentists to treat TMD. They are usually made of acrylic and can be hard or soft. They can be designed to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth. They may cover all the teeth in one arch (full coverage splint) or only some (partial coverage splint). Splints are also termed according to their intended mechanism, such as the anterior positioning splint or the stabilization splint. Although occlusal splints are generally considered a reversible treatment, sometimes partial coverage splints lead to pathologic tooth migration (changes in the position of teeth). Normally splints are only worn during sleep, and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep. There is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal splints in sleep bruxism than in TMD. A splint can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night. This may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt. Soft splints are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to TMD. Specific types of occlusal splint are discussed below.

A stabilization splint is a hard acrylic splint that forces the teeth to meet in an &quot;ideal&quot; relationship for the muscles of mastication and the TMJs. It is claimed that this technique reduces abnormal muscular activity and promotes &quot;neuromuscular balance&quot;. A stabilization splint is only intended to be used for about 2–3 months. It is more complicated to construct than other types of splint since a face bow record is required and significantly more skill on the part of the dental technician. This kind of splint should be properly fitted to avoid exacerbating the problem and used for brief periods of time. The use of the splint should be discontinued if it is painful or increases existing pain. A systematic review of all the scientific studies investigating the efficacy of stabilization splints concluded the following:

Partial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements, which can occasionally be severe. The mechanism of this tooth movement is that the splint effectively holds some teeth out of contact and puts all the force of the bite onto the teeth which the splint covers. This can cause the covered teeth to be intruded, and those that are not covered to over-erupted. I.e. a partial coverage splint can act as a Dahl appliance. Examples of partial coverage splints include the NTI-TSS (&quot;nociceptive trigeminal inhibitor tension suppression system&quot;), which covers the upper front teeth only. Due to the risks involved with long term use, some discourage the use of any type of partial coverage splint.

An anterior positioning splint is a splint that designed to promote an anteriorly displaced disc. It is rarely used. A 2010 review of all the scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in TMD concluded:

Ear canal inserts are also available, but no published peer-reviewed clinical trials have shown them to be useful.

===Medication===
Medication is the main method of managing pain in TMD, mostly because there is little if any evidence of the effectiveness of surgical or dental interventions. Many drugs have been used to treat TMD pain, such as analgesics (pain killers), benzodiazepines (e.g. clonazepam, prazepam, diazepam), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin), muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine), and others. Analgesics that have been studied in TMD include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. piroxicam, diclofenac, naproxen, celecoxib).

Topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin have also been used.

Other drugs that have been described for use in TMD include glucosamine hydrochloride/chondroitin sulphate and propranolol. Low-doses of anti-muscarinic tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or nortriptyline have also been described.

Despite many randomized control trials being conducted on these commonly used medications for TMD a systematic review carried out in 2010 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or not to support the use of these drugs in TMD.

In a subset of people with TMD who are not helped by either noninvasive and invasive treatments, long term use of opiate analgesics has been suggested, although these drugs carry a risk of drug dependence and other side effects. Examples include morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, tramadol, hydrocodone, and methadone.

Injections of local anesthetic, sometimes combined with steroids, into the muscles (e.g. the temoralis muscle or its tendon) are also sometimes used. Local anesthetics may provide temporary pain relief, and steroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines. Steroids and other medications are sometimes injected directly into the joint (See Intra-articular injections). Platelet-rich fibrin injection, alone or associated with arthrocentesis, can be considered a very suitable.

Botulinum toxin solution (&quot;Botox&quot;) is sometimes used to treat TMD. Injection of botox into the lateral pterygoid muscle has been investigated in multiple randomized control trials, and there is evidence that it is of benefit in TMD. It is theorized that spasm of lateral pterygoid causes anterior disc displacement. Botulinum toxin causes temporary muscular paralysis by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. The effects usually last for a period of months before they wear off. Complications include the creation of a &quot;fixed&quot; expression due to diffusion of the solution and subsequent involvement of the muscles of facial expression, which lasts until the effects of the botox wear off.

===Physiotherapy===
Physiotherapy (physical therapy) is sometimes used as an adjuvant to other methods of treatment in TMD. There are many different approaches described, but exercises aiming to increase the range of mandibular movements are commonly involved. Jaw exercises aim to directly oppose the negative effects of disuse that may occur in TMD, due to pain discouraging people from moving their jaw. After initial instruction, people are able to perform a physical therapy regimen at home. The most simple method is by regular stretching within pain tolerance, using the thumb and a finger in a &quot;scissor&quot; maneuver. Gentle force is applied until pain of resistance is felt, and then the position is held for several seconds. Commercial devices have been developed to carry out this stretching exercise (e.g. the &quot;Therabite&quot; appliance). Over time, the amount of mouth opening possible without pain can be gradually increased. A baseline record of the distance at the start of physical therapy (e.g. the number of fingers that can be placed vertically between the upper and lower incisors), can chart any improvement over time.

It has been suggested that massage therapy for TMD improves both the subjective and objective health status. &quot;Friction massage&quot; uses surface pressure to cause temporary ischemia and subsequent hyperemia in the muscles, and this is hypothesized to inactivate trigger points and disrupt small fibrous adhesions within the muscle that have formed following surgery or muscular shortening due to restricted movement.

Occasionally physiotherapy for TMD may include the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which may override pain by stimulation of superficial nerve fibers and lead to pain reduction which extends after the time where the TENS is being actually being applied, possibly due to release of endorphins. Others recommend the use of ultrasound, theorized to produce tissue heating, alter blood flow and metabolic activity at a level that is deeper than possible with surface heat applications. There is tentative evidence that low level laser therapy may help with pain.

The goals of a PT in reference to treatment of TMD should be to decrease pain, enable muscle relaxation, reduce muscular hyperactivity, and reestablish muscle function and joint mobility. PT treatment is non-invasive and includes self-care management in an environment to create patient responsibility for their own health.

Therapeutic exercise and Manual Therapy (MT) are used to improve strength, coordination and mobility and to reduce pain. Treatment may focus on poor posture, cervical muscle spasms and treatment for referred cervical origin (pain referred from upper levels of the cervical spine) or orofacial pain. MT has been used to restore normal range of motion, promoting circulation, stimulate proprioception, break fibrous adhesions, stimulate synovial fluid production and reduce pain. Exercises and MT are safe and simple interventions that could potentially be beneficial for patients with TMD. No adverse events regarding exercise therapy and manual therapy have been reported.

There have been positive results when using postural exercises and jaw exercises to treat both myogenous (muscular) and arthrogenous (articular) TMJ dysfunction. MT alone or in combination with exercises shows promising effects.

It is necessary that trials be performed isolating the type of exercise and manual techniques to allow a better understanding of the effectiveness of this treatment. Additionally, details of exercise, dosage, and frequency as well as details on manual techniques should be reported to create reproducible results. High quality trials with larger sample sizes are needed.

There is some evidence that some people who use nighttime biofeedback to reduce nighttime clenching experience a reduction in TMD.

===Occlusal adjustment===
This is the adjustment or reorganizing of the existing occlusion, carried out in the belief that this will redistribute forces evenly across the dental arches or achieve a more favorable position of the condyles in the fossae, which is purported to lessen tooth wear, bruxism and TMD, but this is controversial. These techniques are sometimes termed &quot;occlusal rehabilitation&quot; or &quot;occlusal equilibration&quot;. At its simplest, an occlusal adjustment involves selective grinding (with a dental drill) of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth, with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way. However, there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the exact goals. Occlusal adjustment can also be very complex, involving orthodontics, restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism. A &quot;middle ground&quot; view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of TMD is neither desirable nor helpful as a first-line treatment, and furthermore, with few exceptions, any adjustments should be reversible. However, most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment, with no evidence of benefit. Specifically, orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for TMD. A systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in TMD concluded the following: 
These conclusions were based largely on the fact that, despite many different scientific studies investigating this measure as a therapy, overall no statistically significant differences can be demonstrated between treatment with occlusal adjustment and treatment with placebo. The reviewers also stated that there are ethical implications if occlusal adjustment was found to be ineffective in preventing TMD.

Orthodontic treatment, as described earlier, is sometimes listed as a possible predisposing factor in the development of TMD. On the other hand, orthodontic treatment is also often carried out in the belief that it may treat or prevent TMD. Another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and TMD concluded the following:

A common scenario where a newly placed dental restoration (e.g. a crown or a filling) is incorrectly contoured, and creates a premature contact in the bite. This may localize all the force of the bite onto one tooth, and cause inflammation of the periodontal ligament and reversible increase in tooth mobility. The tooth may become tender to bite on. Here, the &quot;occlusal adjustment&quot; has already taken place inadvertently, and the adjustment aims to return to the pre-existing occlusion. This should be distinguished from attempts to deliberately reorganize the native occlusion.

===Surgery===

Attempts in the last decade to develop surgical treatments based on MRI and CAT scans now receive less attention. These techniques are reserved for the most difficult cases where other therapeutic modalities have failed. The American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons recommends a conservative/non-surgical approach first. Only 20% of patients need to proceed to surgery.

Examples of surgical procedures that are used in TMD, some more commonly than others, include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, meniscectomy, disc repositioning, condylotomy or joint replacement. Invasive surgical procedures in TMD may cause symptoms to worsen. Meniscectomy, also termed discectomy refers to surgical removal of the articular disc. This is rarely carried out in TMD, it may have some benefits for pain, but dysfunction may persist and overall it leads to degeneration or remodeling of the TMJ.

===Alternative medicine===

====Acupuncture====
Acupuncture is sometimes used for TMD. There is limited evidence that acupuncture is an effective symptomatic treatment for TMD. A short-term reduction in muscular pain of muscular origin can usually be observed after acupuncture in TMD, and this is more than is seen with placebo. There are no reported adverse events of acupuncture when used for TMD, and some suggest that acupuncture is best employed as an adjuvant to other treatments in TMD. However, some suggest that acupuncture may be no more effective than sham acupuncture, that many of the studies investigating acupuncture and TMD have significant risk of bias, and that the long term efficacy of acupuncture for TMD is unknown.

====Chiropractic====
Chiropractic adjustments (also termed manipulations or mobilizations) are sometimes used in the belief that this will treat TMD. There is no credible evidence of efficacy in TMD. However, there is some evidence of possible adverse effects from cervical (neck) vertebral manipulation, which sometimes may be serious.

==Prognosis==
It has been suggested that the natural history of TMD is benign and self-limiting, with symptoms slowly improving and resolving over time. The prognosis is therefore good. However, the persistent pain symptoms, psychological discomfort, physical disability and functional limitations may detriment quality of life. It has been suggested that TMD does not cause permanent damage and does not progress to arthritis in later life, however, degenerative disorders of the TMJ such as osteoarthritis are included within the spectrum of TMDs in some classifications.

==Epidemiology==

TMD mostly affects people in the 20 – 40 age group, and the average age is 33.9 years. People with TMD tend to be younger adults, who are otherwise healthy. Within the catchall umbrella of TMD, there are peaks for disc displacements at age 30, and for inflammatory-degenerative joint disorders at age 50.

About 75% of the general population may have at least one abnormal sign associated with the TMJ (e.g. clicking), and about 33% have at least one symptom of TMD. However, only in 3.6–7% will this be of sufficient severity to trigger the individual to seek medical advice.

For unknown reasons, females are more likely to be affected than males, in a ratio of about 2:1, although others report this ratio to be as high as 9:1. Females are more likely to request treatment for TMD, and their symptoms are less likely to resolve. Females with TMD are more likely to be nulliparous than females without TMD. It has also been reported that female caucasians are more likely to be affected by TMD, and at an earlier age, than female African Americans.

According to the most recent analyses of epidemiologic data using the RDC/TMD diagnostic criteria, of all TMD cases, group I (muscle disorders) accounts for 45.3%, group II (disc displacements) 41.1%, and group III (joint disorders) 30.1% (individuals may have diagnoses from more than one group). Using the RDC/TMD criteria, TMD has a prevalence in the general population of 9.7% for group I, 11.4% for group IIa, and 2.6% for group IIIa.

The highest prevalence of TMD (regardless of type) is in South America at 47%, followed by Asia at 33%, Europe at 29%, and North America at 26%.

==History==
Temporomandibular disorders were described as early as ancient Egypt. An older name for the condition is &quot;Costen&#x27;s syndrome&quot;, eponymously referring to James B. Costen. Costen was an otolaryngologist, and although he was not the first physician to describe TMD, he wrote extensively on the topic, starting in 1934, and was the first to approach the disorder in an integrated and systematic way. Costen hypothesized that malocclusion caused TMD, and placed emphasis on ear symptoms, such as tinnitus, otalgia, impaired hearing, and even dizziness. Specifically, Costen believed that the cause of TMD was mandibular over-closure, recommending a treatment revolving around building up the bite. The eponym &quot;Costen syndrome&quot; became commonly used shortly after his initial work, but in modern times it has been dropped, partially because occlusal factors are now thought to play little, if any, role in the development of TMD, and also because ear problems are now thought to be less associated with TMD. Other historically important terms that were used for TMD include &quot;TMJ disease&quot; or &quot;TMJ syndrome&quot;, which are now rarely used.

On March 31, 2020, The American Dental Association officially recognized orofacial pain as a dental speciality.
