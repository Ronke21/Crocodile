<text>Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that emerged from EBM in Frankfurt, Germany, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and quickly spread throughout Europe.

Trance music is typically characterized by a tempo between 120 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 &quot;peaks&quot; or &quot;drops&quot;. Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient and film scores.

A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of modern trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs.

Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, mostly without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as &quot;grand, soaring, and operatic&quot; and &quot;ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths&quot;. However, male singers, such as Jonathan Mendelsohn, are also featured.

==History==

The KLF&#x27;s &quot;What Time is Love? (Pure Trance)&quot; was released in the UK in 1988. The earliest years of Trance were defined by Frankfurt labels such as Eye Q, Harthouse, Fax +49-69/450464, Force Inc., and others. Producers such as Pete Namlook, Oliver Lieb, and Rolf Ellmer created noteworthy tracks such as &quot;Eternal Spirit&quot; by 4Voice, &quot;Hearts&quot; by L.S.G., and &quot;We Came in Peace&quot; by Dance 2 Trance.

Much of the development of trance can be traced to Sven Väth, who was heavily influenced by his experiences traveling to Goa where DJs were using psychedelic rock and other sounds to induce a trance state at beach parties. Vath, Dag Lerner, and Torsten Fenslau had an affection for hypnotic dance sounds and the music at Dorian Gray and Omen began to reflect this.

Väth launched Eye Q with Heinz Roth and Matthias Hoffman in 1991, followed by Harthouse in 1992, releasing some of the most well-known trance tracks of the era. Eye Q took a softer approach to trance with records such as Cygnus X&#x27;s &quot;The Orange Theme,&quot; Brainchild&#x27;s &quot;Symmetry&quot; and Vernon&#x27;s &quot;Wonderer.&quot; Harthouse focused on a harder trance sound with tracks such as Quicksand by Spicelab, Spectrum by Metal Master, Human by Resistance D, and Acperience by Hardfloor. The sound of Frankfurt was the sound of trance. DJ Dag Lerner, one half of Dance to Trance has stated that he was the first to call his music trance and &quot;gave the child his name.&quot; The genre got its name from the trance-like state the music attempted to emulate in the 1990s before the genre&#x27;s focus changed.

In a 2006 interview with Resident Advisor, Sven Väth acknowledged the role of his labels Eye Q and Harthouse in helping to create what people know as trance music today, going on to say that &quot;people are getting a wrong interpretation of what trance music is all about&quot; and differentiating his own form from modern forms saying &quot;They are following a format -- always producing the same structure. It&#x27;s a pop format for trance.&quot;

As German Trance made its way back to Goa, a new subgenre emerged that was more organic in sound with an oriental aesthetic in its melodies, often with references to Eastern philosophy. Goa trance would go on to spawn many sub-genres of its own, including psytrance, psybreaks, and others.

In 1991 in Berlin, MFS Records began to gain a trance profile, signing Mijk van Dijk, Cosmic Baby, and Paul van Dyk, soon releasing some of the most well-known early trance tracks such as Love Stimulation by Humate and Perfect Day by Visions of Shiva, as well as perhaps the first ever trance compilation, Tranceformed From Beyond. While writer Bom Coen traces the roots of trance to Paul van Dyk&#x27;s 1993 remix of Humate&#x27;s &quot;Love Stimulation&quot;, there is little evidence to support this contention. In fact, van Dyk&#x27;s own Trance roots can be traced further back to his work with Visions of Shiva, van Dyk&#x27;s trance project with Cosmic Baby coming earlier. Early on, Paul van Dyk had been relatively sidelined on the scene, but his collaboration with Cosmic Baby quickly led him into the heart of the scene.

In the UK, the British approach to trance music and house music was similar: progressive chord structures, crescendos, longer breakdowns, and more organic instruments. In 1993 Platipus Records was launched by Simon Berry as an outlet for Barry&#x27;s various projects, including Union Jack, Clanger, Art of Trance. Platipus would become one of the most consequential progressive trance labels. Another influential label of progressive trance was Hooj Choons with notable trance releases from artists Tilt, Oliver Lieb, Solarstone, as well as the well-known Three N&#x27; One remix of Cafe Del Mar by Energy 52.

In Australia, Christopher J. Dolan from Melbourne, who performs as Quench produced one of the most iconic trance anthems of the 90s, &quot;Dreams&quot; in 1993. It was re-released in 1994 and was nominated for the ARIA Award for Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995. It peaked at No. 9 on the French singles chart, and No. 75 on the United Kingdom Singles Chart. By October 2000 it had sold over a million copies worldwide. Dreams is widely considered pioneering in the sounds of trance and has influenced DJs and Trance Producers for decades.

In Germany, a harder sub-genre of trance emerged. With a faster tempo and gated pads, hard trance introduced the breakdown-build-anthem template that would become nearly ubiquitous in later trance sub-genres. Hard trance would inspire hardhouse, hard uplifting, jumpstyle, NRG, and hardstyle. Perhaps the best known label for this subgenre of trance was Bonzai Records, a sublabel of Lightning Records with notable tracks including Jones &amp; Stephenson&#x27;s The First Rebirth, Cherry Moon Trax&#x27;s The House of House, Blue Alphabet&#x27;s Cybertrance to name a few.

By the late 1990s, uplifting took over the scene with its fast tempo, characteristic builds, long breakdowns and big drops. In the early 2000s, pop-style vocals began being added into the music. The development of another subgenre, epic trance, finds some of its origins in classical music, with film music also being influential. Trance was arguably at its commercial peak in the second part of 1990s and early 2000s. 

From the late 2000s to the mid 2010s, popular trance music providers such as Armin van Buuren&#x27;s &quot;A State of Trance&quot;, Paul van Dyk, and Above &amp; Beyond remained popular, while lesser known DJs changed to other sounds. In 2017 a new wave of underground DJs such as Nina Kraviz began incorporating trance music into their sets.

In 2023, an effort by John 00 Fleming and others led Beatport to split their trance genre category into two: Trance (Main Floor) and Trance (Raw/Deep/Hypnotic). The latter designed for the underground side of the genre.

==Production==
Trance employs a 4/4 time signature, generally a tempo of 125 to 150 BPM, though the music can be any tempo, and 16 or 32 beat phrases. A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat and a regular open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat. While the majority of trance music uses the same &quot;four-on-the-floor&quot; beat as house and techno, in trance the kick drum is often de-emphasized to give space to the bassline, whereas in house and techno the kick drum is heavily emphasized, oftentimes being the loudest sound in the mix. Extra percussive elements are usually added, and in recent years major transitions, builds or climaxes are often foreshadowed by lengthy &quot;snare rolls&quot;—a quick succession of snare drum hits that build in velocity, frequency, and volume towards the end of a measure.


Rapid arpeggios and minor keys are common features of trance, the latter being almost universal. Trance tracks often use one central &quot;hook&quot;, or melody, which runs through almost the entire song, repeating at intervals anywhere between 2 beats and 32 bars, in addition to harmonies and motifs in different timbres from the central melody. Instruments are added or removed every 4, 8, 16, or 32 bars.

In the section before the breakdown, the lead motif is often introduced in a sliced up and simplified form, to give the audience a &quot;taste&quot; of what they will hear after the breakdown. Then later, the final climax is usually &quot;a culmination of the first part of the track mixed with the main melodic reprise&quot;.

As is the case with many dance music tracks, trance tracks are usually built with sparser intros (&quot;mix-ins&quot;) and outros (&quot;mix-outs&quot;) to enable DJs to blend them together immediately.

EDM-infused forms designed for festival main stages often incorporate other styles and elements of electronic music such as electro and progressive house into its production. It emphasizes harsher basslines and drum beats which decrease the importance of offbeats and focus primarily on a four on the floor stylistic house drum pattern. The BPM of more recent styles tends to be on par with house music at 120 to 135 beats per minute. However, unlike house music, recent forms of Uplifting continue to feature melodic breakdowns and longer transitions.

==Subgenres==

Trance music is broken into a number of subgenres including acid trance, classic trance, hard trance, progressive trance, and uplifting trance. Uplifting trance is also known as &quot;anthem trance&quot;, &quot;epic trance&quot;, &quot;commercial trance&quot;, &quot;stadium trance&quot;, or &quot;euphoric trance&quot;, and has been strongly influenced by classical music in the 1990s and 2000s by leading artists such as Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren, Tiësto, Push, Rank 1 and at present with the development of the subgenre &quot;orchestral uplifting trance&quot; or &quot;uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra&quot; by such artists as Sound Apparel, Andy Blueman, Ciro Visone, Soundlift, Arctic Moon, and Sergey Nevone &amp; Simon O&#x27;Shine, among others. Closely related to uplifting trance is Eurodance, which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music. Notably late in the 1990s, German producer ATB revolutionized the scene of the aforementioned Eurodance with his hit single &quot;9 PM (Till I Come)&quot;. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno, and vocal trance &quot;combines [trance&#x27;s] progressive elements with pop music&quot;. The dream trance genre originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by Robert Miles, who composed Children in 1996. Recently, there is also a very small subgenre called &quot;medieval trance&quot;, which combines medieval elements together with trance elements, e.g. Maestro Giano, Green Clouds and other artists, which are effectively a kind of &quot;reverse Bardcore&quot;.

AllMusic states on progressive trance: &quot;the progressive wing of the trance crowd led directly to a more commercial, chart-oriented sound since trance had never enjoyed much chart action in the first place. Emphasizing the smoother sound of Eurodance or house (and occasionally more reminiscent of Jean-Michel Jarre than Basement Jaxx), Progressive Trance became the sound of the world&#x27;s dance floors by the end of the millennium. Critics ridiculed its focus on predictable breakdowns and relative lack of skill to beat-mix, but progressive trance was caned by the hottest DJ.&quot;

<text>Thomas Ruggles Pynchon Jr. ( , ; born May 8, 1937) is an American novelist noted for his dense and complex novels. His fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, genres and themes, including history, music, science, and mathematics. For &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Pynchon won the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American novelists.

Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon served two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known: &quot;V.&quot; (1963), &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; (1966), and &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1973). Rumors of a historical novel about Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon had circulated as early as the 1980s; the novel, &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, was published in 1997 to critical acclaim. His 2009 novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; was adapted into a feature film by Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014. Pynchon is notoriously reclusive from the media; few photographs of him have been published, and rumors about his location and identity have circulated since the 1960s. Pynchon&#x27;s most recent novel, &quot;Bleeding Edge&quot;, was published in 2013.

==Early life==

Thomas Pynchon was born on May 8, 1937, in Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, one of three children of engineer and politician Thomas Ruggles Pynchon Sr. (1907–1995) and Katherine Frances Bennett (1909–1996), a nurse. During his childhood, Pynchon alternately attended church at an Episcopal church with his father and a Catholic church with his mother.

===Education and naval career===
A &quot;voracious reader and precocious writer&quot;, Pynchon is believed to have skipped two grades before high school. Pynchon attended Oyster Bay High School in Oyster Bay, where he was awarded &quot;student of the year&quot; and contributed short fictional pieces to his school newspaper. These juvenilia incorporated some of the literary motifs and recurring subject matter he would use throughout his career: oddball names, sophomoric humor, illicit drug use, and paranoia.

Pynchon graduated from high school in 1953 at the age of 16. That fall, he went to Cornell University to study engineering physics. At the end of his sophomore year, he enlisted to serve in the U.S. Navy. He attended boot camp at United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge, Maryland, then received training to be an electrician at a base in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1956, he was aboard the destroyer USS &quot;Hank&quot; in the Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis. According to recollections from his Navy friends, Pynchon said at the time that he did not intend to complete his college education.

In 1957, Pynchon returned to Cornell to pursue a degree in English. His first published story, &quot;The Small Rain&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Cornell Writer&quot; in March 1959, and narrates an actual experience of a friend who had served in the Army; subsequently, however, episodes and characters throughout Pynchon&#x27;s fiction draw freely upon his own experiences in the Navy. His short story, &quot;Mortality and Mercy in Vienna&quot;, was published in the Spring 1959 issue of &quot;Epoch&quot;.

While at Cornell, Pynchon befriended Richard Fariña, Kirkpatrick Sale, and David Shetzline. Pynchon would go on to dedicate &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; to Fariña, and to serve as his best man and his pallbearer. In his introduction to Fariña&#x27;s novel &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me&quot;, Pynchon recalls that &quot;we also succeeded in getting on the same literary wavelength. We showed up once at a party, not a masquerade party, in disguise—he as Hemingway, I as Scott Fitzgerald, each of us aware that the other had been through a phase of enthusiasm for his respective author ... Also in &#x27;59 we simultaneously picked up on what I still think is among the finest American novels, Oakley Hall&#x27;s &quot;Warlock&quot;. We set about getting others to read it too, and for a while we had a micro-cult going. Soon a number of us were talking in &quot;Warlock&quot; dialogue, a kind of thoughtful, stylized, Victorian-Wild West diction.&quot; Pynchon reportedly attended lectures given by Vladimir Nabokov, who then taught literature at Cornell. Although Nabokov later said that he had no memory of Pynchon, Nabokov&#x27;s wife Véra, who graded her husband&#x27;s class papers, commented that she remembered his distinctive handwriting as a mixture of printed and cursive letters, &quot;half printing, half script.&quot; In 1958, Pynchon and Sale wrote part or all of a science-fiction musical, &quot;Minstrel Island&quot;, which portrayed a dystopian future in which IBM rules the world. Pynchon received his B.A. with distinction as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in June 1959.

After leaving Cornell, Pynchon began to work on his first novel, &quot;V&quot;. From February 1960 to September 1962, he was employed as a technical writer at Boeing in Seattle, where he compiled safety articles for the &quot;Bomarc Service News&quot;, a support newsletter for the BOMARC surface-to-air missile deployed by the U.S. Air Force. Pynchon&#x27;s experiences at Boeing inspired his depictions of the &quot;Yoyodyne&quot; corporation in &quot;V.&quot; and &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, and both his background in physics and the technical journalism he undertook at Boeing provided much raw material for &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. &quot;V.&quot; won the William Faulkner Foundation Award For Notable First Novel and was a finalist for the National Book Award.

George Plimpton gave the book a positive review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, describing it as a picaresque novel, in which &quot;The author can tell his favorite jokes, throw in a song, indulge in a fantasy, include his own verse, display an intimate knowledge of such disparate subjects as physics, astronomy, art, jazz, how a nose-job is done, the wildlife in the New York sewage system. These indeed are some of the topics which constitute a recent and remarkable example of the genre: a brilliant and turbulent first novel published this month by a young Cornell graduate, Thomas Pynchon.&quot; Plimpton called Pynchon &quot;a writer of staggering promise.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s review of &quot;V.&quot; concluded: &quot;&quot;V.&quot; sails with majesty through caverns measureless to man. What does it mean? Who, finally, is V.? Few books haunt the waking or the sleeping mind, but this is one. Who, indeed?&quot;&quot;.&quot;

====1960s====
After resigning from Boeing, Pynchon spent some time in New York and Mexico before moving to California, where he was reportedly based for much of the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably in a small downstairs apartment at 217 33rd St. in Manhattan Beach
 where he lived as he was composing what would become &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

In 1964 he applied to study mathematics as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, but was turned down.

But in an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he had four novels in progress, announcing: &quot;If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium.&quot;

From the mid-1960s Pynchon also regularly provided blurbs and introductions for a wide range of novels and non-fiction works. He contributed an appreciation of Oakley Hall&#x27;s &quot;Warlock&quot; in a feature called &quot;A Gift of Books&quot; in the December 1965 issue of &quot;Holiday&quot;. Pynchon wrote that Hall &quot;has restored to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity ... It is this deep sensitivity to abysses that makes &quot;Warlock&quot;, I think, one of our best American novels. For we are a nation that can, many of us, toss with all aplomb our candy wrapper into the Grand Canyon itself, snap a color shot and drive away; and we need voices like Oakley Hall’s to remind us how far that piece of paper, still fluttering brightly behind us, has to fall.&quot;

In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from Stanley Edgar Hyman to teach literature at Bennington College, writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as &quot;a moment of temporary insanity&quot;, but noted that he was &quot;too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them.&quot;

Pynchon&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a &quot;potboiler&quot;. When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it &quot;a short story, but with gland trouble&quot;, and hoped that Donadio could &quot;unload it on some poor sucker.&quot;

In June 1966, Pynchon wrote a first-hand report on the aftermath and legacy of the Watts Riots in Los Angeles, titled &quot;A Journey Into the Mind of Watts&quot;, and published in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; won the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon&#x27;s other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as &quot;The Tristero&quot; or &quot;Trystero&quot;, a parody of a Jacobean revenge drama called &quot;The Courier&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of World War II American GIs being used as charcoal cigarette filters. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible connections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like &quot;V.&quot;, the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events. &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; also continues Pynchon&#x27;s habits of writing satiric song lyrics and referencing popular culture. An example of both can be seen in allusion to the narrator of Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; in the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of &quot;The Paranoids&quot;, an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p. 17). Despite Pynchon&#x27;s alleged dislike, &quot;Lot 49&quot; received positive reviews; Harold Bloom named it one of Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;canonical works&quot;, along with &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;. It was included on &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels published since the magazine&#x27;s founding in 1923. Richard Lacayao wrote, &quot;With its slapstick paranoia and heartbreaking metaphysical soliloquies, &quot;Lot 49&quot; takes place in the tragicomic universe that is instantly recognizable as Pynchon-land. Is it also a mystery novel? Absolutely, so long as you recognize the mystery here is the one at the heart of everything&quot;.

In June 1966, Pynchon wrote a first-hand report on the aftermath and legacy of the Watts Riots in Los Angeles, titled &quot;A Journey Into the Mind of Watts&quot;, and published in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

A negative aspect that Pynchon retrospectively found in the hippie movement, both in the form of the Beats of the 1950s and the resurgence form of the 1960s, was that it &quot;placed too much emphasis on youth, including the eternal variety.&quot;

In 1968, Pynchon was one of 447 signatories to the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot;. Full-page advertisements in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; listed the names of those who had pledged not to pay &quot;the proposed 10% income tax surcharge or any war-designated tax increase&quot;, and stated their belief &quot;that American involvement in Vietnam is morally wrong&quot;.

====1970s====
Pynchon&#x27;s most famous novel is his third, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, published in 1973. An intricate and allusive fiction that combines and elaborates on many of the themes of his earlier work, including preterition, paranoia, racism, colonialism, conspiracy, synchronicity, and entropy, there is a wealth of commentary and critical material, including reader&#x27;s guides, books and scholarly articles, online concordances and discussions, and art works. Its artistic value is often compared to that of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Some scholars have hailed it as the greatest American post-WW2 novel, and it has similarly been described as &quot;literally an anthology of postmodernist themes and devices&quot;. Richard Locke, reviewing it in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is longer, darker and more difficult than his first two books; in fact it is the longest, most difficult and most ambitious novel to appear in these pages since Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Ada&quot; four years ago; its technical and verbal resources bring to mind Melville and Faulkner.&quot;

The major portion of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; takes place in Europe in the final months of World War II and the weeks immediately following VE Day, and is narrated for the most part from within the historical moment in which it is set. In this way, Pynchon&#x27;s text enacts a type of dramatic irony whereby neither the characters nor the various narrative voices are aware of specific historical circumstances, such as the Holocaust and, except as hints, premonitions and mythography, the complicity between Western corporate interests and the Nazi war machine, which figure prominently in readers&#x27; apprehensions of the novel&#x27;s historical context. For example, at war&#x27;s end the narrator observes: &quot;There are rumors of a War Crimes Tribunal under way in Nürnberg. No one Slothrop has listened to is clear who&#x27;s trying whom for what ...&quot; (p. 681). Such an approach generates dynamic tension and moments of acute self-consciousness, as both reader and author seem drawn ever deeper into the &quot;plot&quot;, in various senses of that term:


The novel invokes anti-authority sentiments, often through violations of narrative conventions and integrity. For example, as the protagonist, Tyrone Slothrop, considers the fact that his own family &quot;made its money killing trees&quot;, he apostrophizes his apology and plea for advice to the coppice within which he has momentarily taken refuge. In an overt incitement to eco-activism, Pynchon&#x27;s narrative agency then has it that &quot;a medium-sized pine nearby nods its top and suggests, &#x27;Next time you come across a logging operation out here, find one of their tractors that isn&#x27;t being guarded, and take its oil filter with you. That&#x27;s what you can do.&#x27;&quot; (p. 553)

Encyclopedic in scope and often self-conscious in style, the novel displays erudition in its treatment of an array of material drawn from the fields of psychology, chemistry, mathematics, history, religion, music, literature, human sexuality, and film. Pynchon wrote the first draft of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in &quot;neat, tiny script on engineer&#x27;s quadrille paper&quot;. Pynchon worked on the novel throughout the 1960s and early 1970s while he was living in California and Mexico City.

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; shared the 1974 National Book Award with &quot;A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories&quot; by Isaac Bashevis Singer (split award). That same year, the Pulitzer Prize For Fiction panel unanimously recommended &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; for the award, but the Pulitzer board vetoed the jury&#x27;s recommendation, describing the novel as &quot;unreadable&quot;, &quot;turgid&quot;, &quot;overwritten&quot;, and in parts &quot;obscene&quot;. (No Pulitzer Prize For Fiction was awarded that year and finalists were not recognized before 1980.) In 1975, Pynchon declined the William Dean Howells Medal. Along with &quot;Lot 49&quot;, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was included on &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest English-language novels published since the magazine&#x27;s founding, with Lev Grossman and Richard Lacayao commenting on its &quot;fantastic multitude of meditations upon the human need to build systems of intellectual order even as we use the same powers of intellect to hasten our destruction. (Did we mention that this is also a comedy, more or less?) Among American writers of the second half of the 20th century, Pynchon is the indisputed candidate for lasting literary greatness. This book is why.&quot;

His earliest American ancestor, William Pynchon, emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, then became the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1636, and thereafter a long line of Pynchon descendants found wealth and repute on American soil. Aspects of Pynchon&#x27;s ancestry and family background have partially inspired his fiction writing, particularly in the Slothrop family histories related in the short story &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; (1964) and &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;.

===Later career===

A collection of Pynchon&#x27;s early short stories, &quot;Slow Learner&quot;, was published in 1984, with a lengthy autobiographical introduction. In October of the same year, an article titled &quot;Is It O.K. to Be a Luddite?&quot; was published in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. In April 1988, Pynchon reviewed Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, calling it &quot;a shining and heartbreaking book.&quot; Another article, titled &quot;Nearer, My Couch, to Thee&quot;, was published in June 1993 in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, as one in a series of articles in which various writers reflected on each of the Seven Deadly Sins. Pynchon&#x27;s subject was &quot;Sloth&quot;. In 1989, Pynchon was one of many authors who signed a letter of solidarity with Salman Rushdie after Rushdie was sentenced to death by the Ayatollah for his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Pynchon wrote: &quot;I pray that tolerance and respect for life prevail. I keep thinking of you.&quot;

====&quot;Vineland&quot;====

Pynchon&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Vineland&quot;, was published in 1990 and disappointed some fans and critics. It did, however, receive a positive review from Salman Rushdie, who called it &quot;free-flowing and light and funny and maybe the most readily accessible piece of writing the old Invisible Man ever came up with ... the entropy&#x27;s still flowing, but there is something new to report, some faint possibility of redemption, some fleeting hints of happiness and grace. Thomas Pynchon, like Paul Simon&#x27;s girl in New York City, who calls herself the Human Trampoline, is bouncing into Graceland.&quot; The novel is set in California in the 1980s and 1960s and describes the relationship between an FBI COINTELPRO agent and a female radical filmmaker. Its strong socio-political undercurrents detail the constant battle between authoritarianism and communalism, and the nexus between resistance and complicity, but with a typically Pynchonian sense of humor.

In 1988, he received a MacArthur Fellowship and, since the early 1990s at least, he has been frequently cited as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Pynchon provided a blurb for Don DeLillo&#x27;s novel &quot;Mao II&quot;, about a reclusive novelist and partly inspired by the fatwa on Salman Rushdie: &quot;This novel&#x27;s a beauty. DeLillo takes us on a breathtaking journey, beyond all the official versions of our daily history, behind all the easy assumptions about who we&#x27;re supposed to be, with a vision as bold and a voice as eloquent and morally focused as any in American writing.&quot;

====&quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;====

The meticulously researched novel is a sprawling postmodernist saga recounting the lives and careers of the English astronomer Charles Mason and his partner, the surveyor Jeremiah Dixon, whose survey of the American West resulted in the Mason–Dixon line, during the birth of the American Republic. The dust jacket notes that it features appearances from George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Johnson and a talking dog. Some commentators acknowledged it as a welcome return to form; T. C. Boyle called it &quot;the old Pynchon, the true Pynchon, the best Pynchon of all&quot; and &quot;a book of heart and fire and genius.&quot; Michiko Kakutani called Mason and Dixon Pynchon&#x27;s most human characters, writing that they &quot;become fully fleshed-out people, their feelings, hopes and yearnings made as palpably real as their outrageously comic high jinks.&quot; The American critic Harold Bloom hailed the novel as Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece to date&quot;. Bloom named Pynchon as one of the four major American novelists of his time, along with Cormac McCarthy, Philip Roth and Don DeLillo. For &quot;The Independent&quot; feature Book Of A Lifetime, Marek Kohn chose &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; &quot;precisely because my own teens were long gone by the time it came out: it showed me that being exhilarated by prose is not just an effect of youthful overexcitement.&quot;

====&quot;Against the Day&quot;====

A variety of rumors pertaining to the subject matter of &quot;Against the Day&quot; circulated for a number of years. Most specific of these were comments made by the former German minister of culture Michael Naumann, who stated that he assisted Pynchon in his research about &quot;a Russian mathematician [who] studied for David Hilbert in Göttingen&quot;, and that the new novel would trace the life and loves of Sofia Kovalevskaya.

In July 2006, a new, untitled novel by Pynchon was announced along with a description written by Pynchon himself: &quot;Spanning the period between the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair of 1893 and the years just after World War I, this novel moves from the labor troubles in Colorado to turn-of-the-century New York, to London and Gottingen, Venice and Vienna, the Balkans, Central Asia, Siberia at the times of the mysterious Tunguska Event, Mexico during the Revolution, postwar Paris, silent-era Hollywood, and one or two places not strictly speaking on the map at all. With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead, it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred.&quot; He promised cameos by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi and Groucho Marx, as well as &quot;stupid songs&quot; and &quot;strange sexual practices&quot;. Subsequently, the title of the new book was reported to be &quot;Against the Day&quot; and a Penguin spokesperson confirmed that the synopsis was Pynchon&#x27;s.

&quot;Against the Day&quot; was released on November 21, 2006, and is 1,085 pages long in the first edition hardcover. The book was given almost no promotion by Penguin and professional book reviewers were given little time in advance to review the book. An edited version of Pynchon&#x27;s synopsis was used as the jacket-flap copy and Kovalevskaya does appear, although as only one of over a hundred characters.

Composed in part of a series of interwoven pastiches of popular fiction genres from the era in which it is set, the novel inspired mixed reactions from critics and reviewers. One reviewer remarked, &quot;It is brilliant, but it is exhaustingly brilliant.&quot; Other reviewers described &quot;Against the Day&quot; as &quot;lengthy and rambling&quot; and &quot;a baggy monster of a book&quot;, while negative appraisals condemned the novel for its &quot;silliness&quot; or characterized its action as &quot;fairly pointless&quot; and remained unimpressed by its &quot;grab bag of themes&quot;.

In 2006, Pynchon wrote a letter defending Ian McEwan against charges of plagiarism in his novel &quot;Atonement&quot;: &quot;Oddly enough, those of us who write historical fiction do feel some obligation to accuracy. It is that Ruskin business about &#x27;a capacity of responsiveness to the claims of fact, but unoppressed by them.&#x27; Unless we were actually there, we must turn to people who were, or to letters, contemporary reporting, the encyclopedia, the Internet, until, with luck, at some point, we can begin to make a few things of our own up. To discover in the course of research some engaging detail we know can be put into a story where it will do some good can hardly be classed as a felonious act-- it is simply what we do.&quot;

====&quot;Inherent Vice&quot;====

&quot;Inherent Vice&quot; was published in August 2009.

A synopsis and brief extract from the novel, along with the novel&#x27;s title, &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, and dust jacket image, were printed in Penguin Press&#x27; Summer 2009 catalogue. The book was advertised by the publisher as &quot;part-noir, part-psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon—private eye Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a cannabis haze to watch the end of an era as free love slips away and paranoia creeps in with the L.A. fog.&quot;

A promotional video for the novel was released by Penguin Books on August 4, 2009, with the character voiceover narrated by Pynchon himself.

A 2014 film adaptation of the same name was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.

====&quot;Bleeding Edge&quot;====

&quot;Bleeding Edge&quot; takes place in Manhattan&#x27;s Silicon Alley during &quot;the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11.&quot; The novel was published on September 17, 2013, to positive reviews.

==Style==
Poet L. E. Sissman wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;He is almost a mathematician of prose, who calculates the least and the greatest stress each word and line, each pun and ambiguity, can bear, and applies his knowledge accordingly and virtually without lapses, though he takes many scary, bracing linguistic risks. Thus his remarkably supple diction can first treat of a painful and delicate love scene and then roar, without pause, into the sounds and echoes of a drugged and drunken orgy.&quot;

Pynchon often engages in parodies or pastiches of other styles; &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; is written in the style of the eighteenth-century, when it takes place. Anthony Lane, reviewing the novel in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, writes that &quot;It sounds and, more important, looks like a period novel; it comes bedecked with archaic spellings, complex punctuation, words like &#x27;Nebulosity,&#x27; &#x27;Fescue,&#x27; &#x27;pinguid,&#x27; and &#x27;G-d.&#x27; ... This is hard to fault as pastiche, and yet it moves beyond pastiche, with none of the cramped self-amusement that usually attends the genre. What is more, it bears the signature—wholly unmistakable but written, as it were, in invisible ink—of Pynchon himself.&quot; Pynchon includes deliberate anachronisms: Lane notes that &quot;the shipboard scenes include an honorary mention of a sailor named Pat O&#x27;Brian, &#x27;the best Yarn-Spinner in all the fleets,&#x27; and the current president might allow himself a small smile at the advice on Indian hemp which is offered to Cherrycoke as he prepares to set sail: &#x27;If you must use the latter, do not inhale. Keep your memory working, young man!&#x27; Whether Thomas Pynchon himself would heed this counsel is hard to decide. His memory seems, as ever, not only to have gorged itself on facts and figures but to have kept the whole lot down ... On the other hand, this book could have been conceived in the fumes of inhalation: it has a dreamed quality, an eagerness to be haunted ... Pynchon is furiously clever, but more important and, I suspect, more enduring, is his anatomy of melancholy, his conjuring of a doleful burlesque ... Good luck, and G-dspeed.&quot; Pynchon&#x27;s prose, with its wide range of styles and subjects, is commonly classified as postmodern.

Pynchon makes frequent allusions to other authors; in the introduction to &quot;Slow Learner&quot;, a collection of his early short stories, he acknowledges his debts to the modernists, especially T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, and to the Beats, particularly Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;. He also writes of the influence of jazz and rock and roll, and satiric song lyrics and mock musical numbers are a trademark of his fiction. In his essay &quot;Smoking Dope With Thomas Pynchon: A Sixties Memoir&quot;, Andrew Gordon writes: &quot;Kerouac&#x27;s heroes were filled with romantic angst and an unfulfilled yearning to burn like roman candles, whereas Pynchon&#x27;s were clowns, schlemiels and human yo-yos, bouncing between farce and paranoia. Kerouac was of the cool fifties; he wrote jazz fiction. But Pynchon was of the apocalyptic sixties; he wrote rock and roll.&quot;

==Themes==
In her review of &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, Michiko Kakutani writes: &quot;The Great Big Theme in all of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novels, from &quot;V.&quot; (1963) through &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1973) and &quot;Vineland&quot; (1990) has been: Is the world dominated by conspiracy or chaos? Are there patterns, secret codes, hidden agendas -- in short, a hidden design -- to the bubble and turmoil of human existence, or is it all a product of chance? Are the paranoiacs onto something, or do the nihilists have the key to it all?&quot;

Pynchon&#x27;s work explores philosophical, theological, and sociological ideas exhaustively, though in quirky and approachable ways. His writings demonstrate a strong affinity with the practitioners and artifacts of low culture, including comic books and cartoons, pulp fiction, popular films, television programs, cookery, urban myths, conspiracy theories, and folk art. This blurring of the conventional boundary between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; culture has been seen as one of the defining characteristics of his writing.

Pynchon makes frequent musical allusions. McClintic Sphere in &quot;V.&quot; is a composite of jazz musicians such as Ornette Coleman, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. In &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, the lead singer of The Paranoids sports &quot;a Beatle haircut&quot; and sings with an English accent. In the closing pages of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, there is an apocryphal report that Tyrone Slothrop, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, played kazoo and harmonica as a guest musician on a record released by The Fool in the 1960s (having magically recovered the latter instrument, his &quot;harp&quot;, in a German stream in 1945, after losing it down the toilet in 1939 at the Roseland Ballroom in Roxbury, Boston, to the strains of the jazz standard &quot;Cherokee&quot;, upon which tune Charlie Parker was simultaneously inventing bebop in New York, as Pynchon describes). In &quot;Vineland&quot;, both Zoyd Wheeler and Isaiah Two Four are also musicians: Zoyd played keyboards in a &#x27;60s surf band called The Corvairs, while Isaiah played in a punk band called Billy Barf and the Vomitones. In &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, one of the characters plays on the Clavier the varsity drinking song that will later become &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;; while in another episode a character remarks tangentially &quot;Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to be a woman.&quot; He also alludes to classical music; in &quot;V&quot;., a character sings an aria from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. In &quot;Lot 49&quot; Oedipa listens to &quot;the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble&#x27;s variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist.&quot;

In his introduction to &quot;Slow Learner&quot;, Pynchon acknowledges a debt to the anarchic bandleader Spike Jones, and in 1994, he penned a 3,000-word set of liner notes for the album &quot;Spiked!&quot;, a collection of Jones&#x27;s recordings released on the short-lived BMG Catalyst label. Pynchon also wrote the liner notes for &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Cool&quot;, the second album of indie rock band Lotion, in which he states that &quot;rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings, and a working band is a miracle of everyday life. Which is basically what these guys do.&quot; He is known to be a fan of Roky Erickson.

Investigations and digressions into human sexuality, psychology, sociology, mathematics, science, and technology recur throughout Pynchon&#x27;s works. One of his earliest short stories, &quot;Low-lands&quot; (1960), features a meditation on Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle as a metaphor for telling stories about one&#x27;s own experiences. His next published work, &quot;Entropy&quot; (1960), introduced the concept which was to become synonymous with Pynchon&#x27;s name (though Pynchon later admitted the &quot;shallowness of [his] understanding&quot; of the subject, and noted that choosing an abstract concept first and trying to construct a narrative based on it was &quot;a lousy way to go about writing a story&quot;). Another early story, &quot;Under the Rose&quot; (1961), includes among its cast of characters a cyborg set anachronistically in Victorian-era Egypt (a precursor of what is now called steampunk). This story, significantly reworked by Pynchon, appears as Chapter 3 of &quot;V.&quot; &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; (1964), Pynchon&#x27;s last published short story, is a sensitively handled coming-of-age tale in which a group of young boys face the consequences of the American policy of racial integration. At one point in the story, the boys attempt to understand the new policy by way of the mathematical operation, the only sense of the word with which they are familiar.

&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; also alludes to entropy and communication theory, and contains scenes and descriptions which parody or appropriate calculus, Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes, and the thought experiment known as Maxwell&#x27;s demon. At the same time, the novel also investigates homosexuality, celibacy and both medically sanctioned and illicit psychedelic drug use. &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; describes many varieties of sexual fetishism (including sado-masochism, coprophilia and a borderline case of tentacle erotica), and features numerous episodes of drug use, most notably cannabis but also cocaine, naturally occurring hallucinogens, and the mushroom &quot;Amanita muscaria.&quot; &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; also derives much from Pynchon&#x27;s background in mathematics: at one point, the geometry of garter belts is compared with that of cathedral spires, both described as mathematical singularities. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; explores the scientific, theological, and socio-cultural foundations of the Age of Reason while also depicting the relationships between actual historical figures and fictional characters in intricate detail and, like &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, is an archetypal example of the genre of historiographic metafiction.

==Influence==

S. Eliot, di Chirico’s novel &quot;Hebdomeros&quot;&quot; (in &quot;V.&quot;, p. 307), William March, Vladimir Nabokov (in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, p. 120), Patrick O&#x27;Brian (in &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, p. 54), Ishmael Reed (in &quot;Gravity’s Rainbow&quot;, p. 558), Rainer Maria Rilke (in &quot;Gravity’s Rainbow&quot;, p. 97 f) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (in &quot;V.&quot;, p. 278 f), and to a heady mixture of iconic religious and philosophical sources.

Critics have made comparisons of Pynchon&#x27;s writing with works by Rabelais, Cervantes, Laurence Sterne, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Mann, William S. Burroughs, Ralph Ellison, Patrick White, and Toni Morrison.

Pynchon&#x27;s work also has similarities with modernist writers who wrote long novels dealing with large metaphysical or political issues, such as James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Apes of God&quot;, Robert Musil&#x27;s &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; and John Dos Passos&#x27;s &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy. A strong influence from Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot; on Pynchon&#x27;s first novel has been noted. &quot;V.&quot; resembles Nabokov&#x27;s novel in plot, character, narration and style, and the title alludes directly to Nabokov&#x27;s narrator &quot;V.&quot; in &quot;The Real Life of Sebastian Knight&quot;. Pynchon also outlines the influence on his own early fiction of literary works by Ernest Hemingway, Henry Miller, Saul Bellow, Herbert Gold, Philip Roth, Norman Mailer, John Buchan and Graham Greene, and non-fiction works by Helen Waddell, Norbert Wiener and Isaac Asimov.

===Legacy===
Pynchon&#x27;s work has been cited as an influence and inspiration by many writers, among them Elfriede Jelinek (who translated &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; into German), David Foster Wallace, William T. Vollmann, Richard Powers, Steve Erickson, David Mitchell, Neal Stephenson, Dave Eggers, William Gibson, T. C. Boyle, Salman Rushdie, Alan Moore, and Tommaso Pincio (whose pseudonym is an Italian rendering of Pynchon&#x27;s name).

Thanks to his influence on Gibson and Stephenson in particular, Pynchon became one of the progenitors of cyberpunk fiction; a 1987 essay in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine by Timothy Leary explicitly named &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; as the &quot;Old Testament&quot; of cyberpunk, with Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and its sequels as the &quot;New Testament&quot;. Though the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; did not become prevalent until the early 1980s, since Leary&#x27;s article many readers have retroactively included &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in the genre, along with other works—Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;Dhalgren&quot; and many works of Philip K. Dick—which seem, in hindsight, to anticipate cyberpunk styles and themes. The encyclopedic nature of Pynchon&#x27;s novels also led to some attempts to link his work with the hypertext fiction movement of the 1990s. Ian Rankin, author of the Inspector Rebus mystery novels, called encountering Pynchon in college &quot;a revelation&quot;: &quot;Pynchon seemed to fit the model I was learning of literature as an extended code or grail quest. Moreover, he was like a drug: as you worked out one layer of meaning, you quickly wanted to move to the next. He wrote action novels about spies and soldiers which also happened to be detective stories and bawdy romps. His books were picaresquely post-modern and his humour was Marxian (tendance: Groucho). On page six of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, the name Quackenbush appears, and you know you are in safely comedic hands.&quot;

The main-belt asteroid 152319 is named after Pynchon.

==Media scrutiny of private life==
Relatively little is known about Pynchon&#x27;s private life; he has carefully avoided contact with reporters for more than fifty years. Only a few photos of him are known to exist, nearly all from his high school and college days, and his whereabouts have often remained undisclosed.

A 1963 review of &quot;V.&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; described Pynchon as &quot;a recluse&quot; living in Mexico, thereby introducing the media label with which journalists have characterized him throughout his career. Nonetheless, Pynchon&#x27;s personal absence from mass media is one of the notable features of his life, and it has generated many rumors and apocryphal anecdotes.

Around 1984, Pynchon wrote an introduction for his short story collection &quot;Slow Learner&quot;. His comments on the stories after reading them again for the first time in many years, and his recollection of the events surrounding their creation, amount to the author&#x27;s only autobiographical comments to his readers.

===1970s and 1980s===
After the publication and success of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, interest mounted in finding out more about the identity of the author. At the 1974 National Book Awards ceremony, the president of Viking Press, Tom Guinzberg, arranged for double-talking comedian &quot;Professor&quot; Irwin Corey to accept the prize on Pynchon&#x27;s behalf. Many of the assembled guests had no idea who Corey was and had never seen the author, so they assumed it was Pynchon himself on the stage delivering Corey&#x27;s trademark torrent of rambling, pseudo-scholarly verbiage. Toward the end of Corey&#x27;s address a streaker ran through the hall, adding further to the confusion.

An article by John Batchelor published in the &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot; in 1977 claimed that Pynchon was in fact J. D. Salinger. Pynchon&#x27;s written response to this theory said that &quot;some of it was true, but none of the interesting parts. Not bad. Keep trying.&quot;

Thereafter, the first piece to provide substantial information about Pynchon&#x27;s personal life was a biographical account written by a former Cornell University friend, Jules Siegel, and published in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. In his article, Siegel reveals that Pynchon had a complex about his teeth and underwent extensive and painful reconstructive surgery, was nicknamed &quot;Tom&quot; at Cornell and attended Mass diligently, acted as best man at Siegel&#x27;s wedding, and that he later also had an affair with Siegel&#x27;s wife. Siegel recalls Pynchon saying he did attend some of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s lectures at Cornell but that he could hardly make out what Nabokov was saying because of his thick Russian accent. Siegel also records Pynchon&#x27;s commenting: &quot;Every weirdo in the world is on my wavelength&quot;, an observation borne out by the crankiness and zealotry that has attached itself to his name and work in subsequent years.

===1990s===
Pynchon does not like to talk with reporters, and refuses the spectacle of celebrity and public appearances. Some readers and critics have suggested that there were and are perhaps aesthetic (and ideological) motivations behind his choice to remain aloof from public life. For example, the protagonist in Janette Turner Hospital&#x27;s short story &quot;For Mr. Voss or Occupant&quot; (published in 1991), explains to her daughter that she is writing

More recently, book critic Arthur Salm has written that

Pynchon has published a number of articles and reviews in the mainstream American media, including words of support for Salman Rushdie and his then-wife, Marianne Wiggins, after the fatwa was pronounced against Rushdie by the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. In the following year, Rushdie&#x27;s enthusiastic review of Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Vineland&quot; prompted Pynchon to send him another message hinting that if Rushdie were ever in New York, the two should arrange a meeting. Eventually, the two did have dinner together. Rushdie later commented: &quot;He was extremely Pynchon-esque. He was the Pynchon I wanted him to be&quot;.

In 1990, Pynchon married his literary agent, Melanie Jackson—a great-granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt and a granddaughter of Robert H. Jackson, U.S. Supreme Court Justice and Nuremberg trials prosecutor—and fathered a son, Jackson, in 1991. The disclosure of Pynchon&#x27;s 1990s location in New York City, after many years in which he was believed to be dividing his time between Mexico and northern California, led some journalists and photographers to try to track him down. Shortly before the publication of &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; in 1997, a CNN camera crew filmed him in Manhattan. Angered by this invasion of his privacy, he called CNN asking that he not be identified in the footage of the street scenes near his home. When asked by CNN, Pynchon rejected their characterization of him as a recluse, remarking &quot;My belief is that &#x27;recluse&#x27; is a code word generated by journalists ... meaning, &#x27;doesn&#x27;t like to talk to reporters&#x27;.&quot; CNN also quoted him as saying, &quot;Let me be unambiguous. I prefer not to be photographed.&quot; The next year, a reporter for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; managed to snap a photo of him as he was walking with his son.

After several references to Pynchon&#x27;s work and reputation were made on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;, Pynchon (through his agent) reportedly contacted the series&#x27; producers to offer suggestions and corrections. When a local Pynchon sighting became a major plot point in a 1994 episode of the series, Pynchon was sent the script for his approval; as well as providing the title of a fictitious work to be used in one episode (&quot;Pandemonium of the Sun&quot;), the novelist apparently vetoed a final scene that called for an extra playing him to be filmed from behind, walking away from the shot. Pynchon also insisted that it should be specifically mentioned in the episode that Pynchon was seen wearing a Roky Erickson T-shirt. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, this spurred an increase in sales of Erickson&#x27;s albums. Also during the 1990s, Pynchon befriended members of the band Lotion and contributed liner notes for the band&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Cool&quot;. Although the band initially claimed that he had seen them in concert and become a groupie, in 2009 they revealed to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that they met him through his accountant, who was drummer Rob Youngberg&#x27;s mother; she gave him an advance copy of the album and he agreed to write the liner notes, only later seeing them in concert. The novelist then conducted an interview with the band (&quot;Lunch with Lotion&quot;) for &quot;Esquire&quot; in June 1996 in the lead-up to the publication of &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;. More recently, Pynchon provided faxed answers to questions submitted by author David Hajdu and permitted excerpts from his personal correspondence to be quoted in Hajdu&#x27;s 2001 book, &quot;Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fariña and Richard Fariña&quot;.

Pynchon&#x27;s insistence on maintaining his personal privacy and on having his work speak for itself has resulted in a number of outlandish rumors and hoaxes over the years. Indeed, claims that Pynchon was the Unabomber or a sympathizer with the Waco Branch Davidians after the 1993 siege were upstaged in the mid-1990s by the invention of an elaborate rumor insinuating that Pynchon and one &quot;Wanda Tinasky&quot; were the same person. A collection of the Tinasky letters was eventually published as a paperback book in 1996; however, Pynchon himself denied having written the letters, and no direct attribution of the letters to Pynchon was ever made. &quot;Literary detective&quot; Donald Foster subsequently showed that the &quot;Letters&quot; were in fact written by an obscure Beat writer, Tom Hawkins, who had murdered his wife and then committed suicide in 1988. Foster&#x27;s evidence was conclusive, including finding the typewriter on which the &quot;Tinasky&quot; letters had been written.

In 1998, over 120 letters that Pynchon had written to his longtime agent, Candida Donadio, were donated by the family of a private collector, Carter Burden, to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City. The letters ranged from 1963 to 1982, thus covering some of the author&#x27;s most creative and prolific years. Although the Morgan Library originally intended to allow scholars to view the letters, at Pynchon&#x27;s request the Burden family and Morgan Library agreed to seal these letters until after Pynchon&#x27;s death.

===2000s===

Responding to the image which has been manufactured in the media over the years, Pynchon made two cameo animated appearances on the television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 2004, a show which he is a fan of. The first occurs in the episode &quot;Diatribe of a Mad Housewife&quot;, in which Marge Simpson becomes a novelist. He plays himself, with a paper bag over his head, and provides a blurb for the back cover of Marge&#x27;s book, speaking in a broad Long Island accent: &quot;Here&#x27;s your quote: Thomas Pynchon loved this book, almost as much as he loves cameras!&quot; He then starts yelling at passing cars: &quot;Hey, over here, have your picture taken with a reclusive author! Today only, we&#x27;ll throw in a free autograph! But, wait! There&#x27;s more!&quot; In his second appearance, in &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Oven War&quot;, Pynchon&#x27;s dialogue consists entirely of puns on his novel titles (&quot;These wings are &quot;V&quot;-licious! I&#x27;ll put this recipe in &quot;The Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow Cookbook&quot;, right next to &#x27;The Frying of Latke 49&#x27;.&quot;). The cartoon representation of Pynchon reappears in a third, non-speaking cameo, as a guest at the fictional WordLoaf convention depicted in the 18th season episode &quot;Moe&#x27;N&#x27;a Lisa&quot;. The episode first aired on November 19, 2006, the Sunday before Pynchon&#x27;s sixth novel, &quot;Against the Day&quot;, was released. According to Al Jean on the 15th season DVD episode commentary, Pynchon wanted to do the series because his son was a big fan.

During pre-production of &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Oven War&quot;, Pynchon faxed one page from the script to producer Matt Selman with several handwritten edits to his lines. Of particular emphasis was Pynchon&#x27;s outright refusal to utter the line &quot;No wonder Homer is such a fat-ass.&quot; Pynchon&#x27;s objection apparently had nothing to do with the salty language as he explained in a footnote to the edit, &quot;... Homer is my role model and I can&#x27;t speak ill of him.&quot;

In celebration of the centenary of George Orwell&#x27;s birth, Pynchon wrote a new foreword to Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The introduction presents a brief biography of Orwell as well as a reflection on some of the critical responses to &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Pynchon also offers his own reflection in the introduction that &quot;what is perhaps [most] important, indeed necessary, to a working prophet, is to be able to see deeper than most of us into the human soul.&quot;

In July 2006, Amazon.com created a page showing an upcoming 992-page, untitled, Thomas Pynchon novel. A description of the soon-to-be published novel appeared on Amazon purporting to be written by Pynchon himself. The description was taken down, prompting speculation over its authenticity, but the blurb was soon back up along with the title of Pynchon&#x27;s new novel &quot;Against the Day&quot;.

Shortly before &quot;Against the Day&quot; was published, Pynchon&#x27;s prose appeared in the program for &quot;&quot;The Daily Show&quot;: Ten Fu@#ing Years (The Concert)&quot;, a retrospective on Jon Stewart&#x27;s comedy-news broadcast &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

On December 6, 2006, Pynchon joined a campaign by many other major authors to clear Ian McEwan of plagiarism charges by sending a typewritten letter to his British publisher, which was published in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper.

Pynchon&#x27;s 2009 YouTube promotional teaser for the novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; is the second time a recording of his voice has been released to mainstream outlets (the first being his appearances on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;).

===2010s===
In 2012, Pynchon&#x27;s novels were released in e-book format, ending a long holdout by the author. Publisher Penguin Press reported that the novels&#x27; length and complex page layouts made it a challenge to convert them to a digital format. Though they had produced a promotional video for the June release, Penguin had no expectation Pynchon&#x27;s public profile would change in any fashion.

In 2013, his son, Jackson Pynchon, graduated from Columbia University, where he was affiliated with St. Anthony Hall.

In September 2014, Josh Brolin told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Pynchon had made a cameo in the &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; film adaptation. This led to a sizable online hunt for the author&#x27;s appearance, eventually targeting actor Charley Morgan, whose small role as a doctor led many to believe he was Pynchon. Morgan, son of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;″s Harry Morgan, claimed that Paul Thomas Anderson, whom he described as a friend, had told him that such a cameo did not exist. Despite this, nothing has been directly confirmed by Anderson or Warner Bros. Pictures.

On November 6, 2018, Pynchon was photographed near his apartment in New York&#x27;s Upper West Side district when he went to vote with his son. The photo was published by the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and was said to be the first photo of him &quot;in decades&quot;.

===2020s===
In December 2022, the Huntington Library announced that it had acquired the literary archive, including typescripts and drafts of each of Pynchon&#x27;s novels, handwritten notes, correspondence with publishers, and research.

<text>In electrical engineering, a transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another circuit, or multiple circuits. A varying current in any coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic flux in the transformer&#x27;s core, which induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) across any other coils wound around the same core. Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.

Transformers are used to change AC voltage levels, such transformers being termed step-up or step-down type to increase or decrease voltage level, respectively. Transformers can also be used to provide galvanic isolation between circuits as well as to couple stages of signal-processing circuits. Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electric power. A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications. Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect the power grid.
==Principles==

Ideal transformer equations

By Faraday&#x27;s law of induction:

where formula_1 is the instantaneous voltage, formula_2 is the number of turns in a winding, dΦ/dt is the derivative of the magnetic flux Φ through one turn of the winding over time (t), and subscripts P and S denotes primary and secondary.

Combining the ratio of eq. 1 &amp; eq. 2:

{V_\text{S}} = \frac{N_\text{P}}{N_\text{S}}=a&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where for a step-up transformer &quot;a&quot; &lt; 1 and for a step-down transformer &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1.

By the law of conservation of energy, apparent, real and reactive power are each conserved in the input and output:

where formula_3 is apparent power and formula_4 is current.

Combining Eq. 3 &amp; Eq. 4 with this endnote gives the ideal transformer identity:

{V_\text{S}} = \frac{I_\text{S}}{I_\text{P}}=\frac{N_\text{P}}{N_\text{S}}=\sqrt{\frac{L_\text{P}}{L_\text{S}}}=a&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_5 is winding self-inductance.

By Ohm&#x27;s law and ideal transformer identity:

{I_\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

{I_\text{P}}=\frac{aV_\text{S}}{I_\text{S}/a}=a^2\frac{V_\text{S}}{I_\text{S}}=a^2{Z_\text{L}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_6 is the load impedance of the secondary circuit &amp; formula_7 is the apparent load or driving point impedance of the primary circuit, the superscript formula_8 denoting referred to the primary.

===Ideal transformer===
An ideal transformer is linear, lossless and perfectly coupled. Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core magnetic permeability and winding inductance and zero net magnetomotive force (i.e. &quot;i&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;i&quot;&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;s&quot; = 0).


A varying current in the transformer&#x27;s primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer core, which is also encircled by the secondary winding. This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying electromotive force or voltage in the secondary winding. This electromagnetic induction phenomenon is the basis of transformer action and, in accordance with Lenz&#x27;s law, the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding.

The windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a voltage source connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.

According to Faraday&#x27;s law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of turns. The transformer winding voltage ratio is equal to the winding turns ratio.

An ideal transformer is a reasonable approximation for a typical commercial transformer, with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio.

The load impedance &quot;referred&quot; to the primary circuit is equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance.
===Real transformer===
====Deviations from ideal transformer====
The ideal transformer model neglects many basic linear aspects of real transformers, including unavoidable losses and inefficiencies.

(a) Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consisting of
* Hysteresis losses due to nonlinear magnetic effects in the transformer core, and
* Eddy current losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer&#x27;s applied voltage.

(b) Unlike the ideal model, the windings in a real transformer have non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:
* Joule losses due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings
* Leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.

(c) similar to an inductor, parasitic capacitance and self-resonance phenomenon due to the electric field distribution. Three kinds of parasitic capacitance are usually considered and the closed-loop equations are provided
* Capacitance between adjacent turns in any one layer;
* Capacitance between adjacent layers;
* Capacitance between the core and the layer(s) adjacent to the core;

Inclusion of capacitance into the transformer model is complicated, and is rarely attempted; the &#x27;real&#x27; transformer model&#x27;s equivalent circuit shown below does not include parasitic capacitance. However, the capacitance effect can be measured by comparing open-circuit inductance, i.e. the inductance of a primary winding when the secondary circuit is open, to a short-circuit inductance when the secondary winding is shorted.

====Leakage flux====
The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings. Such flux is termed &quot;leakage flux&quot;, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings. Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load. Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.

In some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply. Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury- and sodium- vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.

Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings. A saturable reactor exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.

Knowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (&quot;X&quot;/&quot;R&quot;) ratio of two transformers were
the same, the transformers would share the load power in proportion to their respective ratings. However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary.
====Equivalent circuit====
Referring to the diagram, a practical transformer&#x27;s physical behavior may be represented by an equivalent circuit model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.

Winding joule losses and leakage reactance are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:
* Primary winding: &quot;R&quot;P, &quot;X&quot;P
* Secondary winding: &quot;R&quot;S, &quot;X&quot;S.
In normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, &quot;R&quot;S and &quot;X&quot;S are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (&quot;N&quot;P/&quot;N&quot;S) 2 = a2.

Core loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:
* Core or iron losses: &quot;R&quot;C
* Magnetizing reactance: &quot;X&quot;M.
&quot;R&quot;C and &quot;X&quot;M are collectively termed the &quot;magnetizing branch&quot; of the model.

Core losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency. The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current &quot;I&quot;M to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits. With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current &quot;I&quot;0 equals transformer no-load current.

The resulting model, though sometimes termed &#x27;exact&#x27; equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations. Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactance by simple summation as two series impedances.

Transformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: open-circuit test, short-circuit test, winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.

===Transformer EMF equation===

If the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal, the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage &quot;E&quot;rms of the winding, and the supply frequency &quot;f&quot;, number of turns &quot;N&quot;, core cross-sectional area &quot;A&quot; in m2 and peak magnetic flux density &quot;B&quot;peak in Wb/m2 or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:

: formula_9

===Polarity===
A dot convention is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding&#x27;s &#x27;dot&#x27; end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding&#x27;s &#x27;dot&#x27; end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a phasor diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.

===Effect of frequency===
The EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency. By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight. Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.
Operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require protective relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.

One example is in traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high-speed train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50 Hz down to 16.7 Hz and rated up to 25 kV).

At much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.

Transformers for higher frequency applications such as SMPS typically use core materials with much lower hysteresis and eddy-current losses than those for 50/60 Hz. Primary examples are iron-powder and ferrite cores. The lower frequency-dependant losses of these cores often is at the expense of flux density at saturation. For instance, ferrite saturation occurs at a substantially lower flux density than laminated iron.

Large power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.

===Energy losses===
Transformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers&#x27; efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity. The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.

As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and eddy current losses are constant at all load levels and dominate at no load, while winding loss increases as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing energy efficient transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a trade-off between initial cost and operating cost.

Transformer losses arise from:
; Winding joule losses
:Current flowing through a winding&#x27;s conductor causes joule heating due to the resistance of the wire. As frequency increases, skin effect and proximity effect causes the winding&#x27;s resistance and, hence, losses to increase.
;Core losses
:; Hysteresis losses
::Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core, caused by motion of the magnetic domains within the steel. According to Steinmetz&#x27;s formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by
:::formula_10 and,
::hysteresis loss is thus given by
:::formula_11
::where, &quot;f&quot; is the frequency, &quot;η&quot; is the hysteresis coefficient and &quot;β&quot;max is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron. For more detailed analysis, see Magnetic core and Steinmetz&#x27;s equation.
:; Eddy current losses
:: Eddy currents are induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness. Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.
; Magnetostriction related transformer hum
:Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or &quot;transformer hum&quot;. This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency flyback transformers associated with television CRTs.
; Stray losses
:Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer&#x27;s support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.
; Radiative
:There are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small.
;Mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission
:In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. This energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork, thus amplifying audible transformer hum.

==Construction==

===Cores===
Closed-core transformers are constructed in &#x27;core form&#x27; or &#x27;shell form&#x27;. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form. Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils. Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230 kV or 75 MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent. Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.

====Laminated steel cores====
Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel. The steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings. Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires. Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation. The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.

The effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses, but are more laborious and expensive to construct. Thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers, with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10 kHz.

One common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of E-I transformer. Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap. They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.

A steel core&#x27;s remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform. Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass.

On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.

Distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.

====Solid cores====
Powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common. Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called &#x27;slugs&#x27;) which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.

====Toroidal cores====

Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil, powdered iron, or ferrite. A strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned, improving the transformer&#x27;s efficiency by reducing the core&#x27;s reluctance. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core. The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core&#x27;s magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.

Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.

Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10 kVA, and practically none above 25 kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.

====Air cores====
A transformer can be produced by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an &quot;air-core&quot; transformer. An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material. The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution, but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications. Air cores are also used for resonant transformers such as tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.

===Windings===
The electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from enamelled magnet wire. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard.

High-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses. Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings. Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.

The windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.

Power-frequency transformers may have &quot;taps&quot; at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as arc furnace transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.

===Cooling===
It is a rule of thumb that the life expectancy of electrical insulation is halved for about every 7 °C to 10 °C increase in operating temperature (an instance of the application of the Arrhenius equation).

Small dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers are filled with transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is often a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information.

Building regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid-filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil, or be installed in fire-resistant rooms. Air-cooled dry transformers can be more economical where they eliminate the cost of a fire-resistant transformer room.

The tank of liquid-filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins. Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling. An oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a Buchholz relay, which, depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing, is used to either trigger an alarm or de-energize the transformer. Oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have properties that once favored their use as a dielectric coolant, though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use.
Today, non-toxic, stable silicone-based oils, or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault. However, the long life span of transformers can mean that the potential for exposure can be high long after banning.

Some transformers are gas-insulated. Their windings are enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and often cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas.

Experimental power transformers in the 500–1,000 kVA range have been built with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled superconducting windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.

===Insulation===

Insulation must be provided between the individual turns of the windings, between the windings, between windings and core, and at the terminals of the winding.

Inter-turn insulation of small transformers may be a layer of insulating varnish on the wire. Layer of paper or polymer films may be inserted between layers of windings, and between primary and secondary windings. A transformer may be coated or dipped in a polymer resin to improve the strength of windings and protect them from moisture or corrosion. The resin may be impregnated into the winding insulation using combinations of vacuum and pressure during the coating process, eliminating all air voids in the winding. In the limit, the entire coil may be placed in a mold, and resin cast around it as a solid block, encapsulating the windings.

Large oil-filled power transformers use windings wrapped with insulating paper, which is impregnated with oil during assembly of the transformer. Oil-filled transformers use highly refined mineral oil to insulate and cool the windings and core. 
Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used.

===Bushings===
Larger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil.

==Classification parameters==

==Applications==

Various specific electrical application designs require a variety of transformer types. Although they all share the basic characteristic transformer principles, they are customized in construction or electrical properties for certain installation requirements or circuit conditions.

In electric power transmission, transformers allow transmission of electric power at high voltages, which reduces the loss due to heating of the wires. This allows generating plants to be located economically at a distance from electrical consumers. All but a tiny fraction of the world&#x27;s electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.

In many electronic devices, a transformer is used to convert voltage from the distribution wiring to convenient values for the circuit requirements, either directly at the power line frequency or through a switch mode power supply.

Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits. Isolation transformers prevent leakage of current into the secondary circuit and are used in medical equipment and at construction sites. Resonant transformers are used for coupling between stages of radio receivers, or in high-voltage Tesla coils.


==History==

===Discovery of induction===
Electromagnetic induction, the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832. Only Faraday furthered his experiments to the point of working out the equation describing the relationship between EMF and magnetic flux now known as Faraday&#x27;s law of induction:

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the magnitude of the EMF in volts and ΦB is the magnetic flux through the circuit in webers.

Faraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first toroidal closed-core transformer. However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and EMF in the windings.
===Induction coils===
The first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil, invented by Irish-Catholic Rev. Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836. He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists&#x27; and inventors&#x27; efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.

===First alternating current transformers===
By the 1870s, efficient generators producing alternating current (AC) were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an interrupter.

In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several &#x27;electric candles&#x27; (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.

In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.

In 1882, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an initially widely criticized laminated plate open iron core called a &#x27;secondary generator&#x27; in London, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States in 1886. They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was highly successful and adopted for an electric lighting system. Their open-core device used a fixed 1:1 ratio to supply a series circuit for the utilization load (lamps). However, the voltage of their system was controlled by moving the iron core in or out.

====Early series circuit transformer distribution====
Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.
Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.



===Closed-core transformers and parallel power distribution===
In the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world&#x27;s first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core. The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed &quot;core form&quot; or &quot;shell form&quot; .

In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments; In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.

Transformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word &#x27;transformer&#x27; to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current although the term had already been in use by 1882. In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world&#x27;s first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.

===Westinghouse improvements===
Building on the advancement of AC technology in Europe, George Westinghouse founded the Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886. The new firm became active in developing alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States. 
The Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs&#x27; patents for $50,000 in February 1886. He assigned to William Stanley the task of redesign the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for commercial use in United States. Stanley&#x27;s first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image). This design was first used commercially in the US in 1886 but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.

Westinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed a core that was easier to manufacture, consisting of a stack of thin &#x27;E‑shaped&#x27; iron plates insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Pre-wound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse obtained a patent for the new low-cost design in 1887.

===Other early transformer designs===
In 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (&#x27;General Electricity Company&#x27;) in Germany.

In 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very high voltages at high frequency.

Audio frequency transformers (&quot;repeating coils&quot;) were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.

<text>Transubstantiation (Latin: &quot;transubstantiatio&quot;; Greek: μετουσίωσις &quot;metousiosis&quot;) is, according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, &quot;the change of the whole substance of bread into the substance of the Body of Christ and of the whole substance of wine into the substance of the Blood of Christ&quot;. This change is brought about in the eucharistic prayer through the efficacy of the word of Christ and by the action of the Holy Spirit. However, &quot;the outward characteristics of bread and wine, that is the &#x27;eucharistic species&#x27;, remain unaltered&quot;. In this teaching, the notions of &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;transubstantiation&quot; are not linked with any particular theory of metaphysics.

The Roman Catholic Church teaches that, in the Eucharistic offering, bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. The affirmation of this doctrine on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist was expressed, using the word &quot;transubstantiate&quot;, by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215. It was later challenged by various 14th-century reformers, John Wycliffe in particular. 

The manner in which the change occurs, the Roman Catholic Church teaches, is a mystery: &quot;The signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ.&quot; In Lutheranism, the terminology used regarding the real presence is the doctrine of the sacramental union, while in Anglicanism, the precise terminology to be used to refer to the nature of the Eucharist has a contentious interpretation: &quot;bread and cup&quot; or &quot;Body and Blood&quot;; &quot;set before&quot; or &quot;offer&quot;; &quot;objective change&quot; or &quot;new significance&quot;.

In the Greek Orthodox Church, the doctrine has been discussed under the term of &quot;metousiosis&quot;, coined as a direct loan-translation of &quot;transubstantiatio&quot; in the 17th century. In Eastern Orthodoxy in general, the Sacred Mystery (Sacrament) of the Eucharist is more commonly discussed using alternative terms such as &quot;trans-elementation&quot; (, &quot;metastoicheiosis&quot;), &quot;re-ordination&quot; (, &quot;metarrhythmisis&quot;), or simply &quot;change&quot; (, &quot;metabole&quot;).

==History==
=== Summary ===
From the earliest centuries, the Church spoke of the elements used in celebrating the Eucharist as being changed into the body and blood of Christ. Terms used to speak of the alteration included &quot;trans-elementation&quot;. The bread and wine were said to be &quot;made&quot;, &quot;changed into&quot;, the body and blood of Christ. Similarly, Augustine said: &quot;Not all bread, but only that which receives the blessing of Christ the body of Christ.&quot;

The term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; was used at least by the 11th century to speak of the change and was in widespread use by the 12th century. The Fourth Council of the Lateran used it in 1215. When later theologians adopted Aristotelian metaphysics in Western Europe, they explained the change that was already part of Catholic teaching in terms of Aristotelian substance and accidents. The sixteenth-century Reformation gave this as a reason for rejecting the Catholic teaching. The Council of Trent did not impose the Aristotelian theory of substance and accidents or the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; in its Aristotelian meaning, but stated that the term is a fitting and proper term for the change that takes place by consecration of the bread and wine. The term, which for that Council had no essential dependence on scholastic ideas, is used in the Catholic Church to affirm the fact of Christ&#x27;s presence and the mysterious and radical change which takes place, but not to explain the change takes place, since this occurs &quot;in a way surpassing understanding&quot;. The term is mentioned in both the 1992 and 1997 editions of the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; and is given prominence in the later (2005) &quot;Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;.

===Patristic period===
Early Christian writers referred to the Eucharistic elements as Jesus&#x27;s body and the blood. The short document known as the &quot;Teachings of the Apostles&quot; or &quot;Didache&quot;, which may be the earliest Christian document outside of the New Testament to speak of the Eucharist, says, &quot;Let no one eat or drink of your Eucharist, unless they have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, &#x27;Give not that which is holy to the dogs&#x27;.&quot;

Ignatius of Antioch, writing in about AD 106 to the Roman Christians, says: &quot;I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.&quot;

Writing to the Christians of Smyrna in the same year, he warned them to &quot;stand aloof from such heretics&quot;, because, among other reasons, &quot;they abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again.&quot;

In about 150, Justin Martyr, referring to the Eucharist, wrote: &quot;Not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.&quot;

In about AD 200, Tertullian wrote: &quot;Having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, This is my body, that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body. An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us.&quot;

The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; (compiled ) says: &quot;Let the bishop give the oblation, saying, The body of Christ; and let him that receiveth say, Amen. And let the deacon take the cup; and when he gives it, say, The blood of Christ, the cup of life; and let him that drinketh say, Amen.&quot;

Ambrose of Milan (died 397) wrote:
Other fourth-century Christian writers say that in the Eucharist there occurs a &quot;change&quot;, &quot;transelementation&quot;, &quot;transformation&quot;, &quot;transposing&quot;, &quot;alteration&quot; of the bread into the body of Christ.

Augustine declares that the bread consecrated in the Eucharist actually &quot;becomes&quot; (in Latin, ) the Body of Christ: &quot;The faithful know what I&#x27;m talking about; they know Christ in the breaking of bread. It isn&#x27;t every loaf of bread, you see, but the one receiving Christ&#x27;s blessing, that becomes the body of Christ.&quot;

Clement of Alexandria, who uses the word &quot;symbol&quot; concerning the Eucharist, is quoted as an exception, although this interpretation is disputed on the basis of Alexandrian overlaps of symbology and literalism.

===Middle Ages===
Paschasius Radbertus (785–865) was a Carolingian theologian, and the abbot of Corbie, whose most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled &quot;De Corpore et Sanguine Domini&quot;. In it, Paschasius agrees with Ambrose in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true. Christ&#x27;s proclamation at the Last Supper that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth. He thus believes that the change of the substances of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ offered in the Eucharist really occurs. Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.

In the 11th century, Berengar of Tours stirred up opposition when he denied that any material change in the elements was needed to explain the fact of the Real Presence. His position was never diametrically opposed to that of his critics, and he was probably never excommunicated, but the controversies that he aroused (see Stercoranism) forced people to clarify the doctrine of the Eucharist.

The earliest known use of the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; to describe the change from bread and wine to body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist was by Hildebert de Lavardin, Archbishop of Tours, in the 11th century. By the end of the 12th century the term was in widespread use.

The Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 spoke of the bread and wine as &quot;transubstantiated&quot; into the body and blood of Christ: &quot;His body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread and wine having been transubstantiated, by God&#x27;s power, into his body and blood&quot;. Catholic scholars and clergy have noted numerous reports of Eucharistic miracles contemporary with the council, and at least one such report was discussed at the council. It was not until later in the 13th century that Aristotelian metaphysics was accepted and a philosophical elaboration in line with that metaphysics was developed, which found classic formulation in the teaching of Thomas Aquinas and in the theories of later Catholic theologians in the medieval period (Robert Grosseteste, Giles of Rome, Duns Scotus and William of Ockham).

===Reformation===
During the Protestant Reformation, the doctrine of transubstantiation was heavily criticised as an Aristotelian &quot;pseudophilosophy&quot; imported into Christian teaching and jettisoned in favor of Martin Luther&#x27;s doctrine of sacramental union, or in favor, per Huldrych Zwingli, of the Eucharist as memorial.
In the Reformation, the doctrine of transubstantiation became a matter of much controversy. Martin Luther held that &quot;It is not the doctrine of transubstantiation which is to be believed, but simply that Christ really is present at the Eucharist&quot;. In his &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot; (published on 6 October 1520) Luther wrote:

In his 1528 &quot;Confession Concerning Christ&#x27;s Supper&quot;, he wrote:
What Luther thus called a &quot;sacramental union&quot; is often erroneously called &quot;consubstantiation&quot; by non-Lutherans. In &quot;On the Babylonian Captivity&quot;, Luther upheld belief in the Real Presence of Jesus and, in his 1523 treatise &quot;The Adoration of the Sacrament&quot;, defended adoration of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist.

In England, the Six Articles of 1539 prescribed the death penalty for any who denied transubstantiation. This was changed under Elizabeth I. In the Thirty-nine Articles of 1563, the Church of England declared: &quot;Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions&quot;. Laws were enacted against participation in Catholic worship, which remained illegal until 1791.

For a century and half – 1672 to 1828 – transubstantiation had an important role, in a negative way, in British political and social life. Under the Test Act, the holding of any public office was made conditional upon explicitly denying Transubstantiation. Any aspirant to public office had to repeat the formula set out by the law: &quot;I, &quot;N&quot;, do declare that I do believe that there is not any transubstantiation in the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, or in the elements of the bread and wine, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever.&quot;

====Council of Trent====
In 1551, the Council of Trent declared that the doctrine of transubstantiation is a dogma of faith and stated that &quot;by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation.&quot;
In its 13th session ending 11 October 1551, the Council defined transubstantiation as &quot;that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood – the species only of the bread and wine remaining – which conversion indeed the Catholic Church most aptly calls Transubstantiation&quot;. This council officially approved use of the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; to express the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on the subject of the conversion of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, with the aim of safeguarding Christ&#x27;s presence as a literal truth, while emphasizing the fact that there is no change in the empirical appearances of the bread and wine. It did not however impose the Aristotelian theory of substance and accidents: it spoke only of the species (the appearances), not the philosophical term &quot;accidents&quot;, and the word &quot;substance&quot; was in ecclesiastical use for many centuries before Aristotelian philosophy was adopted in the West, as shown for instance by its use in the Nicene Creed which speaks of Christ having the same &quot; (Greek) or &quot; (Latin) as the Father.

=== Since the Second Vatican Council ===

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states the Church&#x27;s teaching on transubstantiation twice.

It repeats what it calls the Council of Trent&#x27;s summary of the Catholic faith on &quot;the conversion of the bread and wine into Christ&#x27;s body and blood [by which] Christ becomes present in this sacrament&quot;, faith &quot;in the efficacy of the Word of Christ and of the action of the Holy Spirit to bring about this conversion&quot;: &quot;[B]y the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation&quot;.

As part of its own summary (&quot;In brief&quot;) of the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; on the sacrament of the Eucharist, it states: &quot;By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ is brought about. Under the consecrated species of bread and wine Christ himself, living and glorious, is present in a true, real, and substantial manner: his Body and his Blood, with his soul and his divinity (cf. Council of Trent: DS 1640; 1651).&quot;

The Church&#x27;s teaching is given in the &quot;Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; in question and answer form:
The Anglican–Roman Catholic Joint Preparatory Commission stated in 1971 in their common declaration on Eucharistic doctrine: &quot;The word transubstantiation is commonly used in the Roman Catholic Church to indicate that God acting in the eucharist effects a change in the inner reality of the elements.&quot;

==== Opinions of some individuals (not necessarily typical) ====
In 2017 Irish Augustinian Gabriel Daly said that the Council of Trent approved use of the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; as suitable and proper, but did not make it obligatory, and he suggested that its continued use is partly to blame for lack of progress towards sharing of the Eucharist between Protestants and Catholics.

Traditionalist Catholic Paolo Pasqualucci said that the absence of the term in the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s constitution on the liturgy &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot; means that it presents the Catholic Mass &quot;in the manner of the Protestants&quot;. To this Dave Armstrong replied that &quot;the may not be present; but the is&quot;. For instance, the document &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; refers to the &quot;sacrament of faith where natural elements refined by man are gloriously changed into His Body and Blood, providing a meal of brotherly solidarity and a foretaste of the heavenly banquet&quot; (Chapter 3).

Thomas J. Reese commented that &quot;using Aristotelian concepts to explain Catholic mysteries in the 21st century is a fool&#x27;s errand&quot;, while Timothy O&#x27;Malley remarked that &quot;it is possible to teach the doctrine of transubstantiation without using the words &#x27;substance&#x27; and &#x27;accidents&#x27;. If the word &#x27;substance&#x27; scares people off, you can say, &#x27;what it really is&#x27;, and that is what substance is. What it really is, what it absolutely is at its heart is Christ&#x27;s body and blood&quot;.

==== General belief and doctrine knowledge among Catholics ====
A Georgetown University CARA poll of United States Catholics in 2008 showed that 57% said they believed that Jesus Christ is really present in the Eucharist in 2008 and nearly 43% said that they believed the wine and bread are symbols of Jesus. Of those attending Mass weekly or more often, 91% believed in the Real Presence, as did 65% of those who merely attended at least once a month, and 40% of those who attended at most a few times a year.

Among Catholics attending Mass at least once a month, the percentage of belief in the Real Presence was 86% for pre-Vatican II Catholics, 74% for Vatican II Catholics, 75% for post-Vatican II Catholics, and 85% for Millennials.

A 2019 Pew Research Report found that 69% of United States Catholics believed that in the Eucharist the bread and wine &quot;are of the body and blood of Jesus Christ&quot;, and only 31% believed that, &quot;during Catholic Mass, the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Jesus&quot;. Of the latter group, most (28% of all US Catholics) said they knew that this is what the Church teaches, while the remaining 3% said they did not know it. Of the 69% who said the bread and wine are , almost two-thirds (43% of all Catholics) said that what they believed is the Church&#x27;s teaching, 22% said that they believed it in spite of knowing that the Church teaches that the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Christ. Among United States Catholics who attend Mass at least once a week, the most observant group, 63% accepted that the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Christ; the other 37% saw the bread and wine as , most of them (23%) not knowing that the Church, so the survey stated, teaches that the elements actually become the body and blood of Christ, while the remaining 14% rejected what was given as the Church&#x27;s teaching. The Pew Report presented &quot;the understanding that the bread and wine used in Communion are of the body and blood of Jesus Christ&quot; as contradicting belief that, &quot;during Catholic Mass, the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Jesus&quot;. The Catholic Church itself speaks of the bread and wine used in Communion as &quot;signs&quot; as &quot;becoming&quot; Christ&#x27;s body and blood: &quot;[...] the signs of bread and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ&quot;.

In a comment on the Pew Research Report, Greg Erlandson drew attention to the difference between the formulation in the CARA survey, in which the choice was between &quot;Jesus Christ is really present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist&quot; and &quot;the bread and wine are symbols of Jesus, but Jesus is not really present&quot;, and the Pew Research choice between &quot;during Catholic Mass, the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Jesus&quot; and &quot;the bread wine are of the body and blood of Jesus Christ&quot;. He quotes an observation by Mark Gray that the word &quot;actually&quot; makes it sound like &quot;something that could be analyzed under a microscope or empirically observed&quot;, while what the Church teaches is that the &quot;substance&quot; of the bread and wine are changed at consecration, but the &quot;accidents&quot; or appearances of bread and wine remain. Erlandson commented further: &quot;Catholics may not be able to articulately define the &#x27;Real Presence&#x27;, and the &#x27;transubstantiation&#x27; may be obscure to them, but in their reverence and demeanor, they demonstrate their belief that this is not just a symbol&quot;.

==Theology==

===Catholic Church===

While the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation in relation to the Eucharist can be viewed in terms of the Aristotelian distinction between substance and accident, Catholic theologians generally hold that, &quot;in referring to the Eucharist, the Church does not use the terms substance and accident in their philosophical contexts but in the common and ordinary sense in which they were first used many centuries ago. The dogma of transubstantiation does not embrace any philosophical theory in particular.&quot; This ambiguity was recognized also by then-Lutheran theologian Jaroslav Pelikan, who, while himself interpreting the terms as Aristotelian, states that &quot;the application of the term &#x27;substance&#x27; to the discussion of the Eucharistic presence antedates the rediscovery of Aristotle. [...] Even &#x27;transubstantiation&#x27; was used during the twelfth century in a nontechnical sense. Such evidence lends credence to the argument that the doctrine of transubstantiation, as codified by the decrees of the Fourth Lateran and Tridentine councils, did not canonize Aristotelian philosophy as indispensable to Christian doctrine. But whether it did so or not in principle, it has certainly done so in effect&quot;.

The view that the distinction is independent of any philosophical theory has been expressed as follows: &quot;The distinction between substance and accidents is real, not just imaginary. In the case of the person, the distinction between the person and his or her accidental features is after all real. Therefore, even though the notion of substance and accidents originated from Aristotelian philosophy, the distinction between substance and accidents is also independent of philosophical and scientific development.&quot; &quot;Substance&quot; here means what something is in itself: take some concrete object – e.g. your own hat. The shape is not the object itself, nor is its color, size, softness to the touch, nor anything else about it perceptible to the senses. The object itself (the &quot;substance&quot;) &quot;has&quot; the shape, the color, the size, the softness and the other appearances, but is distinct from them. While the appearances are perceptible to the senses, the substance is not.

The philosophical term &quot;accidents&quot; does not appear in the teaching of the Council of Trent on transubstantiation, which is repeated in the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;. For what the Council distinguishes from the &quot;substance&quot; of the bread and wine it uses the term &quot;species&quot;:

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; cites the Council of Trent also in regard to the mode of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist:

The Catholic Church holds that the same change of the substance of the bread and of the wine at the Last Supper continues to occur at the consecration of the Eucharist when the words are spoken &quot;in persona Christi&quot; &quot;This is my body ... this is my blood.&quot; In Orthodox confessions, the change is said to start during the Dominical or Lord&#x27;s Words or Institution Narrative and be completed during the Epiklesis.

Teaching that Christ is risen from the dead and is alive, the Catholic Church holds, in addition to the doctrine of transubstantiation, that when the bread is changed into his body, not only his body is present, but Christ as a whole is present (&quot;the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity&quot;). The same holds when the wine is transubstantiated into the blood of Christ. This is known as the doctrine of concomitance.

In accordance with the dogmatic teaching that Christ is really, truly and substantially present under the appearances of bread and wine, and continues to be present as long as those appearances remain, the Catholic Church preserves the consecrated elements, generally in a church tabernacle, for administering Holy Communion to the sick and dying.

In the arguments which characterised the relationship between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism in the 16th century, the Council of Trent declared subject to the ecclesiastical penalty of anathema anyone who

The Catholic Church asserts that the consecrated bread and wine are not merely &quot;symbols&quot; of the body and blood of Christ: they &quot;are&quot; the body and blood of Christ. It also declares that, although the bread and wine completely cease to be bread and wine (having become the body and blood of Christ), the appearances (the &quot;species&quot; or look) remain unchanged, and the properties of the appearances also remain (one can be drunk with the appearance of wine despite it only being an appearance). They are still the appearances of bread and wine, not of Christ, and do not inhere in the substance of Christ. They can be felt and tasted as before, and are subject to change and can be destroyed. If the appearance of bread is lost by turning to dust or the appearance of wine is lost by turning to vinegar, Christ is no longer present.

The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread and grape wine, on which the blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked and the priest pronounces the words of consecration spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper: &quot;This is my body which will be given up for you. ... This is the cup of my blood ...&quot; When the signs cease to exist, so does the sacrament.

According to Catholic teaching, the whole of Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity, is really, truly and substantially in the sacrament, under each of the appearances of bread and wine, but he is not in the sacrament as in a place and is not moved when the sacrament is moved. He is perceptible neither by the sense nor by the imagination, but only by the intellectual eye.

St. Thomas Aquinas gave poetic expression to this perception in the devotional hymn &quot;Adoro te devote&quot;:

An official statement from the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission titled &quot;Eucharistic Doctrine&quot;, published in 1971, states that &quot;the word &quot;transubstantiation&quot; is commonly used in the Roman Catholic Church to indicate that God acting in the Eucharist effects a change in the inner reality of the elements. The term should be seen as affirming the &quot;fact&quot; of Christ&#x27;s presence and of the mysterious and radical change which takes place. In Roman Catholic theology it is not understood as explaining &quot;how&quot; the change takes place.&quot; In the smallest particle of the host or the smallest droplet from the chalice Jesus Christ himself is present: &quot;Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide Christ.&quot;

===Eastern Christianity===
As the &quot;Disputation of the Holy Sacrament&quot; took place in the Western Church after the Great Schism, the Eastern Churches remained largely unaffected by it. The debate on the nature of &quot;transubstantiation&quot; in Greek Orthodoxy begins in the 17th century, with Cyril Lucaris, whose &quot;The Eastern Confession of the Orthodox Faith&quot; was published in Latin in 1629.
The Greek term &quot;metousiosis&quot; () is first used as the translation of Latin in the Greek edition of the work, published in 1633.

The Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches, along with the Assyrian Church of the East, agree that in a valid Divine Liturgy bread and wine truly and actually become the body and blood of Christ.
In Orthodox confessions, the change is said to start during the Liturgy of Preparation and be completed during the Epiklesis. However, there are official church documents that speak of a &quot;change&quot; (in Greek ) or &quot;metousiosis&quot; () of the bread and wine. &quot;Μετ-ουσί-ωσις&quot; (&quot;met-ousi-osis&quot;) is the Greek word used to represent the Latin word &quot;trans-substanti-atio&quot;, as Greek &quot;μετα-μόρφ-ωσις&quot; (&quot;meta-morph-osis&quot;) corresponds to Latin &quot;trans-figur-atio&quot;. Examples of official documents of the Eastern Orthodox Church that use the term &quot;μετουσίωσις&quot; or &quot;transubstantiation&quot; are the &quot;Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church&quot; (question 340) and the declaration by the Eastern Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem of 1672:

The way in which the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ has never been dogmatically defined by the Eastern Orthodox Churches. However, St Theodore the Studite writes in his treatise &quot;On the Holy Icons&quot;: &quot;for we confess that the faithful receive the very body and blood of Christ, according to the voice of God himself.&quot; This was a refutation of the iconoclasts, who insisted that the eucharist was the only true icon of Christ. Thus, it can be argued that by being part of the dogmatic &quot;horos&quot; against the iconoclast heresy, the teaching on the &quot;real presence&quot; of Christ in the eucharist is indeed a dogma of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

===Protestantism===
====Anglicanism====
Transubstantiation is generally rejected in Anglicanism. 
The Eucharistic teaching labeled &quot;receptionism&quot;, defined by Claude Beaufort Moss as &quot;the theory that we receive the Body and Blood of Christ when we receive the bread and wine, but they are not identified with the bread and wine which are not changed&quot;, was commonly held by 16th and 17th-century Anglican theologians. It was characteristic of 17th century thought to &quot;insist on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but to profess agnosticism concerning the manner of the presence&quot;. It remained &quot;the dominant theological position in the Church of England until the Oxford Movement in the early nineteenth century, with varying degrees of emphasis&quot;. Importantly, it is &quot;a doctrine of the real presence&quot; but one which &quot;relates the presence primarily to the worthy receiver rather than to the elements of bread and wine&quot;.

Anglicans generally consider no teaching binding that, according to the Articles, &quot;cannot be found in Holy Scripture or proved thereby&quot;, and are not unanimous in the interpretation of such passages as John 6 and 1 Corinthians 11, although all Anglicans affirm a view of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist: some Anglicans (especially Anglo-Catholics and some other High Church Anglicans) hold to a belief in the corporeal presence while Evangelical Anglicans hold to a belief in the pneumatic presence. As with all Anglicans, Anglo-Catholics and other High Church Anglicans historically held belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist but were &quot;hostile to the doctrine of transubstantiation&quot;.

However, in the first half of the twentieth century, the Catholic Propaganda Society upheld both Article XXVIII and the doctrine of transubstantiation, stating that the 39 Articles specifically condemn a pre-Council of Trent &quot;interpretation which was included by some under the term Transubstantiation&quot; in which &quot;the bread and wine were only left as a delusion of the senses after consecration&quot;; it stated that &quot;this Council propounded its definition after the Articles were written, and so cannot be referred to by them&quot;.

Theological dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church has produced common documents that speak of &quot;substantial agreement&quot; about the doctrine of the Eucharist: the ARCIC Windsor Statement of 1971, and its 1979 Elucidation. Remaining arguments can be found in the Church of England&#x27;s pastoral letter: &quot;The Eucharist: Sacrament of Unity&quot;.

====Lutheranism====
Lutherans explicitly reject transubstantiation believing that the bread and wine remain fully bread and fully wine while also being truly the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Lutheran churches instead emphasize the sacramental union (not exactly the consubstantiation, as is often claimed) and believe that within the Eucharistic celebration the body and blood of Jesus Christ are objectively present &quot;in, with, and under the forms&quot; of bread and wine (cf. Book of Concord). They place great stress on Jesus&#x27;s instructions to &quot;take and eat&quot;, and &quot;take and drink&quot;, holding that this is the proper, divinely ordained use of the sacrament, and, while giving it due reverence, scrupulously avoid any actions that might indicate or lead to superstition or unworthy fear of the sacrament.

In dialogue with Catholic theologians, a large measure of agreement has been reached by a group of Lutheran theologians. They recognize that &quot;in contemporary Catholic expositions, ... transubstantiation intends to affirm the fact of Christ&#x27;s presence and of the change which takes place, and is not an attempt to explain how Christ becomes present. ... [And] that it is a legitimate way of attempting to express the mystery, even though they continue to believe that the conceptuality associated with &quot;transubstantiation&quot; is misleading and therefore prefer to avoid the term.&quot;

====Reformed churches====
Classical Presbyterianism held Calvin&#x27;s view of &quot;pneumatic presence&quot; or &quot;spiritual feeding&quot;, a Real Presence by the Spirit for those who have faith. John Calvin &quot;can be regarded as occupying a position roughly midway between&quot; the doctrines of Martin Luther on one hand and Huldrych Zwingli on the other. He taught that &quot;the thing that is signified is effected by its sign&quot;, declaring: &quot;Believers ought always to live by this rule: whenever they see symbols appointed by the Lord, to think and be convinced that the truth of the thing signified is surely present there. For why should the Lord put in your hand the symbol of his body, unless it was to assure you that you really participate in it? And if it is true that a visible sign is given to us to seal the gift of an invisible thing, when we have received the symbol of the body, let us rest assured that the body itself is also given to us.&quot;

The Westminster Shorter Catechism summarises the teaching:

====Methodism====
Methodists believe in the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine (or grape juice) while, like Presbyterians and Lutherans, rejecting transubstantiation. According to the United Methodist Church, &quot;Jesus Christ, who &#x27;is the reflection of God&#x27;s glory and the exact imprint of God&#x27;s very being&#x27;, is truly present in Holy Communion.&quot;

While upholding the view that scripture is the primary source of Church practice, Methodists also look to church tradition and base their beliefs on the early Church teachings on the Eucharist, that Christ has a real presence in the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The &quot;Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists&quot; thus states that, &quot;[in Holy Communion] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour&quot;.

<text>Thomas Brackett Reed Jr. (October 18, 1839 – December 7, 1902) was an American attorney, author, parliamentarian and Republican Party politician from Maine who served as the 32nd Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1889 to 1891 and 1895 to 1899. He represented Maine&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the House from 1877 to 1899 and, prior to his time in Congress, represented Portland in the Maine legislature and served as Attorney General of Maine. In 1876, he was elected to represent Cumberland and York counties in the U.S. House and was re-elected for twelve consecutive terms.

As Speaker, Reed had greater influence over the agenda and operations of the House than any prior Speaker. His first term was marked by a dramatic expansion of the Speaker&#x27;s formal authority through changes to the House Rules, and he remains one of the most powerful Speakers in House history. He set out to put into practical effect his dictum &quot;The best system is to have one party govern and the other party watch&quot; and dramatically increased the power of the Speaker over the House by limiting the ability of the minority party to prevent the establishment of a quorum. Reed helped pass the Lodge Bill, which sought to protect African American voting rights in the Southern United States, but the bill failed in the Senate and never became law.

In 1896, he ran for president on a hard currency platform but lost the Republican nomination to William McKinley. While serving as Speaker in 1899, Reed resigned from the House in opposition to growing American imperialism, which left him politically isolated following the American victory in the Spanish-American War and the passage of the Newlands Resolution.

==Early life and education==

Thomas Brackett Reed was born on October 18, 1839, in a small two-story tenement on Hancock Street in Portland, Maine. His parents, Matilda Prince (née Mitchell) and Thomas Brackett Reed Sr., were natives of Maine who traced their American ancestry to the &quot;Arbella&quot; and &quot;Mayflower&quot;, respectively. The Reed family were not wealthy; Thomas Sr. was captain of a fishing boat before becoming a watchman in a Portland sugar warehouse.

Reed attended public schools, including the Portland Boys&#x27; School, and was an avid student and reader. He showed interest in public affairs from an early age, attending Neal Dow&#x27;s trial for involvement in the Portland Rum Riot in 1855. He was also an avid member of the Congregational Church as a young man. Members of his congregation raised funds to provide him a college education with intent that he become a minister, but he left the church and returned the donations.

===Bowdoin College (1856–1860)===
After graduating high school, Reed entered Bowdoin College in 1856 and undertook a mandatory course centered on Christian theology, Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Bowdoin was noted for its required courses in English composition and oratory and had already produced Nathaniel Hawthorne, President of the United States Franklin Pierce, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The faculty consisted of ten men, led by president Leonard Woods and including Charles Carroll Everett, Thomas C. Upham, Alpheus Packard, and William Smyth. Reed&#x27;s professor of rhetoric and oratory, Joshua Chamberlain, later distinguished himself at the Battle of Gettysburg and served as Governor of Maine during Reed&#x27;s term in the state legislature.

At Bowdoin, Reed gained a personal reputation for his ability to recite Joseph Butler&#x27;s &quot;Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed&quot; from memory. He was a member of the rowing crew, chess club, Psi Upsilon fraternity, and an editor of the annual yearbook. He debated as a member of the Peucinian Society and was an avid reader of Carlyle, Goethe, Thackeray, Macaulay, and Charles Reade, among other less popular authors.

Reed kept a small, close group of friends, including Samuel Fessenden, the son of U.S. Senator William Pitt Fessenden, who provided Reed a loan to complete his education. Samuel Fessenden was an avid abolitionist who participated in the civil conflict in Kansas and, one year after graduation, died at the Second Battle of Bull Run. His death had a profound impact on Reed, who memorialized Fessenden as &quot;the quiet associate of the studious hours ... sublimated in the crucible of death from all imperfections, clothed upon with all his virtues and radiant with all the possibilities of a generous youth.&quot;

===Legal and U.S. Navy career (1860–1865)===
As a senior, Reed reversed a previously mediocre academic record to lead his class; he finished fifth in the graduating class of 1860 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Abandoning any interest in ministry, he spent the next years doing odd jobs and studying law. He taught school in Portland for a year before moving to California in 1861. He was admitted to the bar in San Jose on September 8, 1863, after an examination by eminent California attorney William T. Wallace. While in San Jose, he delivered pro-Union speeches and signed a letter from sixteen members of the bar endorsing judge Samuel Bell McKee for re-election to the bench, citing McKee&#x27;s determination to &quot;uphold the Administration in its present efforts to suppress the rebellion and sustain the Constitution and laws of the United States.&quot; However, he soon returned to Portland, deciding &quot;nature never intended any man to live [in California], only to dig gold and get himself out of it, and to shudder in dreams ever afterwards.&quot;

On his return to Maine, Reed joined the law offices of Howard and Strout as a clerk. He joined the United States Navy in April 1864, winning an appointment as acting assistant paymaster on the recommendation of Senator Fessenden. He served in that role, primarily on the gunboat USS &quot;Sibyl&quot; on the Mississippi and Tennessee rivers, until honorably discharged in late 1865. When a Reed supporter later pointed out his opponents boasted of their war records, he retorted, &quot;Tell them I kept a grocery on a gunboat down in Louisiana in wartime.&quot;

==State politics (1867–1876)==
===Maine legislator (1867–1870)===
After the war, Reed returned to Portland and was admitted to the Maine bar in October 1865. He opened a practice in Portland, taking petty civil and criminal cases. In 1867, his colleague Nathan Webb secured Reed&#x27;s nomination for the Maine House of Representatives; after some persuading, Reed agreed to run. In the heavily Republican city of Portland, he was easily elected; he was re-elected to a second term in 1868.

Reed, one of the youngest members of the Maine House at the time, served on the joint legislative committee on the judiciary and drafted a bills for a general law of incorporation and the abolition of capital punishment in the state; both failed. He distinguished himself for parliamentary skill in the 1869 U.S. Senate election between former Vice President Hannibal Hamlin and incumbent Senator Lot M. Morrill, whom Reed supported. In the Republican caucus to nominate a candidate, Reed moved to rule a blank ballot invalid, breaking a tie in favor of Morrill. (Hamlin was later elected by a vote of the whole legislature.) Despite his youth, by March 1869 the Portland &quot;Press&quot; considered Reed &quot;the actual though not the nominal leader of [the House].&quot;

In 1869, Reed was elected Senator for Cumberland County. He continued to serve on the joint committee on the judiciary and successfully led the fight to delay construction of the Portland and Rutland Railroad. He also paid homage to his former patron, Senator Fessenden, who died in 1869. Though Fessenden had become unpopular in the state owing to his vote against the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, Reed aggressively defended Fessenden&#x27;s legacy and wartime service.

Reed later reflected that his greatest achievement as a state legislator was securing the re-organization of the Cumberland County courts in an effort to reduce the time necessary to bring cases to a final judgment.

===Attorney General of Maine (1870–1873)===
In January 1870, the Republican caucus nominated Reed for Attorney General, and he was elected easily. As Attorney General, Reed significantly raised his profile. His first months in office were marked by the high-profile trial of a man charged with killing his wife&#x27;s lover. Overcoming a &quot;crime of passion&quot; defense, Reed won a manslaughter verdict, though he had asked for a charge of murder. As a result, Reed advocated for the abolition of spousal privilege, which had excluded the only witness, the defendant&#x27;s wife, from testifying. He also advocated separately as Attorney General for bail bond reform and an increase in the State&#x27;s peremptory challenges in jury selection. Most of Reed&#x27;s suggestions did eventually become law, but were not adopted immediately, which he attributed to the fact that prosecutors were barred by virtue of their office from advising the legislature.

He continued to oppose the railroad corporations, calling for an increase in the $5,000 cap ($ in ) on wrongful death claims and challenging the merger of the Portland and Kennebec with the Maine Central under a writ of quo warranto; his action was rendered moot when the legislature recognized the merger as valid. In 1894, Reed spoke out in favor of consolidation and declared the writ was a mistake, arguing that the merger had &quot;resulted in better stations, better trains, better transportation facilities of every kind.&quot;

Reed served as Attorney General for the three years prescribed by tradition before leaving office in 1873. He returned to a more lucrative private practice and served for three years as Portland city solicitor, representing the city in personal injury suits and routine business.

==Early United States House career (1877–81)==
=== 1876 election ===
Reed was nominated for Congress from Maine&#x27;s first district in 1876. Incumbent Representative John H. Burleigh had split from the state party organization, led by Senators James G. Blaine and Hannibal Hamlin, and Reed, a respected organization man, was chosen to oppose him. Reed&#x27;s strength was in the city of Portland, while most of Burleigh&#x27;s support was from York County. Reed narrowly carried the district convention on June 29. The conflict between Reed and Burleigh carried into the general election, with a Burleigh ticket in the campaign. Reed campaigned in favor of prohibition and was attacked for his association with Robert G. Ingersoll, known for his radical advocacy for agnosticism. Reed was forced to deny that he was an atheist, but the charge would be repeated in later campaigns. Ultimately, Reed narrowly won by fewer than 1,000 votes on September 9, with Burleigh receiving 177.

=== Early congressional service and rise ===
Reed was relatively active in debate during his first term, speaking against Fernando Wood in support of funding for the United States diplomatic corps and delivering his most famous early speech against the federal restoration of the campus of William &amp; Mary College, which was destroyed during the war. Arguing that the expenditure would set a precedent which would allow &quot;every claim agent who loved the Lost Cause and a good many who did not&quot; to raid the Treasury, Reed argued, &quot;You were beaten and yet you want us to take the consequences. You come forward and insist that the victorious country shall pay for the damages inflicted upon it by its enemies.&quot;

The highlight of his first term was his appointment on May 20, 1878, to the committee to investigate charges of fraud in the 1876 presidential election. Reed used the politically sensitive role to advocate the Republican position, restoring the party&#x27;s fortunes ahead of the 1880 election. Reed defended the legitimacy of Hayes&#x27;s victory in the state of Louisiana, in particular focusing on East Feliciana Parish, where he alleged that a violent wave of crime (including murder) had been for the purpose of political intimidation, as it had ended suddenly on election day and the victims had been primarily Republicans. Reed also cross-examined William T. Pelton, Tilden&#x27;s nephew and aide, regarding evidence Pelton had delivered bribes on behalf of his uncle&#x27;s campaign. Pelton&#x27;s testimony under Reed&#x27;s questioning was so damaging that Tilden appeared before the committee himself to deny the accusations. The final Republican minority report suggested Pelton, a poor man, could not have made such bribes without Tilden&#x27;s knowledge. While the report did not vindicate Hayes, it softened the political blow by demonstrating that electioneering and misconduct had not been one-sided and raised Reed&#x27;s profile beyond that of an ordinary House freshman.

His seat was nevertheless threatened by the rise of the Greenback Party, which favored an inflationary monetary policy, and his vote against the Bland-Allison Act. In his 1878 re-election campaign, he came out vigorously against paper currency and was aided by appearances from James Garfield and Galusha Grow. His re-election was ultimately owed to the failure of the opposition to settle on a single candidate, and he won with a plurality. During the campaign, Reed developed a widely quoted aphorism against monetary expansion: &quot;You won&#x27;t have any more potatoes if you call them four thousand pecks than if you call them one thousand bushels.&quot;

In 1880, Reed joined the rest of Maine in supporting James G. Blaine&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination. He was a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention. In the fall, he faced a united opposition following the fusion of the Greenback and Democratic ticket in Maine. Returns gave Reed a 109-vote lead, but his opponent alleged fraud and challenged his election in the House. The Republican majority declared Reed the victor.

==Party leadership (1881–1889)==
===Judiciary chair (1881–1883)===
After Reed&#x27;s election to a third term, he was briefly considered to succeed Hannibal Hamlin in the United States Senate, but he publicly declined to be a candidate. He attributed his decision to the narrow Republican majority in the House and the possibility that his seat would flip.

By the time the 47th United States Congress met on December 5, 1881, the new President James A. Garfield had been assassinated and Chester A. Arthur had succeeded him. With few tested leaders in the House, the Republican caucus turned to J. Warren Keifer as Speaker of the House after sixteen ballots; Reed finished third with eleven votes on the final ballot, behind Frank Hiscock. In a concession to his opponents, Keifer named Hiscock and Reed to House leadership as chairs of the powerful committees on Appropriations and the Judiciary, respectively. In a significant step, Reed also joined the Speaker and George Robeson on the powerful Committee on Rules after January 9, 1882, when Godlove Orth, another Keifer opponent who was left out of leadership, resigned in protest.

In both roles, Reed defended the authority of the office of Speaker and majority rule. When Orth introduced a resolution to select committees and their chairs by an elective board of eleven members, Reed spoke out against it on the grounds that &quot;the Speaker is not only under constant supervision of public opinion but also of the House.&quot; The resolution lost by a large nonpartisan majority. During a May 1882 debate over a contested election in North Carolina, the parties came to a head over the minority&#x27;s use of the filibuster. In response, Reed moved to amend the House Rules to bar any dilatory motion while a motion to adjourn was on the table. After a week of efforts by the Democratic minority to delay this Rules amendment, Reed moved that the dilatory tactics were out of order and proposed that &quot;no member or set of members have any right to use the rules which are to be changed to prevent the change which the House desires to make. ... There is no such thing as suicide in any provision of the Constitution of the United States.&quot; After three hours of debate, Keifer upheld Reed on the point of order. Former Speaker Samuel J. Randall protested and appealed to the House, where the Speaker&#x27;s decision was upheld by a majority vote. According to De Alva S. Alexander, &quot;[From] that hour Reed became the real leader of his party. Ever after, so long as he remained in Congress, his voice gave the word of command.&quot;

Reed further expanded the principle of majority rule in debate over Tariff of 1883. As a protectionist, Reed supported higher tariffs on imports, but the House appeared unlikely to pass an independent tariff bill. Instead, Reed presented a report from the Rules Committee to suspend the rules by majority vote and request a conference committee to consider the &quot;internal&quot; revenue bill, to which the Senate had attached tariff amendments. Reed&#x27;s report passed the House, but only after the first vote failed to show a quorum. The report was highly controversial; Samuel S. Cox denounced it as &quot;a fraud on parliamentary law,&quot; and Senators Thomas F. Bayard and James B. Beck refused to sit on the conference committee. The resulting bill itself, sometimes called the &quot;mongrel tariff,&quot; was highly unpopular as well; Reed later wrote of his regret over the episode, claiming that none of the tariff commissioners&#x27; report had been enacted, &quot;but all of its mistakes were.&quot;

=== House Minority leadership (1883–89) ===
In 1882, the Democratic Party regained control of the House and John G. Carlisle of Kentucky was elected Speaker. Reed continued to seek reform of the House Rules from the minority by exploiting disagreements between Samuel J. Randall and William Ralls Morrison, two members of Democratic leadership who disagreed sharply over tariff policy. Reed retained his seats on the Rules and Judiciary committees and gained a spot on the powerful Committee on Ways and Means.

During his six years in the House minority, Reed also grew in party influence. Former Speaker Keifer, by virtue of seniority, retained leadership of the minority, but ultimately lost re-election to his House seat in 1884. When the next Congress met, Reed&#x27;s name was placed in nomination by William McKinley for the party endorsement for Speaker; he defeated Frank Hiscock by 63 votes against 42 for the honor, thus formally sanctioning Reed as the party&#x27;s floor leader. Hiscock also left the House in 1887 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate, leaving Reed the undisputed leader of the party in the House, though McKinley, Nelson Dingley, and Joe Cannon were rising stars.

==Speaker of the House (1889–91, 1895–99)==
=== First term (1889–91) ===
In 1888, the Republican Party retook control of the House of Representatives and the White House in an election defined by their support for the protective tariff. In Congress, Reed was a leader of the campaign, delivering a lengthy and celebrated May 19 speech against tariff reform legislation before the House. Following the election, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that the &quot;speakership question was regarded on all sides as being settled&quot; in favor of Reed, though his leading rival, McKinley, was personally very popular. Reed&#x27;s election as Speaker was decisively ensured by the support of the New York delegation on November 29, 1889. He carried the caucus the next day on the second ballot with 85 votes to McKinley&#x27;s 38 and was elected speaker at the opening of the next session on December 2, 1889.

McKinley was named chair of Ways and Means, placing him in charge of the tariff, with Reed&#x27;s lesser rivals Cannon and David B. Henderson on Appropriations and Julius C. Burrows as chair of Manufactures. McKinley and Cannon also joined Reed on the Rules Committee.

==== Rules reform ====
Even before his election as Speaker, Reed had renewed his calls for rules reform. In a March 1889 article for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Century&quot; magazine, he demanded checks on dilatory motions and a restoration of the &quot;morning hour,&quot; permitting the House to consider urgent measures for prompt action at the start of each day, rather than consider measures in the order they were presented. In the October &quot;North American Review&quot;, Reed compared the situation in the House to that in the House of Commons, where Reed argued Irish nationalists had hijacked the rules beyond their original intent in order to extract concessions through obstruction. Reed vowed that the incoming Republican House would adopt new Rules wholesale, as opposed to the traditional practice of adopting the previous House&#x27;s rules &quot;pro forma&quot; and amending as needed.

On January 21, 1890, Reed made his first serious reform to House Rules when he refused a motion by Richard P. Bland to require tellers for a motion to adjourn, on the grounds that the motion was merely intended to delay adjournment and obstruct House business. After a prolonged and heated debate, the Speaker&#x27;s decision was ratified 149 to 137.

In particular, Reed sought to circumscribe the &quot;disappearing quorum&quot;—the ability of the minority to block business by remaining silent during a quorum call, which, under the rules, prevented a member from being counted as present even if physically in the chamber, thus forcing the House to suspend business. Reed&#x27;s solution was implemented on January 29, 1890, in what has popularly been called the &quot;Battle of the Reed Rules,&quot; when Democrats attempted to prevent Charles Brooks Smith, a Republican from West Virginia whose election was contested, from being seated. The motion to seat Brooks passed 162–1, short of the 165 required for quorum; when voting closed Democrats shouted, &quot;No quorum,&quot; a formal quorum count was triggered. Reed began the roll call, and when members refused to answer, Reed directed the Clerk to count them as present but not voting. Startled Democrats protested heatedly, directing verbal abuse, threats, and insults at Reed, while James B. McCreary, a Democrat from Kentucky, challenged Reed&#x27;s authority to count him since he had not answered to his name when the roll was called. Reed replied &quot;The Chair is making a statement of fact that the gentleman from Kentucky is present. Does he deny it?&quot; Unable to deny their presence, some Democrats tried to flee the chamber or hide under their desks, but Reed ordered the doors locked. One Representative, Constantine B. Kilgore of Texas, was able to flee by kicking his way through a door. The conflict over parliamentary procedure lasted three days, with Democrats delaying consideration of the bill by introducing points of order to challenge the maneuver and then appealing Reed&#x27;s rulings to the floor. Democrats finally dropped their objections on January 31, and Smith was seated on February 3 by a vote of 166–0. Six days later, Reed won a vote to formalize the new Rules, eliminating the disappearing quorum and lowering the quorum to 100 members. Though Democrats reinstated the disappearing quorum when they took control of the House the following year, Reed would prove so adroit at using the tactic against them that they reinstated the &quot;Reed Rules&quot; in 1894.

Following his decisive victory in over the Smith election contest, Reed introduced wholesale reforms designed to speed the pace of legislation in the House. The Democratic minority permitted the resumption of business, with former Speaker Carlisle admitting, &quot;We protest, but the case must be tried elsewhere.&quot; Under those conditions, the 51st Congress was the most productive since the Civil War and passed at least twenty-six pieces of major legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, Sherman Silver Purchase Act, Sherman Antitrust Act, and Immigration Act of 1891.

==== McKinley Tariff ====
As the campaign of 1888 had been waged over the issue of protective tariff policy, passing a heightened tariff was a key priority of the 51st Congress. The resulting bill, known as the McKinley Tariff after its primary author, passed the House on May 21, 1890, after an expedited drafting process. A revised bill passed the Senate on September 10 with a reciprocity clause (supported by now-Secretary of State James G. Blaine) attached. Despite Reed&#x27;s opposition, the reciprocity clause was allowed to remain after some further amendments, and the bill was signed into law on October 1.

With a month to the House elections, the McKinley Tariff was immediately the center of political debate; no tariff since the so-called &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; had been as controversial. The Tariff was seen as favoring the industrial and financial regions of the Northeast and Midwest over the rural South and West, which were suffering under poor conditions for the agricultural industry. The free trade publication &quot;The Nation&quot; referred to it as &quot;a series of minute interferences with trade and industry for the benefit of individuals, firms and corporations&quot; and attributed its passage to the repayment of campaign debts to corporate donors. Though Reed defended the tariff package in public, he ultimately blamed it for the party&#x27;s massive defeat in the 1890 elections and in 1894, admitted that protection had been carried to its extreme on certain goods. However, he later argued that the tariff had been a success in light of the impending global financial collapse, which had rendered the international mercantile situation &quot;a quicksand which then began to give signs of sinking.&quot; Though repealed and replaced by the next Congress, it gained greater support after the Panic of 1893 and made McKinley a serious national political figure; he would go on to win the White House in 1896 as the premier champion of industrial protection.

==== Sherman Silver Purchase Act ====
By 1888, there was a growing movement in both parties to return the country to a currency system backed by both silver and gold (thus expanding the money supply), and it had become conventional wisdom that it was necessary to &quot;do something for silver.&quot; Though Reed was a firm supporter of &quot;sound money,&quot; which tended to favor the more stable gold standard, a majority in both chambers of Congress had some level of sympathy for the free silver movement. On January 20, 1890, Edwin H. Conger (chair of Coinage, Weights and Measures) introduced a bill authorizing the Treasury to issue notes in exchange for silver bullion at market price. A revised version of Conger&#x27;s bill, providing for the purchase of $4,500,000 of silver per month ($ in ), was reported to the House in early June. If silver reached the ratio of 16 to 1 under this bill, free coinage was authorized.

In a party caucus on June 4, Reed spoke against any further concessions to silver advocates; the silver Republicans dissented, seriously threatening party unity. On June 5, the Rules Committee (Reed, McKinley, and Cannon) passed a special order to permit only two days of debate before a final vote at 3 o&#x27;clock on June 7. After an outbreak of acrimonious dissent, the special order passed 120 to 117, and the bill ultimately passed on schedule without further amendments by a vote of 135 to 119.

However, the Senate, controlled by silver advocates, passed an amended version adopting an unconditional free coinage amendment on June 17. The amendment caught Reed and House Republicans by surprise; a considerable number of Representatives were absent, making its passage likely if brought to an immediate vote. When McKinley moved on June 19 for approval of the House Journal (containing the procedural business of the day), Roger Q. Mills objected that the Journal had not been read in its entirety. The omitted portions were the read, revealing the Senate bill had been referred to the Committee on Coinage, sparking an uproar. In a rare parliamentary defeat for Reed, the Journal was not approved by a vote of 105 to 117. Mills then successfully moved to have the Journal amended, hastening a vote. On June 20, Richard P. Bland moved to debate the bill before the House. Conger and Reed engaged in a series of dilatory maneuvers, arguing that the bill was not on available for debate, because it was before Conger&#x27;s committee. By the time the bill came for a vote the next day, enough Republican votes had been whipped via telegraph to return a working majority to Washington, and Bland&#x27;s motion was defeated by a vote of 144 to 117.

A conference bill, called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act after John Sherman, emerged which omitted the free coinage of silver and called for the parity of the two metals. The bill passed with great difficulty in the lame duck 1891 session.

==== Lodge Federal Elections Bill ====

One of the most significant and controversial pieces of legislation which Reed pressed for passage in the 51st Congress did not become law. In 1889 and 1890, Republicans undertook one last stand in favor of federal enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment to protect the voting rights of blacks in the Solid South, and Reed took a special interest in the project. Under the Lodge Bill, introduced on June 14, 1890, congressional elections would be placed under the protection of the federal government; Reed personally defended the bill and the concept of equality of races under the law in an April 1890 speech and published article in the June 1890 &quot;North American Review&quot;. Opponents, especially in the South, derided it as the &quot;Force Bill,&quot; and cynics attributed the proposal to an effort to secure Southern seats in the face of waning Republican support in the West. Reed also aroused Northern opposition in his speech, when he defended black voting in the South by way of comparison to immigrant votes in New York and other cities, arguing, &quot;Why should they poll their ignorance and we not poll ours?&quot; Reed, McKinley, and Cannon voted the Bill out of committee on June 25 and, over Democratic objections, it passed after a strict debate schedule on July 2.

In the Senate, the bill was filibustered through two sessions of Congress, until it was ultimately laid aside during the lame duck session of January 1891 in favor of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Notably, several Republican Senators from the newly admitted Western states voted to prioritize the Silver Purchase Act; likely in retaliation, the House rejected a free silver bill which passed the Senate to &quot;provide against the contraction of the currency.&quot; The Lodge Bill was the last serious effort in Congress to enforce the terms of the Fifteenth Amendment until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and its defeat is sometimes marked as the beginning of the decline in American race relations.

=== Return to minority (1891–95) ===
In reaction to Reed&#x27;s aggressive legislative agenda and the new appropriations associated with it, the 51st Congress was branded by critics as the &quot;Billion Dollar Congress.&quot; Democrats regained the House by a wide majority, and both of Reed&#x27;s top lieutenants, McKinley and Cannon, were defeated. Republicans retained the Senate by a reduced margin. With government thus divided in the 52nd Congress, legislation reached a standstill. In Reed&#x27;s words, the House &quot;led a gelatinous existence, the scorn of all vertebrate animals.&quot;

Anticipating a further disaster in the 1892 elections, Reed privately opposed the nomination of President Harrison for a second term, and his own name gained some traction in the press as a potential compromise candidate. When Harrison was ultimately nominated, Reed declined to campaign for him in the general election. Grover Cleveland was elected and the Republicans lost the Senate, giving the Democratic Party control of the White House, Senate, and House for the first time since the Civil War. Reed did win a minor victory in 1892, when the Supreme Court decided &quot;United States v. Ballin&quot;, determining that Reed had acted within the Constitution in defining a quorum to include all members present.

The 53rd Congress was dominated by the Panic of 1893; it convened early in summer 1893 when President Cleveland called a special session asking for the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Though Reed was still a member of the minority for partisan purposes, he could be counted among the leaders of the cross-party majority which supported repeal. Reed gave the closing argument for repeal on August 26, 1893, arguing that the regular schedule of redemptions had drained the nation&#x27;s currency reserves and undermined confidence in the financial system. Two days later, repeal carried in the House by a vote of 240 to 110. A vote for free silver was defeated 227 to 124. When the Senate delayed passage of the repeal bill, Reed delivered a public speech on October 25 arguing that the Senate was directly opposed to the will of the majority; five days later, repeal passed the Senate 43 to 22.

The remainder of the term was marked by infighting among the majority, which had become hopelessly divided over the currency issue; meanwhile, the Republican minority remained loyally unified behind Reed, delivering him opportunities to undermine Speaker Charles Frederick Crisp. A frustrated Crisp remarked of his predecessor on March 29, 1894: &quot;The leader that they follow without question has one great thought, one great idea in his mind, and that is to force this side to count a quorum. Every other question, no matter who great, no matter how important it may be, sinks into insignificance. Gentlemen on that side blindly follow him, no matter how their own convictions may differ from his. He is the great leader on that side. You will hear them privately saying &#x27;Reed ought not to do that,&#x27; or &#x27;This is wrong,&#x27; but when Reed says &#x27;Do it,&#x27; they all step up and do it.&quot;Given Crisp&#x27;s failure to hold his majority together, the House officially adopted a rule to use a present, rather than voting, quorum on April 17, 1894, consistent with Reed&#x27;s 1890 reforms.

=== Return to speakership (189599) ===
==== 1896 presidential campaign ====
After four years in the minority, the economic situation and divisions in the Democratic majority delivered the Republicans a historic landslide in the 1894 elections. In the House, the party gained 110 seats; as of 2025, this remains the largest single-election seat swing in United States history. With a wide majority but little room for common ground with President Cleveland outside of the currency issue, Reed&#x27;s focus during the 54th Congress was his highly anticipated campaign for the presidency. Observers in the capital soon found Reed a changed man; he shaved his trademark mustache and was less given to humor or sarcasm, giving the impression of a man who felt &quot;a necessity of taking himself seriously, of presenting an impressive aspect, of looking as wise as he can.&quot;

At the start of the 54th Congress, Reed was widely regarded as the favorite for the Republican nomination as the party&#x27;s leading figure and spokesman on financial matters. He had the vigorous support of Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt, and party bosses including Joseph H. Manley, Matt Quay, J. Donald Cameron, and Thomas C. Platt were reported to be sympathetic. His chief opponent for the nomination was William McKinley, his longtime lieutenant and rival for party supremacy, now serving as Governor of Ohio. McKinley&#x27;s campaign was managed by Mark Hanna, who raised unprecedented sums of money for the race. Hanna also launched a nationwide publicity campaign to raise McKinley&#x27;s profile and successfully framed the issue in the campaign as protective tariffs, McKinley&#x27;s strength, rather than the currency question, acknowledged to be Reed&#x27;s strength. As the year 1896 began, McKinley supporters claimed the secure support of 433 delegates, only thirty short of nomination on the first ballot. When New Hampshire senator William E. Chandler accused Hanna of effectively taking bribes from mercantile interests in exchange for promises of a new protective tariff, the backlash permanently damaged the struggling Reed campaign. Some accused Chandler, whose reputation for political corruption rendered his charge hypocritical, of deliberately sabotaging Reed. When the Vermont convention declared for McKinley on April 28, breaking solidarity in the New England ranks, Reed&#x27;s campaign was effectively doomed.

In addition to the vigorous campaign by Hanna and Chandler&#x27;s gaffe, Reed&#x27;s ultimate failure to secure the nomination has been attributed to his refusal to make pledges or commitments in exchange for political or financial support. Despite his unvarnished ambition for the White House, Reed refused to give special consideration to allies or supporters when considering committee appointments or appropriations. On one occasion, he was quoted, &quot;The bill will not be allowed to come up even with that Reed button on your coat.&quot; By the time the 1896 Republican National Convention met in St. Louis, McKinley had secured a greater share of delegate pledges than any candidate since Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, and he became the first candidate since Grant in 1868 to win an open nomination (i.e., without an incumbent in the race) on the first ballot. Reed received the support of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, as well as a handful of Southern delegates. Reed supporters at the convention, led by Lodge, did succeed in including a gold standard plank in the party platform, abandoning their prior proposal for bimetallism by international agreement. Reed vigorously supported McKinley in the general election against William Jennings Bryan, a vocal free silver advocate.

The election of 1896 returned the Republican Party to control of government, with McKinley as President and majorities in both the House and Senate. Despite some suggestions that Reed would sabotage the McKinley administration as retribution for his defeat in 1896, he set personal differences aside and was again credited as the shepherd of the Republican agenda. Nelson Dingley returned as chair of Ways and Means and set about drafting the protective tariff legislation for which McKinley had campaigned, ultimately passed as the Dingley Tariff in July 1897.

==== Spanish-American War and resignation ====
Beginning in 1895, the struggle for Cuban independence was the subject of increasing American attention during the McKinley presidency. The severity of Spanish rule and the potential for an economic and military foothold in the Caribbean drew calls for an American intervention on the island, which had long been the target of expansionists. Reed was an opponent of &quot;jingoism&quot; and expansionism generally, having privately criticized Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s involvement in Chile and publicly opposed efforts to annex Hawaii. Foreign policy is the constitutional province of the Senate, giving Reed few opportunities to participate in the growing debate over Cuba. On July 7, 1897, the issue came before the House for the first time when Representative Benton McMillin offered a resolution recognizing the Cuban rebels. Nelson Dingley promptly moved for adjournment.

Reed continued to avoid addressing Cuba in the House but made his position public through a series of interviews and articles. In September, he published an article in the &quot;Illustrated American&quot; which called for the government to avoid foreign entanglements, &quot;grow up to the territory we have already,&quot; and strive for national unity. He added that there was no serious threat of attack from Spain or Cuba and, while he supported naval power as a form of insurance, over-insurance was &quot;costly and makes a moral hazard and danger of a conflagration which might burn what we have not protected.&quot; In a second article titled &quot;Empire Can Wait,&quot; he pointed to historical examples to argue expansion created variation in the thought and needs of a country and that unassimilated populations would inevitably create a strain on American institutions. He further arraigned the press for feeding public interest in &quot;prurient details of crime&quot; in Cuba and Turkey in an effort to influence foreign policy.

Initially, Reed and President McKinley agreed on the issue. McKinley actively sought a peaceful solution to the Cuban Revolution and Reed gave him full support. However, after the publication of the De Lôme Letter and the sinking of the USS &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana harbor on February 15, 1898, public opinion rapidly turned against peace and in favor of a declaration of war. Reed refused to believe the &quot;Maine&quot; was intentionally sunk by Spain, a position he maintained until his death. On March 8, Joe Cannon (as chair of Appropriations) introduced a bill at the behest of McKinley to appropriate $50 million (approximately $ in ) for defense, and it received almost unanimous support. Reed clung to hope that war could be avoided, and his suppression of a resolution to recognize Cuban independence aroused resentment throughout the country. Though public opinion was growing in favor of war, the question of Cuban independence remained considerably more controversial. A war resolution passed on April 19 with only six votes against. Reed was quoted as telling one of the six, &quot;I envy you the luxury of your vote. I was where I could not do it.&quot;

Reed&#x27;s political position became increasingly fraught following the easy American victory at Manila Bay on May 1, as the aims of American expansion grew to include strategic positions in the Pacific. The Newlands Resolution, which would prove Reed&#x27;s signal defeat, was introduced in the House on May 4. For three weeks, the Speaker blocked its consideration but, when opinion in the House became overwhelming and a petition for its introduction was signed by Republican members, Reed surrendered. On June 2, it was announced that the resolution would be passed before adjournment. Reed was re-elected in 1898 and retained the Speaker&#x27;s gavel but became increasingly isolated during the debate over the ratification of the Treaty of Paris and imperial expansion, especially after the loss of three key allies: Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge were ardent expansionists, and Nelson Dingley died on January 13, 1899. After meeting with President McKinley on Jekyll Island in the spring, Reed finally announced on April 19 that he would retire from public life and become senior partner in the firm of Simpson, Thatcher and Barnum. His resignation was made formally effective on September 4.

==Personal life==

Reed married his childhood friend and classmate Susan P. Merrill in 1871, when he was a member of the Maine legislature. She was born at Center Harbor, New Hampshire, on Lake Winnipesaukee to the Rev. Samuel H. Merrill, a well-known Congregational clergyman, and Hannah Prentis, a native of New Hampshire. She had one brother, Edward P. Merrill, and one sister, who resided in Lowell, Massachusetts. They had one daughter, Katherine Reed Balentine, who was born January 23, 1875. Katherine later started a monthly magazine called &quot;The Yellow Ribbon&quot;, which promoted women&#x27;s suffrage.

Reed was well known for his acerbic wit (asked if his party might nominate him for president, he noted, &quot;They could do worse, and they probably will&quot;). His size, standing at over 6 feet in height and weighing over 300 lbs (136 kg), was also a distinguishing factor. Reed was a member of the social circle that included intellectuals and politicians Henry Cabot Lodge, Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Adams, and John Hay. Upon his retirement from public life, he also counted Mark Twain among his personal friends.

In 1894, Reed published his handbook on parliamentary procedure, titled &quot;Reed&#x27;s Rules: A Manual of General Parliamentary Law&quot;, which was, at the time, a very popular text on the subject and is still in use in the legislature of the State of Washington.

==Death and legacy==
In early December 1902, Reed was in Washington on business with the United States Supreme Court. On December 2, Reed visited his former colleagues in the Ways and Means Committee room. Later that day, he became ill while in another room of the Capitol and was rushed to the nearby Arlington Hotel. In the Arlington, Reed was diagnosed with Bright&#x27;s disease complicated by appendicitis; he died five days later at 12:10am on December 7 with his wife and daughter at his bedside. A Gridiron Club dinner was occurring at the same time in the same hotel as Reed&#x27;s death. When news broke of Reed&#x27;s passing, &quot;the diners rose to drink a silent toast to a man who had so often been among them&quot;.

In announcing his death to the House, Representative James S. Sherman said, &quot;He was so great, his service to his country so valuable, that it seems we may fitly depart from what is the usual custom of the House when one not in public life dies.&quot; The House thus adopted a resolution honoring Reed as &quot;a distinguished statesman, a lofty patriot, a cultured scholar, an incisive writer, a unique orator, an unmatched debater, a master of logic, wit, satire, the most famous of the world&#x27;s parliamentarians, the great and representative citizen of the American Republic.&quot; Henry Cabot Lodge eulogized him as &quot;a good hater, who detested shams, humbugs and pretense above all else.&quot; Mark Twain wrote of him, &quot;He was transparently honest and honorable, there was no furtiveness about him, and whoever came to know him trusted him and was not disappointed. He was wise, he was shrewd and alert, he was a clear and capable thinker, a logical reasoner, and a strong and convincing speaker.&quot;

He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine. His will was executed by his good friend, the financier Augustus G. Paine Sr. He left his family an estate of $200,000 (approximately $ in ).

=== Memorials ===

There is a Reed House at Bowdoin College.

His home town of Portland, Maine, erected a statue of him at the corner of Western Promenade and Pine Street in a ceremony on August 31, 1910. His last home in Portland has been designated a National Historic Landmark in his honor.

<text>&quot;Thunderbird and Whale&quot; is an indigenous myth belonging to the mythological traditions of a number of tribes from the American Pacific Northwest.

==Overview==

The myth of the epic struggle between Thunderbird and Whale is found in common among different language/cultural groups of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of America, and seems to be uniquely localized to this area. It is also the major archetypal motif in carvings and painted art, particularly among the natives along the outlying coasts of Vancouver Island, e.g., the Kwakiutl (Kwakwakaʼwakw) or the Nootka (Nuu-chah-nulth) people.

== Examples ==

=== Quileute ===

One version can be summarized as follows:
The famine experienced on Quileute may not necessarily be blamed on the whales, and Thunderbird makes a gift of a whale, its usual prey to the starving folk, as in a version collected by Ella E. Clark (pub. 1953).

There are also disparate short pieces of lore which Clark stitches together into one narrative; with the individual pieces resembling the short lore collected by Albert B. Reagan (mostly 1905–1909).

Thus one narrative tells of the Thunderbird pitted against its prey, the whale which kept trying to elude capture, and this escalated to such turmoil that it uprooted trees, and no tree ever grew back again in the area.

Another narrative is the recurrent battle between Thunderbird and the &quot;Mimlos-Whale&quot;, an orca that repeatedly escapes to sea after capture, and this struggle resulted in great tremors in the mountains and leveling of trees, offering a mythic explanation of the origin of the Olympic Peninsula prairies.

=== Kwakwakaʼwakw ===

Some of the lore among the Kwakwakaʼwakw, regarding the Thunderbird&#x27;s has been collated by Franz Boas.

But in Boas&#x27;s version the battle takes place between Thunderbird and Ōʼᵋmät (K!wēʼk!waxāʼwēᵋ), the leader of the animals. The latter retaliates against Thunderbird carrying away one of his sons, by raising an army carried in an artificial whale. In the battle at the village, Thunderbird&#x27;s four children (named &quot;One-Whale-Carrier&quot;, etc.) are drowned, and Thunderbird himself is killed, survived only by the &quot;nine-month old infant in the cradle&quot;.

=== Comox ===
In one of many variant versions of the myth, the sound of the whale dropping into the sea is the source of thunder. A young boy of a Vancouver Island people, the Comox, was fascinated by the sound of thunder, and heard it from behind a point of land. He crossed that point, following the sound of thunder, and discovered the spectacle of the Thunderbird seizing and dropping the whale. The Thunderbird saw the boy, and told him that the story was now his, and he had the right to wear the Thunderbird mask and wings at the potlatch.

==Reconstructing the myth==
In the 1980s, geologists found evidence that an earthquake, powerful enough to send a tsunami all the way to Japan, hit the American Pacific Northwest in 1700. Some ethnologists believe that &quot;Thunderbird and Whale&quot; is a description of that disaster.

<doc id="30916" wikidata="Q3596097" url="?curid=30916" title="Tomato sauce">
<text>Tomato sauce (, , or ) can refer to many different sauces made primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish, rather than as a condiment. Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables, but they are perhaps best known as bases for sauces for Mexican salsas and Italian pasta dishes. Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high water content, soft flesh which breaks down easily, and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when stewed, without the need for thickeners such as roux or masa. All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces.

In countries such as the United Kingdom, India, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the term &quot;tomato sauce&quot; is used to describe a condiment similar to what Americans call ketchup. In some of these countries, both terms are used for the condiment.

==History==
Tomato sauces, along with similarly related and prepared tomatillo sauces, are presumed to have been in use since antiquity by the peoples of Central and South America as bases for many dishes. However, much of Pre-Columbian cuisine history in Mexico, along with other culturally significant information, had been purged during the periods of conquest by Europeans, chiefly the Spanish. Bernardino de Sahagún, a Franciscan friar from the Kingdom of Spain, is believed to be the first European to write about tomato sauce after encountering it for sale in the markets of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City, today). 

The first Italian recipe of tomato sauce was published under the name &quot;Spanish tomato sauce&quot; in &quot;Lo Scalco alla Moderna&quot; (&#x27;The Modern Steward&#x27;), written by Italian chef Antonio Latini and published in two volumes in 1692 and 1694. Tomato sauce also began to be used in the cuisine of the south of France at the same time, particularly in Provence and the Basque Country. The Provençals who went to Paris for the National Federation Day of July 14, 1790, demanded tomatoes everywhere they went. The use of tomato sauce with pasta appeared for the first time in 1790 in the Italian cookbook &quot;L&#x27;Apicio moderno&quot;, by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi. 

The first written recipe for canned tomatoes comes from Vaucluse, in southern France, it appears in a document written by an individual in 1795.

==Cooked tomato sauces==

A simple tomato sauce consists of chopped or ground tomatoes sautéed in olive oil and simmered until they lose their raw flavor, seasoned to taste with salt, or other herbs or spices. Tomato skins and seeds are generally removed.

Tomato sauce may be thinner than the tomato purée it may be made from. It may serve as an ingredient in other dishes, such as spaghetti and meatballs.

Water or a more flavorful liquid such as stock or wine is sometimes added to keep the sauce from becoming too thick while simmering. Onion and garlic are often sweated or sautéed before the tomatoes are added, or puréed together with tomatoes and then cooked together. Other seasonings typically include dried red chili flakes, epazote, basil, oregano, parsley, and black pepper.

Many meat-based sauces include tomatoes, such as &quot;ragù alla napoletana&quot;; in the Italian version of &quot;ragù alla bolognese&quot;, tomato is a relatively minor ingredient.

==Raw tomato sauces==
In Italy, there are many pasta sauces based on raw, uncooked tomatoes. In Mexico, the best-known raw tomato sauce is &quot;pico de gallo&quot;, also known as &quot;salsa cruda&quot;.

In France, raw tomato sauce is known as &quot;saoussoun&quot; in the Alpes-Maritimes. Sauce vierge is another French sauce made from raw tomato, basil, lemon juice and olive oil, a bit similar to mexican pico de gallo.

==Varieties==

===Mexico===

Tomato sauce was an ancient condiment in Mesoamerican food. The first person to write about what may have been a tomato sauce was Bernardino de Sahagún, a Spanish Franciscan friar who later moved to New Spain, who made note of a prepared sauce that was offered for sale in the markets of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City today). He wrote (translated from Spanish), Spaniards later brought the use of tomatoes to Europe.

Basic Mexican tomato sauce was traditionally prepared using a &quot;molcajete&quot; to puree the tomatoes. Food that is cooked in tomato sauce is known as &quot;entomatada&quot;. Tomato sauce is used as a base for spicy sauces and &quot;moles&quot;.

===Italy===

Tomato sauce in Italian cuisine is first mentioned in Antonio Latini&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Lo scalco alla moderna&quot; (Naples, 1692). Latini was chef to the Spanish viceroy of Naples, and one of his tomato recipes is for sauce &quot;in the Spanish style&quot; (). The first known use of tomato sauce with pasta appears in the Italian cookbook &quot;L&#x27;Apicio moderno&quot;, by the Roman chef Francesco Leonardi, published in 1790.

Italian tomato dishes range from simple &quot;pasta al pomodoro&quot; to the piquant &quot;puttanesca&quot; and &quot;arrabbiata&quot; sauces. Tomato-based sauces for pasta may also include sausage, clams, pancetta cubes, tuna, or vegetables. 

Tomato-garlic sauce is prepared using tomatoes as a main ingredient, and is used in various cuisines and dishes. In Italian cuisine, &quot;alla pizzaiola&quot; is tomato-garlic sauce, which is used on pizza, pasta and meats.

===France===
 is one of the five mother sauces of classical French cooking, as codified by Auguste Escoffier in the early 20th century. It consists of salt belly of pork, onions, bay leaves, thyme, tomato purée or fresh tomatoes, roux, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper. 

Basic cooked tomato sauce, with garlic and olive oil is also a classic in the cuisine of southern France, it is used in many dishes like piperade, tian, &quot;chichoumeille&quot;, &quot;alouettes sans têtes&quot; (a kind of paupiette).

Tomato sauce can also be served raw, in this case it is named &quot;saoussoun (&quot;grated raw tomato with onions, olive oil and herbs) or sauce vierge (diced raw tomato with olive oil, lemon , garlic and basil).

===Australia, New Zealand and South Africa===
 Tomato sauce is a popular, commercially produced table sauce, similar to tomato ketchup, which is typically applied to foods such as meat pies, sausages, and fish and chips. Some sources say that Australian tomato sauce has less tomato than ketchup, but this varies between brands. 

Tomato-based sauces served with pasta are commonly referred to as &quot;pasta sauce&quot; or &quot;Napoletana sauce&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
The meaning of the term &quot;tomato sauce&quot; depends on the context; on a restaurant menu the phrase &quot;in a tomato sauce&quot; means a freshly prepared tomato-based sauce as used on pasta, and colloquially it may refer to either the pasta sauce, or tomato ketchup. &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; lists the term as &quot;another name for tomato ketchup&quot; in British English.

===Canada and United States===


In Canada and the U.S., tomato sauce is typically sold jarred or canned, with minimal ingredients, and is not normally used as is. Related ingredients are tomato purée and tomato paste, each of which is similar but paste has a thicker consistency. Tomato purée and tomato paste have US FDA standards of identity (since 1939) for percentage of tomato solids, and historically did not contain seasonings other than salt; in recent decades variants with basil or other traditional Italian seasonings became common. Tomato sauce is non-standardized.

====Louisiana====
A spicy tomato sauce known as &quot;sauce piquante&quot; is common in Louisiana Cajun cuisine, that can contain any seafood, poultry, or meats such as wild game. It is typically served over white rice. In Louisiana Creole cuisine, there is a tomato sauce known as a Creole sauce. It is similar to Italian tomato sauce, but features more Louisiana flavors derived from the fusion of French and Spanish cooking styles. They both usually contain the traditional holy trinity of diced bell pepper, onion, and celery.

====Tomato gravy====
&quot;Tomato gravy&quot; is distinct from the term as used by Italian Americans when referring to a type of tomato sauce particularly where tomatoes were a staple food. The cooked tomatoes, some fat (usually cured pork fat) and flour are cooked together until thick, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Onions or bell peppers may be added as well. Typically, tomato gravy is served over pasta.

====Sunday gravy====
Common in Italian American cuisine is a tomato-based sauce called &quot;Sunday gravy&quot; or &quot;Sunday sauce&quot;, which can be prepared with a variety of meats.

===India===
Some Indian curries have a tomato-based sauce, notably many vegetarian style dishes.

<text>In medicine, triage (, ; ) is a process by which care providers such as medical professionals and those with first aid knowledge determine the order of priority for providing treatment to injured individuals and/or inform the rationing of limited supplies so that they go to those who can most benefit from it. Triage is usually relied upon when there are more injured individuals than available care providers (known as a mass casualty incident), or when there are more injured individuals than supplies to treat them.

The methodologies of triage vary by institution, locality, and country but have the same universal underlying concepts. In most cases, the triage process places the most injured and most able to be helped as the first priority, with the most terminally injured the last priority (except in the case of reverse triage). Triage systems vary dramatically based on a variety of factors, and can follow specific, measurable metrics, like trauma scoring systems, or can be based on the medical opinion of the provider. Triage is an imperfect practice, and can be largely subjective, especially when based on general opinion rather than a score. This is because triage needs to balance multiple and sometimes contradictory objectives simultaneously, most of them being fundamental to personhood: likelihood of death, efficacy of treatment, patients&#x27; remaining lifespan, ethics, and religion.

== Etymology and origin ==
The term &quot;triage&quot; comes directly from French, where the term means to pick or to sort, it itself coming from the Old French verb , meaning to separate, sort, shift, or select; with in turn came from late Latin tritare, to grind. Although the concept existed much earlier, at least as far back as the reign of Maximillian I, it was not until the 1800s that the Old French trier was used to describe the practice of triage. That year, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, the Surgeon in Chief of Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard laid the groundwork for what would eventually become modern triage introducing the concept of &quot;treat[ing] the wounded according to the observed gravity of their injuries and the urgency for medical care, regardless of their rank or nationality&quot;.

== Concepts in triage ==

=== Simple triage ===
Simple triage is usually used in a scene of an accident or &quot;mass-casualty incident&quot; (MCI), in order to sort patients into those who need critical attention and immediate transport to a secondary or tertiary care facility to survive, those who require low-intensity care to survive, those who are uninjured, and those who are deceased or will be so imminently. In the United States, this most commonly takes the form of the START triage model, in Canada, the CTAS model, and in Australia the ATS model. Assessment often begins with asking anyone who can walk to walk to a designated area, labeling them the lowest priority, and assessing other patients from there. Upon completion of the initial assessment by the care provider, which is based on the so-called ABCDE approach, patients are generally labelled with their available information, including &quot;patient’s name, gender, injuries, interventions, care-provider IDs, casualty triage score, and an easily visible overall triage category&quot;.

==== ABCDE Assessment ====

An ABCDE assessment (other variations include ABC, ABCD, ABCDEF, and many others, including those localized to non-English) is rapid patient assessment designed to check bodily function in order of importance.
==== Tags ====


A triage tag is a premade label placed on each patient that serves to accomplish several objectives:
* identify the patient.
* bear record of assessment findings.
* identify the priority of the patient&#x27;s need for medical treatment and transport from the emergency scene.
* track the patients&#x27; progress through the triage process.
* identify additional hazards such as contamination.

Triage tags take a variety of forms. Some countries use a nationally standardized triage tag, while in other countries commercially available triage tags are used, which vary by jurisdictional choice. In some cases, international organizations also have standardized tags, as is the case with NATO. The most commonly used commercial systems include the METTAG, the SMARTTAG, E/T LIGHT and the CRUCIFORM systems. More advanced tagging systems incorporate special markers to indicate whether or not patients have been contaminated by hazardous materials, and also tear off strips for tracking the movement of patients through the process.

=== Advanced triage ===
In advanced triage, those with advanced training, such as doctors, nurses and paramedics make further care determinations based on more in-depth assessments, and may make use of advanced diagnostics like CT scans. This can also be a form of secondary triage, where the evaluation occurs at a secondary location like a hospital, or after the arrival of more qualified care providers.

=== Reverse triage ===

There are a three primary concepts referred to as Reverse Triage. The first is concerned with the discharge of patients from hospital often to prepare for an incoming mass casualty. The second concept of Reverse Triage is utilized for certain conditions such as lightning injuries, where those appearing to be dead may be treated ahead of other patients, as they can typically be resuscitated successfully. The third is the concept of treating the least injured, often to return them to functional capability. This approach originated in the military, where returning combatants to the theatre of war may lead to overall victory (and survivability).

=== Undertriage and overtriage ===
Undertriage is underestimating the severity of an illness or injury. An example of this would be categorizing a Priority 1 (Immediate) patient as a Priority 2 (Delayed) or Priority 3 (Minimal). The rate of undertriage generally varies by the location of the triage, with a 2014 review of triage practices in emergency rooms finding that in-hospital undertriaging occurred 34% of the time in the United States, while reviews of pre-hospital triage finding undertriage rates of 14%.

Overtriage is the overestimating of the severity of an illness or injury. An example of this would be categorizing a Priority 3 (Minimal) patient as a Priority 2 (Delayed) or Priority 1 (Immediate). Acceptable overtriage rates have been typically up to 50% in an effort to avoid undertriage. Some studies suggest that overtriage is less likely to occur when triaging is performed by hospital medical teams, rather than paramedics or EMTs.

=== Telephone triage ===
In telephone triage, care providers like nurses assess symptoms and medical history, and make a care recommendation over the phone. A review of available literature found that these services provide accurate and safe information about 90% of the time.

=== Palliative care ===
In triage, palliative care takes on a wider applicability, as some conditions which may be survivable outside of extreme circumstances become unsurvivable due to the nature of a mass casualty incident. For these patients, as well as those who are deemed to be unsavable, palliative care can mean the difference of a painful death, and a relatively peaceful one. During the COVID-19 pandemic issues of palliative care in triage became more obvious as some countries were forced to deny care to large groups of individuals due to lack of supplies and ventilators.

=== Evacuation ===
In the field, evacuation of all casualties is the ultimate goal, so that the site of the incident can ultimately be cleared, if necessary investigated, and eventually rendered safe. Additional considerations must be made to avoid overwhelming local resources, and in some extreme cases, this can mean evacuating some patients to other countries.

=== Alternative care facilities ===
Alternative care facilities are places that are set up for the care of large numbers of patients, or are places that could be so set up. Examples include schools, sports stadiums, and large camps that can be prepared and used for the care, feeding, and holding of large numbers of victims of a mass casualty or other type of event. Such improvised facilities are generally developed in cooperation with the local hospital, which sees them as a strategy for creating surge capacity. While hospitals remain the preferred destination for all patients, during a mass casualty event such improvised facilities may be required in order to divert low-acuity patients away from hospitals in order to prevent the hospitals becoming overwhelmed.

== Pre-modern history of triage ==
=== The Edwin Smith Papyrus ===
The general concept was first described in a 17th-century BCE Egyptian document, the Edwin Smith Papyrus. Discovered in 1862, outside of modern-day Luxor, Egypt, the Edwin Smith Papyrus contains descriptions of the assessment and treatment of a multitude of medical conditions, and divides injuries into three categories:

# &quot;A medical condition I can heal&quot;
# &quot;A medical condition I intend to fight with.&quot;
# &quot;A medical condition that cannot be healed.&quot;

=== The Holy Roman Empire ===
During the reign of Emperor Maximilian I, during wartime, a policy was implemented where soldiers were prioritized over all others in hospitals, and the sickest soldiers received treatment first.

== Modern history of triage ==
=== Napoleonic triage ===
Modern triage grew out of the work of Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey and Pierre-François Percy during the reign of Napoleon. Larrey in particular introduced the concept of a &quot;flying ambulance&quot; (flying in this case meaning rapidly moving) or in its native French, Ambulance Volante.

=== World War I ===
In 1914, Antoine Depage developed the five-tiered &quot;Ordre de Triage&quot;, a triage system which set specific benchmarks on evacuation, described staged evacuation. French and Belgian doctors began using these concepts to inform the treatment of casualties at aid stations behind the front. Those responsible for the removal of the wounded from a battlefield or their care afterwards would divide the victims into three categories:

* Those who are likely to live, regardless of what care they receive;
* Those who are unlikely to live, regardless of what care they receive;
* Those for whom immediate care may make a positive difference in outcome.
From that delineation, aid workers would follow the &quot;Ordre de Triage&quot;:

==== First Order of Triage ====

In the first order of triage, the injured would be evacuated to clearing stations in the night, when darkness offered maximum protection from the German forces.

==== Second Order of Triage ====
Once at a casualty clearing station, wounds were dressed, and anyone requiring immediate surgical intervention was placed in a cart and brought immediately to an ambulance pickup area. If the wounded could wait, they would be evacuated by ambulance during the night.

==== Third Order of Triage ====
Ambulances, driven by YMCA and American Red Cross trained drivers then removed the casualties to mobile surgical centers, called &quot;postes avances des hospitaux du front&quot; or outposts of the frontline hospitals.

==== Fourth Order of Triage ====
At the mobile surgical hospitals, the most severe cases were treated, specifically those who were likely to die before reaching a permanent, more equipped hospital. Anyone who could survive the trip was transported to a farther away, often costal, hospital.

==== Fifth Order of Triage ====
Upon reaching a permanent hospital, casualties received appropriate care to treat all of their injuries.

=== World War II ===
By the onset of World War II, American and British forces had adopted and adapted triage, with other global powers doing the same. The increased availability of airplanes allowed rapid evacuation to a hospital outside of the warzone to become a part of the triage process. Although the basic practices remained the same as in World War I, with initial evacuation to an aid station, followed by transitions to higher levels of care, and eventual admission to a permanent hospital, more advanced care was provided at each stage, and the mindset of treating only what was absolutely necessary fell away. Although triage almost certainly occurred in the days after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the pandemonium caused by the attack left records of such action non-existent until after the fifth day, at which point they are largely without historical use. 
=== The Texas City disaster (1947) ===
In 1947, the Texas City Disaster occurred when the SS Grandcamp exploded in Texas City, Texas, killing 600 people and injuring thousands more. The entire fire department was killed in the blast, and what followed was a massive informal triage of the victims. Drug stores, clinics, and homes were opened as makeshift triage stations. As the city has no hospital, they had to evacuate casualties to area facilities, including those in Galveston and Houston, with at least one doctor relying on skills he had learned in World War II to inform care decisions.

=== The Korean War ===
The Korean War saw the advent of the tiered triage, wherein care providers sorted people into categories defined ahead of time. These categories, immediate, delayed, minimal and expectant are still the basis for most triage systems today. The time period was also marked by improvements in medical understanding, including shock, which allowed effective interventions to be administered earlier in the Triage process, which in turn significantly improved outcomes. At the same time, Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) were introduced along with helicopters for evacuation. These helicopters, however were used for evacuation only, and care was not provided in the air during the evacuation. These advances reduced fatalities for injured soldiers by up to 30%, and changed the nature of battlefield medicine significantly.

=== The Vietnam War ===
The conditions of the Vietnam War drove further development on the concepts created during the Korean War. Advances in helicopters allowed the introduction of the first helicopter medics, who were able to provide fluid resuscitation, and other interventions mid-flight. This made it so that the average time from injury to definitive care was less than two hours. This evolution also flowed into the everyday life, with air ambulances emerging in the civilian world by the mid-1960&#x27;s. The use of triage in emergency departments and ambulance services also quickly followed.

=== The World Trade Center bombing (1993) ===
In 1993, the north tower of the World Trade Center was bombed, in a plot with a similar intended outcome as the later September 11th attacks. While search, rescue and triage operations immediately following were ordinary, the attack itself represented one of the first terrorist attacks affecting the United States directly. The fact that the U.S. was no longer seen as untouchable, along with the later Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, and the September 11th attack lead to long term changes in triage practices to be more focused on operational safety and the risk of secondary attacks designed to kill care providers.

=== Matsumato sarin attack (1994) ===
In June 1994, emergency crews began responding to calls related to symptoms of toxic gas exposure in a neighborhood. Without proper personal protective equipment, more than 253 residents were evacuated and 50 were hospitalized. 20 vehicles were called to the scene, and a mobile operating center was setup nearby, likely within the zone of contamination. Unaware of the presence of Sarin, triage was performed following the standard system of the time, which ultimately resulted in eight care givers experiencing mild sarin poisoning, and an unknown amount of additional staff experiencing general malaise.

At the time, no decontamination procedures or gas masks were available for incidents involving contaminants. In response, the Japan Self-Defense Forces created a decontamination team, which was then instrumental to the response of the Tokyo subway sarin attack which occurred only seven months later.

=== Triage in the present day ===

As medical technology has advanced, so have modern approaches to triage, which are increasingly based on scientific models. The categorizations of the victims are frequently the result of triage scores based on specific physiological assessment findings. Some models, such as the START model may be algorithm-based. As triage concepts become more sophisticated, and to improve patient safety and quality of care, several human-in-the-loop decision-support tools have been designed on top of triage systems to standardize and automate the triage process (e.g., eCTAS, NHS 111) in both hospitals and the field. Moreover, the recent development of new machine learning methods offers the possibility to learn optimal triage policies from data and in time could replace or improve upon expert-crafted models.

==Specific triage systems and methods ==

Most simply, the general purpose of triage is to sort patients by level of acuity to inform care decisions; so that the most people possible can be saved. Although a multitude of systems, color codes, codewords, and categories exist to help direct it, in all cases, triage follows the same basic process. In all systems, patients are first assessed for injuries, then, they are categorized based on the severity of those injuries. Although the number of categories differs from system to system, all have at least three in common; high severity, low severity, and deceased. Some systems involve features like scoring systems, such as the Revised Trauma Score, the Injury Severity Score, and the Trauma and Injury Severity Score, the latter of which has been shown to be most effective at determining outcome.

=== Triage Systems by Methodology ===

==== S.T.A.R.T. model ====

S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) is a simple triage system that can be performed by lightly trained lay and emergency personnel in emergencies. It was developed at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, California for use by emergency services in 1983.

Triage separates the injured into four groups:

* The &quot;expectant&quot; who are beyond help
* The injured who can be helped by &quot;immediate&quot; transportation
* The injured whose transport can be &quot;delayed&quot;
* Those with &quot;minor&quot; injuries who need help less urgently

Triage also sets priorities for evacuation and transport as follows:

* &quot;Deceased&quot; are left where they fell. These include those who are not breathing and repositioning their airway efforts were unsuccessful.
* &quot;Immediate&quot; or Priority 1 (red) evacuation to a medical facility as they need advanced medical care at once or within one hour. These people are in critical condition and would die without immediate assistance.
* &quot;Delayed&quot; or Priority 2 (yellow) can have their medical evacuation delayed until all &quot;immediate&quot; people have been transported. These people are in stable condition but require medical assistance.
* &quot;Minor&quot; or Priority 3 (green) are not evacuated until all &quot;immediate&quot; and &quot;delayed&quot; persons have been evacuated. These will not need advanced medical care for at least several hours. Continue to re-triage in case their condition worsens. These people are able to walk and may only need bandages and antiseptic.

==== JumpSTART triage ====

The JumpSTART pediatric triage MCI triage tool is a variation of the S.T.A.R.T. model. Both systems are used to sort patients into categories at mass casualty incidents (MCIs). However, JumpSTART was designed specifically for triaging children in disaster settings. Though JumpSTART was developed for use in children from infancy to age 8, where age is not immediately obvious, it is used in any patient who appears to be a child (patients who appear to be young adults are triaged using START).

=== Triage Systems by Country ===

==== Australia and New Zealand ====
In hospital settings, Australia and New Zealand rely on the &quot;Australasian Triage Scale&quot; (abbreviated &quot;ATS&quot; and formally known as the &quot;National Triage Scale&quot;). The scale has been in use since 1994. The scale consists of 5 levels, with 1 being the most critical (resuscitation), and 5 being the least critical (nonurgent).

In field settings, various standardized triage systems are used, and there is no area wide standard.

==== Canada ====
In 1995, the CAEP Triage and Acuity scale was launched in Canada relying on a simplified version of the Australian National Triage Scale. This scale used three categories, emergent, urgent, and non-urgent. This scale was deprecated in 1999 with the introduction of the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), which is used across the country to sort incoming patients. The system categorizes patients by both injury and physiological findings, and ranks them by severity from 1–5 (1 being highest). The model is not currently used for mass casualty triage, and instead the START protocol and METTAG triage tags is used.
==== France ====
In France, the Prehospital triage in case of a disaster uses a multi-tier scale:
* &quot;Décédé&quot; (deceased), or &quot;urgence dépassée&quot; (beyond urgency)
* &quot;Extrême urgence (extreme urgency):&quot; requiring care within a half hour. 
* &quot;Urgence absolue&quot; (absolute urgency): requiring care within an hour.
* &quot;Urgence relative&quot; (relative urgency): requiring care, but not immediately.
* &quot;Blessé léger&quot; (slightly injured)
* &quot;Impliqué&quot; (involved, but not directly injured)
This triage is performed by a physician called &quot;médecin trieur&quot; (sorting medic).

==== Germany ====
The German triage system uses four color codes:
==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, triage in Accident &amp; Emergency Departments is performed by experienced registered nurses, patients are divided into five triage categories: &quot;Critical&quot;, &quot;Emergency&quot;, &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Semi-urgent&quot; and &quot;Non-urgent&quot;. In mass casualty incidents, the START triage system is used.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, the triage system is mainly used by health professionals. The categories of triage, in corresponding color codes, are:
* : Used for viable victims with potentially life-threatening conditions.
* : Used for victims with non-life-threatening injuries, but who urgently require treatment.
* : Used for victims with minor injuries that do not require ambulance transport.
* : Used for victims who are dead, or whose injuries make survival unlikely.

==== Singapore ====
All public hospitals in Singapore use the Patient Acuity Category Scale (PACS) to triage patient in Emergency Departement. PACS is a symptom-based differential diagnosis approach that triages patients according to their presenting complaints and objective assessments such as vital signs and Glasgow Coma Scale, allowing acute patients to be identified quickly for treatment. PACS classifies patients into four main categories: P1, P2, P3, and P4.
In mass casualty incidents, the START triage system is used.

==== Spain ====
In Spain, there are 2 models which are the most common found in hospitals around the country:
* The Sistema Estructurado de Triaje (SET), which is an adaptation of the Model Andorrà de Triatge (MAT). The system uses 650 reasons for medical appointment in 32 symptomatic categories, that together with some patient information and basic exploratory data, classifies the emergency within 5 levels of urgency. 
* The &quot;Manchester&quot;, based on the system with the same name in the UK, use 51 reasons for consultation. Through some yes/no questions, addressed in a diagram, it classifies the emergency in 5 severities.
In mass casualty incidents, the &quot;Modelo Extrahospitalario de Triaje Avanzado&quot; (META)/Advanced Triage Out of Hospital Model system is used. META is a seven-stage system, classifying patients as: Red 1st, Red 2nd, Red 3rd, Yellow 1st, Yellow 2nd, Green, and Deceased. The system aligns with the ABCDE framework.
==== United Kingdom ====
In April 2023, the NHS and ambulance services adopted two new triage tools to be used in major incidents, replacing the NASMeD Triage Sieve. These new tools resulted from a multi-stakeholder review led by the NHS but its implementation became more urgent after the Manchester Arena Inquiry made it a monitored recommendation for the NHS and National Ambulance Resilience Unit to adopt.

===== Ten Second Triage Tool =====
The Ten Second Triage Tool (TST) was introduced as a way for all emergency services, including the police and fire service, to assess and prioritise mass casualties to provide lifesaving intervention. The tool allows for rapid assessment by removing the need to measure physiological vital signs focusing on what the emergency responder can see.

* – Patients who have catastrophic bleeding, a penetrating injury or those who are unconscious
* – Patients who are unable to walk but are conscious
* – Patients who are able to walk
* – Patients who are not breathing (this replaces the deceased category)

===== NHS Major Incident Triage Tool =====
The Major Incident Triage Tool (MITT) serves as the more advanced triage tool for emergency medial responders to triage casualties. The tool, derived from the Modified Physiological Triage Tool, can be used on both adults and children, and also includes the assessment of physiological vital signs.

* – Life-threatening injury 
* – Unconscious but breathing
* – Non-life-threatening injury
* – No signs of life or non-survivable injury

==== United States ====
A multitude of triage systems exist in the United States, and there is no national standard. Among local, regional, state, and interstate systems, the START triage method is most commonly used.

===== United States Armed Forces =====
The U.S. armed forced utilize a four-stage system, A battlefield situation, care providers rank casualties for precedence, treat those who they can safely, and transport casualties who need it to a higher level of care, either a Forward Surgical Team or Combat Support Hospital.

The triage categories (with corresponding color codes), in order of priority, are:
== Limitations of current practices ==
Notions of mass casualty triage as an efficient rationing process of determining priority based upon injury severity are not supported by research, evaluation and testing of current triage practices, which lack scientific and methodological bases. START and START-like (START) triage that use color-coded categories to prioritize provide poor assessments of injury severity and then leave it to providers to subjectively order and allocate resources within flawed categories. Some of these limitations include:
* lacking the clear goal of maximizing the number of lives saved, as well as the focus, design and objective methodology to accomplish that goal (a protocol of taking the worst Immediate – lowest chances for survival – first can be statistically invalid and dangerous)
* using trauma measures that are problematic (e.g., capillary refill) and grouping into broad color-coded categories that are not in accordance with injury severities, medical evidence and needs. Categories do not differentiate among injury severities and survival probabilities, and are invalid based on categorical definitions and evacuation priorities
* ordering (prioritization) and allocating resources subjectively within Immediate and Delayed categories, which are neither reproducible nor scalable, with little chance of being optimal
* not considering/addressing size of incident, resources, and injury severities and prioritization within its categories – e.g., protocol does not change whether 3, 30 or 3,000 casualties require its use, and regardless of available resources to be rationed
* not considering differences in injury severities and survival probabilities between types of trauma (blunt versus penetrating, etc.) and ages
* resulting in inconsistent tagging and prioritizing/ordering of casualties and substantial overtriage

Research indicates there are wide ranges and overlaps of survival probabilities of the Immediate and Delayed categories, and other START limitations. The same physiologic measures can have markedly different survival probabilities for blunt and penetrating injuries. For example, a START Delayed (second priority) can have a survival probability of 63% for blunt trauma and a survival probability of 32% for penetrating trauma with the same physiological measures – both with expected rapid deterioration, while a START Immediate (first priority) can have survival probabilities that extend to above 95% with expected slow deterioration. Age categories exacerbate this. For example, a geriatric patient with a penetrating injury in the Delayed category can have an 8% survival probability, and a pediatric patient in the Immediate category can have a 98% survival probability. Issues with the other START categories have also been noted. In this context, color-coded tagging accuracy metrics are not scientifically meaningful.

Poor assessments, invalid categories, no objective methodology and tools for prioritizing casualties and allocating resources, and a protocol of worst first triage provide some challenges for emergency and disaster preparedness and response. These are clear obstacles for efficient triage and resource rationing, for maximizing savings of lives, for best practices and National Incident Management System (NIMS) compatibilities, and for effective response planning and training.

Inefficient triage also provides challenges in containing health care costs and waste. Field triage is based upon the notion of up to 50% overtriage as being acceptable. There have been no cost-benefit analyses of the costs and mitigation of triage inefficiencies embedded in the healthcare system. Such analyses are often required for healthcare grants funded by taxpayers, and represent normal engineering and management science practice. These inefficiencies relate to the following cost areas:
* tremendous investment in time and money since 9/11 to develop and improve responders&#x27; triage skills
* cited benefits from standardization of triage methodology, reproducibility and interoperability, and NIMS compatibilities
* avoided capital costs for taxpayer investment in additional EMS and trauma infrastructure
* wasteful daily resource utilization and increased operating costs from acceptance of substantial levels of overtriage
* prescribed values of a statistical life and estimated savings in human lives that could reasonably be expected using evidence-based triage practices
* ongoing performance improvements that could reasonably be expected from a more objective optimization-based triage system and practices

==Ethical considerations==
Because treatment is intentionally delayed or withheld from individuals under this system, triage has ethical implications that complicate the decision-making process. Individuals involved in triage must take a comprehensive view of the process to ensure fidelity, veracity, justice, autonomy, and beneficence are safeguarded.

Ethical implications vary between different settings and the type of triage system employed, culminating in no single gold-standard approach to triage. Emergency departments are advised to preemptively plan strategies in attempts to mitigate the emotional burden on these triage responders. While doing so, standards of care must be maintained to preserve the safety of both patients and providers.

There is widespread agreement among ethicists that, in practice, during the COVID-19 pandemic triage should prioritize &quot;those who have the best chance of surviving&quot; and follow guidelines with strict criteria that consider both short-term and long-term survivability. Likewise, the triage of other health services has been adjusted during the pandemic to limit resource strain on hospitals.

=== Utilitarian approach and critique ===
Under the utilitarian model, triage works to maximize the survival outcomes of the most people possible. This approach implies that some individuals may likely suffer or die, in order for the majority to survive. Triage officers must allocate limited resources and weigh an individual&#x27;s needs along with the needs of the population as a whole.

Some ethicists argue the utilitarian approach to triage is not an impartial mechanism, but rather a partial one that fails to address the social conditions that prevent optimal outcomes in marginalized communities, rendering it a practical but inadequate means of distributing health resources.

=== Special population groups ===
There is wide discussion regarding how VIPs and celebrities should be cared for in the emergency department. It is generally argued that giving special considerations or deviating from the standard medical protocol for VIPs or celebrities is unethical due to the cost to others. However, others argue that it may be morally justifiable as long as their treatment does not hinder the needs of others after assessing overall fairness, quality of care, privacy, and other ethical implications.

=== Proposed frameworks in conflict ===
A variety of logistical challenges complicate the triage and ultimate provision of care in conflict situations. Humanitarian actors acknowledge challenges like disruptions in food and medical supply chains, lack of suitable facilities, and existence of policies that prohibit administration of care to certain communities and populations as elements that directly impede the successful delivery of care. The logistical realities of humanitarian emergencies and conflict situations threatens the bioethical principle of beneficence, the obligation to act for the benefit of others.

=== Technical challenges of triage in conflict settings ===
To address the ethical concerns that underpin triage in conflict situations and humanitarian crises, new triage frameworks and classification systems have been suggested that aim to uphold human rights. Scholars have argued that new frameworks must prioritize informed consent and rely on established medical criteria only in order to respect the human rights considerations set forth by the Geneva Convention of 1864 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but no comprehensive triage model has been adopted by international bodies.

=== Veterinary triage===
Emergency veterinarian Jessica Fragola wrote in 2022 about the ethics of animal triage. She said that pressures on veterinarians having been exacerbated by staffing shortages that resulted from the Covid pandemic, coupled with growth in spending on veterinary care and on pet insurance.

<doc id="30925" wikidata="Q1258710" url="?curid=30925" title="Tolstoy family">
<text>The House of Tolstoy, or Tolstoi (), is a family of Russian gentry that acceded to the high aristocracy of the Russian Empire. The name &quot;Tolstoy&quot; is itself derived from the Russian adjective ( ). They are the descendants of Andrey Kharitonovich Tolstoy (&quot;the Fat&quot;), who moved from Chernigov to Moscow and served under Vasily II of Moscow in the 15th century. The &quot;wild Tolstoys&quot;, as they were known in the high society of Imperial Russia, have left a lasting legacy in Russian politics, military history, literature, and fine arts. The most famous member of the family is the author Leo Tolstoy.

==Origins==
The Tolstoys were a family of provincial Muscovite gentry who claimed their ancestry to a mythical Lithuanian nobleman named Indris stated by Pyotr Tolstoy as supposedly having arrived from the Holy Roman Empire to Chernigov in 1353, the very year when the city became part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, together with his two sons Litvinos (or Litvonis, &quot;Lithuanian&quot;) and Zimonten (or Zigmont, or &quot;Samogitian&quot;) and a druzhina of 3000 men. Litvonis and Zimonten possibly refer to the two main parts of Lithuania at the time - Samogitia was considered administratively separate from Lithuania Proper (in the narrow sense) for much of history. Indris was then supposedly converted to Eastern Orthodoxy as Leonty and his sons — as Konstantin and Feodor, respectively; adopting religion of the locals was typical of Lithuanian nobility at the time and characteristic of the Lithuanian style of governing. Konstantin&#x27;s grandson, Andrei Kharitonovich, was nicknamed Tolstiy (translated as &quot;fat&quot;) by Vasily II of Moscow after he moved from Chernigov to Moscow.

Because of the pagan names and the fact that Chernigov at the time was ruled by Demetrius I Starshy some research concluded that they were Lithuanians who arrived from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then in conflict with the State of the Teutonic Order. At the same time, no mention of Indris was ever found in the 14-16th century documents, while the Chernigov Chronicles used by Pyotr Tolstoy as a reference were lost. The first documented members of the Tolstoy family also lived in the 17th century. House of Durnovo is a side branch of the Tolstoy family. Pyotr Tolstoy is the founder of the titled branch of the family; he was granted the title of count by Peter the Great. The untitled branch of the same stem is descended from Ivan Andreevich Tolstoy. Their common ancestor was Andrey Vasilievich Tolstoy, who married Stepanida Andreevna Miloslavskaya, a cousin of the tsarina. This marriage had allowed the average gentry family to enter the Moscow court. The Tolstoy family is also found amongst untitled provincial gentry of the same origins.

==In the Napoleonic wars==

Two members of the family were active during the Napoleonic wars. Count Pyotr Aleksandrovich Tolstoy (1761–1844) served under Suvorov in wars against Poland and the Ottoman Empire, was made a general-adjutant in 1797, went as an ambassador to Paris in 1807 and tried to persuade Alexander I to prepare for the war against France, without much success though. He served as the governor of St Petersburg and Kronstadt from 1828 until his death.

Alexander Ivanovich Tolstoy (1770–1857), stemming from a collateral branch of the family, inherited the comital title and estates of his childless uncle, the last of the Ostermanns.

He first distinguished himself in the Battle of Czarnowo on the night and following morning of 23–24 December 1806, where under his command the 2nd Division of the Russian Army in Poland held out for fifteen hours against the whole army commanded by Napoleon. One of the most admired generals of the anti-Napoleonic coalition, he was rewarded for his courage in the battles at Pultusk and Eylau. At Guttstadt he was wounded so seriously that they feared for his life. In the great battle of Borodino he brilliantly commanded the key positions until he was shell-shocked and taken away from the battlefield. Ostermann-Tolstoy was once again wounded in the battle of Bautzen (1813) but did not give up command of his force. His crowning achievement was the victory at Kulm (August 30, 1813), which cost him amputation of the left arm. When the war was over, he quarreled with the Emperor, resigned and spent the rest of his life in Europe.

==In high society==

Count Feodor Petrovich Tolstoy (1783–1873), sympathetically mentioned by Pushkin in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, was one of the most fashionable Russian drawers and painters of the 1820s. Although he prepared fine illustrations for Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;Dushenka&quot;, his genuine vocation was wax modeling and the design of medals. As he gradually went blind he had to give up drawing and started writing ballets and librettos for operas. He was appointed Vice-President of the Academy of Arts in 1828. Many of his works may be seen in the Russian Museum, St Petersburg.

Count Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy (1782–1846) was a notorious drunkard, gastronome, and duellist. It is said that he killed 11 people in duels. In 1803 he participated in the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth. After he had his body tattooed at the Marquesas and debauched all the crew, captain Krusenstern had to maroon him on the Aleutian Islands near Kamchatka. When he returned to St Petersburg, Count Fedor was nicknamed &quot;Amerikanets&quot; (&quot;the American&quot;). He fought bravely in the Patriotic War of 1812 but scandalized his family again by marrying a Gypsy singer in 1821. Alexander Griboyedov satirized him in &quot;Woe from Wit&quot;, and his cousin Leo Tolstoy — who called him an &quot;extraordinary, criminal, and attractive man&quot; — fictionalized him as Dolokhov in &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

==In Russian literature==
Many of the Tolstoys devoted their spare time to literary pursuits. For instance, Count Alexei Konstantinovich (1817–75) was a courtier but also one of the most popular Russian poets of his time. He wrote admirable ballads, a historical novel, some licentious verse, and satires published under the penname of Kozma Prutkov. His lasting contribution to the Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas, modelled after Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;.
Count Lev Nikolaevich (1828–1910), more widely known abroad as Leo Tolstoy, is acclaimed as one of the greatest novelists of all time. After he started his career in the military, he was first drawn to writing books when he served in Chechenya, and already his first story, &quot;Detstvo&quot; (&quot;Childhood&quot;), was something quite unlike anything written before him. It was in his family estate Yasnaya Polyana near Tula that he created two novels, &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, that are widely acclaimed as among the best novels ever written. Later he developed a kind of non-traditional Christian philosophy, described in his work &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot; which inspired Rainer Maria Rilke and Mohandas Gandhi, then a young lawyer, whose influence extended to Martin Luther King Jr. and James Bevel.

Of Lev&#x27;s thirteen children, most spent their life either promoting his teachings or denouncing them. His youngest daughter and secretary, Alexandra Lvovna (1884–1979), had a particularly troubled life. Although she shared with her father the doctrine of nonviolence, she felt it was her duty to take part in the events of World War I.

Count Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1883–1945) belonged to a different branch of the family. His early short stories, published in 1910s, were panned by critics for excessive naturalism and wanton eroticism. After the Revolution he briefly emigrated to Germany, but then changed his political views and returned to the Soviet Union. His science fiction novels &quot;Aelita&quot; (1923), about a journey to Mars, and &quot;The Garin Death Ray&quot; (1927) are still popular with readers. In his later years he published two lengthy novels on historical subjects, &quot;Peter the First&quot; (1929–45) and &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; (1922-41). As a staunch supporter of Joseph Stalin, he became known as &quot;Red Count&quot; or &quot;Comrade Count&quot; and his works were acknowledged as classics of Soviet literature. Most of his reputation declined with that of Socialist Realism, but his children&#x27;s tale character Buratino retains his strong legacy with the younger audience of Russia and across the former Soviet space, appearing as popular reading, a movie, and a variety of derivative forms.

His granddaughter Tatyana Tolstaya (born May 3, 1951) is one of the foremost Russian short story writers. Another member of the family is Count Nikolai Tolstoy-Miloslavsky (born in 1935), a British historian and monarchist, and nominal head of the House of Tolstoy today.

==After the Russian revolution==
Some of the members of the Tolstoy family left Russia in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union, and many of the Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s relatives and descendants today live in Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Among them are Swedish jazz singer Viktoria Tolstoy. Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s last surviving grandchild, Countess Tatiana Tolstoy-Paus, died in 2007 at Herresta manor in Sweden, which is owned by Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s descendants in the Paus family. Two of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s great-great-grandsons are Pyotr Tolstoy, a Russian TV presenter and State Duma deputy since 2016 and Vladimir Tolstoy, journalist and adviser to the President of Russia on culture.

<doc id="30928" wikidata="Q7835334" url="?curid=30928" title="Transpositional pun">
<text>A transpositional pun is a pun format with two aspects. It involves transposing the words in a well-known phrase or saying to get a daffynition-like clever redefinition of a well-known word unrelated to the original phrase. The redefinition is thus the first aspect, and the transposition the second aspect. As a result, transpositional puns are considered among the most difficult to create, and commonly the most challenging to comprehend, particularly for non-native speakers of the language in which they&#x27;re given (most commonly English).

<doc id="30930" wikidata="Q443640" url="?curid=30930" title="Tom Daschle">
<text>Thomas Andrew Daschle ( ; born December 9, 1947) is an American politician and lobbyist who represented South Dakota in the United States Senate from 1987 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he led the Senate Democratic Caucus during the final ten years of his tenure, during which time he served as Senate Minority Leader and Majority Leader.

After leaving the United States Air Force, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1978 and served four terms. In 1986, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, becoming Minority Leader in 1995 and Majority Leader in 2001, becoming the highest-ranking elected official in South Dakota history.

In 2004, he was defeated for reelection in a close race to John Thune, who would go on to become a party leader himself. Later, he took a position as a policy advisor with a lobbying firm, became a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and co-authored a book advocating universal health care.

Daschle was an early supporter of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential candidacy, and was nominated by President-elect Obama for the position of Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services after the 2008 election. However, Daschle withdrew his name on February 3, 2009, amid a growing controversy over his failure to properly report and pay income taxes. He is currently working for The Daschle Group, a Public Policy Advisory of Baker Donelson, a large law firm and lobbying group.

==Early life and education==
Daschle was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, the son of Elizabeth B. (née Meier) and Sebastian C. Daschle, both of German descent. His paternal grandparents were Volga Germans. He grew up in a working-class Roman Catholic family, the eldest of four brothers.

He attended Central High School in Aberdeen before becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college when he earned a B.A. from the Department of Political Science at South Dakota State University in 1969. While attending South Dakota State University, Daschle became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega. From 1969 to 1972, Daschle served in the United States Air Force as an intelligence officer with the Strategic Air Command.

In the mid-1970s Daschle was an aide to Senator James Abourezk.

==House of Representatives (1979–1987)==
In 1978 Daschle was elected to the United States House of Representatives at the age of 31, winning the race by a margin of 139 votes, following a recount, out of more than 129,000 votes cast. Daschle served four terms in the House of Representatives and quickly became a part of the Democratic leadership.

Although Daschle was not seeking the vice presidency, he received 10 (0.30%) delegate votes for Vice President of the United States at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Several others also received protest votes, but incumbent Vice President Walter Mondale was nevertheless renominated easily.

==United States Senate (1987–2005)==
In 1986, Daschle was elected to the U.S. Senate in a close victory over incumbent Republican James Abdnor. In his first year, he was appointed to the Finance Committee.

===Party leadership===
In 1994, he was chosen by his colleagues to succeed the retiring Senator George Mitchell as Democratic minority leader. In the history of the Senate, only Lyndon B. Johnson had served fewer years before being elected to lead his party. In addition to the minority leader&#x27;s post, Daschle served as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. South Dakotans reelected Daschle to the Senate by overwhelming margins in 1998.

At various points in his career, he served on the Veterans Affairs, Indian Affairs, Finance, and Ethics Committees.

When the 107th Congress commenced on January 3, 2001, the Senate was evenly divided—that is, there were 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans. Outgoing Vice President Al Gore acted in his constitutional capacity as ex officio President of the Senate, and used his tie-breaking vote to give the Democrats the majority in that chamber. For the next two weeks, Daschle served as Senate Majority Leader.

Upon the commencement of the Bush administration on January 20, 2001, Dick Cheney became president of the senate, thereby returning Democrats to the minority in that body; Daschle reverted to the position of Senate Minority Leader. However, on June 6, 2001, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont announced that he was leaving the Senate Republican caucus to become an independent and to caucus with Democrats; this once again returned control of the body to the Democrats and Daschle again became majority leader.
Democratic losses in the November 2002 elections returned the party to the minority in the senate in January 2003, and Daschle once more reverted to being minority leader.

Daschle recounted his senate experiences from 2001 to 2003 in his first book, &quot;Like No Other Time: The 107th Congress and the Two Years That Changed America Forever&quot;, published in 2003. With Charles Robbins, he has also written the book &quot;The U.S. Senate&quot;, part of the &quot;Fundamentals of American Government&quot; series.
===Anthrax case in 2001===
In October 2001, while he was the Senate Majority Leader, Daschle&#x27;s office received a letter containing anthrax, becoming a target of the 2001 anthrax attacks. Some of his staffers were confirmed to have been exposed, as well as several of Senator Russ Feingold&#x27;s staffers and Capitol police officers. His suite at the Hart Senate Office Building was the focus of an intensive cleanup led by the Environmental Protection Agency.

===Views on abortion===
Daschle has a mixed voting record on abortion-related issues, which led the pro-choice organization NARAL to give him a 50% vote rating.

In 1999 and 2003, Daschle voted in favor of the ban on partial-birth abortion, and supported legislation making it a crime to harm an unborn child when someone attacks a pregnant woman. Investigators into the 2001 anthrax attacks, which included Senator Daschle&#x27;s Capitol Hill office, suspect that alleged anthrax mailer Bruce Ivins may have chosen to target Daschle over his views on abortion, although Ivins&#x27;s lawyer disputed this alleged motive.

In 2003, Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Carlson reportedly wrote to Daschle, criticizing his stance on abortion as conflicting with Roman Catholic teaching, and stating that Daschle should no longer identify himself as a Catholic.

===2004 Senate election===

In the 2004 Senate election, John Thune defeated Daschle by 4,508 votes, 50.6% to 49.4%. It was the first time that a Senate party leader had lost a bid for reelection since 1952, when Barry Goldwater defeated Ernest McFarland in Arizona. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist visited South Dakota to campaign for Thune, breaking an unwritten tradition that a leader of one party would not actively campaign for the defeat of the other.

Throughout the campaign, Thune, along with Frist, President George W. Bush, and Vice President Cheney, frequently accused Daschle of being the &quot;chief obstructionist&quot; of Bush&#x27;s agenda and charged him with using filibusters to unjustly block confirmation of several of Bush&#x27;s nominees. The Republican candidate also drove home his strong support for the war. In a nationally televised debate on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Thune accused Daschle of &quot;emboldening the enemy&quot; in his skepticism of the Iraq War.

When the race began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7% in January and February. By May, his lead was just 2% and summer polls showed a varying number of trends: Daschle or Thune led by no more than 2%, but some polls showed a tie. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2–5% while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most polls showed that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49–49 among likely voters. Some polls showed either Thune or Daschle leading by extremely slim margins.

==Post-Senate career==

===Career and public service===
Following his reelection defeat, Daschle took a position with the lobbying arm of the K Street law firm Alston &amp; Bird. Because he was prohibited by law from lobbying for one year after leaving the Senate, he instead worked as a &quot;special policy adviser&quot; for the firm.

Alston &amp; Bird&#x27;s healthcare clients include CVS Caremark, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, Abbott Laboratories, and HealthSouth. The firm was paid $5.8 million between January and September 2008 to represent companies and associations before Congress and the executive branch, with 60% of that money coming from the healthcare industry. Daschle was recruited by the former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Daschle&#x27;s salary from Alston &amp; Bird for the year 2008 was reportedly $2 million.

Daschle was also a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. In addition, he served as National Co-Chair of ONE Vote ‘08, along with former senator Bill Frist. He and former senators George Mitchell, Bob Dole, and Howard Baker formed the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), dedicated to finding bipartisan solutions for policy disputes. Daschle is also a co-chair of BPC&#x27;s Health Project.

In 2003, Daschle received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Senator Bill Frist.

In May 2005, South Dakota State University, Daschle&#x27;s alma mater, conferred upon him an honorary doctorate for public service. In May 2011, Daschle was further honored with an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters by Northern State University in his hometown of Aberdeen.

In late September 2005, Daschle caught the attention of the media by reactivating his political action committee, changing its name from DASHPAC to New Leadership for America PAC and procuring a speaking slot at the Iowa Democratic Party&#x27;s annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner. He continued to keep a relatively high-profile among Democratic interest groups. These moves were interpreted by the media as an exploration of a potential 2008 Presidential candidacy. On December 2, 2006, he announced he would not run for president in 2008.

In an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on February 12, 2006, Daschle endorsed a controversial warrantless surveillance program conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA), explaining that he had been briefed on the program while he was the Democratic leader in the Senate.

In addition, Senator Daschle is a member of the board of trustees for the Richard C. Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.

Daschle is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

Daschle also served as vice chair of the board of directors of National Democratic Institute for International Affairs.

Daschle is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

Daschle is the co-chair of the national advisory board at the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD). The institute was created at the University of Arizona after the 2011 shooting of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords that killed six people and wounded 13 others.

In 2019, Daschle was named to the advisory board of Northern Swan Holdings Inc., a cannabis investment firm. Daschle stated: &quot;I believe it is imperative to loosen the restrictions on cannabis so we can research its properties and fully understand how patients can benefit from its medicinal use.&quot; In 2020, Daschle endorsed Constitutional Amendment A, a ballot initiative to legalize cannabis for recreational use in South Dakota.

In 2021, Daschle co-wrote an op-ed for The Hill criticizing proposed cuts to pandemic preparedness programs, describing them as &quot;unthinkable&quot; in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Obama campaign===

On February 21, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Daschle, after ruling out a presidential bid of his own in December 2006, had thrown his support behind Senator Barack Obama of Illinois for the 2008 presidential election, saying that Obama &quot;personifies the future of Democratic leadership in our country.&quot;

In January 2005, having suggested that Obama take on some of his staffers, Daschle exited the Senate just as Obama entered. These included Daschle&#x27;s outgoing chief-of-staff Pete Rouse who helped to create a two-year plan in the Senate that would fast-track Obama for the presidential nomination. Daschle himself told Obama in 2006 that &quot;windows of opportunity for running for the presidency close quickly. And that he should not assume, if he passes up this window, that there will be another.&quot;

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Daschle served as a key advisor to Obama and one of the national co-chairs for Obama&#x27;s campaign. On June 3, 2008, Obama lost to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary in Daschle&#x27;s home state of South Dakota, although that night Obama clinched his party&#x27;s nomination anyway.

Two days later, sources indicated Daschle &quot;is interested in universal health care and might relish serving as HHS secretary.&quot; In the general election campaign, Daschle continued to consult Obama, campaign for him across swing states, and advise his campaign organization until Obama was ultimately elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008.

===Obama administration nomination===
On November 19, 2008, the press reported that Daschle had accepted Obama&#x27;s offer to be nominated for Health and Human Services Secretary. His selection was announced at a news conference with Obama on December 11, 2008.

Some organizations objected to Daschle&#x27;s selection, arguing that his work at Alston &amp; Bird was tantamount to lobbying and therefore his selection violated Obama&#x27;s promise to keep special interests out of the White House. According to Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, Daschle technically complies with the transition rules against lobbyists but &quot;many power brokers never register as lobbyists, but they are every bit as powerful.&quot; Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for the Obama transition, responded that Daschle&#x27;s work &quot;does not represent a bar to his service in the transition&quot; since &quot;he was not a lobbyist, and he will recuse himself from any work that presents a conflict of interest.&quot; Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, praised Daschle on his nomination to Secretary of Health and Human Services for his &quot;deep commitment to securing high-quality, affordable health care for everyone in our nation.&quot;

When Daschle was officially nominated for his Cabinet position on January 20, 2009, confirmation by the Senate was required. The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a confirmation hearing for Daschle on January 8, 2009. A second Senate committee, the Finance Committee, also traditionally reviews HHS Secretary nominees; the committee discussed his nomination behind closed doors on February 2, 2009.

====Withdrawal====
On January 30, 2009, it was reported that Daschle&#x27;s friendship and business partnership with businessman Leo Hindery could cause problems for Daschle&#x27;s Senate confirmation. Daschle has been a paid consultant and advisor to Hindery&#x27;s InterMedia Partners since 2005, during which time he received from Hindery access to a limousine and chauffeur. Daschle reportedly did not declare this service on his annual tax forms as required by law. A spokeswoman for Daschle said that he &quot;simply and probably naively&quot; considered the use of the car and driver &quot;a generous offer&quot; from Hindery, &quot;a longtime friend.&quot; Daschle told the Senate Finance Committee that in June 2008—just as he was letting the press know he would like to be HHS secretary in an Obama administration—that &quot;something made him think that the car service might be taxable&quot; and he began seeking to remedy the situation.

Daschle reportedly also did not pay taxes on an additional $83,333 that he earned as a consultant to InterMedia Partners in 2007; this was discovered by Senator Daschle&#x27;s accountant in December 2008. According to ABC News, Daschle also took tax deductions for $14,963 in donations that he made between 2005 and 2007 to charitable organizations that did not meet the requirements for being tax deductible.

The former senator paid the three years of owed taxes and interest—an amount totaling $140,167—in January 2009, but still reportedly owed &quot;Medicare taxes equal to 2.9 percent&quot; of the value of the car service he received, amounting to &quot;thousands of dollars in additional unpaid taxes.&quot;

On February 3, 2009, Daschle withdrew his nomination, saying that he did not wish to be a &quot;distraction&quot; to the Obama agenda.

===Health policy===
Daschle co-wrote the 2008 book &quot;Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis&quot; . He and his co-authors point out that &quot;most of the world’s highest-ranking health-care systems employ some kind of &#x27;single-payer&#x27; strategy – that is, the government, directly or through insurers, is responsible for paying doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers.&quot; They argue that a single-payer approach is simple, equitable, provides everyone with the same benefits, and saves billions of dollars through economies of scale and simplified administration. They concede that implementing a single-payer system in the United States would be &quot;politically problematic&quot; even though some polls show more satisfaction with the single-payer Medicare system than private insurance.

A key element of the single-payer plan that Daschle and his co-authors propose in the book is a new &quot;Federal Health Board&quot; that would establish the framework and fill in the details. The board would somehow be simultaneously &quot;insulated from political pressure&quot; and &quot;accountable to elected officials and the American people.&quot; The board would &quot;promote &#x27;high-value&#x27; medical care by recommending coverage of those drugs and procedures backed by solid evidence.&quot; This proposal has been criticized by conservatives and libertarians who argue that such a board will lead to rationing of health care, and by progressives who believe the board will, as one writer put it, &quot;get defanged by lobbyists immediately.&quot;

One of Daschle&#x27;s co-authors, Jeanne Lambrew, had been slated before his withdrawal to serve as his deputy in the White House Office of Health Reform.

Daschle also served as a panelist on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former senator Joe Lieberman and former governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel&#x27;s final report, &quot;The National Blueprint for Biodefense&quot;, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel&#x27;s call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.

===9/11===
Daschle claims he was asked by vice president Dick Cheney &quot;not to investigate&quot; the events of 9/11.

He told reporters, &quot;the vice president expressed the concern that a review of what happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from the effort in the war on terrorism. I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that the Intelligence Committee is going to begin this effort, trying to limit the scope and the overall review of what happened. But clearly, I think the American people are entitled to know what happened and why.&quot;

==Personal life==
Daschle has been married to Linda Hall, who was Miss Kansas in 1976, since 1984, one year after his marriage to his first wife, Laurie, later-U.S. Ambassador to Denmark, ended in divorce.

Hall was acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in the Clinton administration; she is now a Washington lobbyist. Her lobbying clients have included American Airlines, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing, Senate lobbying records show.

Tom Daschle has three children from his first marriage: Kelly, Nathan, and Lindsay. Nathan is the CEO of Ruck.us and former executive director of the Democratic Governors Association.

<doc id="30932" wikidata="Q1383412" url="?curid=30932" title="Network throughput">
<text>Network throughput (or just throughput, when in context) refers to the rate of message delivery over a communication channel in a communication network, such as Ethernet or packet radio. The data that these messages contain may be delivered over physical or logical links, or through network nodes. Throughput is usually measured in bits per second (, sometimes abbreviated bps), and sometimes in packets per second ( or pps) or data packets per time slot.

The system throughput or aggregate throughput is the sum of the data rates that are delivered over all channels in a network. Throughput represents digital bandwidth consumption.

The throughput of a communication system may be affected by various factors, including the limitations of the underlying physical medium, available processing power of the system components, end-user behavior, etc. When taking various protocol overheads into account, the useful rate of the data transfer can be significantly lower than the maximum achievable throughput; the useful part is usually referred to as goodput.

==Maximum throughput==
Users of telecommunications devices, systems designers, and researchers into communication theory are often interested in knowing the expected performance of a system. From a user perspective, this is often phrased as either &quot;which device will get my data there most effectively for my needs?&quot;, or &quot;which device will deliver the most data per unit cost?&quot;. Systems designers often select the most effective architecture or design constraints for a system, which drive its final performance. In most cases, the benchmark of what a system is capable of, or its &quot;maximum performance&quot; is what the user or designer is interested in. The term &quot;maximum throughput&quot; is frequently used when discussing end-user maximum throughput tests. Maximum throughput is essentially synonymous with digital bandwidth capacity.

Four different values are relevant in the context of maximum throughput are used in comparing the &quot;upper limit&quot; conceptual performance of multiple systems. They are &quot;maximum theoretical throughput&quot;, &quot;maximum achievable throughput&quot;, &quot;peak measured throughput&quot;, and &quot;maximum sustained throughput&quot;. These values represent different qualities, and care must be taken that the same definitions are used when comparing different &quot;maximum throughput&quot; values. 

Each bit must carry the same amount of information if throughput values are to be compared. Data compression can significantly alter throughput calculations, including generating values exceeding 100% in some cases.

If the communication is mediated by several links in series with different bit rates, the maximum throughput of the overall link is lower than or equal to the lowest bit rate. The lowest value link in the series is referred to as the bottleneck.

===Maximum theoretical throughput===
Maximum theoretical throughput is closely related to the channel capacity of the system, and is the maximum possible quantity of data that can be transmitted under ideal circumstances. In some cases, this number is reported as equal to the channel capacity, though this can be deceptive, as only non-packetized systems technologies can achieve this. Maximum theoretical throughput is more accurately reported taking into account format and specification overhead with best-case assumptions.

===Asymptotic throughput===
The asymptotic throughput (less formal asymptotic bandwidth) for a packet-mode communication network is the value of the maximum throughput function, when the incoming network load approaches infinity, either due to a message size, or the number of data sources. As with other bit rates and data bandwidths, the asymptotic throughput is measured in bits per second or (rarely) bytes per second , where is . Decimal prefixes are used, meaning that is .

Asymptotic throughput is usually estimated by sending or simulating a very large message (sequence of data packets) through the network, using a greedy source and no flow control mechanism (i.e., UDP rather than TCP), and measuring the network path throughput in the destination node. Traffic load between other sources may reduce this maximum network path throughput. Alternatively, a large number of sources and sinks may be modeled, with or without flow control, and the aggregate maximum network throughput measured (the sum of traffic reaching its destinations). In a network simulation model with infinite packet queues, the asymptotic throughput occurs when the latency (the packet queuing time) goes to infinity, while if the packet queues are limited, or the network is a multi-drop network with many sources, and collisions may occur, the packet-dropping rate approaches 100%.

A well-known application of asymptotic throughput is in modeling point-to-point communication where (following Hockney) message latency T(N) is modeled as a function of message length N as T(N) = (M + N)/A where A is the asymptotic bandwidth and M is the half-peak length.

As well as its use in general network modeling, asymptotic throughput is used in modeling performance on massively parallel computer systems, where system operation is highly dependent on communication overhead, as well as processor performance. In these applications, asymptotic throughput is used in Xu and Hwang model (more general than Hockney&#x27;s approach) which includes the number of processors, so that both the latency and the asymptotic throughput are functions of the number of processors.

===Peak measured throughput===
The above values are theoretical or calculated. Peak measured throughput is throughput measured by a real, implemented system, or a simulated system. The value is the throughput measured over a short period of time; mathematically, this is the limit taken with respect to throughput as time approaches zero. This term is synonymous with &quot;instantaneous throughput&quot;. This number is useful for systems that rely on burst data transmission; however, for systems with a high duty cycle, this is less likely to be a useful measure of system performance.

===Maximum sustained throughput===
This value is the throughput averaged or integrated over a long time (sometimes considered infinity). For high duty cycle networks, this is likely to be the most accurate indicator of system performance. The maximum throughput is defined as the asymptotic throughput when the load (the amount of incoming data) is large. In packet switched systems where the load and the throughput always are equal (where packet loss does not occur), the maximum throughput may be defined as the minimum load in that causes the delivery time (the latency) to become unstable and increase towards infinity. This value can also be used deceptively in relation to peak measured throughput to conceal packet shaping.

==Channel utilization and efficiency==
Throughput is sometimes normalized and measured in percentage, but normalization may cause confusion regarding what the percentage is related to. &quot;Channel utilization&quot;, &quot;channel efficiency&quot; and &quot;packet drop rate&quot; in percentage are less ambiguous terms.

The channel efficiency, also known as bandwidth utilization efficiency, is the percentage of the net bit rate (in ) of a digital communication channel that goes to the actually achieved throughput. For example, if the throughput is in a Ethernet connection, the channel efficiency is 70%. In this example, effectively 70 Mbit of data are transmitted every second.

Channel utilization is instead a term related to the use of the channel, disregarding the throughput. It counts not only with the data bits, but also with the overhead that makes use of the channel. The transmission overhead consists of preamble sequences, frame headers and acknowledge packets. The definitions assume a noiseless channel. Otherwise, the throughput would not be only associated with the nature (efficiency) of the protocol, but also to retransmissions resultant from the quality of the channel. In a simplistic approach, channel efficiency can be equal to channel utilization assuming that acknowledge packets are zero-length and that the communications provider will not see any bandwidth relative to retransmissions or headers. Therefore, certain texts mark a difference between channel utilization and protocol efficiency.

In a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication link, where only one terminal is transmitting, the maximum throughput is often equivalent to or very near the physical data rate (the channel capacity), since the channel utilization can be almost 100% in such a network, except for a small inter-frame gap.

For example, the maximum frame size in Ethernet is 1526 bytes: up to 1500 bytes for the payload, eight bytes for the preamble, 14 bytes for the header, and 4 bytes for the trailer. An additional minimum interframe gap corresponding to 12 bytes is inserted after each frame. This corresponds to a maximum channel utilization of 1526 / (1526 + 12) × 100% = 99.22%, or a maximum channel use of inclusive of Ethernet datalink layer protocol overhead in a Ethernet connection. The maximum throughput or channel efficiency is then 1500 / (1526 + 12) = 97.5%, exclusive of the Ethernet protocol overhead.

==Factors affecting throughput==
The throughput of a communication system will be limited by a huge number of factors. Some of these are described below:

===Analog limitations===
The maximum achievable throughput (the channel capacity) is affected by the bandwidth in hertz and signal-to-noise ratio of the analog physical medium.

Despite the conceptual simplicity of digital information, all electrical signals traveling over wires are analog. The analog limitations of wires or wireless systems inevitably provide an upper bound on the amount of information that can be sent. The dominant equation here is the Shannon–Hartley theorem, and analog limitations of this type can be understood as factors that affect either the analog bandwidth of a signal or as factors that affect the signal-to-noise ratio. The bandwidth of wired systems can be in fact surprisingly narrow, with the bandwidth of Ethernet wire limited to approximately 1 GHz, and PCB traces limited by a similar amount.

Digital systems refer to the &#x27;knee frequency&#x27;, the amount of time for the digital voltage to rise from 10% of a nominal digital &#x27;0&#x27; to a nominal digital &#x27;1&#x27; or vice versa. The knee frequency is related to the required bandwidth of a channel, and can be related to the 3 db bandwidth of a system by the equation: formula_1
Where Tr is the 10% to 90% rise time, and K is a constant of proportionality related to the pulse shape, equal to 0.35 for an exponential rise, and 0.338 for a Gaussian rise.

*RC losses: Wires have an inherent resistance, and an inherent capacitance when measured with respect to ground. This leads to effects called parasitic capacitance, causing all wires and cables to act as RC lowpass filters.
*Skin effect: As frequency increases, electric charges migrate to the edges of wires or cable. This reduces the effective cross-sectional area available for carrying current, increasing resistance and reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. For AWG 24 wire (of the type commonly found in Cat 5e cable), the skin effect frequency becomes dominant over the inherent resistivity of the wire at 100 kHz. At 1 GHz the resistivity has increased to 0.1 ohm per inch.
*Termination and ringing: Wires longer than about 1/6 wavelengths must be modeled as transmission lines with termination taken into account. Unless this is done, reflected signals will travel back and forth across the wire, positively or negatively interfering with the information-carrying signal.
*Wireless Channel Effects: For wireless systems, all of the effects associated with wireless transmission limit the SNR and bandwidth of the received signal, and therefore the maximum bit transmission rate.

===IC hardware considerations===
Computational systems have finite processing power and can drive finite current. Limited current drive capability can limit the effective signal to noise ratio for high capacitance links.

Large data loads that require processing impose data processing requirements on hardware (such as routers). For example, a gateway router supporting a populated class B subnet, handling 10 × Ethernet channels, must examine 16 bits of address to determine the destination port for each packet. This translates into 81913 packets per second (assuming maximum data payload per packet) with a table of 2^16 addresses this requires the router to be able to perform 5.368 billion lookup operations per second. In a worst-case scenario, where the payloads of each Ethernet packet are reduced to 100 bytes, this number of operations per second jumps to 520 billion. This router would require a multi-teraflop processing core to be able to handle such a load.

* CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA &quot;backoff&quot; waiting time and frame retransmissions after detected collisions. This may occur in Ethernet bus networks and hub networks, as well as in wireless networks.
* Flow control, for example in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocol, affects the throughput if the bandwidth-delay product is larger than the TCP window, i.e., the buffer size. In that case, the sending computer must wait for acknowledgement of the data packets before it can send more packets.
* TCP congestion avoidance controls the data rate. A so-called &quot;slow start&quot; occurs in the beginning of a file transfer, and after packet drops caused by router congestion or bit errors in for example wireless links.

===Multi-user considerations===
Ensuring that multiple users can harmoniously share a single communications link requires some kind of equitable sharing of the link. If a bottleneck communication link offering data rate &quot;R&quot; is shared by &quot;N&quot; active users (with at least one data packet in queue), every user typically achieves a throughput of approximately &quot;R/N&quot;, if fair queuing best-effort communication is assumed.

* Packet loss due to network congestion. Packets may be dropped in switches and routers when the packet queues are full due to congestion.
* Packet loss due to bit errors.
* Scheduling algorithms in routers and switches. If fair queuing is not provided, users that send large packets will get higher bandwidth. Some users may be prioritized in a weighted fair queuing (WFQ) algorithm if differentiated or guaranteed quality of service (QoS) is provided.
* In some communications systems, such as satellite networks, only a finite number of channels may be available to a given user at a given time. Channels are assigned either through preassignment or through Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA). In these cases, throughput is quantized per channel, and unused capacity on partially utilized channels is lost.

==Goodput and overhead==
The maximum throughput is often an unreliable measurement of perceived bandwidth, for example the file transmission data rate in bits per seconds. As pointed out above, the achieved throughput is often lower than the maximum throughput. Also, the protocol overhead affects the perceived bandwidth. The throughput is not a well-defined metric when it comes to how to deal with protocol overhead. It is typically measured at a reference point below the network layer and above the physical layer. The simplest definition is the number of bits per second that are physically delivered. A typical example where this definition is practiced is an Ethernet network. In this case, the maximum throughput is the gross bit rate or raw bit rate.

However, in schemes that include forward error correction codes (channel coding), the redundant error code is normally excluded from the throughput. An example in modem communication, where the throughput typically is measured in the interface between the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and the circuit-switched modem connection. In this case, the maximum throughput is often called net bit rate or useful bit rate.

To determine the actual data rate of a network or connection, the &quot;goodput&quot; measurement definition may be used. For example, in file transmission, the &quot;goodput&quot; corresponds to the file size (in bits) divided by the file transmission time. The &quot;goodput&quot; is the amount of useful information that is delivered per second to the application layer protocol. Dropped packets or packet retransmissions, as well as protocol overhead, are excluded. Because of that, the &quot;goodput&quot; is lower than the throughput. Technical factors that affect the difference are presented in the &quot;goodput&quot; article.

==Other uses of throughput for data==

===Integrated circuits===
Often, a block in a data flow diagram has a single input and a single output, and operate on discrete packets of information. Examples of such blocks are fast Fourier transform modules or binary multipliers. Because the units of throughput are the reciprocal of the unit for propagation delay, which is &#x27;seconds per message&#x27; or &#x27;seconds per output&#x27;, throughput can be used to relate a computational device performing a dedicated function such as an ASIC or embedded processor to a communications channel, simplifying system analysis.

===Wireless and cellular networks===
In wireless networks or cellular systems, the system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz/area unit, bit/s/Hz/site or bit/s/Hz/cell, is the maximum system throughput (aggregate throughput) divided by the analog bandwidth and some measure of the system coverage area.

===Over analog channels===
Throughput over analog channels is defined entirely by the modulation scheme, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the available bandwidth. Since throughput is normally defined in terms of quantified digital data, the term &#x27;throughput&#x27; is not normally used; the term &#x27;bandwidth&#x27; is more often used instead.

<text>TiVo ( ) is a digital video recorder (DVR) developed and marketed by Xperi (previously by TiVo Corporation and TiVo Inc.) and introduced in 1999. TiVo provides an on-screen guide of scheduled broadcast programming television programs, whose features include &quot;OnePass&quot; schedules which record every new episode of a series, and &quot;WishList&quot; searches which allow the user to find and record shows that match their interests by title, actor, director, category, or keyword. TiVo also provides a range of features when the TiVo DVR is connected to a home network, including film and TV show downloads, advanced search, online scheduling, and at one time, personal photo viewing and local music playback. They are currently owned by Philips.

Since its launch in its home market of the United States, TiVo has also been made available in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Taiwan, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Newer models, however, have adopted the CableCARD standard, which is only deployed in the United States, and which limits the availability of certain features.

==History and development==

TiVo was developed by Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay through a corporation they named &quot;Teleworld&quot; which was later renamed to TiVo Inc. Though they originally intended to create a home network device, it was redesigned as a device that records digitized video onto a hard disk.

After exhibiting at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1997, Mike Ramsay announced to the company that the first version of the TiVo digital video recorder would be released &quot;in Q1&quot; (the last day of which is March 31) despite an estimated 4 to 5 months of work remaining to complete the device. Because March 31, 1999, was a blue moon, the engineering staff code-named this first version of the TiVo DVR &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.

The original TiVo DVR digitized and compressed analog video from any source (antenna, cable or direct broadcast satellite). TiVo also integrated its DVR service into the set-top boxes of satellite and cable providers. In late 2000, Philips Electronics introduced the DSR6000, the first DirecTV receiver with an integrated TiVo DVR. This new device, nicknamed the &quot;DirecTiVo&quot;, stored digital signals sent from DirecTV directly onto a hard disk.

In early 2000, TiVo partnered with electronics manufacturer Thomson Multimedia (now Technicolor SA) and broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting to deliver the TiVo service in the UK market. This partnership resulted in the Thomson PVR10UK, a stand-alone receiver released in October 2000 that was based on the original reference design used in the United States by both Philips and Sony. TiVo ended UK unit sales in January 2003, though it continued to sell subscriptions and supply guide data to existing subscribed units until June 2011. TiVo branded products returned to the UK during 2010 under an exclusive partnership with cable TV provider Virgin Media.

TiVo was launched in Australia in July 2008 by Hybrid Television Services, a company owned by Australia&#x27;s Seven Media Group and New Zealand&#x27;s TVNZ. TiVo Australia also launched a TiVo with a 320Gb hard Drive in 2009. TiVo Australia also launched Blockbuster on demand and in December 2009 launched a novel service called Caspa on Demand. TiVo also went on sale in New Zealand on 6 November 2009.

Janet Jackson&#x27;s Super Bowl halftime show incident on February 1, 2004, set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment in TiVo history. The baring of one of Jackson&#x27;s breasts at the end of her duet with Justin Timberlake, which caused a flood of outraged phone calls to CBS, was replayed a record number of times by TiVo users. A company representative stated, &quot;The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it. The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.&quot;

In April 2016, Rovi acquired TiVo for $1.1 billion.

In December 2019, it was announced that TiVo would merge with Xperi Corporation. The merger completed in May 2020.

In early February 2024, TiVo removed the antenna version of the TiVo Edge from their website, apparently discontinuing their OTA line of DVRs. The cable version of the TiVo Edge as well as the TiVo Mini LUX and TiVo Stream 4K continue to be available.

==TiVo digital video recorder==

A TiVo DVR serves a function similar to that of a videocassette recorder (VCR), in that both allow a TV viewer to record programming for viewing at a later time, known as time shifting. Unlike a videocassette recorder, which uses removable magnetic tape cartridges, a TiVo DVR stores TV programs on an internal hard drive, much like a computer.

A TiVo DVR also automatically records programs that the user is likely to be interested in. TiVo DVRs also implement a patented feature that TiVo calls &quot;trick play&quot;, allowing the viewer to pause live television and rewind and replay up to 30 minutes of recently viewed TV. TiVo DVRs can be connected to a computer local area network, allowing the TiVo device to download information, access video streaming services such as Netflix or Hulu, as well as music from the Internet.

===Functions===
TiVo DVRs communicate with TiVo&#x27;s servers on a regular basis to receive program information updates, including description, regular and guest actors, directors, genres, whether programs are new or repeats, and whether broadcast is in High Definition (HD). Information is updated daily into its program guide from Rovi (Tribune Media Services was used prior to September 2016).

Users can select individual programs to record or a &quot;OnePass&quot; (formerly &quot;Season Pass&quot;) to record all episodes of a show. There are options to record First Run Only, First Run and Repeats, or All Episodes. An episode is considered &quot;First Run&quot; if aired within two weeks of that episode&#x27;s initial air date. OnePasses can also &quot;bookmark&quot; shows from internet streaming video services and show a combined view of recordings and bookmarks.

When users&#x27; requests for multiple programs are conflicting, the lower priority program in the OnePass Manager is either not recorded or clipped where times overlap. The lower priority program will be recorded if it is aired later. TiVo DVRs with multiple tuners simultaneously record the top priority programs.

TiVo pioneered recording programs based on household viewing habits; this is called TiVo Suggestions. Users can rate programs from three &quot;thumbs up&quot; to three &quot;thumbs down&quot;. TiVo user ratings are combined to create a recommendation, based on what TiVo users with similar viewing habits watch. For example, if one user likes &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, then another TiVo user who watched just &quot;American Idol&quot; might get a recommendation for the other two shows. As of 2023, Tivo Suggestions are no longer supported. The Thumbs Up/Down buttons can no longer be used to rate programs.

The amount of storage capacity for programs is dependent upon the size of the hard drive inside the TiVo; different models have different sized hard drives. When the space is full on the hard drive, the oldest programs are deleted to make space for the newer ones; programs that users flag to not be deleted are kept and TiVo Suggestions are always lowest priority. The recording capacity of a TiVo HD DVR can be expanded with an external hard drive, which can add additional hours of HD recording space and standard definition video recording capacity.

When not recording specific user requests, the current channel is recorded for up to 30 minutes. Dual-tuner models record two channels. This allows users to rewind or pause anything that has been shown in the last thirty minutes — useful when viewing is interrupted. Shows already in progress can be entirely recorded if less than 30 minutes have been shown. Unlike VCRs, TiVo can record and play at the same time. A program can be watched from the beginning even if it is in the middle of being recorded, which is something that VCRs cannot do. Some users take advantage of this by waiting 10 to 15 minutes after a program starts (or is replayed from a recording), so that they can fast forward through commercials. In this way, by the end of the recording viewers are caught up with live television.

Unlike most DVRs, TiVo DVRs are easily connected to home networks, allowing users to schedule recordings on TiVo&#x27;s website (via TiVo Central Online), and transfer recordings between TiVo units (Multi-Room Viewing (MRV)). Former and now discontinued features included the ability transfer recordings to and from a home computer (TiVoToGo (TTG) transfers), play music and view photos over the network, and access third-party applications written for TiVo&#x27;s Home Media Engine (HME) API.

TiVo added a number of broadband features, most of which are no longer offered. These include:

Integration with Amazon Video on Demand, Jaman.com and Netflix Watch Instantly, offering users access to thousands of movie titles and television shows right from the comfort of their couch. Additionally, broadband connected to TiVo boxes can access digital photos from Picasa Web Albums or Photobucket. Another popular feature is access to Rhapsody music through TiVo, allowing users to listen to virtually any song from their living room. TiVo also teamed up with One True Media to give subscribers a private channel for sharing photos and video with family and friends. They can also access weather, traffic, Fandango movie listings (including ticket purchases), and music through Live365. In the summer of 2008 TiVo announced the availability of YouTube videos on TiVo.

On 7 June 2006, TiVo began offering TiVoCast, a broadband download service that initially offered content from places such as Rocketboom or, The New York Times; now there are over 70 TivoCast channels available for TiVo subscribers.

TiVo is expanding media convergence. In January 2005, TiVoToGo, a feature allowing transfer of recorded shows from TiVo boxes to PCs, was added. TiVo partnered with Sonic in the release of MyDVD 6.1, software for editing and converting TiVoToGo files. In January, 2007, TiVoToGo was extended to the Macintosh with Toast Titanium 8, Roxio software for assembly and burning digital media on CD and DVD media. In August 2005, TiVo rolled out &quot;TiVo Desktop&quot; allowing moving MPEG2 video files from PCs to TiVo for playback by DVR. As of June 5, 2013, TiVo stopped distributing the free version of TiVo Desktop for PC in favor of selling TiVo Desktop Plus. Users who previously downloaded the free version of TiVo Desktop can continue to use the software without paying a fee for the Plus edition.

;Parental features
TiVo KidZone (later removed in the Premiere and Roamio devices) was designed to give parents greater control over what their children see on television. This feature allows parents to choose which shows their children can watch and record. It also helps kids discover new shows through recommendations from leading national children&#x27;s organizations. TiVo KidZone provides a customized Now Playing List for children that displays only pre-approved shows, keeping television as safe as possible.

===Subscription service===
The information that a TiVo DVR downloads regarding television schedules, as well as software updates and any other relevant information is available through a monthly service subscription in the United States. A different model applies in Australia, where the TiVo media device is bought for a one-off fee, without further subscription costs.

;Lifetime subscription
There are multiple types of Product Lifetime Service. For satellite-enabled TiVo DVRs, the lifetime subscription remains as long as the account is active; the subscription does not follow a specific piece of hardware. This satellite lifetime subscription cannot be transferred to another person. Toshiba and Pioneer TiVo DVD recording equipped units include a &quot;Basic Lifetime Subscription&quot;, which is very similar to Full Lifetime, except only three days of the program guide are viewable; and search and Internet capabilities are not available, or at least are limited. All units (except satellite but including DVD units) can have &quot;Product Lifetime Subscription&quot; added to the TiVo service, which covers the life of the TiVo DVR, not the life of the subscriber. The Product Lifetime Subscription accompanies the TiVo DVR in case of ownership-transfer. TiVo makes no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of the TiVo DVR (aside from the manufacturer&#x27;s Limited Warranty). In the past TiVo has offered multiple &quot;Trade Up&quot; programs where you could transfer the Product Lifetime Subscription from an old unit to a newer model with a fee. A TiVo can be used without a service-agreement, but it will act more like a VCR in that you can only perform manual recordings and the TiVo can&#x27;t be connected to the TiVo service for local time, program guide data, software updates, etc. or TiVo will shut down the recording function.

====Service availability====
The TiVo service is available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Spain and Taiwan at present. Over the years since its initial release in the United States, TiVo Series1 and Series2 DVRs have also been modified by end users to work in Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and South Africa.

TiVo went on sale in New Zealand in the first week of November 2009.

The TiVo Service came to an end in Australia on 31 October 2017. The electronic programming guide and TiVo recording features are no longer available, thus making all TiVo machines in Australia virtually useless.

=====United Kingdom=====
The TiVo service was launched in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2000. It sold only 35,000 units over the next 18 months. Thomson, makers of the only UK TiVo box, abandoned it in early 2002 after BSkyB launched its Sky+ integrated &quot;set-top&quot; decoder and DVR, which dominated the market for DVRs in homes subscribing to BSkyB&#x27;s paid-for satellite television service. Many manufacturers, including Thomson have launched integrated decoder boxes/DVRs in the UK for other digital platforms, including free satellite, terrestrial, cable and IPTV.

A technical issue caused TiVo Suggestions to stop recording for S1 UK TiVo customers in late September 2008, but this was fixed in late January 2009.

Since December 2010, UK TiVo units that were not already on an active monthly subscription or lifetime subscription could no longer be re-activated. BSkyB who were operating the support for TiVo no longer had full access to the TiVo systems to activate accounts.

The TiVo S1 subscription service was maintained for both lifetime and monthly subscriptions until 1 June 2011. A community project known as AltEPG was established in March 2011 with the aim of providing a replacement for the discontinued subscription service. This project now provides programme guide data and software upgrades for S1 TiVos.

On 24 November 2009, cable television provider Virgin Media entered into a strategic partnership with TiVo. Under the mutually exclusive agreement, TiVo developed a converged television and broadband interactive interface to power Virgin Media&#x27;s next generation, high definition set top boxes. TiVo will become the exclusive provider of middleware and user interface software for Virgin Media&#x27;s next generation set top boxes. Virgin Media will be the exclusive distributor of TiVo services and technology in the United Kingdom. Virgin Media released its first TiVo co-branded product in December 2010. On 17 March 2011, Virgin Media enabled access to a third tuner.

As of 12 February 2015, Virgin Media has 2 million TiVo customers, 50% of their TV customers.

===Hardware anatomy===
The TiVo DVR was designed by TiVo Inc., which currently provides the hardware design and Linux-based TiVo software, and operates a subscription service (without which most models of TiVo will not operate). TiVo units have been manufactured by various OEMs, including Philips, Sony, Cisco, Hughes, Pioneer, Toshiba, and Humax, which license the software from TiVo Inc. To date, there have been six &quot;series&quot; of TiVo units produced.

TiVo DVRs are based on PowerPC (Series1) or MIPS (Series2) processors connected to MPEG-2 encoder/decoder chips and high-capacity IDE/ATA hard drives. Series1 TiVo units used one or two drives of 13–60 GB; Series2 units have drives of 40–250 GB in size. TiVo has also partnered with Western Digital to create an external hard drive, the My DVR Expander, for TiVo HD and Series3 Boxes. It plugs into the TiVo box using an eSATA interface. It expands the High-Definition boxes by up to 67 hours of HD, and around 300 hours of standard programming. Other TiVo users have found many ways to expand TiVo storage, although these methods are not supported by TiVo, and may void the warranty.

Some recent models manufactured by Toshiba, Pioneer, and Humax, under license from TiVo, contain DVD-R/RW drives. The models can transfer recordings from the built-in hard drive to DVD Video compliant disc, playable in most modern DVD systems.

All standalone TiVo DVRs have coax/RF-in and an internal cable-ready tuner, as well as analog video input — composite/RCA and S-Video, for use with an external cable box or satellite receiver. The TiVo unit can use a serial cable or infrared blasters to control the external receiver. They have coax/RF, composite/RCA, and S-Video output, and the DVD systems also have component out. Audio is RCA stereo, and the DVD systems also have digital optical out.

Until 2006, standalone TiVo systems could only record one channel at a time, though a dual-tuner Series2DT (S2DT) box was introduced in April 2006. The S2DT has two internal cable-ready tuners and it supports a single external cable box or satellite receiver. The S2DT is therefore capable of recording two analog cable channels, one analog and one digital cable channel, or one analog cable and one satellite channel at a time, with the correct programming sources. Note, however, that the S2DT, unlike earlier units, cannot record from an antenna. This is due to an FCC mandate that all devices sold after March 2007 with an NTSC tuner must also contain an ATSC tuner. TiVo therefore had to choose between adding ATSC support, or removing NTSC support. With the S2DT they opted to remove NTSC; the Series3 supports NTSC and ATSC, along with digital cable channels (with CableCards).

The Series2 DVRs also have USB ports, currently used only to support network (wired Ethernet and WiFi) adapters. The early Series2 units, models starting with 110/130/140, have USB1.1 hardware, while all other systems have USB2.0. There have been four major generations of Series2 units. The TiVo-branded 1xx and 2xx generations were solid grey-black. The main difference was the upgrade from USB 1.1 to the much faster USB 2.0. The 5xx generation was a new design. The chassis is silver with a white oval in the faceplate. The white oval is backlit, leading to these units being called &quot;Nightlight&quot; boxes. The 5xx generation was designed to reduce costs, and this also caused a noticeable drop in performance in the system menus as well as a large performance drop in network transfers. The 5xx generation also introduced changes in the boot PROM that make them unmodifiable without extensive wiring changes. The 6xx generation resembles the previous 5xx model, except that it has a black oval. The 6xx is a new design and the only model available today is the S2DT with dual tuners and a built-in 10/100baseT Ethernet port as well. The 6xx is the best performing Series2 to date, outperforming even the old leader, the 2xx, and far better than the lowest performing 5xx.

Some TiVo systems are integrated with DirecTV receivers. These &quot;DirecTiVo&quot; recorders record the incoming satellite MPEG-2 digital stream directly to hard disk without conversion. Because of this and the fact that they have two tuners, DirecTiVos are able to record two programs at once. In addition, the lack of digital conversion allows recorded video to be of the same quality as live video. DirecTiVos have no MPEG encoder chip, and can only record DirecTV streams. However, DirecTV has disabled the networking capabilities on their systems, meaning DirecTiVo does not offer such features as multi-room viewing or TiVoToGo. Only the standalone systems can be networked without additional unsupported hacking.

DirecTiVo units (HR10-250) can record HDTV to a 250 GB hard drive, both from the DirecTV stream and over-the-air via a standard UHF- or VHF-capable antenna. They have two virtual tuners (each consisting of a DirecTV tuner paired with an ATSC over-the-air tuner) and, like the original DirecTiVo, can record two programs at once; further, the program guide is integrated between over-the-air and DirecTV so that all programs can be recorded and viewed in the same manner.

In 2005, DirecTV stopped marketing recorders powered by TiVo and focused on its own DVR line developed by its business units. DirecTV continues to support the existing base of DirecTV recorders powered by TiVo.

On 8 July 2006, DirecTV announced an upgrade to version 6.3 on all remaining HR10-250 DirecTiVo receivers, the first major upgrade since this unit was released. This upgrade includes features like program grouping (folders), a much faster on-screen guide, and new sorting features.

In September 2008, DirecTV and TiVo announced that they have extended their current agreement, which includes the development, marketing and distribution of a new HD DIRECTV DVR featuring the TiVo service, as well as the extension of mutual intellectual property arrangements.

Since the discontinued Hughes Electronics DirecTV DVR with TiVo model HR10-250, all TiVo units have been fully HDTV capable. Other TiVo models will only record analog standard definition television (NTSC or PAL/SECAM). The Series3 &quot;TiVo HD, and TiVo HD XL&quot; DVRs and the Series4 &quot;TiVo Premiere and TiVo Premiere XL&quot; DVRs are capable of recording HDTV both from antenna (over the air) and cable (unencrypted QAM tuner or encrypted with a Cable Card) in addition to normal standard definition television from the same sources. Unlike the HR10-250, neither the Series3 nor Series4 units can record from the DirecTV service; conversely, the HR10-250 cannot record from digital cable. Other TiVo models may be connected to a high definition television (HDTV), but are not capable of recording HDTV signals, although they may be connected to a cable HDTV set-top box and record the down-converted outputs.

In 2008, some cable companies started to deploy switched digital video (SDV) technology, which initially was incompatible with the Series3 and TiVo HD units. TiVo Inc worked with cable operators on a tuning-adapter with USB connection to the TiVo to enable SDV. Some MSOs now offer these adapters for free to their customers with TiVo DVRs.

===Drive expansion===
TiVo has partnered with Western Digital to create an external hard drive, the My DVR Expander eSATA Edition, for TiVo HD and Series3 systems. The external drive plugs into the TiVo box using an eSATA interface. The first version of the eSATA drive shipped was a 500 GB drive that shipped in June 2008. In June 2009 the 1 TB version of the drive began shipping. The 1 TB version expands the TiVo HD and Series3 systems&#x27; capacity by up to 140 hours of HD content or 1,200 hours of standard programming.

TiVo was not designed to have an external drive disconnected once it has been added, because data for each recording is spread across both the internal and external disk drives. As a result, it is not possible to disconnect the external drive without deleting content recorded after the external drive was added. If disconnected, any recordings made will not be usable on either the internal or external drives. However, the external drive may be removed (along with content) without losing settings.

Various capacities of external drives have been shipped since the product was initially released. There were reports of product reliability issues, and a brief period of unavailability.

The Western Digital 1 TB and 500 GB My DVR Expander eSATA Edition and My DVR Expander USB Edition drives have been discontinued and replaced with the Western Digital My Book AV DVR Expander 1 TB drive. This drive has received a facelift from the previous generation, which now sports a glossy finish, and a tiny white LED power indicator, along with a push button power switch in the back. The biggest change is that this drive now includes both eSATA and USB in one device. This device is DirectTV, Dish Network, TiVo, Moxi, Pace, and Scientific Atlanta (Cisco) certified. Seagate has come out with their own DVR-oriented drive called the Seagate GoFlex DVR which comes in a 1 TB and 2 TB capacity. TiVo has not approved the Seagate product for use with TiVo DVRs and they will not currently function with any TiVo products.

===Hacking===
Users have installed additional or larger hard drives in their TiVo boxes to increase their recording capacity. Others have designed and built Ethernet cards and a Web interface (TiVoWeb), and figured out how to extract, insert and transfer video among their TiVo boxes. Other hacks include adding time to the start and end of recording intelligently and sending daily e-mails of the TiVo&#x27;s activity.

TiVo still uses the same encoding, however, for the media files (saved as .TiVo files). These are MPEG files encoded with the user&#x27;s Media Access Key (MAK). However, software developers have written programs such as tivodecode and tivodecode Manager to strip the MAK from the file, allowing the user to watch or send the recordings to friends.

==TiVo in the cloud==

On January 4, 2018, TiVo announced its next-gen platform, a catch-all product for providers like cable companies. It&#x27;s available for multiple TV devices, including not only Linux- and Android TV-based set-top boxes and traditional DVRs, but also DVR-free streaming devices like Apple TV and Amazon&#x27;s Fire TV, as well as phones, tablets and PCs. The platform allows providers to take advantage of TiVo&#x27;s user interface, voice control, personalization and recommendations. TiVo expects its user interface could provide an advantage over competitors such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video &quot;in a world where cord-cutting is increasingly popular.&quot;

In the 2020s, Internet service providers such as TDS and Astound started using set-top boxes with TiVo user interfaces to provide TV and cloud DVR service to their customers. These devices can also run apps for streaming services such as Netflix and Prime Video.

==Competitors and market share==

While its former main competitor in the United States, ReplayTV, had adopted a commercial-skip feature, TiVo decided to avoid automatic implementation fearing such a move might provoke backlash from the television industry. ReplayTV was sued over this feature as well as the ability to share shows over the Internet, and these lawsuits contributed to the bankruptcy of SONICblue, its owner at the time. Its new owner, DNNA, dropped both features in the final ReplayTV model, the 5500.

After demonstrating the WebTV capability at the same 1999 CES with TiVo and ReplayTV demonstrating their products, Dish (then named Dish Network) a few months later added DVR functionality to their DishPlayer 7100 (and later its 7200) with its Echostar unit producing the hardware while Microsoft provided the software that included WebTV, the same software Microsoft would later use for its UltimateTV DVR for DirecTV. The TiVo, ReplayTV, and DishPlayer 7100 represent very first DVRs that were in development at the same time and were released to market at about the same time.

SONICblue, the owners of ReplayTV would file for bankruptcy after being sued for its ability to automatically skip commercials and other features that were thought to violate copyrights; Echostar (Dish) would eventually sue Microsoft in 2001 for failing to support the software in DishPlayer 7100 and 7200 with Dish ending their relationship with Microsoft and cease offering the DishPlayer 7100/7200 to its subscribers and, instead, produce their own in-house DVR; and DirecTV would eventually drop Microsoft&#x27;s UltimateTV and keep DirecTiVo as its only DVR offering for quite some time.

Other distributors&#x27; competing DVR sets in the United States include Comcast and Verizon, although both distribute third-party hardware from manufacturers such as Motorola and the former Scientific Atlanta unit of Cisco Systems with this functionality built-in. Verizon uses boxes fitted for FiOS, allowing high-speed Internet access and other features. However, TiVo is compatible with the FiOS TV service because when the TV programming arrives at the home via FiOS Fiber to the Home network, it is converted to CableLabs specification QAM channels exactly as those used by cable TV companies. AT&amp;T is an IPTV service that is incompatible with the TiVo.

Despite having gained 234,000 subscribers in the last quarter of 2011, as of January 2012 TiVo had only (approximately) 2.3 million subscribers in the United States. This is down from a peak of 4.36 million in January 2006. As of January 31, 2016, TiVo reported 6.8 million subscribers.

==Issues==
===Privacy concerns===
TiVo collects detailed usage data from units via broadband Internet. As units are downloading schedule data, they transmit household viewing habits to TiVo Inc. Collected information includes a log of everything watched (time and channel) and remote keypresses such as fast forwarding through or replaying content. Many users were surprised when TiVo released data on how many users rewatched the exposure of Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast during the 2004 Super Bowl. TiVo records usage data for their own research and they also sell it to other corporations such as advertisers. Nielsen and TiVo have also previously collaborated to track viewing habits. This data is sold to advertising agencies as a way of documenting the number of viewers watching specific commercials to their corporate clients.

TiVo has three levels of data collection. By default, the user is in &quot;opt-out&quot; status, where all usage data is aggregated by ZIP Code, and individual viewing habits are not tracked. Certain optional features and promotions require the user to opt in, and individual information is then collected for targeted show suggestions or advertising. Users can request that TiVo block the collection of anonymous viewing information and diagnostic information from their TiVo DVR.

===Litigation===
TiVo holds several patents regarding digital video recorder technology, including one for its &quot;Time Warp&quot; feature, which have been asserted against cable TV operators and competing DVR box makers.

===Opposition by content providers===
====Content flagging====
In September 2005, a TiVo software upgrade added the ability for broadcasters to &quot;flag&quot; programs to be deleted after a certain date. Some customers had recordings deleted, or could not use their flagged recordings (transfer to a computer or burn to DVD), as they could with unflagged material. The initial showing of this for random shows was a bug in the software. It later was enabled on pay-per-view and video-on-demand content.

====Pop-up advertisements====
During early 2005, TiVo began test marketing &quot;pop-up&quot; advertisements to select subscribers, to explore it as an alternative source of revenue. The idea was that as users fast-forward through certain commercials of TiVo advertisers, they would also see a static image ad more suitable and effective than the broken video stream.

At its announcement, the concept of extra advertisements drew heavy criticism from subscribers. Some lifetime subscribers were upset that they had already paid for a service based upon their previous ad-free experience, while others argued that they had purchased the service for the specific purpose of dodging advertisements. In 2007, TiVo made changes to its pop-up ad system to show pop-up ads only if the user fast-forwards through a commercial that has a corresponding pop-up ad.

In 2019, some TiVo DVRs began running &quot;pre-roll advertisements.&quot; These ads are short, but mandatory. The ads run before the user can play a recorded program. The ads are downloaded from the Internet, so a brief delay occurs before the mandatory ads begin, further delaying playback. Only TiVo DVRs using TiVo Experience 4 software (Roamio, Bolt, Edge, etc.) have this forced advertising, earlier TiVo software does not deploy pre-roll ads.

===GNU General Public License and Tivoization===

In 2006, the Free Software Foundation decided to combat TiVo&#x27;s technical system of blocking users from running modified software.

This behavior, which Richard Stallman dubbed Tivoization, was tackled by creating a new version of the GNU General Public License, the GNU GPLv3, which prohibits this activity.

The kernel of the operating system of TiVo-branded hardware, the Linux kernel, is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2. The FSF&#x27;s goal is to ensure that all recipients of software licensed under the GPLv3 are not restricted by hardware constraints on the modification of distributed software.

This new license provision was acknowledged by TiVo in its April 2007 SEC filing: &quot;we may be unable to incorporate future enhancements to the GNU/Linux operating system into our software, which could adversely affect our business&quot;.

=== CableCard Support Uncertainty (USA) ===
In September 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) changed its rules so that cable television providers no longer must support CableCard. Providers may choose to keep supporting CableCard, but TiVo owners have no assurance. The cable television provider may discontinue CableCard support at any time.

<text>Tony McManus (born 1965) is a guitarist from Paisley, Scotland, who plays finger-style acoustic guitar arrangements of tunes from Celtic music, classical music, and other genres. He emigrated from Scotland to Canada in 2003.

==Music career==
In 1988, McManus substituted for the guitarist Soig Siberil in the supergroup Celtic Fiddle Festival, which consisted of the fiddlers Johnny Cunningham, Kevin Burke and Christian Lemaitre. He has worked as an accompanist for Catriona MacDonald and for the singer, guitarist and fiddler Brian McNeill. His album, &quot;Return to Kintail&quot;, was a duet with the Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser.

In addition to traditional Celtic music, McManus plays classical music and other genres. He performed a piece by Erik Satie for the soundtrack of a movie by Neil Jordan. The mandolin player Mike Marshall prodded him to learn Bach&#x27;s &quot;E Major Prelude&quot;. He performed a chaconne by J.S. Bach at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City with the jazz fusion guitarist John McLaughlin.

He released his first album, &quot;Tony McManus&quot;, in 1996 on Greentrax Recordings. He recorded his second album, &quot;Pourquoi Quebec?&quot;, in Quebec, Canada and released it on the same label in 1998. His third album, &quot;Ceol More&quot;, was released in 2002 and achieved widespread critical acclaim.

Christina Roden wrote on &quot;AllMusic&quot;, &quot;As usual, his command of acoustic guitar technique is flawless, with a chesty, rounded, gorgeous tone and a knack for well-marked rhythms and singing phrases.&quot; Gordon Potter wrote in &quot;Living Tradition&quot;, &quot;Here is a musician demonstrating talent by making it seem understated. This is good, this is very good indeed, and there&#x27;s not much else that can be said.&quot;

The album includes a version of Charles Mingus&#x27; &quot;Goodbye Porkpie Hat&quot;. He recorded an album with the bass guitarist Alain Genty, titled &quot;Singing Sands&quot;.

In 2017, McManus was named one of &quot;50 Transcendent Acoustic Guitarists&quot; in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine.

==Signature model==
In 2011, PRS Guitars created a McManus signature model guitar, a distinction he shares with the jazz guitarist Al Di Meola, the folk guitarist Martin Simpson and the rock guitarists Carlos Santana, John Mayer, Mark Lettieri, Ted Nugent and Orianthi Panagaris. The custom model, designed by Paul Reed Smith, went into development after McManus visited the bluegrass musician Ricky Skaggs in Nashville, Tennessee, while on tour in America.

<doc id="30941" wikidata="Q372660" url="?curid=30941" title="Tacticity">
<text>Tacticity (from , &quot;relating to arrangement or order&quot;) is the relative stereochemistry of adjacent chiral centers within a macromolecule. The practical significance of tacticity rests on the effects on the physical properties of the polymer. The regularity of the macromolecular structure influences the degree to which it has rigid, crystalline long range order or flexible, amorphous long range disorder. Precise knowledge of tacticity of a polymer also helps understanding at what temperature a polymer melts, how soluble it is in a solvent, as well as its mechanical properties.

A tactic macromolecule in the IUPAC definition is a macromolecule in which essentially all the configurational (repeating) units are identical. In a hydrocarbon macromolecule with all carbon atoms making up the backbone in a tetrahedral molecular geometry, the zigzag backbone is in the paper plane with the substituents either sticking out of the paper or retreating into the paper;, this projection is called the Natta projection after Giulio Natta. Tacticity is particularly significant in vinyl polymers of the type - where each repeating unit with a substituent R on one side of the polymer backbone is followed by the next repeating unit with the substituent on the same side as the previous one, the other side as the previous one or positioned randomly with respect to the previous one., Monotactic macromolecules have one stereoisomeric atom per repeat unit, ditactic to n-tactic macromolecules have more than one stereoisomeric atom per unit.

==Describing tacticity==



===Diads===
Two adjacent structural units in a polymer molecule constitute a diad. Diads overlap: each structural unit is considered part of two diads, one diad with each neighbor. If a diad consists of two identically oriented units, the diad is called an &#x27; (formerly &quot;meso diad&quot;, as in a meso compound, now proscribed). If a diad consists of units oriented in opposition, the diad is called an &#x27; (formerly &quot;racemo diad&quot;, as in a racemic compound, now proscribed). In the case of vinyl polymer molecules, an is one in which the substituents are oriented on the same side of the polymer backbone; in the Natta projection, they both point into the plane or both point out of the plane.

===Triads===

The stereochemistry of macromolecules can be defined even more precisely with the introduction of triads. An isotactic triad (&quot;mm&quot;) is made up of two adjacent m diads, a syndiotactic triad (also spelled syndyotactic) (&quot;rr&quot;) consists of two adjacent , and a heterotactic triad (&quot;rm&quot;) is composed of an adjacent to an . The mass fraction of isotactic (&quot;mm&quot;) triads is a common quantitative measure of tacticity.

When the stereochemistry of a macromolecule is considered to be a Bernoulli process, the triad composition can be calculated from the probability &quot;P&quot;m of a diad being . For example, when this probability is 0.25 then the probability of finding:
*an isotactic triad is &quot;P&quot;m2, or 0.0625
*an heterotactic triad is 2&quot;P&quot;m(1–&quot;P&quot;m), or 0.375
*a syndiotactic triad is (1–&quot;P&quot;m)2, or 0.5625
with a total probability of 1. Similar relationships with diads exist for tetrads.

===Tetrads, pentads, etc.===
The definition of tetrads and pentads introduce further sophistication and precision to defining tacticity, especially when information on long-range ordering is desirable. Tacticity measurements obtained by carbon-13 NMR are typically expressed in terms of the relative abundance of various pentads within the polymer molecule, e.g. &quot;mmmm&quot;, &quot;mrrm&quot;.

===Other conventions for quantifying tacticity===
The primary convention for expressing tacticity is in terms of the relative weight fraction of triad or higher-order components, as described above. An alternative expression for tacticity is the average length of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sequences within the polymer molecule. The average m-sequence length may be approximated from the relative abundance of pentads as follows:

==Polymers==

===Isotactic polymers===
Isotactic polymers are composed of isotactic macromolecules (IUPAC definition). In isotactic macromolecules, all the substituents are located on the same side of the macromolecular backbone. An isotactic macromolecule consists of 100% , though IUPAC also allows the term for macromolecules with at least 95% if that looser usage is explained. Polypropylene formed by Ziegler–Natta catalysis is an example of an isotactic polymer. Isotactic polymers are usually semicrystalline and often form a helix configuration.
:

===Syndiotactic polymers===
In syndiotactic or syntactic macromolecules the substituents have alternate positions along the chain. The macromolecule comprises 100% , though IUPAC also allows the term for macromolecules with at least 95% if that looser usage is explained. Syndiotactic polystyrene, made by metallocene catalysis polymerization, is crystalline with aa melting point of 161 °C. Gutta percha is also an example syndiotactic polymer.
: 

===Atactic polymers===

In atactic macromolecules the substituents are placed randomly along the chain. The percentage of is understood to be between 45 and 55% unless otherwise specified, but it could be any value other than 0 or 100% if that usage is clarified. With the aid of spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, it is possible to pinpoint the composition of a polymer in terms of the percentages for each triad.

Polymers that are formed by free-radical mechanisms, such as polyvinyl chloride are usually atactic. Due to their random nature atactic polymers are usually amorphous. In &quot;hemi-isotactic macromolecules&quot; every other repeat unit has a random substituent.

Atactic polymers such as polystyrene (PS) are technologically very important. It is possible to obtain syndiotactic polystyrene using a Kaminsky catalyst, but most industrial polystyrene produced is atactic. The two materials have very different properties because the irregular structure of the atactic version makes it impossible for the polymer chains to stack in a regular fashion: whereas syndiotactic PS is a semicrystalline material, the more common atactic version cannot crystallize and forms a &quot;glass&quot; instead. This example is quite general in that many polymers of economic importance are atactic glass formers.

===Eutactic polymers===
In eutactic macromolecules, substituents may occupy any specific (but potentially complex) sequence of positions along the chain. Isotactic and syndiotactic polymers are instances of the more general class of eutactic polymers, which also includes heterogeneous macromolecules in which the sequence consists of substituents of different kinds (for example, the side-chains in proteins and the bases in nucleic acids).

==Head/tail configuration==
In vinyl polymers, the complete configuration can be further described by defining polymer head/tail configuration. In a regular macromolecule, monomer units are normally linked in a head to tail configuration such that β-substituents are located on alternating carbon atoms. However, it is possible for defects to form where substituents are placed on adjacent carbon atoms, producing a head/head tail/tail configuration, such as by recombination of two growing radical chains, or by direct head-head addition if steric effects are weak enough, such as in polyvinylidene fluoride.

==Techniques for measuring tacticity==

Tacticity may be measured directly using proton or carbon-13 NMR. This technique enables quantification of the tacticity distribution by comparison of peak areas or integral ranges corresponding to known diads (r, m), triads (mm, rm+mr, rr) and/or higher order &quot;n&quot;-ads, depending on spectral resolution. In cases of limited resolution, stochastic methods such as Bernoullian or Markovian analysis may also be used to fit the distribution and predict higher &quot;n&quot;-ads and calculate the isotacticity of the polymer to the desired level.

Other techniques sensitive to tacticity include x-ray powder diffraction, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), vibrational spectroscopy (FTIR) and especially two-dimensional techniques. Tacticity may also be inferred by measuring another physical property, such as melting temperature, when the relationship between tacticity and that property is well-established.

<text>Tobacco is the common name of several plants in the genus &quot;Nicotiana&quot; of the family Solanaceae, and the general term for any product prepared from the cured leaves of these plants. More than 70 species of tobacco are known, but the chief commercial crop is &quot;N. tabacum&quot;. The more potent variant &quot;N. rustica&quot; is also used in some countries.

Dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. They can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, and snus.

Tobacco contains the highly addictive stimulant alkaloid nicotine as well as harmala alkaloids. Tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many deadly diseases, especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs as well as many cancers. In 2008, the World Health Organization named tobacco use as the world&#x27;s single greatest preventable cause of death.

==Etymology==
The English word &#x27;tobacco&#x27; originates from the Spanish word &quot;tabaco&quot;. The precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived, at least in part, from Taíno, the Arawakan language of the Caribbean. In Taíno, it was said to mean either a roll of tobacco leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552), or to &quot;tabago&quot;, a kind of L-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo, with the leaves themselves being referred to as &quot;cohiba&quot;).

However, perhaps coincidentally, similar words in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian were used from 1410 for certain medicinal herbs. These probably derived from the Arabic (also ), a word reportedly dating to the ninth century, referring to various herbs.

==History==


===Cultural significance===
According to Iroquois mythology, tobacco first grew out of Earth Woman&#x27;s head after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.

===Traditional use===
Tobacco has long been used in the Americas, with some cultivation sites in Mexico dating back to 1400–1000 BC. Many Native American tribes traditionally grow and use tobacco. Historically, people from the Northeast Woodlands cultures have carried tobacco in pouches as a readily accepted trade item. It was smoked both socially and ceremonially, such as to seal a peace treaty or trade agreement. In some Native cultures, tobacco is seen as a gift from the Creator, with the ceremonial tobacco smoke carrying one&#x27;s thoughts and prayers to the Creator.

Some Native Americans consider tobacco to be a medicine and advocate for its respectful usage, rather than a commercial one. 

===Popularization===
Following the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, tobacco became increasingly popular as a trade item. Francisco Hernández de Toledo, Spanish chronicler of the Indies, was the first European to bring tobacco seeds to the Old World in 1559 following orders of King Philip II of Spain. These seeds were planted in the outskirts of Toledo, more specifically in an area known as &quot;Los Cigarrales&quot; named after the continuous plagues of cicadas (&quot;cigarras&quot; in Spanish). Before the development of the lighter Virginia and white burley strains of tobacco, the smoke was too harsh to be inhaled. Small quantities were smoked at a time, using a pipe like the &quot;midwakh&quot; or &quot;kiseru,&quot; or newly invented waterpipes such as the bong or the hookah (see thuốc lào for a modern continuance of this practice). Tobacco became so popular that the English colony of Jamestown used it as currency and began exporting it as a cash crop; tobacco is often credited as being the export that saved Virginia from ruin. While a lucrative product, the growing expansion of tobacco demand was intimately tied to the history of slavery in the Caribbean. 

The alleged benefits of tobacco also contributed to its success. The astronomer Thomas Harriot, who accompanied Sir Richard Grenville on his 1585 expedition to Roanoke Island, thought that the plant &quot;openeth all the pores and passages of the body&quot; so that the bodies of the natives &quot;are notably preserved in health, and know not many grievous diseases, wherewithal we in England are often times afflicted.&quot;

Production of tobacco for smoking, chewing, and snuffing became a major industry in Europe and its colonies by 1700.

Tobacco has been a major cash crop in Cuba and in other parts of the Caribbean since the 18th century. Cuban cigars are world-famous.

In the late 19th century, cigarettes became popular. James Bonsack invented a machine to automate cigarette production. This increase in production allowed tremendous growth in the tobacco industry until the health revelations of the late 20th century.

===Contemporary===
Following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. In the United States, this led to the adoption of the 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which settled the many lawsuits by the U.S. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.

In the 1970s, Brown &amp; Williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce Y1, a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2 to 3.5%, to 6.5%. In the 1990s, this prompted the Food and Drug Administration to allege that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.

The desire of many addicted smokers to quit has led to the development of tobacco cessation products.

In 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the World Health Organization successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. Between 2019 and 2021, concerns about increased COVID-19 health risks due to tobacco consumption facilitated smoking reduction and cessation.

==Biology==
===&quot;Nicotiana&quot;===


Many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs &quot;Nicotiana&quot;. It is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) indigenous to North and South America, Australia, south west Africa, and the South Pacific.

Most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. However, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. Unlike many other Solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.

Despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on &quot;Nicotiana&quot; species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. For example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobacco&#x27;s gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival. As a result, some tobacco plants (chiefly &quot;N. glauca&quot;) have become established as invasive weeds in some places.

===Types===

The types of tobacco include:
* Aromatic fire-cured is cured by smoke from open fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, central Kentucky, and Virginia. Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes, and as a condiment in pipe tobacco blends. Another fire-cured tobacco is Latakia, which is produced from oriental varieties of &quot;N. tabacum&quot;. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in Cyprus and Syria.
* Brightleaf tobacco is commonly known as &quot;Virginia tobacco&quot;, often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the American Civil War, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the War of 1812, demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that brightleaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Confederate soldiers traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop.
* Broadleaf, a dark tobacco varietal family popular for producing enormous, resilient, and thick wrapper leaves.
* Burley tobacco is an air-cured tobacco used predominantly in cigarette production, but also in pipe tobacco as a balance to Virginias and other leaves high in sugar content. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.
* Cavendish is more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type, but is used to thicken flavors from other tobaccos that might lack a body. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced from any tobacco type but is usually one of, or a blend of, Kentucky, Virginia and burley and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco.
* Criollo tobacco is primarily used in the making of cigars. It was by most accounts one of the original Cuban tobaccos that emerged around the time of Columbus.
* Dokha is a tobacco originally grown in Iran, mixed with leaves, bark and herbs for smoking in a &quot;midwakh&quot;.
* Perique was developed in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, it is used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but it is no longer sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength and coolness to the blend.
* Shade tobacco is cultivated in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes, and began cultivating the plant commercially, though the Puritans referred to it as the &quot;evil weed&quot;. The Connecticut shade industry has weathered some major catastrophes, including a devastating hailstorm in 1929 and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, and is in danger of disappearing altogether, given the increase in the value of land.
* Turkish tobacco is a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (&quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;) grown in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Originally grown in regions historically part of the Ottoman Empire, it is also known as ‘oriental’. Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco. Its main use evolved to be included in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco. (A typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley and Turkish.)
* White burley air-cured leaf was found to be milder than other types of tobacco. In 1865 George Webb of Brown County, Ohio, planted red burley seeds he had purchased and found a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look, which became white burley.
* Wild tobacco is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico and parts of South America. Its botanical name is &quot;Nicotiana rustica&quot;.

===Parasites===

Tobacco, alongside its related products, can be infested by parasites such as the &quot;Lasioderma serricorne&quot; (tobacco beetle) and the &quot;Ephestia elutella&quot; (tobacco moth), which are the most widespread and damaging parasites to the tobacco industry. Infestation can range from the tobacco cultivated in the fields to the leaves used for manufacturing cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes, etc. Both the larvae of &quot;Lasioderma serricorne&quot; and caterpillars of &quot;Ephestia elutella&quot; are considered pests.

==Production==
===Cultivation===

Tobacco is cultivated similarly to other agricultural products. Seeds were at first quickly scattered onto the soil. However, young plants came under increasing attack from flea beetles (&quot;Epitrix cucumeris&quot; or &quot;E. pubescens&quot;), which caused destruction of half the tobacco crops in United States in 1876. By 1890, successful experiments were conducted that placed the plant in a frame covered by thin cotton fabric. Modern tobacco seeds are sown in cold frames or hotbeds, as their germination is activated by light. In the United States, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.

After the plants are about tall, they are transplanted into the fields. Farmers used to have to wait for rainy weather to plant. A hole is created in the tilled earth with a tobacco peg, either a curved wooden tool or deer antler. After making two holes to the right and left, the planter would move forward two feet, select plants from his/her bag, and repeat. Various mechanical tobacco planters like Bemis, New Idea Setter, and New Holland Transplanter were invented in the late 19th and 20th centuries to automate the process: making the hole, watering it, guiding the plant in—all in one motion.

Tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. In the oldest method, still used, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife; it is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick, and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner entails the serial harvest of a number of &quot;primings&quot;, beginning with the &quot;volado&quot; leaves near the ground, working to the &quot;seco&quot; leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent &quot;ligero&quot; leaves at the top. Before harvesting, the crop must be &quot;topped&quot; when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, the harvesting wagons which were used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand.

In the U.S., North Carolina and Kentucky are the leaders in tobacco production, followed by Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina and Pennsylvania.

===Curing===


Curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the &quot;smoothness&quot; of the smoke. Starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, which is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a caramelization process that also adds flavor. Inhalation of these AGEs in tobacco smoke contributes to atherosclerosis and cancer. Levels of AGEs are dependent on the curing method used.

Tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:
* Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry over a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are &#x27;dark&#x27; air-cured.
* Fire-cured tobacco is hung in large barns where fires of hardwoods are kept on continuous or intermittent low smoulder, and takes between three days and ten weeks, depending on the process and the tobacco. Fire curing produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine. Pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff are fire-cured.
* Flue-cured tobacco was originally strung onto tobacco sticks, which were hung from tier poles in curing barns (Aus: kilns, also traditionally called &#x27;oasts&#x27;). These barns have flues run from externally fed fire boxes, heat-curing the tobacco without exposing it to smoke, slowly raising the temperature over the course of the curing. The process generally takes about a week. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine. Most cigarettes incorporate flue-cured tobacco, which produces a milder, more inhalable smoke. It is estimated that 1 tree is cut to flue-cure every 300 cigarettes, resulting in serious environmental consequences.
* Sun-cured tobacco dries uncovered in the sun. This method is used in Turkey, Greece, and other Mediterranean countries to produce oriental tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is low in sugar and nicotine and is used in cigarettes.

Some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as &quot;fermenting&quot; or &quot;sweating&quot;. Cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a &quot;casing&quot; solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.

===Global production===
====Trends====

Production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. China&#x27;s increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China&#x27;s share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by the existence of a low import tariff on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff was reduced from 66% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it has still led to local Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.

====Major producers====
Every year, about 5.9 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. The top producers of tobacco are China (36.3%), India (12.9%), Brazil (11.9%) and Zimbabwe (3.5%).

====China====
Around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation&#x27;s national income. As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China&#x27;s government has acted to reduce tobacco use.

====India====
India&#x27;s Tobacco Board is headquartered in Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh. India has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers and many more who are not registered. In 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of India. Around 0.25% of India&#x27;s cultivated land is used for tobacco production.

Since 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. India has seven tobacco research centers, located in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Mysore, and West Bengal which houses the core research institute.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. Tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the country&#x27;s total cultivated area. In the southern regions of Brazil, Virginia, and Amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and Galpão Comum air-cured tobacco, are produced. These types of tobacco are used for cigarettes. In the northeast, darker, air- and sun-cured tobacco is grown. These types of tobacco are used for cigars, twists, and dark cigarettes. Brazil&#x27;s government has made attempts to reduce the production of tobacco but has not had a successful systematic antitobacco farming initiative. Brazil&#x27;s government, however, provides small loans for family farms, including those that grow tobacco, through the &quot;Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar&quot;.

===Problems in production===

====Child labor====

The International Labour Office reported that the most child-laborers work in agriculture, which is one of the most hazardous types of work. The tobacco industry houses some of these working children. Use of children is widespread on farms in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. While some of these children work with their families on small, family-owned farms, others work on large plantations.
In late 2009, reports were released by the London-based human-rights group Plan International, claiming that child labor was common on Malawi (producer of 1.8% of the world&#x27;s tobacco) tobacco farms. The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007–08 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported experiencing green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to levels of nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes, just through direct contact with tobacco leaves. The effects of nicotine on human brain development in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.

====Economy====

Major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and Japan Tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries. This encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. This surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. According to the World Bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%. Tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.

====Environment====
Tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child&#x27;s lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm their nervous and immune systems.

As with all crops, tobacco crops extract nutrients (such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium) from soil, decreasing its fertility.

Furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. While some big tobacco producers such as China and the United States have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process. Brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.

In 2017 WHO released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.

===Research===
Several tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from &quot;N. tabacum&quot; cultivar &#x27;Bright Yellow-2&#x27;, are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. Tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. The first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. This research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.

===Genetic modification===
Because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first genetically modified (GM) crop to be tested in field trials, in the United States and France in 1986; China became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a GM crop in 1993, which was tobacco.

====Field trials====
Many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. Agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens (viruses, particularly to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV); fungi; bacteria and nematodes); weed management via herbicide tolerance; resistance against insect pests; resistance to drought and cold; and production of useful products such as pharmaceuticals; and use of GM plants for bioremediation, have all been tested in over 400 field trials using tobacco.

====Production====
Currently, only the US is producing GM tobacco. The Chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in China in 1997. From 2002 to 2010, cigarettes made with GM tobacco with reduced nicotine content were available in the US under the market name Quest.

==Consumption==
Tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. Some examples are:

===Enema===
* Tobacco smoke enemas were employed by the indigenous peoples of North America to stimulate respiration, injecting the smoke with a rectal tube. Later, in the 18th century, Europeans emulated the Americans. Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.

===Nasal administration===
* Snuff is a ground smokeless tobacco product, inhaled or ‘snuffed’ through the nose. If referring specifically to the orally consumed moist snuff, see dipping tobacco.

===Smoked===
* Beedi (also known as bidis or biris) are thin, often flavoured cigarettes from India made of tobacco wrapped in a tendu leaf, and secured with coloured thread at one end.
* Cigarettes are a product consumed through inhalation of smoke and manufactured from cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives, then rolled into a paper cylinder.
* Cigars are tightly rolled bundles of dried and fermented tobacco, which are ignited so their smoke may be drawn into the smokers&#x27; mouths.
* Dokha is a middle eastern tobacco with high nicotine levels grown in parts of Oman and Hatta, which is smoked through a thin pipe called a medwakh. It is a form of tobacco which is dried up and ground and contains little to no additives excluding spices, fruits, or flowers to enhance smell and flavor.
* Heat-not-burn products heat rather than burn tobacco to generate an aerosol that contains nicotine.
* Hookah is a single- or multistemmed (often glass-based) water pipe for smoking. Hookahs were first used in India and Persia; the hookah has gained immense popularity, especially in the Middle East. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking herbal fruits or moassel, a mixture of tobacco, flavouring, and honey or glycerin.
* Roll-your-own, often called &#x27;rollies&#x27; or &#x27;roll-ups&#x27;, are relatively popular in some European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually cheaper to make.
* Tobacco pipes typically consist of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed in the chamber and ignited.

===In the mouth===

Tobacco used in the mouth (buccal (sublabial), sublingual):
* Chewing tobacco is the oldest way of consuming tobacco leaves. It is consumed orally, in two forms: through sweetened strands (&quot;chew&quot; or &quot;chaw&quot;), or in a shredded form (&quot;dip&quot;). When consuming the long, sweetened strands, the tobacco is lightly chewed and compacted into a ball. When consuming the shredded tobacco, small amounts are placed inside the bottom lip, between the gum and the teeth, where it is gently compacted, thus it is often called dipping tobacco. Both methods stimulate the salivary glands, which led to the development of the spittoon.
* Creamy snuff is tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as &quot;mishri&quot; in some parts of Maharashtra.
* Dipping tobaccos are a form of smokeless tobacco. Dip is occasionally referred to as &quot;chew&quot;, and because of this it is commonly confused with chewing tobacco, which encompasses a wider range of products. A small clump of dip is &#x27;pinched&#x27; out of the tin and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. Some brands, as with snus, are portioned in small, porous pouches for less mess.
* Gutka is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-sized packets.
* Kreteks are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves, and a flavoring &quot;sauce&quot;. They were first introduced in the 1880s in Kudus, Java, to deliver the medicinal eugenol of cloves to the lungs.
* Pituri, a nicotine-containing substance traditionally made from Australian tobacco plants, used by Indigenous Australians for chewing and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums.
* Snus is a steam-pasteurized moist powdered tobacco product that is not fermented and induces minimal salivation. It is consumed by placing it (loose or in little pouches) against the upper gums for an extended period of time. It is somewhat similar to dipping tobacco but does not require spitting and is significantly lower in TSNAs.
* Tobacco chewing gum A gum containing nicotine or tobacco designed to be chewed.
* Tobacco edibles, often in the form of an infusion or a spice, have gained popularity in recent years.
* Tobacco water is a traditional organic insecticide used in domestic gardening. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or painted onto the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is, however, banned from use as a pesticide in certified organic production by the USDA&#x27;s National Organic Program.

===Topical===
* Topical tobacco paste is sometimes used as a treatment for wasp, hornet, fire ant, scorpion, and bee stings. An amount equivalent to the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a half a teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected area.

==Influence==

===Social===
Smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and smoking by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in Japan, during the Edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. The same was true in 19th-century Europe.

Following the American Civil War, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. Modern tobacco use has often been stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns. Bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal. Due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.

===Religion===

====Christianity====
In Christian denominations of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, the use of tobacco and other drugs is prohibited; ¶42 of the 2014 Book of Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection states:

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (popularly known as Mormons) adhere to the Word of Wisdom, a religious health code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco as well as alcohol, coffee, and tea.

====Islam====

Most Islamic scholars have condemned tobacco due to its harmful effects on health. The earliest fatwa (religious opinion) against tobacco use dates from 1602. Most major Islamic sects prohibit its use. While tobacco is not mentioned in the Quran, the Quran does instruct Muslims to live healthy lives.

====Sikhism====

Sikhism, a Dharmic religion from India, considers tobacco consumption as a taboo and very bad for health and spirituality. Initiated Sikhs are never to consume tobacco in any form.

===Demographic===
Research on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. An estimated 1.1 billion people, and up to one-third of the adult population, use tobacco in some form. Smoking is more prevalent among men (however, the gender gap declines with age), the poor, and in transitional or developing countries. A study published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that in 2019 approximately one in four youths (23.0%) in the U.S. had used a tobacco product during the past 30 days. This represented approximately three in 10 high school students (31.2%) and approximately one in eight middle school students (12.5%).

Rates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries. Smoking rates in the United States have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults. In the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.

===Health effects===

====Chemicals====
Tobacco smoking harms health because of the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke, including carbon monoxide, cyanide, and carcinogens, which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and cancer.
Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to the harmful effects of smoking.

According to the World Health Organization, tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. WHO estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describe tobacco use as &quot;the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide.&quot; Due to these health consequences, it is estimated that a 10 hectare (approximately 24.7 acre) field of tobacco used for cigarettes causes 30 deaths per year – 10 from lung cancer and 20 from cigarette-induced diseases like cardiac arrest, gangrene, bladder cancer, mouth cancer, etc.

The harms caused by inhaling tobacco smoke include diseases of the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema), and cancer (particularly cancers of the lungs, larynx, mouth, and pancreas). Cancer is caused by inhaling carcinogenic substances in tobacco smoke.

Inhaling secondhand tobacco smoke (which has been exhaled by a smoker) can cause lung cancer in nonsmoking adults. In the United States, about 3,000 adults die each year due to lung cancer from secondhand smoke exposure. Heart disease caused by secondhand smoke kills around 46,000 nonsmokers every year.

In children, exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke is associated with a higher incidence and severity of respiratory illnesses, middle ear disease, and asthma attacks. Each year in the United States, secondhand smoke exposure causes 24,500 infants to be born with low birthweight, 71,900 preterm births, 202,300 episodes of asthma, and 790,000 health care visits for ear infections.

The addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. In drug effect preference questionnaires, a rough indicator of addictive potential, nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids. Users typically develop tolerance and dependence. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of psychological enforcement value. In one medical study, tobacco&#x27;s overall harm to user and self was determined at three percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking sixth most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.

Tobacco also contains 2,3,6-Trimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (sometimes called 2,3,6-TQ and TMN) which is a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor of type A and B with a binding affinity somewhat similar to that of clorgyline and deprenyl. It is a stronger dopamine releasing agent than nicotine and inhibits dopamine metabolism from its MAOI activity. Tobacco also contains Harmine and Norharmine which is a reversible MAO-A inhibitor. The MAO-A activity of tobacco alkaloids have been thought to play a role in the addictive qualities of tobacco.

====Radioactivity====
Polonium-210 is a radioactive trace contaminant of tobacco, providing additional explanation for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer.
The radioactive particles build up over time in the lungs and a UCLA study has estimated that the radiation from 25 years of smoking would cause over 120 deaths per thousand smokers.

===Economic===
Tobacco makes a significant economic contribution. The global tobacco market in 2010 was estimated at US$760 billion, excluding China. The global revenues from tobacco taxes in 2013–2014 was approximately $269 billion.

In China, cigarette manufacturing is one of the few profitable state-owned industries. For example, in 1998 the 1 429 state-owned enterprises in Yunnan province had revenue of Renminbi (RMB) 69.1 billion (US$8.3 billion) while 8 cigarette manufacturing plants alone accounted for about 53 percent (or RMB 36.2 billion) of total provincial industry sales. The Chinese government also collects tax on tobacco products. Tax revenues from cigarettes increased from 740 to 842 billion Chinese yuan between 2014 and 2016. This generated an additional 101 billion Chinese yuan in tax revenues for the government.

In India, tobacco generates approximately 20 billion Indian rupees (US$0.45 billion) of income per annum as a result of employment, income and government revenue.

Statistica estimates that in the U.S. alone, the tobacco industry has a market of US$121 billion, despite the fact the CDC reports that US smoking rates are declining steadily. In terms of health expenditures, cigarette smoking contributed to more than $225 billion (or 11.7%) of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. in 2014. Smoking-attributable healthcare spending increased more than 30% for Medicaid between 2010 and 2014.

In the US, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the Tobacco Transition Payment Program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging.

Of the 1.22 billion smokers worldwide, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies, and much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor. While smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others, and is increasing among women and in developing countries. Between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. Women&#x27;s smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.

Tobacco users must also spend a significant amount of money on cigarettes to maintain regular use, as tobacco products are often heavily taxed by governments. For example, a pack a day smoker in the state of New York would have to spend around $4,690.25 a year on cigarettes alone.

In Indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. In Egypt, more than 10% of low-income household expenditure is on tobacco. The poorest 20% of households in Mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.

===Advertising===

The tobacco industry advertises its products through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. Because of the health risks of these products, this is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. Some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.

<text>The [[national anthem]] of [[South Africa]] was adopted in 1997 and is a hybrid song combining extracts of the 19th century Xhosa hymn &quot;&quot; (, ) and the Afrikaans song that was used as the South African national anthem during the apartheid era, &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; (), with new English lyrics.

The anthem is often referred to by its incipit of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;, but this has never been its official title, which is simply &quot;National Anthem of South Africa&quot;.

The committee responsible for this new composition included Anna Bender, Elize Botha, Richard Cock, Dolf Havemann (Secretary), Mzilikazi Khumalo (chairman), Masizi Kunene, John Lenake, Fatima Meer, Khabi Mngoma, Wally Serote, Johan de Villiers, and Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph.

==Structure==
The lyrics employ the five most widely spoken of South Africa&#x27;s twelve official languages – Xhosa (first stanza, first two lines), Zulu (first stanza, last two lines), Sesotho (second stanza), Afrikaans (third stanza), and English (final stanza). The lyrics are sung in these languages regardless of the native language of the singer. The first half was arranged by Mzilikazi Khumalo and the latter half of the song was arranged by Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph, who also wrote the final verse. The fact that it shifts (modulates) and ends in a different key (from G major to D major) a feature that it shares with the Italian, Spanish, and the Philippine national anthems, makes it compositionally unusual.

==History==
===Background===
From the late 1940s to the early 1990s, South Africa was governed by a system known as apartheid, a widely condemned system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination that was based on white supremacy and the repression of the black majority for the benefit of the politically and economically dominant Afrikaner minority and other whites. During this period, South Africa&#x27;s national anthem was &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot;, also known as &quot;Die Stem&quot;, an Afrikaans-language song that chronicled the Voortrekkers and the Great Trek. &quot;Die Stem&quot; is a poem written by C. J. Langenhoven in 1918 and was set to music by Marthinus Lourens de Villiers in 1921. &quot;Die Stem&quot; () was the co-national anthem with &quot;God Save the King&quot; between 1938 and 1957, when it became the sole national anthem until 1994. &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; was composed of eight stanzas: the original four in Afrikaans and four in English - a translation of the Afrikaans with a few modifications. It was seldom sung in its entirety; usually, the first stanza was the most widely known and sung sometimes followed by the last stanza.

When apartheid came to an end in the early 1990s, the future of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; was called into question. It was ultimately retained as the national anthem, though &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;, a Xhosa language song that was used by the anti-apartheid movement, was also introduced and adopted as a second national anthem of equal standing. &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; was composed by a Methodist school teacher named Enoch Sontonga in 1897. It was first sung as a church hymn but later became an act of political defiance against the apartheid regime.

The South African government adopted both songs as dual national anthems in 1994, when they were performed at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s inauguration.

For the 1995 Rugby World Cup, Morné du Plessis suggested that the Springboks learn all the words of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;, and &quot;they did so with great feeling&quot;, according to their instructor Anne Munnik.

===Inception===
The practice of having two national anthems proved to be a cumbersome arrangement as performing both of them took as much as five minutes. This was rectified when South Africa&#x27;s dual national anthems were merged in abridged forms in early 1997 to form the current national anthem. The new national anthem was performed at an opening of the South African parliament in February 1997, and was published in the South African &quot;Government Gazette&quot; on 10 October 1997. During the drafting of the new national anthem, it was requested by South African president Nelson Mandela that it be not more than one minute and 48 seconds in length (which was the average length of other countries&#x27; anthems being used for reference). The new English lyrics were adapted from the last four lines of the first stanza of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; (), with the changes made to reflect hope in post-apartheid South African society.

Lines borrowed from the two previous national anthems were modified to be more inclusive, omitting overt reference to specific groups of the country&#x27;s population groups. Thus, lines from the apartheid-era national anthem&#x27;s first stanza referencing the Voortrekkers&#x27; Great Trek were omitted, as &quot;this was the experience of only one section of&quot; South African society. Likewise, the words &quot;Woza Moya&quot;, used in &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; were also omitted, as the phrase is a specifically Christian reference, rather than a generically religious one, and thus not acceptable to South Africans of other religions, particularly Muslim South Africans. A new verse found in neither song was also added. The English version of &quot;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&quot; was less prominent than the Afrikaans version and thus could be changed with little objection or controversy. As such, the English portion of the new South African national anthem was the one that had its lyrics changed from the previous version.

===Criticism===
In recent years, the South African national anthem has come under criticism for its Afrikaans verse as it was originally part of the national anthem of South Africa that was used during the apartheid era, with some such as the Economic Freedom Fighters calling for the verse to be removed, supposedly because of this connection. Others defend the inclusion of the verse, pointing out that it is included in large part due to the wishes of the first post-apartheid South African president, Nelson Mandela, who intended its inclusion as a reconciliatory measure for the post-apartheid future of South Africa.

<text>The Undertones are a rock band formed in Derry, Northern Ireland in 1974. From 1975 to 1983, the Undertones consisted of Feargal Sharkey (vocals), John O&#x27;Neill (rhythm guitar, vocals), Damian O&#x27;Neill (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Bradley (bass, vocals) and Billy Doherty (drums). Much of the earlier Undertones material drew influence from punk rock and new wave; the Undertones also incorporated elements of rock, glam rock and post-punk into material released after 1979, before citing soul and Motown as the influence for the material released upon their final album. The Undertones released thirteen singles and four studio albums between 1978 and 1983 before Sharkey announced his intention to leave the band in May 1983, citing musical differences as the reason for the break up.

Despite the backdrop of the Troubles in Derry and across Northern Ireland, the vast majority (though not all) of the material the Undertones released focused not upon the political climate, but upon issues such as adolescence, teenage angst and heartbreak. &quot;AllMusic&quot; has stated that guitarists John and Damian O&#x27;Neill &quot;mated infectious guitar hooks to 1960s garage, 1970s glam rock, and Feargal Sharkey&#x27;s signature vocal quaver.&quot;

In 1999, the Undertones reformed, replacing lead singer Sharkey with Paul McLoone.

The Undertones remain the most successful band to have emerged from Derry, and one of the most successful bands to have emerged from Northern Ireland.

==Formation and early gigs==
The Undertones formed in Derry, Northern Ireland in 1974. The band members were five friends from Creggan and the Bogside, who originally drew inspiration from such artists as the Beatles, Small Faces and Lindisfarne and who decided in part to form their own band due to both their common interest in music and the fact that—because of the Troubles—many entertainment venues in the city were closed in late evenings.

The band initially rehearsed cover versions at the home of the guitarists, brothers John and Vincent O&#x27;Neill, and in the shed of a neighbour. (In early 1976, before the band had played gigs at any venues, Vincent O&#x27;Neill left the band; he was soon replaced by his younger brother Damian.)

Beginning in February 1976 the group, at this stage still unnamed, began playing gigs at various minor local venues, including schools, parish halls and Scout huts, where the band&#x27;s lead singer, Feargal Sharkey, was a local Scout leader. Sharkey was also responsible for giving the band their first name: at the introduction to a gig at Saint Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School in Derry on 16 March 1976, Feargal Sharkey was asked the name of the band and quickly replied &quot;The Hot Rods&quot;. At a later gig, Sharkey named the band &quot;Little Feat&quot;: another name already used by another group.

Later that year, drummer Billy Doherty proposed an alternate name for the group: The Undertones, which Doherty had discovered in his school history book. The other members of the band agreed to the proposal.

With the arrival of punk rock in late 1976, the artistic focus of the band changed. Artists such as the Adverts, Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks and, particularly, the Ramones became major influences on the Undertones.

In addition to being a Scout leader, Feargal Sharkey worked as a television repairman and delivery man. The van which Sharkey drove in this employment was used by the Undertones to transport their equipment to and from various venues.

===The Casbah===
By 1977 the band were performing their own three-chord pop punk material, which was performed alongside cover versions at concerts, primarily at the Casbah Bar, where the band began to perform in February. The Undertones had occasionally earned money at venues where they had performed throughout 1976, but these gigs at the Casbah were the first performances for which the Undertones were paid on a regular basis, as performing at the Casbah earned the group up to £30 for each attendance fee. Both the money earned and their popularity at this venue inspired the band to write and rehearse further material, as a means of remaining a popular act at the Casbah. By the following year, the concerts the Undertones performed would include the song &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot;, which had been written by guitarist John O&#x27;Neill in mid-1977. The gigs performed at the Casbah gave the Undertones increased confidence in their musical ability, and in June 1977 they performed concerts outside Derry for the first time, supporting a Dublin punk group named The Radiators from Space.

In March 1978, the Undertones recorded a demo tape at Magee University in Derry and sent copies of the tape to various record companies in the hope of securing a record deal, but only received official letters of rejection. On 15 June 1978, the band recorded their debut four-song EP &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; on a budget of only £200. The EP was engineered by Davy Shannon at Wizard Studios, Belfast, and was released on Belfast&#x27;s Good Vibrations record label. The title song became a hit with support from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who considered &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; his all-time favourite song, an opinion he held through to his death in 2004.

==Sire Records==
Seymour Stein, the president of Sire Records – in London on business – heard John Peel play &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; on BBC Radio 1 and became interested in the band. Stein sent a London-based representative named Paul McNally to Derry to discuss a record deal with the band. McNally saw the band play live in what would ultimately prove to be their final performance at the Casbah on 29 September 1978. The following day, McNally convened with the Undertones to discuss a record contract. Three members of the band signed the proposed contract on this date, with the understanding that Feargal Sharkey and Michael Bradley would discuss negotiations to the contract with Seymour Stein in person in London.
===&quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; (1978–1979)===
On 2 October 1978, Bradley and Sharkey agreed to an increased advance fee of £10,000 offered by Stein upon the recording contract and signed to Sire Records on a five-year contract. Sire Records subsequently obtained all rights to the material released upon the Teenage Kicks EP and the song was re-released as a standard vinyl single upon Sire&#x27;s own label two weeks later.

On 26 October, the Undertones performed &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. With help from Peel (who had also recorded and broadcast a &quot;Peel Session&quot; with the Undertones on the 16th), Teenage Kicks peaked at number 31 in the UK Singles Chart the following month.
In November 1978, the Undertones embarked on their first tour of the UK. This tour lasted until 16 December and saw the band appear as the supporting act for The Rezillos and John Otway in England and Wales in addition to headlining in three concerts in Belfast and Derry.

In January 1979, the Undertones recorded their eponymous debut album at Eden Studios in Acton, West London, using producer Roger Bechirian, whom the band had worked with for the first time the previous December, when Bechirian had produced the band&#x27;s second single, &quot;Get Over You&quot;. Much of the material upon their first album had been performed regularly at the Casbah, and the band were able to record this album in the space of less than four weeks.

Following the release of &quot;Get Over You&quot; in February 1979, the Undertones&#x27; eponymous debut album was released in May. The primary lyrical concern of the songs focused upon youthful relationships and adolescence. Three further punk singles: &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Summer&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got My Number (Why Don&#x27;t You Use It?)&quot; were released between April and October 1979, each to critical acclaim. In September 1979, the Undertones toured the United States for the first time, supporting The Clash with eight concerts in six different States.

===&quot;Hypnotised&quot; (1980)===
Following the &#x27;You Got My Number tour&#x27; of October 1979, the Undertones began recording the songs for their second album, &quot;Hypnotised&quot;, at Wisseloord Studios in the Netherlands. The recording of the songs began in December. Ten songs were recorded before the band returned to Derry prior to Christmas to write and record further songs for the album. Three further songs were written during this break: &quot;Tearproof&quot;, &quot;More Songs About Chocolate and Girls&quot; and &quot;Wednesday Week&quot;.

In January 1980, the production of &quot;Hypnotised&quot; was finished at Eden Studios in London, with the Undertones recording the three further songs written the previous December, plus two further songs: &quot;Hypnotised&quot; and a cover of &quot;Under The Boardwalk&quot;. Following the completion of their second LP, the band embarked upon a two-week tour of Ireland before touring continental Europe for the first time in March.

On 28 March 1980, the Undertones released their sixth single, &quot;My Perfect Cousin&quot;. The song, which had been written the previous summer by Damian O&#x27;Neill and Michael Bradley, reached number 9 in the UK charts and would subsequently prove to be the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United Kingdom. The following month, on 21 April 1980, the band&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Hypnotised&quot; was released. This album reached number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, remaining in the Top 10 for one month. The same week the album was released, the Undertones embarked on their &#x27;Humming tour&#x27;, which saw the band play a total of 25 gigs across the UK between April and June.

Less than two weeks after the completion of the &#x27;Humming tour&#x27;, the Undertones toured the United States for the second time, this time as the headlining band. &quot;Wednesday Week&quot;—the second single to be released from &quot;Hypnotised&quot;—was released in July 1980. This single reached number 11 in the UK chart and remained in the Top 40 for a total of seven weeks.

Between September and December 1980, the Undertones performed two further tours: the &#x27;Disaster Tour (European Style)&#x27;, which saw the band perform in continental Europe and—in December—the &#x27;See No More&#x27; tour of the UK.

In terms of chart sales, the year 1980 was the Undertones&#x27; most successful year. In a review by &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine the same year, the Undertones were described as: &quot;Possibly the best pop group in the English speaking world.&quot;

==EMI==
===&quot;Positive Touch&quot; (1981–1982)===
In December 1980, the Undertones announced their intention to split from Sire Records as they were unhappy with the lack of promotion they were receiving outside of the UK, particularly in the US. Following negotiations, their manager, Andy Ferguson, succeeded in the band retaining ownership rights to the material released on Sire Records; Ferguson subsequently signed the group to EMI in March 1981.

On 4 January 1981, the band began recording their third album, &quot;Positive Touch&quot;, again at Wisseloord Studios, and again with Roger Bechirian as producer. The band recorded a total of eight songs in five days before returning to Derry. Later the same month, the band returned to Wisseloord Studios to complete the recording of the LP. The songs on this album indicated a change in both musical and lyrical influences: although the songs remained largely guitar-oriented, the band had written songs which focused upon the Troubles in Northern Ireland such as &quot;Crisis of Mine&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; and the single &quot;It&#x27;s Going To Happen!&quot;, which preceded the release of the LP and was inspired by the 1980–81 Hunger Strikes. In addition, several songs upon the LP included instruments such as pianos, saxophones, recorders and brass instruments, with two further songs (&quot;Julie Ocean&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Going To Happen!&quot;) drawing musical inspiration from contemporary artists Orange Juice and Dexy&#x27;s Midnight Runners respectively. The band themselves were content with the change of influences for &quot;Positive Touch&quot;, which bassist Michael Bradley later described as a &quot;natural progression&quot; for the band, adding that, at the time, consensus between the band members was that the songs upon the LP were their best yet.

One month prior to the release of this third album, in April 1981, the Undertones embarked on their &#x27;Positive Touch tour&#x27;; this tour saw the band perform a total of 36 gigs across the UK mainland in the space of less than two months.

&quot;Positive Touch&quot; was released in May 1981. This third album peaked at number 17 in the UK charts—remaining in the Top 40 for a total of four weeks. The album also received favourable reviews from several music critics and was listed by &quot;NME&quot; as one of the best albums to be released in 1981, although neither the album nor either of the singles released were as successful as any of the material released the previous year.

Following the conclusion of their &#x27;Positive Touch tour&#x27; in June 1981, the Undertones released their second single of 1981, &quot;Julie Ocean&quot;. The single – an extended recording of the 90-second album version – was produced by Hugh Jones and Dave Balfe.
On 29 September 1981, the Undertones embarked on their biggest tour of continental Europe, which lasted until 20 October 1981 and saw the band perform a total of 19 concerts in six countries.

1982 saw a lull in activity from the Undertones, who only performed live on a total of five occasions throughout the entire year. Two of these gigs were held in England, with three further live appearances held in the United States in August. Much of the time the band spent together was devoted towards writing and recording songs for their next LP in their 8-track demo studio. Damian O&#x27;Neill, the Undertones&#x27; lead guitarist, later admitted: &quot;We (had) definitely lost a bit of the spark. I don&#x27;t know but I tend to think some of us got too complacent sitting in our homes in Derry.&quot; The Undertones released two studio singles, &quot;Beautiful Friend&quot; and &quot;The Love Parade&quot;, in February and October; both of these singles failed to make an impact upon the UK charts.

===&quot;The Sin of Pride&quot; (1983)===
In March 1983, the Undertones released their fourth album, &quot;The Sin of Pride&quot;. This album, which drew inspiration from both soul and Motown, was produced by Mike Hedges, who had replaced Roger Bechirian as the Undertones&#x27; producer following the 1981 release of &quot;Positive Touch&quot;. Feargal Sharkey is known to have stated he had worked harder upon this album than at any point in his singing career to date, and that he considers this album the finest the Undertones ever produced. &quot;The Sin of Pride&quot; was met with critical acclaim upon release, and the Undertones performed several gigs in both Scotland and England to promote the release of this album; it reached number 43 in the UK chart.

The Undertones released two further studio singles in 1983; their first single, &quot;Got To Have You Back&quot;—an Isley Brothers cover which was inspired by both ABC and Smokey Robinson—was released in February and their second single, &quot;Chain of Love&quot;, was released in May. Both failed to make any major impact on the UK chart.

==Disbandment==
In April 1983, the Undertones embarked on their &#x27;UK Sin of Pride tour&#x27; to promote their latest album. By this stage in their career, the band were acutely aware of the pressure they were under from EMI, who were unhappy with the lack of chart success of much of the material the band had released since the release of their &quot;Positive Touch&quot; LP. In addition, relations between various members of the band, in particular between Feargal Sharkey and John O&#x27;Neill, had deteriorated significantly. These factors led to Sharkey announcing his intentions to leave the Undertones during the &#x27;European Tour 1983&#x27;, which the group performed in May of that year.

To fulfill agreed commitments, the Undertones remained together for a further two months, performing several gigs across continental Europe before disbanding in mid-1983, with their final concert being played at Punchestown Racecourse in County Kildare in Ireland on 17 July.

==Subsequent careers==
Following the disbandment of the Undertones in 1983, Feargal Sharkey was invited by Vince Clarke and Eric Radcliffe of the synthpop duet The Assembly to provide lead vocals on the single &quot;Never Never&quot;, which was released by The Assembly in November 1983 and peaked at number 4 in the UK charts. Sharkey was never officially a member of The Assembly and his vocal contribution to &quot;Never Never&quot; proved to be Sharkey&#x27;s only recording with the band, who would only issue this one single before folding.

Sharkey subsequently embarked upon a brief, but commercially successful solo career in the mid-1980s to early 1990s.

Two of the other band members, John O&#x27;Neill and Damian O&#x27;Neill, formed That Petrol Emotion in 1984. That Petrol Emotion released a total of fifteen singles and six albums between 1985 and 1994.

In the 1990s John O&#x27;Neill formed a trip hop group called Rare under the stage name Seán Ó&#x27;Néill with vocalist Mary Gallagher. They only had one notable chart appearance and disbanded shortly after the release of their only album in 1998.
==Reunion==
The Undertones reformed in November 1999, initially to play concerts in Derry. For their reformation, the Undertones replaced Sharkey (who had declined to rejoin the band) with singer Paul McLoone. Since 1999, the Undertones have performed several tours across the UK, Ireland, Continental Europe, Japan, Turkey and North America and continue to perform live.

Noteworthy gigs by the Undertones since their 1999 reformation include performing at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2005 and 2022, providing pre-match entertainment prior to kick-off at Celtic Park in the UEFA Champions League play-off between Celtic and Arsenal in August 2009 and, in March and April 2011, performing a series of UK gigs in which they played their debut album, &quot;The Undertones,&quot; in its entirety as part of each show. This tour was timed to accompany a re-release of a double compilation album containing all of the A- and B-sides of their singles.

Since their reformation, the Undertones have released two albums of original material with Paul McLoone providing vocals: &quot;Get What You Need&quot; on 30 September 2003; and &quot;Dig Yourself Deep&quot;, on 15 October 2007.

In April 2013, the Undertones released their first new material for over five years with the double A-side single &quot;Much Too Late / When It Hurts I Count To Ten&quot;. This single—limited to 1,000 numbered copies—was released as part of the Record Store Day promotion in the UK and was recorded at Toe Rag Studios in London.

==Media recognition==
In a 2000 poll by &quot;Q&quot; to discover the 100 greatest British albums of all time as voted by the British public, the Undertones&#x27; eponymous debut LP was voted the 90th greatest British album.

The Undertones have also been the subject of two documentaries: The first documentary to be produced: &quot;The Story of the Undertones: Teenage Kicks&quot;, was recorded in 2001 and released in 2004. Directed by Tom Collins, this 65-minute documentary was produced with the cooperation of John Peel, who interviews all current and former members of the band (with the exception of Vincent O&#x27;Neill) in addition to Seymour Stein and Eamonn McCann. In this documentary, the band discuss their formation, career, subsequent careers, personal lives and 1999 reunion.

The second documentary relating to The Undertones: &quot;Here Comes the Summer: The Undertones Story&quot;, was commissioned by the BBC and broadcast on BBC Four in September 2012. This documentary also features with interviews with current and former members of the Undertones (excluding Feargal Sharkey) in addition to numerous fans, friends, journalists, and additional personnel involved in the band&#x27;s recordings and career.

The band were also portrayed in the 2013 film &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; about Terri Hooley and the Good Vibrations record label, featuring Jodie Whittaker and Richard Dormer.

<text>Thomas Andrew Lehrer (; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician, who later taught mathematics and musical theater. He recorded pithy and humorous, often political songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is &quot;The Elements&quot;, in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of Penzance&quot;.

Lehrer&#x27;s early performances dealt with non-topical subjects and black humor (also known as dark comedy) in songs such as &quot;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&quot;. In the 1960s, he produced songs about timely social and political issues, particularly for the U.S. version of the television show &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend&#x27;s explanation: &quot;Always predict the worst and you&#x27;ll be hailed as a prophet.&quot; In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performance to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Early life==

Thomas Andrew Lehrer was born on April 9, 1928, to a secular Jewish family and grew up on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. He is the son of Morris James Lehrer (1897–1986) and Anna Lehrer (née Waller; 1905–1978) and older brother of Barry Waller Lehrer (1930–2007). He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother sent him to a popular-music piano teacher. At this early age, he began writing show tunes, which eventually helped him as a satirical composer and writer in his years of lecturing at Harvard University and later at other universities.

Lehrer attended the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale, New York, part of the Bronx. He also attended Camp Androscoggin, both as a camper and a counselor. Lehrer was considered a child prodigy and entered Harvard College, where one of his professors was Irving Kaplansky, at the age of 15 after graduating from Loomis School. As a mathematics undergraduate student at Harvard College, he began to write comic songs, to entertain his friends, including &quot;Fight Fiercely, Harvard&quot;. Those songs were later named collectively the &quot;Physical Revue&quot;, a joking reference to a leading scientific journal, the &quot;Physical Review&quot;.

==Academic and military career==
Lehrer graduated bachelor of arts in mathematics from Harvard University, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, in 1946. At Harvard, he was the roommate of the Canadian theologian Robert Crouse. He received his MA degree the next year and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. He later taught mathematics and other classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Lehrer remained in Harvard&#x27;s doctoral program for several years, taking time also for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

Lehrer was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1955 and served until 1957, working at the National Security Agency (NSA). Lehrer once stated that he invented the Jello shot during this time, as a means of circumventing the naval base&#x27;s ban on alcoholic beverages. 
Despite holding a master&#x27;s degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked high school diplomas, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of specialist third class, which he described as being a &quot;corporal without portfolio&quot;. These experiences became fodder for songs, such as &quot;The Wild West is Where I Want to Be&quot; and &quot;It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier&quot;. In 2020 Lehrer publicly revealed that he had been assigned to the NSA; since the mere fact of the NSA&#x27;s existence was classified at the time, Lehrer found himself in the position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as a cover story for something more sensitive.

In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time math studies at Harvard. From 1962 he taught mathematics in the political science department at MIT. In 1965 he gave up on his mathematics dissertation on modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.

In 1972, Lehrer joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled &quot;The Nature of Mathematics&quot; to liberal arts majors—&quot;math for tenors&quot;, according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures.

In 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class, on the topic of infinity, and retired from academia. He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still &quot;hangs out&quot; around the University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Musical career==
===Style and influences===
Lehrer was mainly influenced by musical theater. According to Gerald Nachman&#x27;s book &quot;Seriously Funny&quot;, the Broadway musical &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot; made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrer&#x27;s style consists of parodying various forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to write &quot;The Elements&quot;, which lists the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot;.

In author and Boston University professor Isaac Asimov&#x27;s second autobiographical volume, &quot;In Joy Still Felt&quot;, Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang a song about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, &quot;...and after a while you gathered the &#x27;it&#x27; was venereal disease. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable outside a nightclub.&quot; (The song was likely &quot;I Got It From Agnes&quot;.) Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to &quot;The Subway Song&quot; in his book. &quot;I haven&#x27;t gone to nightclubs often,&quot; said Asimov, &quot;but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time.&quot;

===Recordings===
Lehrer was encouraged by the success of his performances, so he paid $15 () for some studio time in 1953 to record &quot;Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot;. The initial pressing was 400 copies. Radio stations would not air his songs because of his controversial subjects, so he sold the album on campus at Harvard for $3, , while &quot;several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price.&quot; After one summer, he started to receive mail orders from all parts of the country, as far away as San Francisco, after the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote an article on the record. Interest in his recordings spread by word of mouth. People played their records for friends, who then also wanted a copy. Lehrer recalled, &quot;Lacking exposure in the media, my songs spread slowly. Like herpes, rather than ebola.&quot;

The album included the macabre &quot;I Hold Your Hand in Mine&quot;, the mildly risqué &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, and &quot;Lobachevsky&quot; regarding plagiarizing mathematicians. It became a cult success by word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. The limited distribution of the album led to a knock off album by Jack &quot;Enjal&quot; (a pseudonym of Jack Nagel) being released in 1958 without Lehrer&#x27;s approval, where some of the lyrics were mistranscribed.

Lehrer embarked on a series of concert tours and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but &quot;More of Tom Lehrer&quot; was a studio recording and &quot;An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer&quot; was recorded live in concert. In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for &quot;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&quot;, which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn:

===Touring===

Lehrer had a breakthrough in the United Kingdom on December 4, 1957, when the University of London awarded a doctor of music degree &quot;honoris causa&quot; to Princess Margaret, and the public orator, Professor J. R. Sutherland, said it was &quot;in the full knowledge that the Princess is a connoisseur of music and a performer of skill and distinction, her taste being catholic, ranging from Mozart to the calypso and from opera to the songs of Miss Beatrice Lillie and Tom Lehrer.&quot; This prompted significant interest in Lehrer&#x27;s works and helped to secure distribution in Britain for his five-year-old debut album. It was there that his music achieved real sales popularity, as a result of the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and inadvertently due to the BBC, which in 1958 banned from broadcast 10 of the 12 songs on the album. By the end of the 1950s, Lehrer had sold 370,000 records.

===&quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;===
In 1960, Lehrer essentially retired from touring in the U.S. The same year, he toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim and controversy. While in New Zealand, he penned lyrics critical of the All Blacks&#x27; upcoming tour of Apartheid-era South Africa and Prime Minister Walter Nash&#x27;s stance on it. Lehrer&#x27;s tours occurred during a time in which he was, he said, &quot;banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest&quot;. In particular, &quot;Be Prepared&quot; drew advance resistance in Brisbane from the commissioner of police. He performed several songs in Australia that were still unreleased, including &quot;The Masochism Tango&quot;. In the early 1960s, he was employed as the resident songwriter for the U.S. edition of &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot; (TW3), a satirical television show.

A greater proportion of his output became overtly political, or at least topical, on subjects such as education (&quot;New Math&quot;), the Second Vatican Council (&quot;The Vatican Rag&quot;), race relations (&quot;National Brotherhood Week&quot;), air and water pollution (&quot;Pollution&quot;), American militarism (&quot;Send the Marines&quot;), and nuclear proliferation (&quot;Who&#x27;s Next?&quot; and &quot;MLF Lullaby&quot;). He also wrote a song satirizing rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who worked for Nazi Germany before working for the United States. Lehrer did not appear on TW3; vocalist Nancy Ames performed his songs (to Lehrer&#x27;s chagrin), and lines were often cut from his songs. Lehrer later performed nine of these songs at the Hungry i nightclub in San Francisco, and this became the album &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot; (1965).

In 1966, BBC TV host David Frost returned to the UK with the BBC program &quot;The Frost Report&quot;; alongside Julie Felix, Lehrer provided musical satire on the weekly subject. The show was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance. Lehrer was not featured in every edition, but his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show. At least two of his songs were not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;That is the End of the News&quot; (with some new lyrics) and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the coming of decimal currency. The record deal with Reprise Records for &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot; also gave Reprise distribution rights for his earlier recordings, because Lehrer wanted to wind up his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of &quot;Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot; was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, as Lehrer was unhappy with this version. The live recording included bonus tracks &quot;L-Y&quot; and &quot;Silent E&quot;, two of the ten songs that he wrote for the PBS children&#x27;s educational series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot; went gold. The album liner notes promote his songs with self-deprecating humor, such as quoting a &quot;New York Times&quot; review from 1959: Mr. Lehrer&#x27;s muse is &quot;not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste&quot;.

Lehrer toured Sweden, Norway and Denmark in 1967; his concert in Oslo was recorded for Danish television and subsequently released on DVD some 40 years later. He performed as a prominent international guest at the &quot;Studenterforeningen&quot; (student association) in Copenhagen, which was televised, and he commented on stage that he might be America&#x27;s &quot;revenge for Victor Borge&quot;. He performed original songs in a Dodge automobile industrial film distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events in 1967, set in a fictional American wild west town and titled &quot;The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For &#x27;67&quot;. He attempted to adapt Sweeney Todd as a Broadway musical, working with Joe Raposo, to star Jerry Colonna. They started a few songs but, as Lehrer noted, &quot;Nothing ever came of it, and of course twenty years later Stephen Sondheim beat me to the punch.&quot;

===Departure from the music scene===

In the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational children&#x27;s television show &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. His last public performance for many years took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate George McGovern.

When asked why he had abandoned his musical career in an interview for the booklet accompanying his CD boxed set, &quot;The Remains of Tom Lehrer&quot; (2000), Lehrer replied: &quot;If an idea came to me, I&#x27;d write, and if it didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t—and, gradually, the second option prevailed over the first. Occasionally people ask &#x27;If you enjoyed it&#x27;—and I did—&#x27;why don&#x27;t you do it again?&#x27; I reply, &#x27;I enjoyed high school but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to do &quot;that&quot; again.

Though Lehrer was &quot;a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left&quot; and covered its political concerns in many of his songs and, even though he shared the New Left&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War, and advocated for civil rights, he disliked the aesthetics of the counterculture of the 1960s and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.

Lehrer&#x27;s musical career was relatively brief. He once mentioned that he performed a mere 109 shows and wrote 37 songs over 20 years. Nevertheless, he developed a significant following in the United States and abroad.

===Revivals and reissues===

Lehrer&#x27;s music became a staple of the Doctor Demento Show when it began national syndication in 1977.
In 1980, Cameron Mackintosh produced &quot;Tomfoolery&quot;, a revue of Lehrer&#x27;s songs that was a hit on the London stage. Lehrer was not initially involved with the show, but he was pleased with it; he eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show. &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; contained 27 songs and led to more than 200 productions, including an Off-Broadway production at the Village Gate which ran for 120 performances in 1981. Lehrer made a rare TV appearance on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Parkinson&quot; show in conjunction with the &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; premiere in 1980 at the Criterion Theatre in London, where he sang &quot;I Got It from Agnes&quot;. There were &quot;Tomfoolery&quot; performances in San Francisco about 1982 and in 2018–19. In 1993, he wrote &quot;That&#x27;s Mathematics&quot; for the closing credits to a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute video celebrating the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

On June 7 and 8, 1998, Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 18 years at the Lyceum Theatre, London as part of the show &quot;Hey, Mr. Producer!&quot; celebrating the career of Cameron Mackintosh, who had produced &quot;Tomfoolery&quot;. The June 8 show was his only performance before Queen Elizabeth II. Lehrer sang &quot;Poisoning Pigeons in the Park&quot; and an updated version of the nuclear proliferation song &quot;Who&#x27;s Next?&quot;.

In 2000, Lehrer commented that he doubted his songs had any real effect on those not already critical of the establishment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It&#x27;s not even preaching to the converted; it&#x27;s titillating the converted ... I&#x27;m fond of quoting Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin Kabaretts of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War.&quot;

Lehrer has said, jokingly, of his musical career: &quot;If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.&quot;
In 2003, Lehrer commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world: &quot;The real issues I don&#x27;t think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn&#x27;t ban land mines ... I&#x27;m not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what sort of song I would write. That&#x27;s the problem: I don&#x27;t want to satirize George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them.&quot; Earlier, he had said: &quot;Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel peace prize.&quot;

In 2000, the boxed CD set &quot;The Remains of Tom Lehrer&quot; was released by Rhino Entertainment. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot;, the songs that he wrote for &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, some previously unreleased material, and a small hardbound lyrics book with an introduction by Dr. Demento. In 2010, Shout! Factory launched a reissue campaign, making Lehrer&#x27;s out-of-print albums available digitally. The CD/DVD combo &quot;The Tom Lehrer Collection&quot; was also issued, including his best-known songs, with a DVD featuring an Oslo concert.

In a February 2008 phone call, Gene Weingarten of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; interviewed Lehrer off the record. When Weingarten asked if there was anything he could print for the record, Lehrer responded &quot;Just tell the people that I am voting for Obama.&quot;

In 2012, rapper 2 Chainz sampled Lehrer&#x27;s song &quot;The Old Dope Peddler&quot;, on his 2012 debut album, &quot;Based on a T.R.U. Story.&quot; In 2013, Lehrer said he was &quot;very proud&quot; to have his song sampled &quot;literally sixty years after I recorded it&quot;. Lehrer went on to describe his official response to the request to use his song: &quot;As sole copyright owner of &#x27;The Old Dope Peddler&#x27;, I grant you motherfuckers permission to do this. Please give my regards to Mr. Chainz, or may I call him 2?&quot;

=== All songs in the public domain ===
In October 2020, Lehrer transferred the music and lyrics for all songs he had ever written into the public domain. In November 2022, he formally relinquished the copyright and performing/recording rights on his songs, making all music and lyrics composed by him free for anyone to use, and established a website from which all of his recordings and printable copies of all of his songs could be downloaded. His statement releasing all his works into the public domain concludes with this note: &quot;This website will be shut down at some date in the not too distant future, so if you want to download anything, don&#x27;t wait too long.&quot;

==Musical legacy==
In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, known outside Sweden for his part in Ingmar Bergman’s &quot;Summer with Monika&quot;, made an album called &quot;I Tom Lehrers vackra värld&quot; (&quot;In the beautiful world of Tom Lehrer&quot;), with 12 of Lehrer&#x27;s songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer wrote in a letter to the producer Per-Anders Boquist that, &quot;Not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it sounds to me as though Mr. Ekborg is perfect for the songs&quot;, along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.

In 1971, Argentinian singer Nacha Guevara sang Spanish versions of several Lehrer songs for the show/live album &quot;Este es el año que es&quot;.

Composer Randy Newman said of Lehrer, &quot;He&#x27;s one of the great American songwriters without a doubt, right up there with everybody, the top guys. As a lyricist, as good as there&#x27;s been in the last half of the 20th century.&quot; Singer and comedian Dillie Keane has acknowledged Lehrer&#x27;s influence on her work.

Dr. Demento praised Lehrer as &quot;the best musical satirist of the twentieth century.&quot; Other artists who cite Lehrer as an influence include &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, whose work generally addresses more popular and less technical or political subjects, and educator and scientist H. Paul Shuch, who tours under the stage name Dr. SETI, and calls himself &quot;a cross between Carl Sagan and Tom Lehrer: He sings like Sagan and lectures like Lehrer.&quot; Yankovic saw Daniel Radcliffe (who called Lehrer his &quot;hero&quot;) perform &quot;The Elements&quot; on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; in his native United Kingdom, which led to Radcliffe starring in &quot;&quot;.

From January 16 to February 25, 2006, the play &quot;Letters from Lehrer&quot;, written and performed by Canadian Richard Greenblatt, ran at CanStage in Toronto. It followed Lehrer&#x27;s musical career, the meaning of several songs, the politics of the time, and Greenblatt&#x27;s own experiences with Lehrer&#x27;s music, while playing some of Lehrer&#x27;s songs.

In the March 16, 2006, issue of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Donald Fagen of Steely Dan named Tom Lehrer among the writers who had influenced him and his songwriting partner Walter Becker. &quot;We also liked comic songwriting, like Tom Lehrer. He was a piano player and songwriter who wrote these grim, funny songs.&quot;

In 2010, the German musician-comedian Felix Janosa released an album with the title &quot;Tauben vergiften: Die bösen Lieder von Tom Lehrer&quot; (&quot;Poisoning pigeons: The Evil Songs of Tom Lehrer&quot;), with German versions of some of his best-known songs.

In 2024, Francis Beckett wrote a play &quot;Tom Lehrer Is Teaching Math and Doesn’t Want to Talk to You&quot;, which features Lehrer&#x27;s music and was performed with Lehrer&#x27;s tacit approval at the Upstairs at The Gatehouse theatre in Highgate, London.

Performers influenced by Lehrer&#x27;s style include American political satirist Mark Russell, Canadian comedian and songwriter Randy Vancourt, and the British duo Kit and The Widow. Composer/cabarettist Leonard Lehrman extended three of Lehrer&#x27;s songs, writing a new verse 4 to &quot;Clementine&quot;, a new verse 2 to &quot;Hanukkah in Santa Monica&quot;, and a new verse 3 to &quot;The Elements&quot;.

Lehrer has been referred to as the &quot;King of Satire&quot; by fans.

<text>The Sophia The Christ, also known as the Wisdom of Jesus Christ, is a Gnostic text that was first discovered in the Berlin Codex (a Codex purchased in Cairo in 1896 and given to the Berlin Museum which also contains the &quot;Gospel of Mary&quot;, the &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, and a summary of the &quot;Act of Peter&quot;). More famously, the &quot;Sophia of Jesus Christ&quot; is also among the many Gnostic tractates in the Nag Hammadi codices, discovered in Egypt in 1945. The Berlin-Codex manuscript (as opposed to its contents) probably dates to c. AD 400, and the Nag-Hammadi manuscript has been dated to the 300s. However, these are complemented by a few fragments in Greek dating from the 200s, indicating an earlier date for the contents. 

While the title may refer to Sophia, Roel van den Broek argues that &quot;Sophia&quot; should be understood in its ordinary meaning as &quot;wisdom&quot;, analogous to the titles Wisdom of Solomon and Wisdom of Sirach.

The text incorporates almost the entirety of the &quot;Epistle of Eugnostos&quot;, which is also found in the Nag Hammadi codices, but incorporates it into a Christian frame narrative, in which Jesus answers questions from his disciples by quoting from &quot;Eugnostos&quot; verbatim.

==Background==
The debate about dating is critical, since some argue that it reflects the &quot;true, recorded, sayings&quot; of Jesus, which is possible if they were to be dated as far back as the 1st century. Others argue that they are, in fact, considerably later, and constitute an unreliable secondary source (at best &quot;post factum&quot; hearsay). Roel van den Broek argues that because the text presupposes a familiarity with gnostic myth, it is unlikely to predate the mid-second century.

Most scholars argue that the text is of Gnostic origin, based on the similarities between the mystical teachings found in the text itself and standard Gnostic themes. Highly mystical, the content of this text concerns creation of gods, angels, and the universe with an emphasis on infinite and metaphysical truth. 

The text is composed of 13 questions from the disciples, followed by brief discourses by Jesus in response. 
#The first question concerns the vanity and futility of searching for God.
#The second concerns how to find truth, but only explaining what it is not.
#The third concerns how truth was revealed to the gnostics at the beginning of time.
#The fourth concerns how one must awake to see the truth.
#The fifth concerns how things began.
#The sixth concerns how mankind came to gnosis.
#The seventh concerns the position of Jesus in all this.
#The eighth concerns the identity of Jesus.
#The ninth concerns how the spirit connects to the material.
#The tenth concerns the number of spirits.
#The eleventh concerns the immortal.
#The twelfth concerns those who are not material.
#The final question concerns where mankind came from and what purpose it should have.

<text>The Tuatha Dé Danann (, meaning &quot;the folk of the goddess Danu&quot;), also known by the earlier name Tuath Dé (&quot;tribe of the gods&quot;), are a supernatural race in Irish mythology. Many of them are thought to represent deities of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland.

The Tuath Dé Danann are often depicted as kings, queens, druids, bards, warriors, heroes, healers and craftsmen who have supernatural powers. They dwell in the Otherworld but interact with humans and the human world. They are associated with the &quot;sídhe&quot;: prominent ancient burial mounds such as Brú na Bóinne, which are entrances to Otherworld realms. Their traditional rivals are the Fomorians (Fomoire), who might represent the destructive powers of nature, and whom the Tuatha Dé Danann defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired. Prominent members include the Dagda (&quot;the great god&quot;); The Morrígan (&quot;the great queen&quot; or &quot;phantom queen&quot;); Lugh; Nuada; Aengus; Brigid; Manannán; Dian Cecht the healer; and Goibniu the smith, one of the &quot;Trí Dé Dána&quot; (&quot;three gods of craft&quot;). Several of the Tuatha Dé Danann are cognate with ancient Celtic deities: Lugh with Lugus, Brigit with Brigantia, Nuada with Nodons, Ogma with Ogmios, and Goibniu with Gobannus.

Medieval texts about the Tuatha Dé Danann were written by Christians. Sometimes they explained the Tuatha Dé Danann as fallen angels who were neither wholly good nor evil, or ancient people who became highly skilled in magic, but several writers acknowledged that at least some of them had been gods. Some of them have multiple names, but in the tales they often appear to be different characters. Originally, these probably represented different aspects of the same deity, while others were regional names.

The Tuatha Dé Danann eventually became the aes sídhe, the &quot;sídhe&quot;-folk or &quot;fairies&quot; of later folklore.

==Name==

The Old Irish word &quot;tuath&quot; (plural &quot;tuatha&quot;) means &quot;tribe, folk, people&quot;; &quot;dé&quot; is the genitive case of &quot;día&quot; and, depending on context, can mean &quot;god, gods, goddess&quot; or more broadly &quot;supernatural being, object of worship&quot;. In the earliest writings, the mythical race are referred to as the &quot;Tuath Dé&quot;, &quot;tribe of gods&quot;, or &quot;Tuatha Dé&quot;, &quot;tribes of gods&quot;. In the &quot;Lebor Bretnach&quot; their name is translated into Latin as &quot;plebes deorum&quot;, &quot;god-folk&quot;. However, Irish monks also began using the term &quot;Tuath Dé&quot; to refer to the Israelites, with the meaning &quot;People of God&quot;. Apparently to avoid confusion with the Israelites, writers began to refer to the mythical race as the &quot;Tuath(a) Dé Danann&quot; or &quot;Tuath(a) Dé Donann&quot; (). This is generally translated &quot;folk of the goddess Danu&quot;. It may also have been a way of humanizing them: instead of &#x27;god-folk&#x27; they were now the folk of a particular goddess. Early Christian writers also referred to them as the &quot;fir dé&quot; (god-men) and &quot;cenéla dé&quot; (god-kindreds), again possibly to avoid calling them simply &#x27;gods&#x27;. Some of the Tuatha Dé Danann are occasionally called the &quot;clann Eladan&quot;, &quot;children of art&quot;.

&quot;Danann&quot; is generally believed to be the genitive of a female name, for which the nominative case is not attested. It has been reconstructed as &quot;*Danu&quot;, of which &quot;Anu&quot; (genitive &quot;Anann&quot;) may be an alternative form. &quot;Anu&quot; is called &quot;mother of the Irish gods&quot; by Cormac mac Cuilennáin. This may be linked to the Welsh mythical figure Dôn. Hindu mythology also has a goddess called Danu, who may be an Indo-European parallel. However, this reconstruction is not universally accepted. It has also been suggested that &quot;Danann&quot; is a conflation of &quot;dán&quot; (&quot;skill, craft&quot;) and the goddess name &quot;Anann&quot;. The name is also found as &quot;Donann&quot; and &quot;Domnann&quot;, which may point to the origin being proto-Celtic &quot;*don&quot;, meaning &quot;earth&quot; (compare the Old Irish word for earth, &quot;doman&quot;). Tírechán described the &quot;sídh&quot; folk as &quot;dei terreni&quot;, &quot;earthly gods&quot;. The name could be cognate with the mythical Fir Domnann and the British Dumnonii.

==Description==
The Tuatha Dé Danann are described as a supernatural race, much like idealized humans, who are immune from ageing and sickness, and who have powers of magic. The powers most often attributed to the Tuatha Dé Danann are control over the weather and the elements, and the ability to shapeshift themselves and other things. They are also said to control the fertility of the land; the tale &quot;De Gabáil in t-Sída&quot; says the first Gaels had to establish friendship with the Tuatha Dé Danann before they could raise crops and herds.

They live in the Otherworld, which is described as either a parallel world or a heavenly land beyond the sea or under the earth&#x27;s surface. Many of them are associated with specific places in the landscape, especially the &quot;sídh&quot; mounds; the ancient burial mounds and passage tombs which are entrances to Otherworld realms. The Tuatha Dé Danann can hide themselves with a &quot;féth fíada&quot; (&#x27;magic mist&#x27;) and appear to humans only when they wish to.

In some tales, such as &quot;Baile in Scáil&quot;, a king receives affirmation of his legitimacy from one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. In other tales, a king&#x27;s right to rule is affirmed by an encounter with an otherworldly woman. It has been argued that the inauguration of Irish kings originally represented his ritual marriage to the goddess of the land (see sovereignty goddess). The Tuatha Dé Danann can also bring doom to unrightful kings.

The medieval writers who wrote about the Tuatha Dé Danann were Christians. Sometimes they explained the Tuatha Dé Danann as fallen angels; neutral angels who sided neither with God nor Lucifer and were punished by being forced to dwell on the Earth; or humans who had become highly skilled in magic. However, several writers acknowledged that at least some of them had been gods.

There is strong evidence that many of the Tuatha Dé Danann represent the gods of Irish paganism. The name itself means &quot;tribe of gods&quot;, and the ninth-century &quot;Scél Tuain meic Cairill&quot; (Tale of Tuan mac Cairill) speaks of the &quot;Tuath Dé ocus Andé&quot;, &quot;tribe of gods and un-gods&quot;. Goibniu, Credne and Luchta are called the &quot;trí dé dáno&quot;, &quot;three gods of craft&quot;. In &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; (Cormac&#x27;s Glossary), Anu is called &quot;mother of the Irish gods&quot;, Nét a &quot;god of war&quot;, and Brigit a &quot;goddess of poets&quot; whose father is the Dagda; his own name meaning &quot;the great god&quot;. Writing in the seventh century, Tírechán explained the &quot;sídh&quot; folk as &quot;earthly gods&quot; (Latin &quot;dei terreni&quot;), while &quot;Fiacc&#x27;s Hymn&quot; says the Irish adored the &quot;sídh&quot; before the coming of Saint Patrick. Goibniu, Dian Cécht the physician, and Flidais the mistress of animals are invoked in incantations, further evidence that they were seen as supernatural powers. Several of the Tuatha Dé Danann are cognate with ancient Celtic deities: Lugh with Lugus, Brigit with Brigantia, Nuada with Nodons, and Ogma with Ogmios.

Nevertheless, John Carey notes that it is not wholly accurate to describe all of them as gods in the medieval literature itself. He argues that the literary Tuatha Dé Danann are &quot;sui generis&quot;, and suggests &quot;immortals&quot; might be a more neutral term.

==Legend==
In euhemerized accounts, the Tuatha Dé Danann were descended from Nemed, leader of a previous wave of inhabitants of Ireland. In non-euhemerized accounts they are descended from Danu/Anu, a mother goddess. They came from four cities to the north of Ireland—Falias, Gorias, Murias and Finias—where they taught their skills in the sciences, including architecture, the arts and magic. According to &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, they came to Ireland &quot;in dark clouds&quot; and &quot;landed on the mountains of [the] Conmaicne Rein in Connachta&quot;, otherwise Sliabh an Iarainn, &quot;and they brought a darkness over the sun for three days and three nights&quot;. They immediately burnt the ships &quot;so that they should not think of retreating to them, and the smoke and the mist that came from the vessels filled the neighbouring land and air. Therefore it was conceived that they had arrived in clouds of mist&quot;.

A poem in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; says of their arrival:
&lt;poem&gt;It is God who suffered them, though He restrained them
they landed with horror, with lofty deed,
in their cloud of mighty combat of spectres,
upon a mountain of Conmaicne of Connacht.

Without distinction to discerning Ireland,
Without ships, a ruthless course
the truth was not known beneath the sky of stars,
whether they were of heaven or of earth.&lt;/poem&gt;
According to Tuan:
From them are the Tuatha Dé and Andé, whose origin the learned do not know, but that it seems likely to them that they came from heaven, on account of their intelligence and for the excellence of their knowledge.

Led by king Nuada, they fought the First Battle of Magh Tuireadh on the west coast, in which they defeated and displaced the native Fir Bolg, who then inhabited Ireland. In the battle, Nuada lost an arm to their champion, Sreng. Since Nuada was no longer &quot;unblemished&quot;, he could not continue as king and was replaced by the half-Fomorian Bres, who turned out to be a tyrant. The physician Dian Cecht replaced Nuada&#x27;s arm with a working silver one and he was reinstated as king. However, Dian Cecht&#x27;s son Miach was dissatisfied with the replacement so he recited the spell, &quot;ault fri halt dí &amp; féith fri féth&quot; (joint to joint of it and sinew to sinew), which caused flesh to grow over the silver prosthesis over the course of nine days and nights. However, in a fit of jealous rage Dian Cecht slew his own son. Because of Nuada&#x27;s restoration as the leader, Bres complained to his family and his father, Elatha, who sent him to seek assistance from Balor, king of the Fomorians.

The Tuatha Dé Danann then fought the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh against the Fomorians. Nuada was killed by the Fomorian king Balor&#x27;s poisonous eye, but Balor was killed by Lugh, champion of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who then took over as king.

A third battle was fought against a subsequent wave of invaders, the Milesians, from the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Galicia and Northern Portugal), descendants of Míl Espáine (who are thought to represent the Goidelic Celts). The Milesians encountered three Tuatha Dé Danann goddesses, Ériu, Banba and Fodla, who asked that the island be named after them; Ériu is the origin of the modern name Éire, and Banba and Fodla are still sometimes used as poetic names for Ireland.

Their three husbands, Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine, were kings of the Tuatha Dé Danann at that time, and asked for a truce of three days, during which the Milesians would lie at anchor nine waves&#x27; distance from the shore. The Milesians complied, but the Tuatha Dé Danann created a magical storm in an attempt to drive them away. The Milesian poet Amergin calmed the sea with his verse, then his people landed and defeated the Tuatha Dé Danann at Tailtiu. When Amergin was called upon to divide the land between the Tuatha Dé Danann and his own people, he cleverly allotted the portion above ground to the Milesians and the portion underground to the Tuatha Dé Danann. The Tuatha Dé Danann were led underground into the Sidhe mounds by Manannán mac Lir and Tír na nÓg onto a flowery plain/plain of honey attested to in the Voyage of Bran.

==The Four Treasures==
The Tuatha Dé Danann brought four magical treasures with them to Ireland, one apiece from their Four Cities:

* Dagda&#x27;s Cauldron
* The Spear of Lugh
* Lia Fáil (The Stone of Fal)
* Claíomh Solais (The Sword of Light)

==Tuatha Dé Danann High Kings of Ireland==
The following is a chronology from the Annals of the Four Masters, based on reign-lengths given in Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Forus Feasa ar Erinn&quot;. Nuada&#x27;s original reign lacks a precise start date.

*Nuada (first reign) &quot;AFM&quot; unknown–1897 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; unknown–1477 BC
*Bres &quot;AFM&quot; 1897–1890 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1477–1470 BC
*Nuada (final reign) &quot;AFM&quot; 1890–1870 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1470–1447 BC
*Lugh &quot;AFM&quot; 1870–1830 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1447–1407 BC
*Eochaid Ollathair &quot;AFM&quot; 1830–1750 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1407–1337 BC
*Delbáeth &quot;AFM&quot; 1750–1740 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1337–1327 BC
*Fiacha &quot;AFM&quot; 1740–1730 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1327–1317 BC
*Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine &quot;AFM&quot; 1730–1700 BC; &quot;FFE&quot; 1317–1287 BC

==Additional references==

*&quot;Credenus&quot;, &quot;figulus&quot; (&quot;shaper/builder&quot;)
*&quot;Dianus&quot;, &quot;medicus&quot; (&quot;doctor&quot;)
*&quot;Eadon&quot;, daughter of Dianus and nurse of the poets—presumably Étaín, Brigid, or Airmed
*&quot;Goibnen&quot;, &quot;faber&quot; (&quot;smith/architect&quot;)
*Lug, son of Eithne, with whom were all the arts
*Dagda the Great, the King
*Ogma, brother of the King, from whom came the letters of the Scots

<text>In computing, time-sharing is the concurrent sharing of a computing resource among many tasks or users by giving each task or user a small slice of processing time. This quick switch between tasks or users gives the illusion of simultaneous execution. It enables multi-tasking by a single user or enables multiple-user sessions.

Developed during the 1960s, its emergence as the prominent model of computing in the 1970s represented a major technological shift in the history of computing. By allowing many users to interact concurrently with a single computer, time-sharing dramatically lowered the cost of providing computing capability, made it possible for individuals and organizations to use a computer without owning one, and promoted the interactive use of computers and the development of new interactive applications.

==History==

===Batch processing===

The earliest computers were extremely expensive devices, and very slow in comparison to later models. Machines were typically dedicated to a particular set of tasks and operated by control panels, the operator manually entering small programs via switches in order to load and run a series of programs. These programs might take hours to run. As computers grew in speed, run times dropped, and soon the time taken to start up the next program became a concern. Newer batch processing software and methodologies, including batch operating systems such as IBSYS (1960), decreased these &quot;dead periods&quot; by queuing up programs ready to run.

Comparatively inexpensive card punch or paper tape writers were used by programmers to write their programs &quot;offline&quot;. Programs were submitted to the operations team, which scheduled them to be run. Output (generally printed) was returned to the programmer. The complete process might take days, during which time the programmer might never see the computer. Stanford students made a short film humorously critiquing this situation.

The alternative of allowing the user to operate the computer directly was generally far too expensive to consider. This was because users might have long periods of entering code while the computer remained idle. This situation limited interactive development to those organizations that could afford to waste computing cycles: large universities for the most part.

===Time-sharing===
The concept is claimed to have been first described by Robert Dodds in a letter he wrote in 1949 although he did not use the term &quot;time-sharing&quot;. Later John Backus also described the concept, but did not use the term, in the 1954 summer session at MIT. Bob Bemer used the term &quot;time-sharing&quot; in his 1957 article &quot;How to consider a computer&quot; in &quot;Automatic Control Magazine&quot; and it was reported the same year he used the term &quot;time-sharing&quot; in a presentation. In a paper published in December 1958, W. F. Bauer wrote that &quot;The computers would handle a number of problems concurrently. Organizations would have input-output equipment installed on their own premises and would buy time on the computer much the same way that the average household buys power and water from utility companies.&quot;

Christopher Strachey, who became Oxford University&#x27;s first professor of computation, filed a patent application in the United Kingdom for &quot;time-sharing&quot; in February 1959. He gave a paper &quot;Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers&quot; at the first UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris in June that year, where he passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider. This paper was credited by the MIT Computation Center in 1963 as &quot;the first paper on time-shared computers&quot;.

The meaning of the term &quot;time-sharing&quot; has shifted from its original usage. From 1949 to 1960, time-sharing was used to refer to multiprogramming without multiple user sessions. Later, it came to mean sharing a computer interactively among multiple users. In 1984 Christopher Strachey wrote he considered the change in the meaning of the term &quot;time-sharing&quot; a source of confusion and not what he meant when he wrote his paper in 1959.

There are also examples of systems which provide multiple user consoles but only for specific applications, they are not general-purpose systems. These include SAGE (1958), SABRE (1960) and PLATO II (1961), created by Donald Bitzer at a public demonstration at Robert Allerton Park near the University of Illinois in early 1961. Bitzer has long said that the PLATO project would have gotten the patent on time-sharing if only the University of Illinois had not lost the patent for two years.

The first interactive, general-purpose time-sharing system usable for software development, Compatible Time-Sharing System, was initiated by John McCarthy at MIT writing a memo in 1959. Fernando J. Corbató led the development of the system, a prototype of which had been produced and tested by November 1961. Philip M. Morse arranged for IBM to provide a series of their mainframe computers starting with the IBM 704 and then the IBM 709 product line IBM 7090 and IBM 7094. IBM loaned those mainframes at no cost to MIT along with the staff to operate them and also provided hardware modifications mostly in the form of RPQs as prior customers had already commissioned the modifications. There were certain stipulations that governed MIT&#x27;s use of the loaned IBM hardware. MIT could not charge for use of CTSS. MIT could only use the IBM computers for eight hours a day; another eight hours were available for other colleges and universities; IBM could use their computers for the remaining eight hours, although there were some exceptions. In 1963 a second deployment of CTSS was installed on an IBM 7094 that MIT has purchased using ARPA money. This was used to support Multics development at Project MAC.

JOSS began time-sharing service in January 1964. Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) began service in March 1964.

===Development===
Throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, computer terminals were multiplexed onto large institutional mainframe computers (centralized computing systems), which in many implementations sequentially polled the terminals to see whether any additional data was available or action was requested by the computer user. Later technology in interconnections were interrupt driven, and some of these used parallel data transfer technologies such as the IEEE 488 standard. Generally, computer terminals were utilized on college properties in much the same places as &quot;desktop computers&quot; or &quot;personal computers&quot; are found today. In the earliest days of personal computers, many were in fact used as particularly smart terminals for time-sharing systems.

DTSS&#x27;s creators wrote in 1968 that &quot;any response time which averages more than 10 seconds destroys the illusion of having one&#x27;s own computer&quot;. Conversely, timesharing users thought that their terminal was the computer, and unless they received a bill for using the service, rarely thought about how others shared the computer&#x27;s resources, such as when a large JOSS application caused paging for all users. The &quot;JOSS Newsletter&quot; often asked users to reduce storage usage. Time-sharing was nonetheless an efficient way to share a large computer. DTSS supported more than 100 simultaneous users. Although more than 1,000 of the 19,503 jobs the system completed on &quot;a particularly busy day&quot; required ten seconds or more of computer time, DTSS was able to handle the jobs because 78% of jobs needed one second or less of computer time. About 75% of 3,197 users used their terminal for 30 minutes or less, during which they used less than four seconds of computer time. A football simulation, among early mainframe games written for DTSS, used less than two seconds of computer time during the 15 minutes of real time for playing the game. With the rise of microcomputing in the early 1980s, time-sharing became less significant, because individual microprocessors were sufficiently inexpensive that a single person could have all the CPU time dedicated solely to their needs, even when idle.

However, the Internet brought the general concept of time-sharing back into popularity. Expensive corporate server farms costing millions can host thousands of customers all sharing the same common resources. As with the early serial terminals, web sites operate primarily in bursts of activity followed by periods of idle time. This bursting nature permits the service to be used by many customers at once, usually with no perceptible communication delays, unless the servers start to get very busy.

===Time-sharing business===
Genesis

In the 1960s, several companies started providing time-sharing services as service bureaus. Early systems used Teletype Model 33 KSR or ASR or Teletype Model 35 KSR or ASR machines in ASCII environments, and IBM Selectric typewriter-based terminals (especially the IBM 2741) with two different seven-bit codes. They would connect to the central computer by dial-up Bell 103A modem or acoustically coupled modems operating at 10–15 characters per second. Later terminals and modems supported 30–120 characters per second. The time-sharing system would provide a complete operating environment, including a variety of programming language processors, various software packages, file storage, bulk printing, and off-line storage. Users were charged rent for the terminal, a charge for hours of connect time, a charge for seconds of CPU time, and a charge for kilobyte-months of disk storage.

Common systems used for time-sharing included the SDS 940, the PDP-10, the IBM 360, and the GE-600 series. Companies providing this service included GE&#x27;s GEISCO, the IBM subsidiary The Service Bureau Corporation, Tymshare (founded in 1966), National CSS (founded in 1967 and bought by Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 1979), Dial Data (bought by Tymshare in 1968), AL/COM, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN) and Time Sharing Ltd. in the UK. By 1968, there were 32 such service bureaus serving the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone. The &quot;Auerbach Guide to Timesharing&quot; (1973) lists 125 different timesharing services using equipment from Burroughs, CDC, DEC, HP, Honeywell, IBM, RCA, Univac, and XDS.

====Rise and fall====
In 1975, acting president of Prime Computer Ben F. Robelen told stockholders that &quot;The biggest end-user market currently is time-sharing&quot;. For DEC, for a while the second largest computer company (after IBM), this was also true: Their PDP-10 and IBM&#x27;s 360/67 were widely used by commercial timesharing services such as CompuServe, On-Line Systems, Inc. (OLS), Rapidata and Time Sharing Ltd.

The advent of the personal computer marked the beginning of the decline of time-sharing. The economics were such that computer time went from being an expensive resource that had to be shared to being so cheap that computers could be left to sit idle for long periods in order to be available as needed.

=====Rapidata as an example=====
Although many time-sharing services simply closed, Rapidata held on, and became part of National Data Corporation. It was still of sufficient interest in 1982 to be the focus of &quot;A User&#x27;s Guide to Statistics Programs: The Rapidata Timesharing System&quot;. Even as revenue fell by 66% and National Data subsequently developed its own problems, attempts were made to keep this timesharing business going.

=====UK=====
* Time Sharing Limited (TSL, 1969–1974) - launched using DEC systems. PERT was one of its popular offerings. TSL was acquired by ADP in 1974.
* OLS Computer Services (UK) Limited (1975–1980) - using HP &amp; DEC systems.

===The computer utility===
Beginning in 1964, the Multics operating system was designed as a computing utility, modeled on the electrical or telephone utilities. In the 1970s, Ted Nelson&#x27;s original &quot;Xanadu&quot; hypertext repository was envisioned as such a service. 

===Security===
Time-sharing was the first time that multiple processes, owned by different users, were running on a single machine, and these processes could interfere with one another. For example, one process might alter shared resources which another process relied on, such as a variable stored in memory. When only one user was using the system, this would result in possibly wrong output - but with multiple users, this might mean that other users got to see information they were not meant to see.

To prevent this from happening, an operating system needed to enforce a set of policies that determined which privileges each process had. For example, the operating system might deny access to a certain variable by a certain process.

The first international conference on computer security in London in 1971 was primarily driven by the time-sharing industry and its customers.

Time-sharing in the form of shell accounts has been considered a risk.

<doc id="30959" wikidata="Q436436" url="?curid=30959" title="The Dagda">
<text>The Dagda ( , ) is considered the great god of Irish mythology. He is the chief god of the Tuatha Dé Danann, with the Dagda portrayed as a father-figure, king, and druid. He is associated with fertility, agriculture, manliness and strength, as well as magic, druidry and wisdom.
 He can control life and death (cf. his staff, below), .

He is often described as a large bearded man or giant wearing a hooded cloak. He owns a magic staff () of dual nature: it kills with one end and brings to life with the other. He also owns a cauldron (the &quot;coire ansic&quot;) which never runs empty, and a magic harp (&quot;Uaithne&quot;, though this may be the name of the harper), which will not play unless called by its two bynames, and the harp can fly itself to the Dagda when thus beckoned. He is said to dwell in Brú na Bóinne (Newgrange). Other places associated with or named after him include Uisneach, Grianan of Aileach, Lough Neagh and Knock Iveagh. The Dagda is said to be the husband of the Morrígan and lover of Boann. His children include Aengus, Brigit, Bodb Derg, Cermait, Aed, and Midir.

The Dagda&#x27;s name is thought to mean &quot;the good god&quot; or &quot;the great god&quot;. His other names include &quot;Eochu&quot; or &quot;Eochaid Ollathair&quot; (&quot;horseman, great father&quot;), and &quot;Ruad Rofhessa&quot; (&quot;mighty one/lord of great knowledge&quot;). There are indications &quot;Dáire&quot; was another name for him. The death and ancestral god Donn may originally have been a form of the Dagda, and he also has similarities with the later harvest figure Crom Dubh. Several tribal groupings saw the Dagda as an ancestor and were named after him, such as the Uí Echach and the Dáirine.

The Dagda has been likened to the Germanic god Odin, the Gaulish god Sucellos, and the Roman god Dīs Pater.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
The Old Irish name &quot;Dagda&quot; is generally believed to stem from , meaning &quot;the good god&quot; or &quot;the great god&quot;.

===Epithets===
The Dagda has several other names or epithets which reflect aspects of his character. 
* &quot;Eochu&quot; or &quot;Eochaid Ollathair&quot; (&quot;horseman, great father&quot; or &quot;horseman, all-father&quot;) 
* &quot;Ruad Rofhessa&quot; (&quot;mighty one/lord of great knowledge&quot;) 
* &quot;Dáire&quot; (&quot;the fertile one&quot;) 
* &quot;Aed&quot; (&quot;the fiery one&quot;) 
* &quot;Fer Benn&quot; (&quot;horned man&quot; or &quot;man of the peak&quot;)
* &quot;Cera&quot; (possibly &quot;creator&quot;), 
* &quot;Cerrce&quot; (possibly &quot;striker&quot;) 
* &quot;Easal&quot;

The name Eochu is a diminutive form of Eochaid, which also has spelling variants of Eochaidh and Echuid. The death and ancestral god Donn may originally have been a form of the Dagda, who is sometimes called Dagda Donn.

==Description==
The Dagda was one of the kings of the Tuatha De Danann. The Tuatha Dé Danann are the race of supernatural beings who conquered the Fomorians, who inhabited Ireland previously, prior to the coming of the Milesians. The Mórrígan is described as his wife, his daughter was Brigit, and his lover was Boann, after whom the River Boyne is named, though she was married to Elcmar and with whom he had the god Aengus. Prior to the battle with the Fomorians, he coupled with the goddess of war, the Mórrígan, on Samhain. (Cf. ).

Of Dagda it is stated &quot;He was a beautiful god of the heathens, for the Tuatha Dé Danann worshipped him: for he was an earth-god to them because of the greatness of his magical power&quot;, in the Middle Irish language &quot;Coir Anmann&quot; (The Fitness of Names) says:

Tales depict the Dagda as a figure of immense power. He is said to own a magic staff, club or mace which could kill nine men with one blow; but with the handle he could return the slain to life. He owned a magic harp.

===Dagda&#x27;s staff===
In the tract found in the Yellow Book of Lecan, there were three items the Dagda named together, his staff (), there was the shirt (&quot;&quot;) of protection from sickness, and the cloak ( of shape-shifting and color-change. The &quot;great staff&quot; () had a smooth end which brought the dead back to life (he resuscitated his son Cermait Milbél with the smooth end), but the staff&#x27;s rough end caused instant death.

The staff/club is also described in the Ulster Cycle narrative, &quot;Mesca Ulad&quot;, where it was called the &quot;terrible iron staff&quot; ().
===Cauldron===
The Cauldron of the Dagda is one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann, of which it was said &quot;an assembly used not to go unsatisfied from it&quot;.

The cauldron &quot;signified plenty and generousity&quot;. Hence, his magic cauldron was otherwise known as the &quot;coire ansic&quot; (&quot;the un-dry cauldron&quot;).

===Dagda&#x27;s harp===

After Úaithne, the Dagda&#x27;s harper was abducted by the Fomorians, the Dagda went to the enemy&#x27;s hall and retrieved his magic harp, which had two names, according to the text of the &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;Second Battle of Moytura&quot;). And when the Dagda called upon his harp by its two names: &quot;Come Daur Dá Bláo / Come Cóir Cetharchair /
Come summer, come winter..&quot; the harp leapt off the wall and came to him. The harp was forbidden by the Dagda from issuing any sound, unless thus called upon by the names, which translate to &quot;Oak of Two Meadows&quot; and &quot;the Four Angled Music&quot;; The Dagda had the skill to play the &quot;Three Strains&quot; (joy, sorrow, sleep) which he used to immobilize the Fomorians and escape.

===Other possessions===
He possessed two pigs, one of which was always growing whilst the other was always roasting, and ever-laden fruit trees. He is also described as being the owner of a black-maned heifer that was given to him for his labours prior to the Second Battle of Moytura. When the heifer calls her calf, all the cattle of Ireland taken by the Fomorians as tribute graze.

==Family==
The Dagda is said to be husband of the Morrígan, who is called his &quot;envious wife&quot;. His children include Aengus, Cermait, and Aed (often called the three sons of the Dagda), Brigit and Bodb Derg. He is said to have two brothers, Nuada and Ogma, but this may be an instance of the tendency to triplicate deities. Elsewhere the Dagda is linked exclusively with Ogma, and the two are called &quot;the two brothers.&quot; In the Dindsenchas, the Dagda is given a daughter named Ainge, for whom he makes a twig basket or tub that always leaks when the tide is in and never leaks when it is going out. The Dagda&#x27;s father is named Elatha son of Delbeath. Englec, the daughter of Elcmar, is named as a consort of the Dagda and the mother of his &quot;swift son&quot;. Echtgi the loathesome is another daughter of the Dagda&#x27;s named in the Banshenchas.

== Mythology ==

Before the Second Battle of Mag Tuired the Dagda builds a fortress for Bres called Dún Brese and is also forced by the Fomorian kings Elatha, Indech, and Tethra to build raths. In the lead up to the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, when Lugh asks Dagda what power he will wield over the Fomorian host, he responds that he &quot;will take the side of the men of Erin both in mutual smiting and destruction and wizardry. Their bones under my club will be as many as hailstones under feet of herds of horses&quot;.

The Dagda has an affair with Boann, the goddess of the River Boyne. She lives at Brú na Bóinne with her husband Elcmar. The Dagda impregnates her after sending Elcmar away on a one-day errand. To hide the pregnancy from Elcmar, the Dagda casts a spell on him, making &quot;the sun stand still&quot; so he will not notice the passing of time. Meanwhile, Boann gives birth to Aengus, who is also known as Maccán Óg (&#x27;the young son&#x27;). Eventually, Aengus learns that the Dagda is his true father and asks him for a portion of land. In some versions of the tale, the Dagda helps Aengus take ownership of the Brú from Elcmar. Aengus asks and is given the Brú for &quot;láa ocus aidche&quot;; because in Old Irish this could mean either &quot;a day and a night&quot; or &quot;day and night&quot;, Aengus claims it forever. Other versions have Aengus taking over the Brú from the Dagda himself by using the same trick.

It has been suggested that this tale represents the winter solstice illumination of Newgrange at Brú na Bóinne, during which the sunbeam (the Dagda) enters the inner chamber (the womb of Boann) when the sun&#x27;s path stands still. The word &quot;solstice&quot; (Irish &quot;grianstad&quot;) means sun-standstill. The conception of Aengus may represent the &#x27;rebirth&#x27; of the sun at the winter solstice, him taking over the Brú from an older god representing the growing sun taking over from the waning sun.

The &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot;, tells the story of how Bóand conceives Aengus by the Dagda. In the Aislinge Oengusso or Dream of Aengus the Dagda and Boand help Aengus to find a mysterious woman who he has fallen in love with in his dreams.

In a poem about Mag Muirthemne, the Dagda banishes an octopus with his &quot;mace of wrath&quot; using the following words: &quot;Turn thy hollow head! Turn thy ravening body! Turn thy resorbent forehead! Avaunt! Begone!&quot;, the sea receded with the creature and the plain of Mag Muirthemne was left behind.

In the &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; the Dagda is described as swift with a poison draught and as a justly dealing lord. He is also called a King of Erin with hosts of hostages, a noble, slender prince, and the father of Cermait, Aengus, and Aed.

He is credited with a seventy- or eighty-year reign (depending on source) over the Tuatha Dé Danann, before dying at Brú na Bóinne, finally succumbing to a wound inflicted by Cethlenn during the battle of Mag Tuired.

==Parallels==
The Dagda has similarities with the later harvest figure Crom Dubh. He also has similarities with the Gaulish god Sucellos, who is depicted with a hammer and a pot, and the Roman god Dīs Pater.

<text>The tuba (; ) is the largest and lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibrationa buzzinto a mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid-19th century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band, and largely replaced the ophicleide. &quot;Tuba&quot; is Latin for &quot;trumpet&quot;.

A person who plays the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist, or simply a tuba player. In a British brass band or military band, they are known as bass players.

==History==
Prussian Patent No. 19 was granted to Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Johann Gottfried Moritz on 12 September 1835 for a &quot;bass tuba&quot; in F1. The original Wieprecht and Moritz instrument used five valves of the Berlinerpumpen type that was the forerunner of the modern piston valve. The first tenor tuba was invented in 1838 by Moritz&#x27;s son Carl Wilhelm Moritz.

The addition of valves made it possible to play low in the harmonic series of the instrument and still have a complete selection of notes. Prior to the invention of valves, brass instruments were limited to notes in the harmonic series, and were thus generally played very high with respect to their fundamental pitch. Harmonics starting three octaves above the fundamental pitch are about a whole step apart, making a useful variety of notes possible.

The ophicleide used a bowl-shaped brass instrument mouthpiece but had keys and tone holes similar to those of a modern saxophone. Another forerunner to the tuba, the serpent, was a bass instrument shaped in a wavy form to make the tone holes accessible to the player. Tone holes change the pitch by providing an intentional leak in the bugle of the instrument, but this system has a pronounced effect on the timbre. By using valves instead, the tuba could produce a smoother tone, which led to its popularity. Tubas were mostly used by French composers, especially Hector Berlioz, who famously used the ophicleide in his compositions &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;. These pieces are now normally performed on F or CC tuba.

Adolphe Sax, like Wieprecht, was interested in marketing families of instruments ranging from soprano to bass, and developed a series of brass instruments known as saxhorns. The instruments developed by Sax were generally pitched in E and B, while the Wieprecht &quot;basstuba&quot; and the subsequent Červený contrabass tuba were pitched in F and C (see below on pitch systems). Sax&#x27;s instruments gained dominance in France, and later in Britain and America, as a result of the movements of popular instrument makers such as Gustave Auguste Besson (who moved from France to Britain) and Henry Distin (who eventually found his way to America).

The cimbasso is also seen instead of a tuba in the orchestral repertoire. The Italian word , first appearing in the early 19th century, is thought to be a contraction used by musicians of the term or (), sometimes appearing in scores as &quot;c. basso&quot; or &quot;c. in basso&quot;. The original design was inspired by the ophicleide and the bassoon. The cimbasso is sometimes used in historically accurate performances and is commonly called for in film and video game soundtracks.

==Role==
An orchestra usually has a single tuba, though an additional tuba may be requested. It serves as the bass of the orchestral brass section and it can reinforce the bass voices of the strings and woodwinds. It provides the bass of brass quintets and choirs (though many small brass ensembles will use the euphonium or bass trombone as the lowest voice). It is the principal bass instrument in concert bands, brass bands and military bands, and those ensembles generally have two to four tubas. It is also a solo instrument.

Tubas are used in marching bands, drum and bugle corps and in many jazz bands (see below). In British style brass bands, two E and two B tubas are used and are referred to as &quot;basses&quot;.

Well known and influential parts for the tuba include:
* Modest Mussorgsky (orch. Ravel): &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; – &quot;Bydło&quot;, &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;
* Richard Strauss: &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, &quot;Eine Alpensinfonie&quot;, &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, &quot;Ein Heldenleben&quot; 
* Shostakovich: All symphonies, except the Fourteenth
* Stravinsky: &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;Petroushka&quot;
* Edgard Varèse: &quot;Déserts&quot;
* Richard Wagner: &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, &quot;Faust Overture&quot;
* Sergei Prokofiev: Fifth Symphony, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;
* George Gershwin: &quot;An American in Paris&quot;
* Silvestre Revueltas: &quot;Sensemayá, La noche de los mayas, Homenaje a Federico García Lorca
* Gustav Holst: &quot;The Planets&quot;
* Gustav Mahler: Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8
* Ottorino Respighi: &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot;, &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;
* Hector Berlioz: &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, &quot;Hungarian March&quot;
* Paul Hindemith: &quot;Symphonic Metamorphosis&quot;
*Johannes Brahms: Symphony No. 2
*Anton Bruckner: Symphonies Nos. 4, 7, and 8

Concertos have been written for the tuba by many notable composers, including Ralph Vaughan Williams (Tuba Concerto), Edward Gregson, John Williams, Alexander Arutiunian, Eric Ewazen, James Barnes, Joseph Hallman, Martin Ellerby, Philip Sparke, Kalevi Aho, Josef Tal, Bruce Broughton (Tuba Concerto), John Golland, Roger Steptoe, David Carlson, Jennifer Higdon (Tuba Concerto), and Marcus Paus (&quot;Tuba Mirum&quot;).

==Types and construction==
Tubas are found in various pitches, most commonly in F, E, C, or B. The key of a tuba depends on the fundamental pitch of the instrument, or fundamental note in the series of overtones (also called &quot;partials&quot;) available without any valves being pressed. Tubas in different keys use different lengths of tubing. The main tube of a B tuba is approximately long, while that of a C tuba is , of an E tuba , and of an F tuba . The instrument has a conical bore, meaning the bore diameter increases as a function of the tubing length from the mouthpiece to the bell. The conical bore causes the instrument to produce a preponderance of even-order harmonics.

A tuba with its tubing wrapped for placing the instrument on the player&#x27;s lap is usually called a &quot;concert tuba&quot; or simply a &quot;tuba&quot;. Tubas with the bell pointing forward (&quot;pavillon tournant&quot;) instead of upward are often called &quot;recording tubas&quot; because of their popularity in the early days of recorded music, as their sound could more easily be directed at the recording microphone. When wrapped to surround the body for cavalry bands on horseback or marching, it is traditionally known as a helicon. The modern sousaphone, named after American bandmaster John Philip Sousa, resembles a helicon with the bell pointed up (in the original models as the J. W. Pepper prototype and Sousa&#x27;s concert instruments) and then curved to point forward (as developed by Conn and others). Some ancestors of the tuba, such as the military &quot;bombardon&quot;, had unusual valve and bore arrangements compared to modern tubas.

During the American Civil War, most brass bands used a branch of the brass family known as &quot;saxhorns&quot;, which, by today&#x27;s standards, have a narrower bore taper than tuba—the same as true cornets and baritones but distinct from trumpets, euphoniums, and others with different tapers or no taper. Around the start of the Civil War, saxhorns manufactured for military use in the USA were commonly wrapped with the bell pointing backwards over the player&#x27;s shoulder, and these were known as &quot;over-the-shoulder saxhorns&quot;, and came in sizes from cornets down to E basses. However, the E bass, even though it shared the same tube length as a modern E tuba, has a narrower bore and as such cannot be called by the name &quot;tuba&quot; except as a convenience when comparing it to other sizes of the saxhorn.

Most music for the tuba is written in bass clef in concert pitch, so tuba players must know the correct fingerings for their specific instruments. Traditional British-style brass band parts for the tuba are usually written in treble clef, with the B tuba sounding two octaves and one step below and the E tuba sounding one octave and a major sixth below the written pitch. This allows musicians to change instruments without learning new fingerings for the same written music. Consequently, when its music is written in treble clef, the tuba is a transposing instrument but not when the music is in bass clef.

The lowest pitched tubas are the contrabass tubas, pitched in C or B, referred to as CC and BB tubas respectively, based on a traditional distortion of a now-obsolete octave naming convention. The fundamental pitch of a CC tuba is 32 Hz, and for a BB tuba, 29 Hz. The CC tuba is used as an orchestral and concert band instrument in the U.S., but BB tubas are the contrabass tuba of choice in German, Austrian, and Russian orchestras. In the United States, the BB tuba is the most common in schools (largely due to the use of BB sousaphones in high school marching bands) and for adult amateurs. Many professionals in the U.S. play CC tubas, with BB also common, and many train in the use of all four pitches of tubas.

The next smaller tubas are the bass tubas, pitched in F or E (a fourth above the contrabass tubas). The E tuba often plays an octave above the contrabass tubas in brass bands, and the F tuba is commonly used by professional players as a solo instrument and, in America, to play higher parts in the classical repertoire (or parts that were originally written for the F tuba, as is the case with Berlioz). In most of Europe, the F tuba is the standard orchestral instrument, supplemented by the CC or BB only when the extra weight is desired. Wagner, for example, specifically notates the low tuba parts for &quot;Kontrabasstuba,&quot; which are played on CC or BB tubas in most regions. In the United Kingdom, the E is the standard orchestral tuba.

The euphonium is sometimes referred to as a tenor tuba and is pitched in B, one octave higher than the BB contrabass tuba. The term &quot;tenor tuba&quot; is often used more specifically to refer to B rotary-valved tubas pitched in the same octave as euphoniums. The &quot;Small Swiss Tuba in C&quot; is a tenor tuba pitched in C, and provided with 6 valves to make the lower notes in the orchestral repertoire possible. The French C tuba was the standard instrument in French orchestras until overtaken by F and C tubas since the Second World War. One popular example of the use of the French C tuba is the &quot;Bydło&quot; movement in Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, though the rest of the work is scored for this instrument as well.

Larger BBB subcontrabass tubas exist but are extremely rare (there are at least four known examples). One four-valve example was exhibited by maker Bohland &amp; Fuchs in 1928, its bell 50 inches in diameter, its height 110 inches, its weight 200 pounds. Two were built by Gustave Besson in BBB, one octave below the BB contrabass tuba, on the suggestion of John Philip Sousa. The monster instruments were not completed until just after Sousa&#x27;s death. Later, in the 1950s, British musician Gerard Hoffnung commissioned the London firm of Paxman to create a subcontrabass tuba in EEE for use in his comedic music festivals. Also, a tuba pitched in FFF was made in Kraslice by Bohland &amp; Fuchs probably during 1910 or 1911 and was destined for the World Exhibition in New York in 1913. Two players are needed; one to operate the valves and one to blow into the mouthpiece.

===Size vs. pitch===
In addition to the length of the instrument, which dictates the fundamental pitch, tubas also vary in the overall width of the tubing sections. Tuba sizes are usually denoted by a quarter system, with designating a normal, full-size tuba. Larger rotary instruments are known as &quot;kaiser tubas&quot; and are often denoted . Larger piston tubas, particularly those with front action, are sometimes known as &quot;grand orchestral tubas&quot; (examples: the Conn 36J Orchestra Grand Bass from the 1930s, and the current model Hirsbrunner HB-50 &quot;Grand Orchestral&quot;, which is a replica of the large York tubas owned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra). Grand orchestral tubas are generally described as tubas. Smaller instruments may be described as instruments. 

No standards exist for these designations, and their use is up to manufacturers, who usually use them to distinguish among the instruments in their own product line. The size designation is related to the larger outer branches and not to the bore of the tubing at the valves, though the bore is usually reported in instrument specifications. The quarter system is also not directly related to bell size, though there is typically a correlation. tubas are common in American grade schools for use by young tuba players for whom a full-size instrument might be too cumbersome. Though smaller and lighter, they are tuned and keyed identically to full-size tubas of the same pitch, although they usually have 3 rather than 4 or 5 valves.

===Valves===
Tubas are made with either piston or rotary valves. Rotary valves, invented by Joseph Riedl, are based on a design included in the original valve patents by Friedrich Blühmel and Heinrich Stölzel in 1818. Červený of Graslitz was the first to use true rotary valves, starting in the 1840s or 1850s. Modern piston valves were developed by François Périnet for the saxhorn family of instruments promoted by Adolphe Sax around the same time. Pistons may either be oriented to point to the top of the instrument (top-action) or out the front of the instrument (front-action or side-action).

Piston valves require more maintenance than rotary valves – they require regular oiling to keep them freely operating, while rotary valves are sealed and seldom require oiling. Piston valves are easy to disassemble and re-assemble, while rotary valve disassembly and re-assembly is much more difficult and is generally left to qualified instrument repair persons.

Tubas generally have from three to six valves, though some rare exceptions exist. Three-valve tubas are generally the least expensive and are almost exclusively used by amateurs, and the sousaphone (a marching version of a BB tuba) usually has three valves. Among advanced players, four and five valve tubas are by far the most common choices, with six-valve tubas being relatively rare except among F tubas, which mostly have five or six valves.

The valves add tubing to the main tube of the instrument, thus lowering its fundamental pitch. The first valve lowers the pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a semitone, and the third valve by three semitones. Used in combination, the valve tubing is too short and the resulting pitch tends to be sharp. For example, a BB tuba becomes (in effect) an A tuba when the first valve is depressed. The third valve is long enough to lower the pitch of a BB tuba by three semitones, but it is not long enough to lower the pitch of an A tuba by three semitones. Thus, the first and third valves used in combination lower the pitch by something &quot;just short&quot; of five semitones, and the first three valves used in combination are nearly a quarter tone sharp.

The fourth valve is used in place of combinations of the first and third valves, and the second and fourth used in combination are used in place of the first three valves in combination. The fourth valve can be tuned to lower the pitch of the main tube accurately by five semitones, and thus its use corrects the main problem of combinations being too sharp. By using the fourth valve by itself to replace the first and third combination, or the fourth and second valves in place of the first, second and third valve combinations, the notes requiring these fingerings are more in tune. The fourth valve used in combination with, rather than instead of, the first three valves fills in the missing notes in the bottom octave allowing the player to play chromatically down to the fundamental pitch of the instrument. For the reason given in the preceding paragraph some of these notes will tend to be sharp and must by &quot;lipped&quot; into tune by the player.

A fifth and sixth valve, if fitted, are used to provide alternative fingering possibilities to improve intonation, and are also used to reach into the low register of the instrument where all the valves will be used in combination to fill the first octave between the fundamental pitch and the next available note on the open tube. The fifth and sixth valves also give the musician the ability to trill more smoothly or to use alternative fingerings for ease of playing. This type of tuba is what is most found in orchestras and wind bands around the world.

The bass tuba in F is pitched a fifth above the BB tuba and a fourth above the CC tuba, so it needs additional tubing length beyond that provided by four valves to play securely down to a low F as required in much tuba music. The fifth valve is commonly tuned to a flat whole step, so that when used with the fourth valve, it gives an in-tune low B. The sixth valve is commonly tuned as a flat half step, allowing the F tuba to play low G as 1-4-5-6 and low G as 1-2-4-5-6. In CC tubas with five valves, the fifth valve may be tuned as a flat whole step or as a minor third depending on the instrument.

===Compensating valves===
Some tubas have a compensating system to allow accurate tuning when using several valves in combination, simplifying fingering and removing the need to constantly adjust slide positions. The most popular of the automatic compensation systems was invented by Blaikley (Bevan, 1874) and was patented by Boosey (later, Boosey and Hawkes, which also, later still, produced Besson instruments). The patent on the system limited its application outside of Britain, and to this day, tubas with compensating valves are primarily popular in the United Kingdom and countries of the former British Empire. 

The Blaikley design plumbs the instrument so that if the fourth valve is used, the air is sent back through a second set of branches in the first three valves to compensate for the combination of valves. This does have the disadvantage of making the instrument significantly more &quot;stuffy&quot; or resistant to air flow when compared to a non-compensating tuba. This is due to the need for the air to flow through the valves twice. It also makes the instrument heavier. But many prefer this approach to having additional valvesor to the manipulation of tuning slides while playingto achieve improved intonation within an ensemble. 

Most modern professional-grade euphoniums also now feature Blaikley-style compensating valves.

===Resonance and false tones===
Some tubas have a strong and useful resonance that is not in the well-known harmonic series. For example, most large B tubas have a strong resonance at low E (E1, 39 Hz), which is between the fundamental and the second harmonic (an octave higher than the fundamental). These alternative resonances are often known as false tones or privileged tones. Adding the six semitones provided by the three valves, these alternative resonances let the instrument play chromatically down to the fundamental of the open bugle (which is a 29 Hz B0). The addition of valves below that note can lower the instrument a further six semitones to a 20 Hz E0. Thus, even three-valved instruments with good alternative resonances can produce very low sounds in the hands of skilled players; instruments with four valves can play even lower. 

The lowest note in the widely known repertoire is a 16 Hz double-pedal C0 in the William Kraft piece &quot;Encounters II&quot;, which is often played using a timed flutter tongue rather than by buzzing the lips. The fundamental of this pitch borders on infrasound and its overtones define the pitch in the listener&#x27;s ear.

===Materials and finish===
The tuba is generally constructed of brass, which is either unfinished, lacquered or electro-plated with nickel, gold or silver. Unfinished brass will eventually tarnish and thus must be periodically polished to maintain its appearance.

=== Manufacturers ===
There are many types of tubas that are manufactured in Europe, the United States, and Asia. In Europe, the predominant models that are professionally used are Meinl-Weston (Germany) and Miraphone (Germany). Asian brands include the Yamaha Corporation (Japan) and Jupiter Instruments (Taiwan). Holton Instrument Company and King Musical Instruments are some of the most well known brands from the United States.

==Variations==
Some tubas are capable of being converted into a marching style, known as &quot;marching tubas&quot;. A leadpipe can be manually screwed on next to the valves. The tuba is then usually rested on the left shoulder (although some tubas allow use of the right shoulder), with the bell facing directly in front of the player. Some marching tubas are made only for marching, and cannot be converted into a concert model. 

Most marching bands opt for the sousaphone, an instrument that is easier to carry since it was invented specifically for this and almost always cheaper than a true marching tuba. The earlier helicon is still used by bands in Europe and other parts of the world. Drum and bugle corps players, however, generally use marching tubas or Contrabass bugles. 

Standard tubas can also be played whilst standing and marching, which is the usual practice in British brass bands and military bands. With the comfort of the player in mind, companies have provided harnesses that sometimes use a strap joined to the tuba with two rings, a &#x27;sack&#x27; to hold the bottom of the tuba, or numerous straps holding the larger parts of tubing on the tuba. The strap(s) goes over the shoulder like a sash or sit at the waist, so the musician can play the instrument in the same position as when sitting.

==Jazz==
The tuba has been used in jazz since the genre&#x27;s inception. In the earliest years, bands often used a tuba for outdoor playing and a double bass for indoor performances. In this context, the tuba was sometimes called &quot;brass bass&quot;, as opposed to the double bass &quot;(string bass)&quot;. Many musicians played both instruments.

This practice was mostly used in the New Orleans jazz scene. The tuba was used most frequently with the Louis Armstrong groups and prominent in the album &quot;Hot Five&quot;.

In modern jazz, it is not unknown for their players to take solos. New Orleans style brass bands like the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and the Rebirth Brass Band use a sousaphone as the bass instrument. Bill Barber played tuba on several Miles Davis albums, including the sessions compiled as the &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; and &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;. New York City-based tubist Marcus Rojas performed frequently with Henry Threadgill. Starting in 1955, Stan Kenton made his fifth trombonist double on tuba, namely on ballads to make use of the tuba&#x27;s distinct warm, enveloping sound.

<doc id="30963" wikidata="Q212647" url="?curid=30963" title="Saint Timothy">
<text>Timothy or Timothy of Ephesus (Greek: , &quot;Timótheos&quot;, meaning &quot;honouring God&quot; or &quot;honoured by God&quot;) was an early Christian evangelist and the first Christian bishop of Ephesus, who tradition relates died around the year AD 97.

Timothy was from the Lycaonian city of Lystra or of Derbe in Asia Minor, born of a Jewish mother who had become a Christian believer, and a Greek father. The Apostle Paul met him during his second missionary journey and he became Paul&#x27;s companion and missionary partner along with Silas. The New Testament indicates that Timothy traveled with Paul the Apostle, who was also his mentor. He is addressed as the recipient of the First and Second Epistles to Timothy. While included in the Pauline epistles of the New Testament, First and Second Timothy are considered by many biblical scholars to be pseudoepigraphical and not written by Paul.

==Life==
Timothy was a native of Lystra or of Derbe in Lycaonia (Anatolia). When Paul and Barnabas first visited Lystra, Paul healed a person crippled from birth, leading many of the inhabitants to accept his teaching. When he returned a few years later with Silas, Timothy was already a respected member of the Christian congregation, as were his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice, both Jews. In 2 Timothy 1:5, his mother and grandmother are noted as eminent for their piety and faith. Timothy is said to have been acquainted with the Scriptures since childhood. In 1 Corinthians 16:10, there is a suggestion that he was by nature reserved and timid: &quot;When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord&quot;.

Timothy&#x27;s father was a Greek Gentile. Thus Timothy had not been circumcised and Paul now ensured that this was done, according to Acts 16:1-3, to ensure Timothy&#x27;s acceptability to the Jews whom they would be evangelizing. According to John William McGarvey: “Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this ‘on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.’” This did not compromise the decision made at the Council of Jerusalem, that gentile believers were not required to be circumcised.

==Ministry==

Timothy became St Paul&#x27;s disciple, and later his constant companion and co-worker in preaching. In the year 52, Paul and Silas took Timothy along with them on their journey to Macedonia. Augustine extols his zeal and disinterestedness in immediately forsaking his country, his house, and his parents, to follow the apostle, to share in his poverty and sufferings. Timothy may have been subject to ill health or &quot;frequent ailments&quot;, and Paul encouraged him to &quot;use a little wine for your stomach&#x27;s sake&quot;.

When Paul went on to Athens, Silas and Timothy stayed for some time at Beroea and Thessalonica before joining Paul at Corinth. suggests that from Corinth, Paul sent Timothy back to Thessalonika to enquire about the community&#x27;s continued faith, reporting back that it was in good shape. Timothy next appears in Acts during Paul&#x27;s stay in Ephesus (54–57), and in late A. D. 56 or early 57 Paul sent him forth to Macedonia with the aim that he would eventually arrive at Corinth. Timothy arrived at Corinth just after Paul&#x27;s letter 1 Corinthians reached that city.

Timothy was with Paul in Corinth during the winter of 57–58 when Paul dispatched his Letter to the Romans. According to Acts 20:3–6, Timothy was with Paul in Macedonia just before Passover in 58; he left the city before Paul, going ahead of him to await Paul in Troas. &quot;That is the last mention of Timothy in Acts&quot;, Raymond Brown notes. In the year 64, Paul left Timothy at Ephesus, to govern that church.

His relationship with Paul was close. Timothy&#x27;s name appears as the co-author on 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Paul wrote to the Philippians about Timothy, &quot;I have no one like him.&quot; When Paul was in prison and awaiting martyrdom, he summoned his faithful friend Timothy for a last farewell.

That Timothy was jailed at least once during the period of the writing of the New Testament is implied by the writer of Hebrews mentioning Timothy&#x27;s release at the end of the epistle.

Although not stated in the New Testament, other sources have records of the apostle&#x27;s death. The apocryphal &quot;Acts of Timothy&quot; states that in the year 97 AD, the 80-year-old bishop tried to halt a procession in honor of the goddess Diana by preaching the Gospel. The angry pagans beat him, dragged him through the streets, and stoned him to death.

==Veneration==
Timothy is venerated as an apostle, saint, and martyr by the Eastern Orthodox Church, with his feast day on 22 January. The General Roman Calendar venerates Timothy together with Titus by a memorial on 26 January, the day after the Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul. From the 13th century until 1969 the feast of Timothy (alone) was on 24 January, the day before that of the Conversion of Saint Paul. Along with Titus and Silas, Timothy is commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 26 January. Timothy&#x27;s feast is kept by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod on 24 January.

Timothy is honored on the calendars of the Church of England and the Episcopal Church (with Titus) on 26 January.

In the 4th century, the relics of Timothy were transferred from Ephesus to Constantinople and placed in the Church of the Holy Apostles near the tombs of Andrew and Luke. Later on in the 13th century, the relics seem to have been taken to Italy by a count returning from the crusades, and buried around 1239 in the Termoli Cathedral. The remains were rediscovered in 1945, during restoration work.

===Patronage===
Timothy is invoked against stomach and intestinal disorders.

==Pastoral Epistles==
There are two letters to Timothy attributed to Paul the Apostle, the First Epistle to Timothy and the Second Epistle to Timothy. These – along with the Epistle to Titus – are called the Pastoral Epistles, and are considered pseudepigraphic by some modern scholars, including Bart Ehrman, Raymond Collins, and David E. Aune.

===First Timothy (c. 62–64)===
The author of this epistle writes to Timothy concerning the organization of the church and Timothy&#x27;s own leadership within the body. Major themes include the use of The Law, warnings against false doctrine such as Encratism, instructions for prayer, roles of women in the church, qualifications for leaders of the church, and the treatment of widows, elders, masters, youth, and church members in general.

===Second Timothy (c. 62–64)===
According to the letter, Paul urges Timothy not to have a &quot;spirit of timidity&quot; and not to &quot;be ashamed to testify about our Lord&quot;. He also entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him. Paul clearly anticipates his being put to death and realities beyond in his valedictory found in 2 Timothy 4:6–8. He exhorts his spiritual &quot;son&quot; Timothy to all diligence and steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about combating them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to patience under persecution, and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office, with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of the quick and the dead (God).

==Acts of Timothy==

The Acts of Timothy (Acta Timothei) is a work of New Testament apocrypha, most likely from the 5th century. The Acts tell how Paul had consecrated Timothy as bishop during Nero&#x27;s reign on the occasion of a visit to Ephesus which they made together. Then, under Nerva, Timothy suffers a martyr&#x27;s death during a pagan festival. Timothy &quot;attempts to put an end to the wild and violent goings-on but himself falls victim to the orgies.&quot;
The Acts of Timothy contain almost as much material about John the Evangelist, who was also a resident of Ephesus as they do about Timothy.

<text>The Third Epistle of John is the third-to-last book of the New Testament and the Christian Bible as a whole, and attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two epistles of John. The Third Epistle of John is a personal letter sent by &quot;the elder&quot; (the presbyter) to a man named Gaius, recommending to him a group of Christians led by Demetrius, which had come to preach the gospel in the area where Gaius lived. The purpose of the letter is to encourage and strengthen Gaius, and to warn him against Diotrephes, who refuses to cooperate with the author of the letter.

Early church literature contains no mention of the epistle, with the first reference to it appearing in the middle of the third century AD. This lack of documentation, though likely due to the extreme brevity of the epistle, caused early church writers to doubt its authenticity until the early 5th century, when it was accepted into the canon along with the other two epistles of John. The language of 3 John echoes that of the Gospel of John, which is conventionally dated to around AD 90, so the epistle was likely written near the end of the first century. Others contest this view, such as the scholar John A. T. Robinson, who dates 3 John to . The location of writing is unknown, but tradition places it in Ephesus. The epistle is found in many of the oldest New Testament manuscripts, and its text is free of major discrepancies or textual variants.

== Content ==
There is no doctrine laid out in 3 John, which is strictly a personal letter, but the overall theme is the importance of hospitality, especially when it comes to men who were working to spread the gospel. Third John is the shortest book of the Bible by word count, though 2 John has fewer verses. 3 John has 15 verses in the critical SBL Greek New Testament text, or 14 in the Textus Receptus.

It is the only New Testament book which does not contain the names &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Christ&quot;. The original Greek uses the term Ὀνόματος (Onomatos, verse 7) generally translated &quot;Name&quot; and referring specifically to the &quot;Name of Jesus&quot;, but the text does not say &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Christ&quot;.

===Greeting and introduction===
The letter is written to a man named Gaius. Gaius seems to have been a wealthy man, since the epistle&#x27;s author, who identifies himself only as &quot;the Elder&quot;, did not think it would impose unduly on him to host some traveling preachers for a short time. The Elder may have converted Gaius, since he calls Gaius his &quot;child&quot; in the faith. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; VII.46.9 records that Gaius was made bishop of Pergamon, though there is no early support for this statement.

The name Gaius occurs four other times in the New Testament. First, a Christian Gaius is mentioned in Macedonia as a traveling companion of Paul, along with Aristarchus (Acts 19:29). One chapter later, a Gaius from Derbe is named as one of Paul&#x27;s seven traveling companions who waited for him at Troas (Acts 20:4). Next, a Gaius is mentioned residing in Corinth as being one of only a few people there (the others being Crispus and the household of Stephanas) who were baptised by Paul, who founded the Church in that city (1 Corinthians 1:14). Lastly, a Gaius is referred to in a final greeting portion of the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:23) as Paul&#x27;s &quot;host&quot; and also host of the whole church, in whatever city Paul is writing from at the time (probably Corinth). However, there is no reason to suppose that any of these men were the Gaius of 3 John.

===Verse 2===
:&quot;Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.&quot;
This verse, where the author wishes material prosperity upon Gaius similar to the prosperity of his soul, is a commonly used proof text within prosperity gospel teachings; opponents of the prosperity gospel consider the verse to be little more than well-wishing.

===Missionaries===
The Elder continues the letter by commending Gaius for his loyalty and his hospitality towards a group of traveling &quot;brothers&quot;. The &quot;brothers&quot; are brothers in the faith or missionaries, who in accordance with Jesus&#x27;s command in Mark 6:8–9 have set out on a journey without any money. The Elder then goes on to request that Gaius provide for the brothers to continue their journey.

===Opposition of Diotrephes===
The Elder next describes his conflict with Diotrephes, who does not acknowledge the Elder&#x27;s authority and is excommunicating those, like Gaius, who welcome missionaries sent by the Elder. In verse 9 the Elder mentions a previous letter which he has written to the church which was suppressed by Diotrephes, and says that he intends to visit the church and to confront Diotrephes. &quot;The church&quot; is apparently known to Gaius, but he is likely not a member of it, since otherwise the Elder would not need to provide him with information about Diotrephes&#x27;s activities. The dispute between Diotrephes and the Elder seems to be based on church leadership and authority rather than doctrine, since the Elder does not accuse Diotrephes of teaching heresy.

Most scholars do not connect the letter the Elder mentions with 2 John, since 3 John does not contain any reference to the doctrinal controversy described in 2 John, and argue that the Elder is here referring to a previous letter of recommendation. John Painter, however, argues the Elder is in fact referring to 2 John, since there is overlap between 2 John 9 and the theme of hospitality in 3 John.

The Elder closes this section with an entreaty to Gaius: &quot;Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.&quot; This injunction is reminiscent of several passages in 1 John (2:3–5, 3:4–10, 4:7).

===Final greetings and conclusion===
Verse 12 introduces another man named Demetrius, who according to the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; VII.46.9 was ordained by John as bishop of Philadelphia (modern Amman, Jordan). Demetrius was probably a member of the group of missionaries discussed earlier in the letter, and 3 John likely serves as a recommendation letter to Gaius about Demetrius. Recommendation letters were quite common in the early church, as evidenced by 2 Corinthians 3:1, Romans 16:1–2, and Colossians 4:7–8.

The Elder, before ending the letter, says that he has many other things to tell to Gaius, and plans to make a journey to see him in the near future, using almost the exact language of 2 John 12. The closing verse, &quot;Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, one by one&quot;, is typical of contemporary correspondence, with &quot;Peace be to you&quot; a greeting adopted by Christians from the Jews.

==Authorship==
3 John was almost certainly written by the same author who wrote 2 John, and likely 1 John as well. This individual may have been John the Evangelist himself or someone else, perhaps John the Presbyter, though according to scholar C. H. Dodd, &quot;If we attempt to ... identify the anonymous author of these epistles with some known individual, we have little but surmise to go on.&quot;

There are many similarities between 2 and 3 John. Both follow the format of other personal letters of the era; in both the author self-identifies as &quot;the Presbyter&quot;, a term which literally means &quot;the elder&quot;; and both deal with themes of hospitality and conflict within the church. They are also extremely similar in length, probably because they were both written to fit on one papyrus sheet.

3 John is also linguistically similar to both 2 John and other Johannine works. Of 99 different words used, 21 are unimportant words like &quot;and&quot; or &quot;the&quot;, leaving 78 significant words. 23 of these do not appear in 1 John or the Gospel of John, of which four are unique to 3 John, one is common to 2 and 3 John, and two are found in both 2 and 3 John as well as in other New Testament writings. Approximately 30% of the significant words in 3 John do not appear in 1 John or the Gospel, compared to 20% for 2 John. These considerations indicate a close affinity between 2 and 3 John, though 2 John is more strongly connected with 1 John than it is with 3 John. A minority of scholars, however, argue against common authorship of 2 and 3 John, and Rudolf Bultmann held that 2 John was a forgery based on 3 John.

If 3 John was written by John the Apostle, however, it is strange that Diotrephes would oppose him since the apostles were highly respected in the early church. One possible alternative view of the epistle&#x27;s authorship arises from a fragment written by Papias of Hierapolis and quoted by Eusebius which mentions a man named &quot;the Presbyter John&quot;. However, since nothing else is known of this individual it is not possible to positively identify him as the author of 3 John.

===Date and location of writing===
All three letters of John were likely written within a few years of each other, and internal evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them in the second half of the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.

Dodd argues for a date between 96 and 110 A.D., concluding from the absence of references to persecution in the letters that they were probably written after the harsh reign (AD 81–96) of the Roman emperor Domitian, whose persecution of Christians seems to have prompted the writing of the Book of Revelation. Dodd notes, however, that they could have been written in the pre-Domitian era, which is likely if the author was a personal disciple of Jesus. Marshall suggests a date of between the 60s and 90s. Rensberger suggests a dating of around 100, assuming that the Gospel of John was written in the 90s and the letters must have followed after. Brown argues for a date of between 100 and 110, with all three letters composed in close time proximity. A date past 110–115 is unlikely, as parts of 1 John and 2 John are quoted by Polycarp and Papias.

The letters do not indicate the location of authorship, but since the earliest quotations of them (in the writings of Polycarp, Papias, and Irenaeus) come from the province of Asia Minor, it is likely that the epistles were also written in Asia. Church tradition typically places them in the city of Ephesus.

===Manuscripts===
3 John is preserved in many of the old manuscripts of the New Testament. Of the Greek great uncial codices, codices Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Vaticanus contain all three Johannine epistles, while Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus contains 3 John 3–15 along with 1 John 1:1–4. Codex Bezae, while missing most of the Catholic epistles, contains 3 John 11–15 in Latin translation. In languages other than Greek, the Vulgate and the Sahidic, Armenian, Philoxenian Syriac, and Ethiopian versions contain all three epistles. Between the different copies there are no major difficulties or differences, meaning that there is very little doubt over determining the original text.

==Canonical history==

There are some doubtful similarities between passages in the Johannine epistles and the writings of Polycarp and Papias, but the earliest definitive references to the epistles come from the late second century. Irenaeus in &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot; 3.16.8 (written ), quotes 2 John 7 and 8, and in the next sentence 1 John 4:1, 2, but does not distinguish between 1 and 2 John; he does not quote from 3 John. The Muratorian Canon seems to refer to two letters of John only, though it is possible to interpret it as referring to three. 1 John is extensively cited by Tertullian, who died in 215, and Clement of Alexandria, in addition to quoting 1 John, wrote a commentary on 2 John in his &quot;Adumbrationes&quot;. All three Johannine epistles were recognized by the 39th festal letter of Athanasius, the Synod of Hippo and the Council of Carthage (397). Additionally Didymus the Blind wrote a commentary on all three epistles, showing that by the early 5th century they were being considered as a single unit.

The first reference to 3 John is in the middle of the third century; Eusebius says that Origen knew of both 2 and 3 John, however Origen is reported as saying &quot;all do not consider them genuine&quot;. Similarly, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Origen&#x27;s pupil, was aware of a &quot;reputed Second or Third Epistle of John&quot;. Also around this time 3 John is thought to have been known in North Africa as it was referred to in the &quot;Sententiae Episcoporum&quot; produced by the Seventh Council of Carthage. There was doubt about the authority of 3 John, however, with Eusebius listing it and 2 John as &quot;disputed books&quot; despite describing them as &quot;well-known and acknowledged by most&quot;. Although Eusebius believed the Apostle wrote the Gospel and the epistles, it is likely that doubt about the fidelity of the author of 2 and 3 John was a factor in causing them to be disputed. By the end of the fourth century the Presbyter (author of 2 and 3 John) was thought to be a different person than the Apostle John. This opinion, although reported by Jerome, was not held by all, as Jerome himself attributed the epistles to John the Apostle.
