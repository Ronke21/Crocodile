<text>The history of Western Sahara can be traced back to the times of Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator in the 5th century BC. Though few historical records are left from that period, Western Sahara&#x27;s modern history has its roots linked to some nomadic groups (living under Berber tribal rule and in contact with the Roman Empire) such as the Sanhaja group, and the introduction of Islam and the Arabic language at the end of the 8th century AD.

Western Sahara has never been a nation in the modern sense of the word. It was home to Phoenician colonies, but those disappeared with virtually no trace. Islam arrived there in the 8th century, but the region, beset with desertification, remained little developed. 
From the 11th to the 19th centuries, Western Sahara was one of the links between the sub-Saharan and North African regions. During the 11th century, the Sanhaja tribal confederation allied with the Lamtuna tribe to found the Almoravid dynasty. The conquests of the Almoravids extended over present-day Morocco, Western Algeria, and the Iberian Peninsula to the north and Mauritania and Mali to the south, reaching the Ghana Empire. By the 16th century, the Arab Saadi dynasty conquered the Songhai Empire based on the Niger River. Some Trans-Saharan trade routes also traversed Western Sahara.

In 1884, Spain claimed a protectorate over the coast from Cape Bojador to Cape Blanc, and the area was later extended. In 1958, Spain combined separate districts together to form the province of Spanish Sahara.

A 1975 advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice on the status of the Western Sahara held that while some of the region&#x27;s tribes had historical ties to Morocco, they were insufficient to establish &quot;any tie of territorial sovereignty&quot; between the Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco. In November of that year, the Green March into Western Sahara began when 350,000 unarmed Moroccans, accompanied by the Moroccan Army armed with heavy weapons, converged on the southern city of Tarfaya and waited for a signal from King Hassan II of Morocco to cross into Western Sahara. As a result of pressure from France, the US, and the UK, Spain abandoned Western Sahara on November 14, 1975, going so far as to even exhume Spanish corpses from cemeteries. Morocco later virtually annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara in 1976, and the rest of the territory in 1979, following Mauritania&#x27;s withdrawal.

On February 27, 1976, the Polisario Front formally proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and set up a government in exile, initiating a guerrilla war between the Polisario and Morocco, which continued until a 1991 cease-fire. As part of the 1991 peace accords, a referendum was to be held among indigenous people, giving them the option between independence or inclusion within Morocco. To date the referendum has never been held because of questions over who is eligible to vote.

==Ancient and classical antiquity==
Phoenician/Carthaginian colonies established or reinforced by Hanno the Navigator in the 5th century BC have vanished with virtually no trace. The desertification of the Sahara during the &quot;transitional arid phase&quot; ca. 300 BC - 300 AD&quot; made contact with some parts with the outside world very difficult before the introduction of the camel into these areas, from the third century of the Christian era on.

===Contacts with Roman Empire===
Plinius wrote that the coastal area north of the river Senegal and south of the Atlas Mountains was populated, during Augustus times, by the &quot;Pharusii&quot; and &quot;Perorsi&quot;,

What is now Western Sahara was a dry savanna area during classical antiquity, where independent tribes like the Pharusii and the Perorsi led a semi-nomadic life facing growing desertification.

Romans made explorations toward this area and probably reached, with Suetonius Paulinus, the area of Adrar. There is evidence (e.g., coins, fibulas) of Roman commerce in Akjoujt and Tamkartkart near Tichit.

The western Sahara population (in those first centuries of the Roman Empire) consisted of nomads (mainly of the Sanhaja tribal confederation) in the plains and sedentary populations in river valleys, in oases, and in towns like Awdaghust Tichitt, Oualata, Taghaza, Timbuktu, Awlil, Azuki, and Tamdult.

Some Berber tribes moved to Mauritania in the third and fourth century, and after the 13th century some Arabs entered the region as conquerors.

==Islamic era==
Islam arrived in the 8th century AD between the Berber population who inhabited the western part of the Sahara. The Islamic faith quickly expanded, brought by Arab immigrants, who initially only blended superficially with the population, mostly confining themselves to the cities of present-day Morocco and Spain.

The Berbers increasingly used the traditional trade routes of the Sahara. Caravans transported salt, gold and slaves between North Africa and West Africa, and the control of trade routes became a major ingredient in the constant power struggle between various tribes. On more than one occasion, the Berber tribes of the Western Sahara would unite behind religious leaders to sweep the ruling leaders from power, sometimes founding dynasties of their own. This was the case with the Almoravids and Al-Andalus, and was also the case with the jihad of Nasir al-Din in the 17th century and the later Qadiriyyah movement of the Kunta in the 18th century.

==Zawiyas==
An important role was played by the zawiyas. These zawiya tribes became the tribes of the teachers, specialists of religion, law and education.

==Arabization of the mujahideen (13th and 14th century)==
In the 13th and 14th century, these tribes migrated westwards along the Sahara&#x27;s northern border to settle in the Fezzan (Libya), Ifriqiya (Tunisia), Tlemcen (Algeria), Jebel Saghro (Morocco), and Saguia el-Hamra (Western Sahara).

Ouadane, Idjil (near Atar), Azougui, Araouane, Taoudenni, and later Tindouf were important stopping-places. At the same time, the number of slaves kept in Western Sahara itself increased drastically.
The Maqil tribes, who entered the domains of the Sanhaja Berber tribe, sometimes intermarried with the Berber population; the Arabo-Berber people of the region are now known as Saharawi. An exonym sometimes used to describe the Banu Hassan tribes of present-day of the region was Moors. The Arabic dialect, Hassaniya, became the dominant mother-tongue of the Western Sahara and Mauritania. Berber vocabulary and cultural traits remain common, despite the fact that many Saharawi people today claim Arab ancestry.

==Colonial era (1884–1975)==
Western Sahara came under Spanish rule, despite attempts by the Moroccan sultan Hassan I to repel the European incursions on the territory in 1886. The oases of Tuat in the south-east went to the immense territory of the French Sahara. In 1898, in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War, Spain attempted to sell Spanish Sahara to Austria-Hungary; Spain wished to recoup its losses from the conflict and several Austrian ministers wished to obtain an overseas colony to justify naval expansion. However, as Austria-Hungary operated as a dual monarchy with Austria and Hungary having joint control over financial and foreign policy matters, the Hungarian House of Magnates vetoed the purchase and the colony was retained by Spain.

===Sahrawi tribes===
The modern ethnic group is thus an Arabized Berber people inhabiting the westernmost Sahara desert, in the area of modern Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria and most notably the Western Sahara, with some tribes traditionally migrating into northern Mali and Niger. As with most Saharan peoples, the tribes reflect a highly mixed heritage, combining Arab, Berber, and other influences, including black African ethnic and cultural characteristics.

In pre-colonial times, the tribal areas of the Sahara desert was generally considered &quot;bled es-Siba&quot; or &quot;the land of dissidence&quot; by the authorities of the established Islamic states of North Africa, such as the Sultan of Morocco and the Deys of Algeria. The Islamic governments of the pre-colonial sub-Saharan empires of Mali and Songhai appear to have had a similar relationship with these territories, which were at once the home of undisciplined raiding tribes and the main trade route for the Saharan caravan trade. Central governments had little control over the region, although some Hassaniya tribes would occasionally extended &quot;beya&quot; or allegiance to prestigious neighbouring rulers, to gain their political backing or, in some cases, as a religious ceremony.

Best reference on Sahrawi population ethnography in the Spanish colonial era is the work of Spanish anthropologist Julio Caro Baroja, who in 1952–53 spent several months among native tribes all along the then Spanish Sahara.

===Spanish Sahara===
In 1884, Spain claimed a protectorate over the coast from Cape Bojador to Cap Blanc. Later, the Spanish extended their area of control. In 1958 Spain joined the previously separate districts of Saguia el-Hamra (in the north) and Río de Oro (in the south) to form the province of Spanish Sahara.

Raids and rebellions by the Sahrawi population kept the Spanish forces out of much of the territory for a long time. Ma al-Aynayn started an uprising against the French in the 1910s, at a time when France had expanded its influence and control in North-West Africa. French forces finally beat him when he tried to conquer Marrakesh, but his sons and followers figured prominently in several rebellions which followed. Not until the second destruction of Smara in 1934, by joint Spanish and French forces, did the territory finally become subdued. Another uprising in 1956–1958, initiated by the Moroccan Army of Liberation, led to heavy fighting, but eventually the Spanish forces regained control - again with French aid. However, unrest simmered, and in 1967 the Harakat Tahrir arose to challenge Spanish rule peacefully. After the events of the Zemla Intifada in 1970, when Spanish police destroyed the organization and &quot;disappeared&quot; its founder, Muhammad Bassiri, anti-Spanish feeling or Sahrawi nationalism again took a militant turn.

==Western Sahara conflict==

From 1973 the colonizers gradually lost control over the countryside to the armed guerrillas of the Polisario Front, a nationalist organization. Successive Spanish attempts to form loyal Sahrawi political institutions (such as the Djema&#x27;a -many members of the Yemaa are today in Polisario Movement- and the PUNS party) to support its rule, and draw activists away from the radical nationalists, failed. As the health of the Spanish leader Francisco Franco deteriorated, the Madrid government slipped into disarray, and sought a way out of the Sahara conflict. The fall in 1974 of the Portuguese Estado Novo-government after unpopular wars in its own African provinces seems to have hastened the decision to pull out.

==Armed conflict (1975–1991)==

In late 1975, Spain held meetings with Polisario leader El-Ouali, to negotiate the terms for a handover of power. But at the same time, Morocco and Mauritania began to put pressure on the Franco government: both countries argued that Spanish Sahara formed a historical part of their own territories. The United Nations became involved after Morocco asked for an opinion on the legality of its demands from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and the UN also sent a visiting mission to examine the wishes of the population. The visiting mission returned its report on October 15, announcing &quot;an overwhelming consensus&quot; in favor of independence (as opposed to integration with Morocco or with Mauritania, or continued rule by Spain). The mission, headed by Simeon Aké, also declared that the Polisario Front seemed the main Sahrawi organization of the territory - the only rival arrangements to what the mission described as Polisario&#x27;s &quot;mass demonstrations&quot; came from the PUNS, which by this time also advocated independence. Polisario then made further diplomatic gains by ensuring the backing of the main Sahrawi tribes and of a number of formerly pro-Spanish Djema&#x27;a elders at the Ain Ben Tili conference of October 12.

On October 16, the ICJ delivered its verdict. To the dismay of both the Rabat and Nouakchott governments, the court found with a clear majority, that the historical ties of these countries to Spanish Sahara did &quot;not&quot; grant them the right to the territory. Furthermore, the Court declared that the concept of &quot;terra nullius&quot; (un-owned land) did not apply to the territory. The Court declared that the Sahrawi population, as the true owners of the land, held a right of self-determination. In other words, any proposed solution to the situation (independence, integration etc.), had to receive the explicit acceptance of the population to gain any legal standing. Neither Morocco nor Mauritania accepted this, and on October 31, 1975, Morocco sent its army into Western Sahara to attack Polisario positions. The public diplomacy between Spain and Morocco continued, however, with Morocco demanding bilateral negotiations over the fate of the territory.

On November 6, 1975 Morocco launched the Green March into Western Sahara. About 350,000 unarmed Moroccans accompanied by the Moroccan Army armed with heavy weapons converged on the city of Tarfaya in southern Morocco and waited for a signal from King Hassan II of Morocco to cross into Western Sahara. As a result of international pressure, Spain acceded to Moroccan demands, and entered bilateral negotiations. This led to the Madrid Agreement and the Western Sahara partition agreement, treaties that divided the administration of the territory between Morocco and Mauritania, but did not impact the sovereignty debate. Spain, Morocco and Mauritania did not consult the Sahrawi population, and the Polisario violently opposed the treaties. The developments chance in the region until the 1990s were strongly influenced by the power struggle of the Cold War. Algeria, Libya and Mali were allied to the Eastern bloc. Morocco was the only African country in the region that was allied to the West.

Algeria gave help to the Movimiento de Liberación del Sahara, that in the late 1960s and early 1970s formed a section of new &quot;split youngs&quot;. The majority of the Sahrawi people supported its patriotic actions and identified with this movement, which later was called Polisario, and gradually had more misunderstandings with the Autonomous and Central Government of the Metropoli for the signs of a &quot;vacilante&quot;, or feeble foreign policy, made up by generals that had the &quot;última palabra&quot; or &quot;last word&quot;, feeling a possible betrayal of the &quot;Motherland&quot;.

On November 14, 1975, Spain, Morocco and Mauritania signed the Madrid Accords, hence setting up a timetable for the retrieval of Spanish forces and ending Spanish occupation of Western Sahara. These accords were signed by the three parties in accordance with all international standards. In these accords, Morocco was set to annex back 2/3 of the northern part of Western Sahara, whereas the lower third would be given to Mauritania.
Polisario established their own Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and combined guerrilla warfare with their conventional military forces, the Sahrawi People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA).

On February 26, 1976 Spain&#x27;s formal mandate over the territory ended when it handed administrative power on to Morocco in a ceremony in Laayoune. The day after, the Polisario proclaimed in Bir Lehlou the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as a government in exile. Mauritania in its turn renamed the southern parts of Río de Oro as Tiris al-Gharbiyya, but proved unable to maintain control over the territory. Polisario made the weak Mauritanian army its main target, and after a bold raid on the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott (where a gunshot killed El-Ouali, the first president of the SADR), Mauritania succumbed to internal unrest. The presence of a large number of Sahrawi nationalists among the country&#x27;s dominant Moorish population made the Mauritanian government&#x27;s position yet more fragile, and thousands of Mauritanian Sahrawis defected to Polisario. In 1978 the army seized control of the Mauritanian government and Polisario declared a cease-fire, on the assumption that Mauritania would withdraw unconditionally. This eventually occurred in 1979, as Mauritania&#x27;s new rulers agreed to surrender all claims and to recognize the SADR. Following Mauritania&#x27;s withdrawal, however, Morocco extended its control to the rest of the territory, and the war continued.

Through the 1980s, the war stalemated through the construction of a desert sand berm, the Moroccan Wall. Sporadic fighting continued, and Morocco faced heavy burdens due to the economic costs of its massive troop deployments along the Wall. To some extent aid sent by Saudi Arabia, France and by the USA relieved the situation in Morocco, but matters gradually became unsustainable for all parties involved.

===Cease-fire===
In 1991, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on a UN-backed cease-fire in the Settlement Plan. This plan, its further detail fleshed out in the 1997 Houston Agreement, hinged upon Morocco&#x27;s agreement to a referendum on independence or unification with Morocco voted on by the Sahrawi population. The plan intended this referendum to constitute their exercise of self-determination, thereby completing the territory&#x27;s yet unfinished process of decolonization. The UN dispatched a peace-keeping mission, the MINURSO, to oversee the cease-fire and make arrangements for the vote. Initially scheduled for 1992, the referendum has not taken place, due to the conflict over who has the right to vote.

Two subsequent attempts to resolve the problem by means of a negotiated political settlement by James Baker, acting as Personal Envoy of the UN Secretary General, the first in 2000 and the second in 2003, failed to gain acceptance, the first being rejected by the Polisario and second by Morocco. Both attempts, the first referred to as &quot;The Framework Agreement&quot; and the second commonly referred to as &quot;The Peace Plan&quot;, contained the proposal of autonomy for the region under Moroccan sovereignty as core elements of the plans. Failure to gain acceptance by the parties to either proposal was a result of what each of the parties viewed as fundamental flaws in the respective proposals.

The Framework Agreement would have required the parties to agree on the specific terms of a political settlement based on the Autonomy/Sovereignty formula through direct negotiations. Baker presented the Peace Plan as a non-negotiable package that would have obliged each of the parties to accept its terms without further amendment. Both proposals contained elements that would have required popular endorsement of the solution through a referendum of the concerned populations. The UN Security Council declined to formally endorse either of the two proposals, which led eventually to Baker&#x27;s resignation as Personal Envoy.

The prolonged cease-fire has held without major disturbances, but Polisario has repeatedly threatened to resume fighting if no breakthrough occurs. Morocco&#x27;s withdrawal from both the terms of the original Settlement Plan and the Baker Plan negotiations in 2003 left the peace-keeping mission without a political agenda, which further increased the risks of renewed war.

Meanwhile, the gradual liberalization of political life in Morocco during the 1990s belatedly reached Western Sahara around 2000. This spurred political protest, as former &quot;disappeared&quot; and other human rights-campaigners began holding illegal demonstrations against Moroccan rule. The subsequent crackdowns and arrests drew media attention to the Moroccan occupation, and Sahrawi nationalists seized on the opportunity: in May 2005, a wave of demonstrations subsequently dubbed by the Independence Intifada by Polisario supporters, broke out. These demonstrations, which continued into the following year, were the most intense in years, and engendered a new wave of interest in the conflict, as well as new fears of instability. Polisario demanded international intervention but declared that it could not stand idly by if the &quot;escalation of repression&quot; continued.

In 2007, Morocco requested U.N. action against a congress to be held by the Polisario Front in Tifariti from December 14 to December 16. Morocco claimed Tifariti was part of a buffer zone and holding the congress there violated a cease-fire between the two parties. Additionally, the Polisario Front had been reported as planning a vote on a proposal for making preparations for war; if passed, it would have been the first time in 16 years preparations for war had been part of the Polisario&#x27;s strategy.

In October 2010, Gadaym Izik camp was set up near Laayoune as a protest by displaced Sahrawi people about their living conditions. It was home to more than 12,000 people. In November 2010, Moroccan security forces entered Gadaym Izik camp in the early hours of the morning, using helicopters and water cannons to force people to leave. The Polisario Front said Moroccan security forces had killed a 26-year-old protester at the camp, a claim denied by Morocco. Protesters in Laayoune threw stones at police and set fire to tires and vehicles. Several buildings, including a TV station, were also set afire. Moroccan officials said five security personnel had been killed in the unrest.
In 2020, the Polisario Front brought legal action against New Zealand&#x27;s superannuation fund for accepting &quot;blood phosphate&quot; from the occupied region. In November a brief conflict broke out near the Southern village of Guerguerat, with Morocco claiming to want to end a blockade of a road to Mauritania, and to pave that road.

<text>Western Sahara is a territory in Northern Africa, bordered by the North Atlantic Ocean, Morocco proper, Algeria (Tindouf region), and Mauritania. Geographic coordinates: 

== Size of Western Sahara ==

The size of Western Sahara, a region located in North Africa, is a critical aspect of its geopolitical and environmental profile. The territory’s vastness impacts its resource distribution, strategic importance, and the ongoing conflict over its sovereignty. Western Sahara is a significant area of study for its complex history and its role in regional and global geopolitics.

=== Area ===
Western Sahara encompasses approximately 266,000 square kilometers (102,703 square miles), which places it among the larger regions of Africa. This measurement provides a broad perspective on the land’s scale, revealing its comparative size to other nations and regions. For instance, Western Sahara is slightly larger than the United Kingdom but smaller than some of Africa’s largest countries, such as Algeria and Sudan. The size of Western Sahara is not merely a numerical fact; it is intrinsically linked to its physical geography and the strategic interests it holds for various stakeholders. The arid climate and extensive desert areas define much of its landscape, influencing the lifestyle of its inhabitants and the approaches taken by both local and international actors in addressing the territory&#x27;s status and development.

The region’s area also affects logistical considerations, such as the management of natural resources and the implementation of infrastructure projects. Its size presents both challenges and opportunities for resource exploration, environmental management, and territorial administration. Despite its vastness, much of Western Sahara remains sparsely populated, with the majority of its residents living in a few concentrated areas. This uneven distribution of population relative to the land area plays a significant role in the political and humanitarian issues faced by the region.

=== Geographic Context ===
Western Sahara&#x27;s geographic location is pivotal in understanding its significance. Situated in the northwest corner of Africa, it is bordered by Morocco to the north and east, Algeria to the northeast, Mauritania to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. This strategic position places it at the intersection of several historical and cultural exchange routes, which have influenced its development and the broader regional dynamics.

The landscape of Western Sahara is dominated by desert terrain, with features such as sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and sparse vegetation. The coastal areas along the Atlantic Ocean provide a contrast to the inland desert, offering a more temperate climate and supporting limited but important marine and coastal ecosystems. The terrain’s aridity and the lack of significant water resources have shaped the settlement patterns and economic activities within the region. Historical trade routes and migratory paths that traverse Western Sahara are a testament to its historical significance in connecting different parts of Africa and beyond.

Additionally, the desert environment poses unique challenges for infrastructure development and resource management. The region&#x27;s natural resources, including phosphate deposits and potential offshore oil reserves, add another layer of complexity to the geopolitical stakes associated with its size and geography.

==Land==

===Terrain===
The terrain is mostly low, flat desert with large areas of rocky or sandy surfaces rising to small mountains in south and northeast.

Elevation extremes:
:&quot;Lowest point:&quot; Sebjet Tah, , a depression in the northwest part of Western Sahara straddling the Morocco border
:&quot;Highest point:&quot; Unnamed elevation, , east of Awsard (Aousserd)

===Natural resources===
Phosphates, iron ore, and fishing resources on Atlantic Ocean coast

===Land use===
&quot;Arable land:&quot; 0.02%
*&quot;Permanent crops:&quot; 0%
*&quot;Other:&quot; 99.98% (2005)

Irrigated land: N/A

===Natural hazards===
Hot, dry, dust/sand-laden sirocco wind can occur during winter and spring; widespread harmattan haze exists 60% of time, often severely restricting visibility. Flash flooding occurs during spring months.

==Environment==

===Climate===
Western Sahara has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). Annual average rainfall is below everywhere. Along the Atlantic coast, average temperatures, both high and low, are constant and very moderated throughout the year because cool offshore ocean currents considerably cool off the climate, especially during the day. However, summertime is long and extremely hot and wintertime is short and very warm to truly hot further in the interior, where cooling marine influences aren&#x27;t felt anymore. Average high temperatures exceed in summer during a prolonged period of time but can reach as high as or even more in places such as Smara, Tichla, Bir Gandus, Bir Anzarane, Aghouinite, Aousserd and others. Average high temperatures exceed in winter but average low temperatures can drop to in some places. The sky is usually clear and bright throughout the year and sunny weather is the norm.

===Current issues===

Sparse water and lack of arable land.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of Western Sahara, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.
* Northernmost points – the border with Morocco*
* Easternmost points – the northern section of the border with Mauritania/Algeria**
* Southernmost point – the southern tip of Ras Nouadhibou (Cabo Blanco/Cap Blanc)
* Westernmost point – Cape Dubouchage on Ras Nouadhibou
** &quot;Note: Western Sahara does not have a northernmost point, the border being formed by a circle of latitude&quot;
** &quot;Note: Western Sahara does not have an easternmost point, the border being formed by a meridian&quot;

<text>All data about demographic information regarding Western Sahara are extremely error-prone, regardless of source. Most countries take censuses every ten years, and some every five in order to stay abreast of change and miscounts; the last count was conducted in 1970, and even that data by colonial Spain is considered unreliable due to large nomadic populations.

Following the 1975 Green March, the Moroccan state has sponsored settlement schemes enticing thousands of Moroccans to move into the Moroccan-occupied part of Western Sahara (80% of the territory). By 2015, it was estimated that Moroccan settlers made up at least two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants. Under international law, Morocco&#x27;s transfer of its own civilians into Non-Self-Governing territory is in direct violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

The religion in Western Sahara is Sunni Islam. The major ethnic groups are Arab and Berbers. The most common languages are Hassaniya Arabic and Moroccan Arabic.

==CIA World Factbook demographic statistics==
The following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.

===Languages===
Modern Standard Arabic and Spanish, the former colonial language, are the official languages of the Polisario Front, based in Tindouf, Algeria. Hassaniya, an Arabic dialect, is the native language spoken in Western Sahara and in the refugee camps in Tindouf in Algeria. There is also a significant presence of Berber language speakers in the northern parts of the territory of Western Sahara.

Hassaniya, primarily spoken at home, is dominated by the Moroccan dialect spoken in the streets, workplace, and schools. This is because the great majority of the population consists of Moroccans who settled in Western Sahara. French is also commonly used by the Moroccan administration. In the urban areas Moroccan Arabic is now spoken, as Morocco controls and administers most of the territory of Western Sahara and all of its cities, and considers it an inseparable part of the country. The Moroccan constitution stipulates two official languages for the Kingdom of Morocco, including Western Sahara: Berber (Tamazight) and Arabic.

Spanish is common among Sahrawi people and especially among the Sahrawi diaspora, with the Sahrawi Press Service, official news service of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, being available in Spanish since 2001 and the Sahara Film Festival, Western Sahara&#x27;s only film festival, showing mainly Spanish-language films. Spanish is used to document Sahrawi poetry and oral traditions and has also been used in Sahrawi literature. Despite Spanish having been used by the Sahrawi people for over a century, the Cervantes Institute does not provide support or Spanish-language education to Sahrawis in Western Sahara and the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria. A group of Sahrawi poets known as &#x27;Generación de la Amistad saharaui&#x27; produces Sahrawi literature in Spanish.

===Religions===
Sunni Islam is the major religion in Western Sahara. Sunni Muslims constitute about 99.9% of the population. Prior to 1975 there were over 20,000 Roman Catholics in Western Sahara but there were only around 100.

==Refugees==
The events triggered by the Moroccan and Mauritanian joint invasion of Western Sahara at the end of 1975 are directly linked to the large displacement of the Saharawi population, most of whom live as refugees in south-west Algeria. The major bulk of Saharawis became refugees during the war between the Polisario Front and Morocco. The south-western desert region near Tindouf offered a potential safe region. Algeria, in its rivalry with Morocco, offered the Sahrawis a safe place to settle and actively supported the Polisario.

The next Saharawi exodus, although on a smaller scale, took place in 1979 when Mauritania withdrew from the conflict and Morocco annexed the rest of Western Sahara. Exact figures cannot be provided for the numbers that fled the territory in those two waves, but the estimations are between 1/3 and 2/3 of the total population at that time. The current size of the population in the refugee camps is believed to be around 165,000.

Used by the Algerian government, this figure is the most widely quoted by NGOs and is also used by the UNHCR and the World Food Programme to raise funds for food aid to the refugees. In the 2004 WFP meeting in Rome, the number of refugees was officially recognized at 158,000.

<text>The politics of Western Sahara take place in a framework of an area claimed by both the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco.

Occupied by Spain from 1884 to 1975, as Spanish Sahara, the territory has been listed with the United Nations as a case of incomplete decolonization since the 1960s, making it the last major territory to effectively remain a colony, according to the UN. The conflict is largely between the Kingdom of Morocco and the national liberation movement known as Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro), which in February 1976 formally proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), now basically administered by a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria.

Following to the Madrid Accords, the territory was partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in November 1975, with Morocco acquiring the northern two-thirds. Mauritania, under pressure from the POLISARIO guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979, with Morocco moving to annex that sector shortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control over the majority of the territory. A portion is administered by the SADR. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was seated as a member of the Organisation of African Unity in 1984, and was a founding member of the African Union. Guerrilla activities continued until a United Nations-monitored cease-fire was implemented September 6, 1991 via the mission MINURSO. The mission patrols the separation line between the two territories.

== Baker plan ==

The &quot;Baker Plan&quot; (formally, &quot;Peace Plan for Self-Determination of the People of Western Sahara&quot;) is a United Nations initiative to grant self-determination to Western Sahara. It was intended to replace the Settlement Plan of 1991, which was further detailed in the Houston Agreement of 1997.

The first draft of the plan, called &quot;Baker I&quot; or the &quot;Framework Agreement&quot;, was circulated by the UN special envoy James Baker in 2000, but never presented formally to the Security Council. Although based on Baker&#x27;s proposals, it was drafted by a Morocco-sponsored legal team. It offered the people of Western Sahara autonomy within the Moroccan state. Except for defense and foreign policy, all other decisions would be the responsibility of local government. Morocco accepted the plan, but the Polisario rejected it.

The second version, informally known as &quot;Baker II&quot;, envisioned Saharan self-rule under a Western Sahara Authority for a period of five years, with a referendum on independence to follow. In this referendum, the entire present-day population of Western Sahara would participate, including people who had migrated from or been settled by Morocco post-1975, something which Polisario had so far refused. On the other hand, a provision that the interim local government (the Western Sahara Authority) would be elected only by a restricted voters&#x27; list (those identified as original inhabitants of the territory by MINURSO) alienated Morocco. After Morocco had voiced early objections to Baker II, the Polisario front reluctantly accepted the plan as a basis for negotiations. In July 2003, the UN Security Council endorsed the plan, something that it had not done with Baker&#x27;s first draft, and unanimously called for the parties to implement it. Morocco, however, then rejected the plan, saying that it would no longer agree to any referendum that included independence as an option.

==Suffrage==
The population under Moroccan control participates in countrywide and regional Moroccan elections. A referendum on independence or integration with Morocco was agreed upon by Morocco and the Polisario Front in 1991, but it has yet to take place.

The population under SADR control and in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria, participates in elections to the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.

<text>The majority of the territory of Western Sahara is currently administered by the Kingdom of Morocco. As such, the majority of the economic activity of Western Sahara happens in the framework of the economy of Morocco.

In the Moroccan-administered territory, fishing and phosphate mining are the principal sources of income for the population. The territory lacks sufficient rainfall for sustainable agricultural production; hence, most of the food for the urban population must be imported. Trade and other economic activities are controlled by the Moroccan government.

The Free Zone (POLISARIO-administered territory) is mainly uninhabited. There is practically no economical infrastructure and the main activity is camel herding nomadism. The government-in-exile of the Polisario Front had also signed contracts for oil exploration, but there is no practical work, because the zones given are in the Moroccan-controlled part of the territory.

Key agricultural products from Western Sahara include fruits and vegetables (grown in the few oases), as well as camels, sheep and goats.
Fishing and oil exploration contracts concerning Western Sahara are sources of political tension.

==Disputes over natural resources==
Fishing and oil exploration contracts concerning Western Sahara are sources of political tension. In 2015, a European court invalidated a trade deal between the European Union (EU) and Morocco that involved Western Sahara, prompting a diplomatic backlash from Morocco. In 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that a fishing treaty between the EU and the Moroccan government did not include fishing grounds off the coast of Western Sahara. In April 2010, the Norwegian state-owned salmon company EWOS stopped the purchases of fish oil from Western Sahara and Morocco (with an amount of around 10 million euros annually, and estimated between 12,000 and 20,000 tons of fish oil in total), for &quot;not being in line with the Norwegian authorities&#x27; recommendations&quot;.

In 2002, the petroleum companies TotalEnergies and Kerr-McGee were awarded contracts to explore for oil in the region. In December 2004, French oil company TotalEnergies decided not to renew their license off Western Sahara. In May 2006, Kerr-McGee decided to not renew the contract signed with the Moroccan Authorities. The US-based firm Kosmos Energy began a contract to explore offshore from Western Sahara in 2013, prompting criticism from activist groups such as Western Sahara Resource Watch. Desertec, a Munich-based solar energy company, declined to place a plant in Western Sahara for &quot;reputational reasons.&quot;

<text>Telecommunications in Western Sahara include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

Morocco claims the Western Sahara territory and administers Moroccan law through Moroccan institutions in the estimated 85 percent of the territory it controls. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario), an organization that has sought independence for the former Spanish territory since 1973, disputes Morocco’s claim to sovereignty over the territory. Because of this long running dispute, many traditional telecommunication statistics are not reported separately for the Western Sahara.

==Radio and television==
* Radio stations: 
** Morocco&#x27;s state broadcaster, Société Nationale de Radiodiffusion et de Télévision (SNRT, formerly RTM) operates a radio service from Laayoune (2008);
** Polisario-backed medium wave (AM) and shortwave radio stations are on the air (2008);
** Unofficial amateur radio stations occasionally operate from Polisario territory. This is classified as the DXCC entity &quot;Western Sahara&quot;. Operators use callsigns with the prefix &quot;S0&quot;; an informal identifier that has not been issued by the International Telecommunication Union. 
* Radios: 56,000 (1997).
* Television stations: Morocco&#x27;s state broadcaster, SNRT, operates a TV service that is relayed in the territory (2008). The Polisario-owned territory operates a minor television service known by the name of RASD TV.
* Television sets: 6,000 (1997).

==Telephones==
* Calling code: +212
* International call prefix: 00
* Main lines: about 2,000 lines in use (1999 estimate).
* Mobile cellular: Unknown.
* Telephone system: sparse and limited system; tied into Morocco&#x27;s system by microwave radio relay, tropospheric scatter, and satellite (2008).
* Satellite earth stations: 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) linked to Rabat, Morocco (2008).

==Internet==
* Top-level domain: none, as a disputed territory no country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is assigned, however, .eh is reserved for this purpose, and will be assigned if the competing claimants reach an agreement.
* Internet users: unknown (2012).
* Fixed broadband: unknown (2012).
* Wireless broadband: unknown (2012).
* Internet hosts: no hosts explicitly associated with Western Sahara (2012).
* IPv4: no addresses allocated (2012).
* Internet Service Providers (ISPs): NA

==Internet censorship and surveillance==
There is no indication that Internet access in the territory differs from that in internationally recognized Morocco, which was generally open. Morocco was listed as engaged in selective Internet filtering in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas and as little or no evidence of filtering in the political area by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in August 2009. Freedom House listed Morocco&#x27;s &quot;Internet Freedom Status&quot; as &quot;Partly Free&quot; in its 2013 &quot;Freedom on the Net&quot; report.

Morocco considers the part of the territory that it administers to be an integral component of the kingdom with the same laws and structures regarding civil liberties, political, and economic rights. Moroccan law prohibits citizens from criticizing Islam or the institution of the monarchy or to oppose the government’s official position regarding territorial integrity and Western Sahara. Saharan media outlets and bloggers practice self-censorship on these issues, and there are no reports of government action against them for what they write. Human rights and Sahrawi bloggers affiliated with leftist political groups assume that authorities closely monitor their activities and feel the need to hide their identities.

<text>Transport in Western Sahara is very limited by sea, road and air with camels being the primary means of transportation in the desert area. Road transport by buses remain the major mode of transportation. The longest conveyor belt in the world is long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune. The belt moves about 2,000 metric tons of rock containing phosphate every hour from the mines to El-Aaiun, where it is loaded and shipped.

Portions of Western Sahara were a Spanish Colony until 1975 as the last colonial province in Africa. A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources. A UN brokered ceasefire was implemented from 1991 between Polisario and Moroccan forces.

The world&#x27;s longest cargo train, the Mauritania Railway cargo train, crosses the southeastern corner of Western Sahara for a short distance. Transit through Western Sahara was disrupted during the war between Polisario and Moroccan forces before the ceasefire was implemented in 1991.

==Background==

Portions of Western Sahara were a Spanish Colony till 1975 as the last colonial province in Africa. A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government in exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources. 

Polisario was formed in 1973 to fight for the rights of Saharawi Arab African People. Polisario attacked Moroccan positions many times and have retaliated. Continued war was waged between Polisario and Morocco over prominence in the region backed by Algeria for Polisario and US, France and Saudi Arabia for Morocco. Polisario were successful in cutting the transport of Phosphorus across Western Sahara to the Atlantic Coast. The transport infrastructure of the region, including the border towns of Morocco was affected during the wars.

==Road transport==
Western Sahara has no rail service, with the exception of a section of the Mauritania Railway; which (since the closure of the Choum Tunnel), cuts across the extreme south-eastern corner of the territory. The rail-route is considered the world&#x27;s longest cargo train covering a distance of . Passengers with tickets ride in cramped cars while many illegal passengers, sometimes with livestock, ride on top of freight cars. 

There are only of roads, of which are metalled. A small network of highways provides limited ground travel connections. N1 highway is a major roadway traversing along the Atlantic coastline of the country. There are a few roads in the north and only two roads in the south that branch off of N1. All other roads are local ones in the various cities and towns. Off road driving is considered dangerous since there are &quot;thousands of unexploded mines&quot; in the area. Highway Road plans in the region started by Algeria have been used to increase its own influence in the region. There are only 4 companies licensed to use buses in Western Sahara which are: CTM, Supratours, Satas and Sat; CTM and Supratours buses have daily service from Dakhla to Marrakech via Laayoune and Agadir.

== Rail transport ==

Since the closure of the Choum Tunnel, a section of Mauritania Railway cuts through the Polisario Front-controlled part of the Western Sahara ().
==Ports==
The major port in Western Sahara is Ad Dakhla - small docking facility (Port Marchand Lassarga/Port-Îlot) located in a shelter bay south of the airport, Cabo Bojador - small port with fishing boats store inland and Laayoune (El Aaiun) - major deep water port facility; used by vessels carrying phosphate, large fishing vessels and military patrol boats. The longest conveyor belt in the world is long, from the phosphate mines of Bu Craa to the coast south of Laayoune. 

The belt moves about 2,000 metric tons of rock containing phosphate every hour from the mines to El-Aaiun, where it is loaded and shipped.

==Air transport==

There are six airfields, three with paved runways and three unpaved surfaces, and one helipad (military in Cape Bojador). Hassan I Airport, serving El Aaiún (Laâyoune), is an international airport, but the carriers at the airport connect only to regional destinations (to Morocco or the Canary Islands). Dakhla Airport is located in Dakhla and has commercial operational flights. Smara Airport in Smara and La Güera Airport serving La Güera are other smaller airports in Western Sahara.

<doc id="33229" wikidata="Q17008016" url="?curid=33229" title="Political status of Western Sahara">
<text>Western Sahara, formerly the colony of Spanish Sahara, is a disputed territory claimed by both the Kingdom of Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario Front), which is an independence movement based in Tifariti and Bir Lehlou. The Annexation of Western Sahara by Morocco took place in two stages, in 1976 and 1979, and is considered illegal under international law.

Western Sahara is listed by the United Nations (UN) as a non-decolonized territory and is thus included in the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories, which regards Spain as the &quot;de jure&quot; administering state. Under international law, Western Sahara is not a legal part of Morocco, and it remains under the international laws of military occupation.

== Background ==
Since the Madrid Accords of 1975, a part of Western Sahara has been administered by Morocco as the Southern Provinces. Another section, the Liberated Territories, is administered by the Polisario Front as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Mauritania administers the western half of the Ras Nouadhibou Peninsula. An UN-monitored cease-fire has been in effect since September 1991.

No other country than the United States and Israel has ever recognized Morocco&#x27;s unilateral annexation of Western Sahara; however, certain countries such as the United Kingdom have recognized that Morocco exerts &quot;de facto&quot; control of the region. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) treats the status of Western Sahara as &#x27;undetermined&#x27; but its lack of reference to the partition and the existence of the Polisario-held areas, suggests a tacit acceptance of Morocco as the administering power in the entire territory. Overall, the annexation has not garnered as much attention in the international community as many other disputed annexations (e.g. the Russian annexation of Crimea).

In order to resolve the sovereignty issue, the UN has attempted to hold a referendum through the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), and is holding direct talks between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front. The UN recognizes neither Moroccan nor SADR sovereignty over Western Sahara.

Moroccan settlers currently make up more than two thirds of the 500,000 inhabitants of Western Sahara. Under international law, Morocco&#x27;s transfer of its own civilians into occupied territory is in direct violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (cf. Israeli and Turkish settlers).

==Positions of the main parties==

===Kingdom of Morocco===

The official position of the Kingdom of Morocco since 1963 is that all of Western Sahara is an integral part of the kingdom. The Moroccan government refers to Western Sahara only as &quot;Moroccan Sahara&quot;, the &quot;Saharan provinces&quot;, or the &quot;Southern Provinces&quot;.

According to the Moroccan government, in 1958 the Moroccan Army of Liberation fought Spanish colonizers and almost liberated what was then Spanish Sahara. The fathers of many of the Polisario leaders were among the veterans of the Moroccan Southern Army, for example the father of Polisario leader Mohammed Abdelaziz. Morocco is supported in this view by a number of former Polisario founders and leaders. The Polisario Front is considered by Morocco to be a Moroccan separatist movement, referring to the Moroccan origins of most of its founding members.

On 22 January 2020, Morocco&#x27;s House of Representatives voted unanimously to add Western Sahara waters to the Moroccan maritime borders.

===Polisario Front and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic===
The Polisario Front, mainly backed by Algeria, is described by itself and its supporters as a national liberation movement that opposes Moroccan control of Western Sahara, whilst it is considered by Morocco and supporters of Morocco&#x27;s claims over Western Sahara to be a separatist organization. It began as a movement of students who felt torn between the divergent Spanish and Moroccan influences on the country. The original goal of the Polisario, which was to end Spanish colonialism in the region, was achieved, but their neighbors, Morocco and Mauritania, seized sovereignty of the region, which the Polisario felt was entitled to self-determination and eventually independence. The Polisario engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Moroccan and Mauritanian forces. It evacuated the Sahrawi population to the Tindouf refugee camps due to Royal Moroccan Air Force bombing of the refugee camps on Sahrawi land with napalm and white phosphorus. The Polisario Front has called for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara to be decided through a referendum. Although the SADR is not recognized as a state by the UN, the Polisario is considered a direct participant in the conflict and as the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people, recognized by the United Nations since 1979.
The Polisario Front argues that Morocco&#x27;s position is due to economic interests (fishing, phosphate mining, and the potential for oil reserves) and political reasons (stability of the king&#x27;s position and the governing elite in Morocco, deployment of most of the Moroccan Army in Western Sahara instead of in Morocco). The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Bir Lehlou (Western Sahara), on 27 February 1976.

===Mauritania===
Claims on Western Sahara had proliferated since the 1960s, fueled by Mauritanian President Moktar Ould Daddah. Before Mauritania signed the Madrid Accords and after the withdrawal of the last Spanish forces, in late 1975, the Mauritanian Army invaded the southern part of Western Sahara, while the Moroccan Army did the same in the north.

In April 1976, Mauritania and Morocco partitioned the country into three parts, Mauritania getting the southern one, which was named Tiris al-Gharbiyya. Mauritania waged four years of war against Polisario guerrillas, conducting raids on Nouakchott, attacks on the Zouerate mine train and a coup d&#x27;état that deposed Ould Daddah. Mauritania finally withdrew in the summer of 1979, after signing the Algiers Agreement with the Polisario Front, recognizing the right of self-determination for the Sahrawi people, and renouncing any claims on Western Sahara. The Moroccan Army immediately took control of the former Mauritanian territory.

Mauritania recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic on 27 February 1984.

===Algeria===
Algeria has supported the independence of the whole of Western Sahara since 1975, when Spanish forces and settlers withdrew from the area. It is one of the few countries to do so in the Arab League. It has provided aid to the &#x27;Polisario Front&#x27;. Algeria&#x27;s role became indirect, through political and military support for the Polisario Front. Algeria recognized the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic on 6 March 1976. Its involvement in Western Sahara independence movement has interrupted the development of Algerian-Morocco diplomatic relations, which were restored in 1988.

===United Nations===

Western Sahara is on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories. The UN has been involved since 1988 in trying to find a solution to the conflict through self-determination. In 1988, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed to settle the dispute through a referendum under the auspices of the UN that would allow the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence or integration with Morocco. In 1991, the parties agreed upon the &quot;Settlement Plan&quot;, contingent on the referendum being held the following year, but due to disputes over voter qualification, the vote was not held. In the following years, the UN argued for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front to resolve the deadlock, culminating in the Manhasset negotiations in 2007–2008.

As of 2020, the mandate for MINURSO has been extended 47 times and it maintains its presence in the country, but has yet to fulfill its mission by organizing a referendum.

==Positions of other states==

Some states are supportive of the &quot;right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people&quot;, including the option of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Some states have changed their opinion frequently or have given separate announcements of support for both Morocco and the Polisario Front/SADR (Egypt, Italy, Lesotho, Russia, Rwanda, Yemen, etc.).

Some of the states announcing support of the &quot;right of self-determination&quot; currently recognize the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Not all of the states that have terminated diplomatic relations with or withdrawn recognition of the SADR have announced their support for the Moroccan claims.

The overwhelming majority of United Nations member states have not announced any position.

===Position of United Nations Security Council permanent members===
;France
France claims neutrality on the Western Sahara issue, despite its military involvement in the Western Sahara War on the side of Morocco and Mauritania (see Operation Lamantin). In 2009 and 2010, France used the threat of its veto power to block the establishment of Human Rights monitoring by the MINURSO in Western Sahara. France has been a major backer of the Moroccan autonomy proposal and in the EU negotiated the concession of the advanced status to Morocco.

On 30 July 2024, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Throne Day (Morocco), French President Emmanuel Macron sent a letter to King Mohammed VI of Morocco clarifying France&#x27;s new position on the Western Sahara. He stated that he &quot;considers that the present and future of Western Sahara lie within the framework of Moroccan sovereignty&quot; and affirmed France&#x27;s support for Morocco&#x27;s autonomy plan proposed in 2007 by saying &quot;our support for the autonomy plan proposed by Morocco in 2007 is clear and unwavering,&quot; adding that this plan &quot;constitutes now the only basis to achieve a just, lasting, and negotiated political solution, in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions.&quot; Macron emphasized France&#x27;s support for Morocco&#x27;s efforts to promote economic and social development in the region. This marked a notable change of diplomatic stance; The French authorities previously argued that Morocco’s plan for autonomy was a “serious and credible” basis for discussion, but not the only one.

From 28 to 30 October 2024, Macron conducted his three-day state visit to Morocco&#x27;s capital accompanied by a delegation of French ministers and business leaders. Notable cabinet members present included French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, Economy Minister Antoine Armand and Culture Minister Rachida Dati – herself of Moroccan origin. On the first day, the King and Macron jointly chaired the signing ceremony of 22 key deals between the nations, addressing: railway, aviation, education, and sustainable energy/infrastructure.

On 29 October 2024, in an address to the Moroccan Parliament, Macron said French companies &quot;will support the development&quot; of the Sahara, pledging &quot;investments and sustainable support initiatives to benefit local populations.&quot; This includes French-sponsored projects and initiatives in Dakhla, Western Sahara and the Guelmim-Oued Noun region—more broadly—amounting to 10 billion euros ($10.8 billion). As part of the objective &quot;to accelerate&quot; partnerships between France and Morocco, MGH Energy, a French company focused on decarbonizing transportation by air and sea, also plans to partner with a Moroccan gas retailer to produce fuel near Dakhla. In an effort to begin its first phase of operations by 2030, the company said it planned to invest 4.8 billion euros ($5.2 billion). 2030 also aligns with when Morocco hopes its Atlantic Ocean port under construction in Dakhla will open, stimulating an unprecedented flow of exports from Morocco and its neighbors in West Africa.

;United States


The Obama administration disassociated itself from the Moroccan autonomy plan in 2009, however, reversing the Bush-backed support of the Moroccan plan, and returning to a pre-Bush position, wherein the option of an independent Western Sahara is on the table again.

In April 2009, 229 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, a clear majority and more than 50 more than the number who signed the letter in 2007, called on President Obama to support Morocco&#x27;s autonomy plan and to assist in drawing the conflict to a close. The signers included Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner. In addition to acknowledging that Western Sahara has become a recruiting post for radical Islamists, the letter affirmed that the conflict is &quot;the single greatest obstacle impending the security and cooperation necessary to combat&quot; terrorism in the Maghreb. The letter referenced UN Security Council Resolution 1813 (2008), and encouraged President Obama to follow the policy set by President Clinton and followed by President Bush. The congressmen expressed concerns about Western Sahara&#x27;s viability. They referenced a UN fact-finding mission to Western Sahara which confirmed the State Department&#x27;s view that the Polisario proposal, which ultimately stands for independence, would lead to a non-viable state. In closing, the letter stated, &quot;We remain convinced that the U.S. position, favoring autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution. We urge you to both sustain this longstanding policy, and to make clear, in both words and actions, that the United States will work to ensure that the UN process continues to support this framework as the only realistic compromise that can bring this unfortunate and longstanding conflict to an end.&quot;

Commenting on a 2004 free trade agreement with Morocco, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick stated in a letter to Congressman Joe Pitts in response to his questioning, &quot;the United States and many other countries do not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and have consistently urged the parties to work with the United Nations to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. The Free Trade Agreement will not include Western Sahara.&quot;

In April 2013, the United States proposed that MINURSO monitored human rights (as all the other UN mission since 1991) in Western Sahara, a move that Morocco strongly opposed, cancelling the annual African Lion military exercises with U.S. Army troops. Also in mid-April, United States Ambassador to Morocco Samuel L. Kaplan declared during a conference in Casablanca that the Moroccan autonomy plan &quot;can&#x27;t be the only basis in these negotiations&quot;, referring to the UN sponsored talks between the Polisario Front and Morocco.

On 10 December 2020, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would officially recognize Morocco&#x27;s claims over Western Sahara, as a result of Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. In April 2021, the Biden administration stated that they would not reverse the decision. In November 2021, Antony Blinken said that the Biden administration &quot;[continues] to view Morocco’s autonomy plan as serious, credible, and realistic, and one potential approach to satisfy the aspirations of the people of Western Sahara&quot;.

==Positions of international organizations==
The SADR is also a member of the Asian-African Strategic Partnership, formed at the 2005 Asian-African Conference, over Moroccan objections to SADR participation.

In 2006, the SADR participated in a conference of the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of the Latin American and the Caribbean.

;African Union
On 22 February 1982, the SADR secured membership in the Organisation of African Unity.

In 1984, Morocco withdrew from the AU&#x27;s predecessor, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), in protest of the group&#x27;s recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).

The African Union (formerly the OAU) has given the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic full recognition, and accepted it as a member state (which has led Morocco to leave the union.). Mohamed Abdelaziz, president of the SADR, has been Vice-president of the OUA in 1985, and of the AU in 2002.

In 2016, King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared his country&#x27;s intention to become a member of the African Union. On the same day, twenty-eight African countries or about 52% of the 54 UN recognized member states of the African Union signed a petition to expel the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic from the African Union. At the same time, AU Commission Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma reaffirmed the AU&#x27;s support for Western Sahara&#x27;s independence.

;European Union
The European Union supports the right of self-determination of the Sahrawi people (the MINURSO UN-sponsored referendum), but does not recognize the Polisario Front. Over practical issues such as fishing in the EEZ the EU deals with Morocco as the country currently exercising &quot;jurisdiction, but not sovereignty&quot; over Western Sahara territory. In addition, members of the EFTA trade bloc have made statements excluding Western Sahara from the Moroccan-EFTA free trade agreement. In December 2016, the European Court of Justice reaffirmed in &quot;Council v Front populaire pour la libération de la saguia-el-hamra et du rio de oro (Front Polisario)&quot; that Morocco has no basis for sovereignty over Western Sahara and that trade deals with Morocco cannot apply to the occupied territory.

;United Nations
Since 1966, the United Nations request for the celebration of a referendum for enabling the &quot;indigenous population&quot; to exercise freely their right to self-determination. Since 1979, the United Nations has recognized the Polisario Front as the representative of the people of Western Sahara, and considered Morocco as an occupying force.

Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan stressed, in his last report on Western Sahara, to the Security Council:

:&quot;The Security Council would not be able to invite parties to negotiate about Western Saharan autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, for such wording would imply recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, which was out of the question as long as no States Member of the United Nations had recognized that sovereignty&quot;.

<doc id="33230" wikidata="Q65321" url="?curid=33230" title="Wolfgang Petersen">
<text>Wolfgang Petersen (14 March 1941 – 12 August 2022) was a German film director, screenwriter, and producer. He was nominated for two Academy Awards for the World War II submarine warfare film (1981). His other films include &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (1984), &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; (1985), &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; (1993), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (1997), &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000), &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), and &quot;Poseidon&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Petersen was born on 14 March 1941 in Emden, the son of a naval officer. From 1953 to 1960, Petersen attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg.

He made his first films with an 8 mm camera while still at school. In the 1960s he was directing plays at Hamburg&#x27;s Ernst Deutsch Theater. After studying theater in Berlin and Hamburg, Petersen attended the Film and Television Academy in Berlin (1966–1970).

==Career==
Petersen&#x27;s first productions were for German television, and it was during his work on the popular German &quot;Tatort&quot; (&quot;Crime Scene&quot;) TV series that he first met and worked with the actor Jürgen Prochnow — who would later appear as the U-boat captain in Petersen&#x27;s famous . The most famous of his &quot;Tatort&quot; episodes is &quot;Reifezeugnis&quot; (Maturity Certificate) from 1977 with the young Nastassja Kinski. He shot 6 &quot;Tatort&quot; episodes.

Petersen made his first theatrical feature film in 1974, the psychological thriller &quot;One or the Other of Us&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Einer von uns beiden&quot; by Horst Bosetzky and published anonymously under his pseudonym and starring Jürgen Prochnow. He next directed the 1977 film &quot;Die Konsequenz&quot;, a black/white adaptation of Alexander Ziegler&#x27;s autobiographical novel of homosexual love. In its time, the film was considered so radical that when first broadcast in Germany, the Bavarian network Bayerischer Rundfunk turned off the transmitters rather than broadcast it.

His next feature was the World War II epic , released in early 1982. The film chronicles the experiences of a German submarine crew engaged in the &quot;Battle of the Atlantic&quot;. Though not an immediate financial success, the film received highly positive reviews and was nominated for six Academy Awards, two of which (for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay) went to Petersen; he was also nominated for a BAFTA Award and DGA Award. The film starred Jürgen Prochnow as the U-boat Captain, who became a good example of Petersen&#x27;s action characters, a man at war who confronts danger and fate at sea.
After &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (1984), Petersen&#x27;s first English-language film, he directed &quot;Enemy Mine&quot; (1985), which was not a critical or box office success. He hit his stride in 1993 with the assassination thriller &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;. Starring Clint Eastwood as an angst-ridden presidential Secret Service guard, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; gave Petersen the box office clout he needed to direct another suspense thriller, &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), starring Dustin Hoffman. The 1997 Petersen blockbuster &quot;Air Force One&quot; did very well at the box office, with generally positive critical reviews from movie critics. For both &quot;Air Force One&quot; and &quot;Outbreak&quot;, Petersen teamed up with the German cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who has also worked frequently with director Martin Scorsese.

By 1998, Petersen was an established Hollywood director, with the power to both re-release his classic in a new director&#x27;s cut and to helm star-studded action-thrillers. As such, he was originally considered to direct the first movie in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Petersen pulled out of the running in March 2000.

In the 2000s, Petersen continued to direct two summer blockbusters, the films &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000) and &quot;Troy&quot; (2004). The success of the former helped his Radiant Productions company to sign a deal with Warner Bros.
Petersen&#x27;s $160 million epic film &quot;Poseidon&quot;, a re-telling of the 1969 Paul Gallico novel &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (previously adapted for the 1972 disaster film), was released by Warner Bros. in May 2006. The film performed poorly in the U.S., barely exceeding $60 million in domestic box office receipts by early August, but international sales surpassed $121 million.

Although hired to direct the film adaptation of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; by Orson Scott Card that was scheduled for release in 2008, he later &quot;moved on&quot; from the project. His potential projects included a live-action adaptation of the 2006 anime film &quot;Paprika&quot; and a film adaptation of the science fiction novel &quot;Old Man&#x27;s War&quot;.

After a ten-year hiatus, Petersen returned in 2016 as director of the heist comedy &quot;Vier gegen die Bank&quot;, his first German-language film since in 1981.

==Personal life==
Petersen&#x27;s first marriage was with actress ; they had a son. In 1978, he married his assistant Maria Borgel. Petersen moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and subsequently acquired American citizenship.

==Death==
Petersen died of pancreatic cancer on 12 August 2022, at the age of 81, at his home in Brentwood, Los Angeles.

<doc id="33234" wikidata="Q822050" url="?curid=33234" title="White matter">
<text>White matter refers to areas of the central nervous system that are mainly made up of myelinated axons, also called tracts. Long thought to be passive tissue, white matter affects learning and brain functions, modulating the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions.

White matter is named for its relatively light appearance resulting from the lipid content of myelin. Its white color in prepared specimens is due to its usual preservation in formaldehyde. It appears pinkish-white to the naked eye otherwise, because myelin is composed largely of lipid tissue veined with capillaries. 

==Structure==

===White matter===
White matter is composed of bundles, which connect various grey matter areas (the locations of nerve cell bodies) of the brain to each other, and carry nerve impulses between neurons. Myelin acts as an insulator, which allows electrical signals to jump, rather than coursing through the axon, increasing the speed of transmission of all nerve signals.

The total number of long range fibers within a cerebral hemisphere is 2% of the total number of cortico-cortical fibers (across cortical areas) and is roughly the same number as those that communicate between the two hemispheres in the brain&#x27;s largest white tissue structure, the corpus callosum. Schüz and Braitenberg note &quot;As a rough rule, the number of fibres of a certain range of lengths is inversely proportional to their length.&quot;

The proportion of blood vessels in the white matter in nonelderly adults is 1.7–3.6%.

===Grey matter===
The other main component of the brain is grey matter (actually pinkish tan due to blood capillaries), which is composed of neurons. The substantia nigra is a third colored component found in the brain that appears darker due to higher levels of melanin in dopaminergic neurons than its nearby areas. White matter can sometimes appear darker than grey matter on a microscope slide because of the type of stain used. Cerebral and spinal white matter do not contain dendrites, neural cell bodies, or shorter axons, which can only be found in grey matter.

===Location===
White matter forms the bulk of the deep parts of the brain and the superficial parts of the spinal cord. Aggregates of grey matter such as the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, nucleus accumbens) and brainstem nuclei (red nucleus, cranial nerve nuclei) are spread within the cerebral white matter.

The cerebellum is structured in a similar manner as the cerebrum, with a superficial mantle of cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar white matter (called the &quot;arbor vitae&quot;) and aggregates of grey matter surrounded by deep cerebellar white matter (dentate nucleus, globose nucleus, emboliform nucleus, and fastigial nucleus). The fluid-filled cerebral ventricles (lateral ventricles, third ventricle, cerebral aqueduct, fourth ventricle) are also located deep within the cerebral white matter.

===Myelinated axon length===

One small study found that men have more white matter than women both in volume and in length of myelinated axons, and that volume and length reduced with age. (This study only included 36 participants.) At the age of 20, the total length of myelinated fibers in men is 176,000 km while that of a woman is 149,000 km. There is a decline in total length with age of about 10% each decade such that a man at 80 years of age has 97,200 km and a woman 82,000 km. Most of this reduction is due to the loss of thinner fibers. However, this reduction may correlate with men having larger brains than women
and with brain size reducing with age.

==Function==
White matter is the tissue through which messages pass between different areas of grey matter within the central nervous system. The white matter is white because of the fatty substance (myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibers (axons). This myelin is found in almost all long nerve fibers, and acts as an electrical insulation. This is important because it allows the messages to pass quickly from place to place.

Unlike grey matter, which peaks in development in a person&#x27;s twenties, the white matter continues to develop, and peaks in middle age.

==Research==
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common of the inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system which affect white matter. In MS lesions, the myelin sheath around the axons is deteriorated by inflammation. Alcohol use disorders are associated with a decrease in white matter volume.

Amyloid plaques in white matter may be associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Other changes that commonly occur with age include the development of leukoaraiosis, which is a rarefaction of the white matter that can be correlated with a variety of conditions, including loss of myelin pallor, axonal loss, and diminished restrictive function of the blood–brain barrier.

There is also evidence that substance abuse may damage white matter microstructure, though prolonged abstinence may in certain cases reverse such white matter changes.

White matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are linked to several adverse outcomes, such as cognitive impairment and depression. White matter hyperintensities are often found in patients with vascular dementia, particularly with small vessel/subcortical subtypes of vascular dementia.

===Volume===

Smaller volumes (in terms of group averages) of white matter might be associated with larger deficits in attention, declarative memory, executive functions, intelligence, and academic achievement. However, volume change is continuous throughout one&#x27;s lifetime due to neuroplasticity, and is a contributing factor rather than determinant factor of certain functional deficits due to compensating effects in other brain regions. The integrity of white matter declines due to aging. Nonetheless, regular aerobic exercise appears to either postpone the aging effect or in turn enhance the white matter integrity in the long run. Changes in white matter volume due to inflammation or injury may be a factor in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

==Imaging==

The study of white matter has been advanced with the neuroimaging technique called diffusion tensor imaging where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scanners are used. As of 2007, more than 700 publications have been published on the subject.

A 2009 paper by Jan Scholz and colleagues used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to demonstrate changes in white matter volume as a result of learning a new motor task (e.g. juggling). The study is important as the first paper to correlate motor learning with white matter changes. Previously, many researchers had considered this type of learning to be exclusively mediated by dendrites, which are not present in white matter. The authors suggest that electrical activity in axons may regulate myelination in axons. Or, gross changes in the diameter or packing density of the axon might cause the change. A more recent DTI study by Sampaio-Baptista and colleagues reported changes in white matter with motor learning along with increases in myelination.

<text>A word processor is an electronic device (later a computer software application) for text, composing, editing, formatting, and printing.

The word processor was a stand-alone office machine developed in the 1960s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions of an electric typewriter with a recording unit, either tape or floppy disk (as used by the Wang machine) with a simple dedicated computer processor for the editing of text. Although features and designs varied among manufacturers and models, and new features were added as technology advanced, the first word processors typically featured a monochrome display and the ability to save documents on memory cards or diskettes. Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking programs, and improved formatting options.

As the more versatile combination of personal computers and printers became commonplace, and computer software applications for word processing became popular, most business machine companies stopped manufacturing dedicated word processor machines. In 2009 there were only two U.S. companies, Classic and AlphaSmart, which still made them. Many older machines, however, remain in use. Since 2009, Sentinel has offered a machine described as a &quot;word processor&quot;, but it is more accurately a highly specialised microcomputer used for accounting and publishing. In 2014, U.S. company Astrohaus launched the Freewrite series of electronic word processors.

Word processing was one of the earliest applications for the personal computer in office productivity, and was the most widely used application on personal computers until the World Wide Web rose to prominence in the mid-1990s.

Although the early word processors evolved to use tag-based markup for document formatting, most modern word processors take advantage of a graphical user interface providing some form of what-you-see-is-what-you-get (&quot;WYSIWYG&quot;) editing. Most are powerful systems consisting of one or more programs that can produce a combination of images, graphics and text, the latter handled with type-setting capability. Typical features of a modern word processor include multiple font sets, spell checking, grammar checking, a built-in thesaurus, automatic text correction, web integration, HTML conversion, pre-formatted publication projects such as newsletters and to-do lists, and much more.

Microsoft Word is the most widely used word processing software according to a user tracking system built into the software. Microsoft estimates that roughly half a billion people use the Microsoft Office suite, which includes Word. Many other word processing applications exist, including WordPerfect (which dominated the market from the mid-1980s to early-1990s on computers running Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS operating system, and still (2014) is favored for legal applications), Apple&#x27;s Pages application, and open source applications such as OpenOffice.org Writer, LibreOffice Writer, AbiWord, KWord, and LyX. Web-based word processors such as Office Online or Google Docs are a relatively new category.

==Characteristics==
Word processors evolved dramatically once they became software programs rather than dedicated machines. They can usefully be distinguished from text editors, the category of software they evolved from.

A text editor is a program that is used for typing, copying, pasting, and printing text (a single character, or strings of characters). Text editors do not format lines or pages. (There are extensions of text editors which can perform formatting of lines and pages: batch document processing systems, starting with TJ-2 and RUNOFF and still available in such systems as LaTeX and Ghostscript, as well as programs that implement the paged-media extensions to HTML and CSS). Text editors are now used mainly by programmers, website designers, computer system administrators, and, in the case of LaTeX, by mathematicians and scientists (for complex formulas and for citations in rare languages). They are also useful when fast startup times, small file sizes, editing speed, and simplicity of operation are valued, and when formatting is unimportant. Due to their use in managing complex software projects, text editors can sometimes provide better facilities for managing large writing projects than a word processor.

Word processing added to the text editor the ability to control type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and mail merge were some of the most popular add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of hyphenation, and the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes.

More advanced features found in recent word processors include:
* Collaborative editing, allowing multiple users to work on the same document.
* Indexing assistance. (True indexing, as performed by a professional human indexer, is far beyond current technology, for the same reasons that fully automated, literary-quality machine translation is.)
* Creation of tables of contents.
* Management, editing, and positioning of visual material (illustrations, diagrams), and sometimes sound files.
* Automatically managed (updated) cross-references to pages or notes.
* Version control of a document, permitting reconstruction of its evolution.
* Non-printing comments and annotations.
* Generation of document statistics (characters, words, readability level, time spent editing by each user).
* &quot;Styles&quot;, which automate consistent formatting of text body, titles, subtitles, highlighted text, and so on.

Later desktop publishing programs were specifically designed with elaborate pre-formatted layouts for publication, offering only limited options for changing the layout, while allowing users to import text that was written using a text editor or word processor, or type the text in themselves.

==History==
Word processors are descended from the Friden Flexowriter, which had two punched tape stations and permitted switching from one to the other (thus enabling what was called the &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;form letter&quot;, one tape containing names and addresses, and the other the body of the letter to be sent). It did not wrap words, which was begun by IBM&#x27;s Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (later, Magnetic Card Selectric Typewriter).

===IBM Selectric===

Expensive Typewriter, written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a text editing program that ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first-word processing program, but the term &quot;word processing&quot; itself was only introduced, by IBM&#x27;s Böblingen Laboratory in the late 1960s.

In 1969, two software based text editing products (Astrotype and Astrocomp) were developed and marketed by Information Control Systems (Ann Arbor Michigan). Both products used the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 mini computer, DECtape (4” reel) randomly accessible tape drives, and a modified version of the IBM Selectric typewriter (the IBM 2741 Terminal). These 1969 products preceded CRT display-based word processors. Text editing was done using a line numbering system viewed on a paper copy inserted in the Selectric typewriter.

Evelyn Berezin invented a Selectric-based word processor in 1969, and founded the Redactron Corporation to market the $8,000 machine. Redactron was sold to Burroughs Corporation in 1976, where the Redactron-II and -III were sold both as standalone units and as peripherals to the company&#x27;s mainframe computers.

By 1971 word processing was recognized by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as a &quot;buzz word&quot;. A 1974 &quot;Times&quot; article referred to &quot;the brave new world of Word Processing or W/P. That&#x27;s International Business Machines talk ... I.B.M. introduced W/P about five years ago for its Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter and other electronic razzle-dazzle.&quot;

IBM defined the term in a broad and vague way as &quot;the combination of people, procedures, and equipment which transforms ideas into printed communications,&quot; and originally used it to include dictating machines and ordinary, manually operated Selectric typewriters. By the early seventies, however, the term was generally understood to mean semiautomated typewriters affording at least some form of editing and correction, and the ability to produce perfect &quot;originals&quot;. Thus, the &quot;Times&quot; headlined a 1974 Xerox product as a &quot;speedier electronic typewriter&quot;, but went on to describe the product, which had no screen, as &quot;a word processor rather than strictly a typewriter, in that it stores copy on magnetic tape or magnetic cards for retyping, corrections, and subsequent printout&quot;.

===Mainframe systems===
In the late 1960s IBM provided a program called FORMAT for generating printed documents on any computer capable of running Fortran IV. Written by Gerald M. Berns, FORMAT was described in his paper &quot;Description of FORMAT, a Text-Processing Program&quot; (Communications of the ACM, Volume 12, Number 3, March, 1969) as &quot;a production program which facilitates the editing and printing of &#x27;finished&#x27; documents directly on the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer system. It features good performance, totally free-form input, very flexible formatting capabilities including up to eight columns per page, automatic capitalization, aids for index construction, and a minimum of nontext [control elements] items.&quot; Input was normally on punched cards or magnetic tape, with up to 80capital letters and non-alphabetic characters per card. The limited typographical controls available were implemented by control sequences; for example, letters were automatically converted to lower case unless they followed a full stop, that is, the &quot;period&quot; character. Output could be printed on a typical line printer in all-capitals — or in upper and lower case using a special (&quot;TN&quot;) printer chain — or could be punched as a paper tape which could be printed, in better than line printer quality, on a Flexowriter. A workalike program with some improvements, DORMAT, was developed and used at University College London.

Electromechanical paper-tape-based equipment such as the Friden Flexowriter had long been available; the Flexowriter allowed for operations such as repetitive typing of form letters (with a pause for the operator to manually type in the variable information), and when equipped with an auxiliary reader, could perform an early version of &quot;mail merge&quot;. Circa 1970 it began to be feasible to apply electronic computers to office automation tasks. IBM&#x27;s Mag Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) and later Mag Card Selectric (MCST) were early devices of this kind, which allowed editing, simple revision, and repetitive typing, with a one-line display for editing single lines. The first novel to be written on a word processor, the IBM MT/ST, was Len Deighton&#x27;s &quot;Bomber&quot;, published in 1970.

===Effect on office administration===
&quot;The New York Times&quot;, reporting on a 1971 business equipment trade show, said
:The &quot;buzz word&quot; for this year&#x27;s show was &quot;word processing&quot;, or the use of electronic equipment, such as typewriters; procedures and trained personnel to maximize office efficiency. At the IBM exhibition a girl typed on an electronic typewriter. The copy was received on a magnetic tape cassette which accepted corrections, deletions, and additions and then produced a perfect letter for the boss&#x27;s signature ...
In 1971, a third of all working women in the United States were secretaries, and they could see that word processing would affect their careers. Some manufacturers, according to a &quot;Times&quot; article, urged that &quot;the concept of &#x27;word processing&#x27; could be the answer to Women&#x27;s Lib advocates&#x27; prayers. Word processing will replace the &#x27;traditional&#x27; secretary and give women new administrative roles in business and industry.&quot;

The 1970s word processing concept did not refer merely to equipment, but, explicitly, to the use of equipment for &quot;breaking down secretarial labor into distinct components, with some staff members handling typing exclusively while others supply administrative support. A typical operation would leave most executives without private secretaries. Instead one secretary would perform various administrative tasks for three or more secretaries.&quot; A 1971 article said that &quot;Some [secretaries] see W/P as a career ladder into management; others see it as a dead-end into the automated ghetto; others predict it will lead straight to the picket line.&quot; The National Secretaries Association, which defined secretaries as people who &quot;can assume responsibility without direct supervision&quot;, feared that W/P would transform secretaries into &quot;space-age typing pools&quot;. The article considered only the organizational changes resulting from secretaries operating word processors rather than typewriters; the possibility that word processors might result in managers creating documents without the intervention of secretaries was not considered—not surprising in an era when few managers, but most secretaries, possessed keyboarding skills.

===Dedicated models===
In 1972, Stephen Bernard Dorsey, Founder and President of Canadian company Automatic Electronic Systems (AES), introduced the world&#x27;s first programmable word processor with a video screen. The real breakthrough by Dorsey&#x27;s AES team was that their machine stored the operator&#x27;s texts on magnetic disks. Texts could be retrieved from the disks simply by entering their names at the keyboard. More importantly, a text could be edited, for instance a paragraph moved to a new place, or a spelling error corrected, and these changes were recorded on the magnetic disk.

The AES machine was actually a sophisticated computer that could be reprogrammed by changing the instructions contained within a few chips.

In 1975, Dorsey started Micom Data Systems and introduced the Micom 2000 word processor. The Micom 2000 improved on the AES design by using the Intel 8080 single-chip microprocessor, which made the word processor smaller, less costly to build and supported multiple languages.

Around this time, DeltaData and Wang word processors also appeared, again with a video screen and a magnetic storage disk.

The competitive edge for Dorsey&#x27;s Micom 2000 was that, unlike many other machines, it was truly programmable. The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a hard-wired system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable. The Micom 2000 was said to be a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented some pretty serious competition such as IBM, Xerox and Wang Laboratories.

In 1978, Micom partnered with Dutch multinational Philips and Dorsey grew Micom&#x27;s sales position to number three among major word processor manufacturers, behind only IBM and Wang.

===Software models===

The Wang was not the first CRT-based machine nor were all of its innovations unique to Wang. In the early 1970s Linolex, Lexitron and Vydec introduced pioneering word-processing systems with CRT display editing. A Canadian electronics company, Automatic Electronic Systems, had introduced a product in 1972, but went into receivership a year later. In 1976, refinanced by the Canada Development Corporation, it returned to operation as AES Data, and went on to successfully market its brand of word processors worldwide until its demise in the mid-1980s. Its first office product, the AES-90, combined for the first time a CRT-screen, a floppy-disk and a microprocessor, that is, the very same winning combination that would be used by IBM for its PC seven years later. The AES-90 software was able to handle French and English typing from the start, displaying and printing the texts side-by-side, a Canadian government requirement. The first eight units were delivered to the office of the then Prime Minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, in February 1974.
Despite these predecessors, Wang&#x27;s product was a standout, and by 1978 it had sold more of these systems than any other vendor.

The phrase &quot;word processor&quot; rapidly came to refer to CRT-based machines similar to the AES 90. Numerous machines of this kind emerged, typically marketed by traditional office-equipment companies such as IBM, Lanier (marketing AES Data machines, re-badged), CPT, and NBI.
All were specialized, dedicated, proprietary systems, priced around $10,000. Cheap general-purpose computers were still for hobbyists.

Some of the earliest CRT-based machines used cassette tapes for removable-memory storage until floppy diskettes became available for this purpose - first the 8-inch floppy, then the 5¼-inch (drives by Shugart Associates and diskettes by Dysan).

Printing of documents was initially accomplished using IBM Selectric typewriters modified for ASCII-character input. These were later replaced by application-specific daisy wheel printers, first developed by Diablo, which became a Xerox company, and later by Qume. For quicker &quot;draft&quot; printing, dot-matrix line printers were optional alternatives with some word processors.

===WYSIWYG models===

Electric Pencil, released in December 1976, was the first word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based word processors running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated word processors, and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys and many of the alphabet keys.

Other early word-processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled &quot;copy&quot; or &quot;bold&quot;. (Many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered &quot;diamond&quot; for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, and the value added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (dBase) markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , and dozens of other word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; &quot;PC Magazine&quot; reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue. Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited WYSIWYG—What You See Is What You Get, to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.

The mid-to-late 1980s saw the spread of laser printers, a &quot;typographic&quot; approach to word processing, and of true WYSIWYG bitmap displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word processing program), PostScript, and graphical user interfaces (another Xerox PARC innovation, with the Gypsy word processor which was commercialised in the Xerox Star product range). Standalone word processors adapted by getting smaller and replacing their CRTs with small character-oriented LCD displays. Some models also had computer-like features such as floppy disk drives and the ability to output to an external printer. They also got a name change, now being called &quot;electronic typewriters&quot; and typically occupying a lower end of the market, selling for under US$200.

During the late 1980s and into the 1990s the predominant word processing program was WordPerfect. It had more than 50% of the worldwide market as late as 1995, but by 2000 Microsoft Word had up to 95% market share.

MacWrite, Microsoft Word, and other word processing programs for the bit-mapped Apple Macintosh screen, introduced in 1984, were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people until the introduction of Microsoft Windows. Dedicated word processors eventually became museum pieces.

<doc id="33254" wikidata="Q1037598" url="?curid=33254" title="WorldForge">
<text>The WorldForge project is producing an open source framework for massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The intent lies in creating a widely used development framework and set of libraries by motivating interested developers to improve on the original source code.

==History==
The WorldForge Project began in October 1998, under the original name of &quot;Altima.&quot; It was originally envisioned to be an &quot;Alternative to &quot;Ultima Online&quot;&quot; and was mentioned in an article on the Slashdot news website, which became a major source of interested developers.

The original founder has since left the project along with most pre-Slashdot developers.
Despite this, the community has become populous and able to sustain itself. A new governing system and selected coordinators has been established, fixing a new direction and a new goal.
This community has decided to work on something much more significant than a &quot;mere Ultima clone,&quot;
and voted itself the new name &quot;WorldForge&quot;. Avinash Gupta was the first leader of the project, followed by Bryce Harrington, but more recently developers have chosen not to select a leader,
and instead rely on consensus among a small group of determined core developers to decide the
overall direction of the project.

The WorldForge community has adopted the view that &quot;massive&quot; is unnecessary in a non-commercial
game and has focused instead on &quot;community&quot; environments; estimating on the order of a few hundred
players per game world, rather than thousands. Because most WorldForge servers are run by volunteers without strong bandwidth and hardware capacities this direction also has practical reasons.

==Games==
Several independent game projects have joined WorldForge, resulting in a lot of parallel development. The pig farming simulation &quot;Acorn&quot; is the only complete, if modest, game
so far that has been released. Its significance lies in providing a proof of concept that the project can actually integrate and deliver software, artwork and media, as well as maintain a community capable of creativity and innovation. Development of Acorn ended in 2001 as the project has moved on to more ambitious new games.

The primary focus has shifted to a tactical building game called &quot;Mason&quot;, which focuses on competitive construction and invention of buildings, traps, and mechanisms. The intent lies in developing powerful yet generic &quot;item invention&quot; algorithms capable of bringing a new dimension of dynamic content to interactive gaming, creating, in effect, a working physics model that enables
players to build and operate objects within the game that were not originally intended by the
creators. Other games have been and will continue to be developed alongside &quot;Mason&quot;.
This game is currently in alpha development and there are two available 3D clients. Mason includes all the functionality of Acorn.

The project is also beginning to branch out into other forms of entertainment (e.g. comics, paper-and-pencil gaming), as it finds that its processes and multi-disciplinary nature are equally applicable there.

===Clients===
There are two currently functional 3D clients for Worldforge, Ember and Sear.
Both clients are fully capable of normal operation such as moving around the world and performing actions such as starting fires, planting trees, making stakes etc. However, Ember has more advanced entity editing capabilities suitable for world building.
Both clients are available for Linux and Windows, only Sear is currently available for Mac.

===Servers===
Cyphesis currently handles the running of the world. It is intended to become an AI only server and Indri is supposed to model Physics. However work on Indri is currently moving slowly by while Cyphesis is being actively developed.

<doc id="33263" wikidata="Q752245" url="?curid=33263" title="Widescreen">
<text>Widescreen images are displayed within a set of aspect ratios (relationship of image width to height) used in film, television and computer screens. In film, a widescreen film is any film image with a width-to-height aspect ratio greater than 4:3 (1.33:1).

For TV, the original screen ratio for broadcasts was in 4:3 (1.33:1). Largely between the 1990s and early 2000s, at varying paces in different countries, 16:9 (e.g. 1920×1080p 60p) widescreen displays came into increasingly common use by high definitions.

With computer displays, aspect ratios other than 4:3 (e.g. 1920×1440) are also referred to as &quot;widescreen&quot;. Widescreen computer displays were previously made in a 16:10 aspect ratio (e.g. 1920×1200), but nowadays they are 16:9 (e.g. 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160).

== Film ==

=== History ===
Widescreen was first used for &quot;The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight&quot; (1897). This was not only the longest film that had been released to date at 100 minutes, but also the first widescreen film being shot on 63 mm Eastman stock with five perforations per frame.

Widescreen was first widely used in the late 1920s in some short films and newsreels, and feature films, notably Abel Gance&#x27;s film &quot;Napoleon&quot; (1927) with a final widescreen sequence in what Gance called Polyvision. Claude Autant-Lara released a film &quot;Pour construire un feu&quot; (&quot;To Build a Fire&quot;, 1928) in the early Henri Chrétien widescreen process, later adapted by Twentieth Century-Fox for CinemaScope in 1952.

The experimental Natural Vision widescreen process developed by George K. Spoor and P. John Berggren used 63.5 mm film and had a 2:1 aspect ratio. In 1926, a Natural Vision film of Niagara Falls was released. In 1927, the Natural Vision process was used in the production of &quot;The American&quot; &quot;The Flag Maker&quot;. It was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and starred Bessie Love and Charles Ray, but was never released theatrically.

On May 26, 1929, Fox Film Corporation released &quot;Fox Grandeur News&quot; and &quot;Fox Movietone Follies of 1929&quot; in New York City in the Fox Grandeur process. Other films shot in widescreen were the musical &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1929) which premiered at the Roxy Theater, New York City, on February 13, 1930, starring Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell and a 12-year-old Betty Grable as a chorus girl; &quot;Song o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, a musical feature starring Irish tenor John McCormack and directed by Frank Borzage (&quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;), which was shipped from the labs on March 17, 1930, but never released and may no longer survive, according to film historian Miles Kreuger (the 35 mm version, however, debuted in New York on March 11, 1930); and the western &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930) starring John Wayne and Tyrone Power, Sr. which premiered at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on October 2, 1930, all of which were also made in the 70 mm Fox Grandeur process.

RKO Radio Pictures released &quot;Danger Lights&quot; with Jean Arthur, Louis Wolheim, and Robert Armstrong on August 21, 1930 in a 65 mm widescreen process known as NaturalVision, invented by film pioneer George K. Spoor. On November 13, 1930, United Artists released &quot;The Bat Whispers&quot; directed by Roland West in a 70 mm widescreen process known as Magnafilm. Warner Brothers released &quot;Song of the Flame&quot; and &quot;Kismet&quot; (both 1930) in a widescreen process they called Vitascope.

In 1930, after experimenting with the system called Fantom Screen for &quot;The Trail of &#x27;98&quot; (1928), MGM came out with a system called Realife. MGM filmed &quot;The Great Meadow&quot; (1930) in Realife. However, it is unclear whether it was released in that widescreen process due to declining interest of the movie-going public.

By 1932, the Great Depression had forced studios to cut back on needless expense and it was not until 1953 that wider aspect ratios were again used in an attempt to stop the fall in attendance due, partially, to the emergence of television in the U.S. However, a few producers and directors, among them Alfred Hitchcock, were reluctant to use the anamorphic widescreen size featured in such formats as Cinemascope. Hitchcock used VistaVision, a non-anamorphic widescreen process developed by Paramount Pictures and Technicolor which could be adjusted to present various flat aspect ratios.

=== Types ===
Masked (or flat) widescreen was introduced in April 1953. The negative is shot exposing the Academy ratio using spherical lenses, but the top and bottom of the picture are hidden or masked off by a metal aperture plate, cut to specifications of the theater&#x27;s screen, in the projector. Alternatively, a hard matte in the printing or shooting stages may be used to mask off those areas while filming for composition purposes, but an aperture plate is still used to block off the appropriate areas in the theater. A detriment is that the film grain size is thus increased because only part of the image is being expanded to full height. Films are designed to be shown in cinemas in masked widescreen format but the full unmasked frame is sometimes used for television, known as an open matte. In such an instance, a photographer will compose for widescreen, but &quot;protect&quot; the full image from things such as microphones and other filming equipment. Standardized &quot;flat widescreen&quot; ratios are 1.66:1, 1.75:1, 1.85:1, and 2:1. The 1.85:1 aspect ratio has become the predominant aspect ratio for the format.

35 mm anamorphic – This type of widescreen is used for CinemaScope, Panavision, and several other equivalent processes. The film is essentially shot &quot;squeezed&quot;, so that the actors appear vertically elongated on the actual film. A special lens inside the projector unsqueezes the image so that it will appear normal. Films shot in CinemaScope or Panavision are usually projected at a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, though the historical aspect ratio can be 2.66:1 (original separate magnetic sound aspect ratio), 2.55:1 (original four-track magnetic sound aspect ratio) or 2.35:1 (original mono optical sound aspect ratio, and much later &quot;stereo variable-area&quot; aspect ratio, also called Dolby Stereo). The negative is usually 2.66:1 or, in rare cases, 2.55:1 or 2.35:1. The sole purpose of the change to 2.39:1 and, later, to 2.40:1, was to better hide so-called &quot;negative assembly&quot; splices (splices employed in the composited camera negative. This was not a production change, rather it was a recommended projection change.)

A Chilean film, &quot;Post Mortem&quot;, used anamorphic lenses with 16 mm film, to be projected at an ultra-widescreen 2.66:1 for a unique look.

Super gauges – The full negative frame, including the area traditionally reserved for the sound track, is filmed using &quot;full&quot; aperture, which was standard for silent, but also common for most anamorphic negatives. The print is then shrunk and/or cropped in order to fit it back onto release prints, which include a sound track. The aspect ratio for Super 35, for example, can be set to virtually any projection standard.

Large gauge – A 70 mm film frame is not only twice as wide as a standard frame but also has greater height (five perfs versus four perfs). Shooting and projecting a film in 70 mm therefore gives more than four times the image area of non-anamorphic 35 mm film providing a major improvement in image quality. Few major dramatic narrative films have been filmed entirely on this format since the 1970s; the three most recent are Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Master&quot; and Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. For many years, large budget pictures shot anamorphically used reserve stocks of 70 mm film for SFX shots involving CGI or blue-screen compositing as the anamorphic format creates problems with said effects. It has also been used to sometimes strike 70 mm blow-up prints for &quot;roadshow&quot; tours in select cities from the 35 mm camera negative in order to capitalize on the extra sound channels provided. The introduction of digital sound systems and diminishing number of installed 70 mm projectors has made a 70 mm release largely obsolete. However, blowups from 35 mm formats to IMAX have been used for a limited number of blockbuster films.

Paramount&#x27;s VistaVision was a larger gauge precursor to 70 mm film. Introduced in 1954, it ran standard 35 mm film through the camera horizontally to achieve a widescreen effect using greater negative area, in order to create a finer-grained four-perforation 35 mm prints in an era where standard monopack stock could not produce finer results. Negative frames were eight perforations wide. Eight-perf photography is sometimes used for shooting special effects in order to produce a finer-grained matte that can be used in optical printing without image degradation, and is notable for its use in Lucasfilm&#x27;s original three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, among others. Another similar system with horizontal orientation was MGM&#x27;s &quot;Arnoldscope&quot;.

Multiple lens camera/multiple projectors – The Cinerama system originally involved shooting with three lens camera, and projecting the three resulting films on a curved screen with three synchronized projectors, resulting in an ultrawide aspect ratio of 2.89. Later Cinerama movies were shot in 70 mm anamorphic (see below), and the resultant widescreen image was divided into three by optical printers to produce the final threefold prints.

The technical drawbacks of Cinerama are discussed in its own article. Only two narrative feature films, &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; and &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, were filmed in three-camera Cinerama, and several sequences from the latter were actually filmed in Ultra-Panavision. With the exception of a few films created sporadically for use in specialty Cinerama theaters, the format is effectively obsolete.

A non-Cinerama, three-projector process was pioneered for the final reel of Abel Gance&#x27;s epic film &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927)
The process, called Polyvision by Gance, consisted of three 1.33 images side by side, so that the total aspect ratio of the image is 4:1. The technical difficulties in mounting a full screening of the film, however, make most theaters unwilling or unable to show it in this format.

Between 1956 and 1957, the Soviets developed Kinopanorama, which is identical in most respects to the original three-camera Cinerama.

Anamorphic 70 mm – 70 mm with anamorphic lenses, popularly known as &quot;Ultra Panavision&quot; or &quot;MGM Camera 65&quot;, creates an even wider high-quality picture. This camera process was used for the remake of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), resulting in an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, one of the widest projected images ever used for a feature film. The 70 mm anamorphic format was not commonly used, due to the very high production costs, although it was favored for epic films such as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; in order to capture wide panoramic landscapes and high-budget scenes with thousands of extras and enormous sets. This system is obsolete.

== Television ==
The original screen ratio for TV broadcasts was 4:3 (1.33:1). This was the same aspect ratio as most cinema screens and films at the time TV was first sold commercially. 1930s and 1940s films in 4:3, such as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, have always been displayed on television in 4:3, filling the entire frame.

When preparing a film that was originally intended to be displayed in widescreen for TV broadcast the material was often edited with the sides truncated, using techniques such as center cut or pan and scan. Sometimes, in the case of Super 35, the full film negative was shown unmasked on TV (that is, with the hard matte removed). However, this causes the 4:3 image not to be what the director intended the audience to see, and sometimes boom mics, edited out of the shot when the picture is matted, can be visible. Current TVs feature a 16:9 aspect ratio, allowing them to display a 16:9 picture without letterboxing.

Japan saw its first commercially available widescreen TV models in 1992 and TV networks began broadcasting in EDTV widescreen in 1995, starting with NTV.

The first widescreen TV sold in the United States was the Thomson Consumer Electronics RCA CinemaScreen, released in 1993.
In Europe, the PAL and the French SECAM Standard Definition systems employed higher resolutions than the US NTSC Standard Definition system, which meant the quality issues of letterboxed or matted movies on TV were not as severe. There is also an extension to PAL, called PALplus, which allows specially equipped receivers to display a PAL picture as true 16:9 with a full 576 lines of vertical resolution, provided that the station employs the same system. Standard PAL receivers will receive such a broadcast as a 16:9 image letterboxed to 4:3, with a small amount of color noise in the black bars; this &quot;noise&quot; is actually the additional lines which are hidden inside the color signal. Clear-Vision supports an equivalent widescreen system for NTSC analogue broadcasting.

Despite the existence of PALplus and support for widescreen in the DVB-based digital satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcasts in use across Europe, only Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, the Nordic countries and the UK have adopted widescreen on a large scale, with over half of all widescreen channels available by satellite in Europe targeting those areas. The UK, in particular, began moving to widescreen with the advent of digital terrestrial television in the late 1990s, and commercials were required to be delivered to broadcasters in widescreen as of 1 July 2000, on their widescreen &quot;C-Day&quot;.

Widescreen televisions are typically used in conjunction with Digital, High-Definition Television (HDTV) receivers, or Standard-Definition (SD) DVD players and other digital television sources. Digital material is provided to widescreen TVs either in high-definition format, which is natively 16:9 (1.78:1), or as an anamorphically-compressed standard-definition picture. Typically, devices decoding Digital Standard-Definition pictures can be programmed to provide anamorphic widescreen formatting, for 16:9 sets, and formatting for 4:3 sets. Pan-and-scan mode can be used on 4:3 if the producers of the material have included the necessary panning data; if this data is absent, letterboxing or centre cut-out is used.
HD DVD and Blu-ray players were introduced in 2006. Toshiba ceased production of HD DVD players in early 2008. Consumer camcorders are also available in the HD-video format at fairly low prices. These developments will result in more options for viewing widescreen images on television monitors.

<doc id="33265" wikidata="Q8016" url="?curid=33265" title="Winston Churchill">
<text>Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman, military officer, and writer who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 (during the Second World War) and again from 1951 to 1955. For some 62 of the years between 1900 and 1964, he was a member of parliament (MP) and represented a total of five constituencies over that time. Ideologically an adherent to economic liberalism and imperialism, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.
Of mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire into the wealthy, aristocratic Spencer family. He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Mahdist War and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government, Churchill was president of the Board of Trade and later Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers&#x27; social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War he oversaw the Gallipoli campaign; but, after it proved a disaster, was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. After two years out of Parliament, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s Conservative government, returning sterling in 1925 to the gold standard, depressing the UK economy.
Out of government during his so-called &quot;wilderness years&quot; in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for rearmament to counter the threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became prime minister, succeeding Neville Chamberlain. Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. After the Conservatives&#x27; defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an &quot;iron curtain&quot; of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Between his terms, he wrote several books recounting his experience during the war. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953. He lost the 1950 election but was returned to office in 1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and preservation of what remained of the British Empire, with India no longer a part of it. Domestically, his government&#x27;s priority was their extensive housebuilding programme, in which they were successful. In declining health, Churchill resigned in 1955, remaining an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral.
One of the 20th century&#x27;s most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the UK and the rest of the Anglosphere. He is generally viewed as a victorious wartime leader who played an integral role in defending liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. He has sometimes been criticised for his imperialism and certain comments on race, in addition to some wartime decisions such as area bombing, but historians nevertheless rank Churchill as one of the greatest British prime ministers.
==Early life==
===Childhood and schooling: 1874–1895===

Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born on 30 November 1874 at his family&#x27;s ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. On his father&#x27;s side, he was a member of the aristocracy as a descendant of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, representing the Conservative Party, had been elected member of parliament (MP) for Woodstock in February 1874. His mother was Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill, a daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman.

In 1876, Churchill&#x27;s paternal grandfather, John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, was appointed Viceroy of Ireland. Randolph became his private secretary and the family relocated to Dublin. Winston&#x27;s brother, Jack, was born there in 1880. For much of the 1880s, Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and the brothers cared for by their nanny, Elizabeth Everest. When she died in 1895, Churchill wrote &quot;she had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived&quot;.

Churchill began boarding school at St George&#x27;s in Ascot, Berkshire, aged 7, but he was not academic and his behaviour was poor. In 1884, he transferred to Brunswick School in Hove, where his academic performance improved. In April 1888, aged 13, he passed the entrance exam for Harrow School. His father wanted him to prepare for a military career, so his last three years at Harrow were in the army form. After two unsuccessful attempts to gain admittance to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he succeeded. He was accepted as a cadet in the cavalry, starting in September 1893. His father died in January 1895.

===Cuba, India, and Sudan: 1895–1899===

In February 1895, Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars regiment of the British Army, based at Aldershot. Eager to witness military action, he used his mother&#x27;s influence to get posted to a war zone. In the autumn, he and friend Reggie Barnes, went to observe the Cuban War of Independence and became involved in skirmishes after joining Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters. Churchill sent reports to the &quot;Daily Graphic&quot; in London. He proceeded to New York and wrote to his mother about &quot;what an extraordinary people the Americans are!&quot; With the Hussars, he went to Bombay in October 1896. Based in Bangalore, he was in India for 19 months, visiting Calcutta and joining expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier.

In India, Churchill began a self-education project, reading widely including Plato, Edward Gibbon, Charles Darwin and Thomas Babington Macaulay. The books were sent by his mother, with whom he shared frequent correspondence. To learn about politics, he asked her to send him copies of &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, the political almanack. In an 1898 letter, he referred to his beliefs, saying: &quot;I do not accept the Christian or any other form of religious belief&quot;. Churchill had been christened in the Church of England but underwent a virulently anti-Christian phase in his youth, and as an adult was an agnostic. In another letter to a cousin, he referred to religion as &quot;a delicious narcotic&quot; and expressed a preference for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism because he felt it &quot;a step nearer Reason&quot;.

Interested in parliamentary affairs, Churchill declared himself &quot;a Liberal in all but name&quot;, adding he could never endorse the Liberal Party&#x27;s support for Irish home rule. Instead, he allied himself to the Tory democracy wing of the Conservatives and on a visit home, gave his first speech for the party&#x27;s Primrose League at Claverton Down. Mixing reformist and conservative perspectives, he supported the promotion of secular, non-denominational education while opposing women&#x27;s suffrage.

Churchill volunteered to join Bindon Blood&#x27;s Malakand Field Force in its campaign against Mohmand rebels in the Swat Valley of north-west India. Blood accepted on condition he was assigned as a journalist, the beginning of Churchill&#x27;s writing career. He returned to Bangalore in October 1897 and wrote his first book, &quot;The Story of the Malakand Field Force&quot;, which received positive reviews. He wrote his only work of fiction, &quot;Savrola&quot;, a Ruritanian romance. To keep occupied, Churchill embraced writing as what Roy Jenkins calls his &quot;whole habit&quot;, especially through his career when he was out of office. Writing was his safeguard against recurring depression, which he referred to as his &quot;black dog&quot;.

Using London contacts, Churchill got attached to General Herbert Kitchener&#x27;s campaign in the Sudan as a 21st Lancers subaltern while, working as a journalist for &quot;The Morning Post&quot;. After participating in one of the British Army&#x27;s last cavalry charges in the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898, the 21st Lancers were stood down. In October, Churchill returned to England and began writing &quot;The River War&quot; about the campaign; it was published in 1899. He decided to leave the army as he was critical of Kitchener&#x27;s actions, particularly the unmerciful treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of Muhammad Ahmad&#x27;s tomb.

On 2 December 1898, Churchill embarked for India to settle his military business and complete his resignation. He spent much time playing polo, the only ball sport in which he was ever interested. Having left the Hussars, he sailed from Bombay on 20 March 1899, determined to launch a career in politics.

===Politics and South Africa: 1899–1901===

Churchill spoke at Conservative meetings and was selected as one of the party&#x27;s two candidates for the June 1899 Oldham by-election. While campaigning, he referred to himself as &quot;a Conservative and a Tory Democrat&quot;. Although the seats had been held by the Conservatives, the result was a narrow Liberal victory.

Anticipating the outbreak of the Second Boer War between Britain and the Boer republics, Churchill sailed to South Africa as a journalist for the &quot;Morning Post&quot;. In October, he travelled to the conflict zone near Ladysmith, then besieged by Boer troops, before heading for Colenso. At the Battle of Chieveley, his train was derailed by Boer artillery shelling, he was captured as a prisoner of war (POW) and interned in a POW camp in Pretoria. In December, Churchill escaped and evaded his captors by stowing aboard freight trains and hiding in a mine. He made it to safety in Portuguese East Africa. His escape attracted much publicity.

In January 1900, Churchill briefly rejoined the army as a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse regiment, joining Redvers Buller&#x27;s fight to relieve the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria. He was among the first British troops into both places. With his cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, he demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer prison camp guards. Throughout the war, he publicly chastised anti-Boer prejudices, calling for them to be treated with &quot;generosity and tolerance&quot;, and afterwards urged the British to be magnanimous in victory. In July, having resigned his lieutenancy, he returned to Britain. His &quot;Morning Post&quot; despatches had been published as &quot;London to Ladysmith via Pretoria&quot; and sold well.

Churchill rented a flat in London&#x27;s Mayfair, using it as his base for six years. He stood again as a Conservative candidate at Oldham in the October 1900 general election, securing a narrow victory to become a Member of Parliament aged 25. In the same month, he published &quot;Ian Hamilton&#x27;s March&quot;, a book about his South African experiences, which became the focus of a lecture tour in November through Britain, America and Canada. Members of Parliament were unpaid and the tour was a financial necessity. In America, Churchill met Mark Twain, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, who he did not get on with. In spring 1901, he gave lectures in Paris, Madrid and Gibraltar.

===Conservative MP: 1901–1904===

In February 1901, Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread coverage. He associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans, but was critical of the Conservative government on various issues, especially increases in army funding. He believed additional military expenditure should go to the navy. This upset the Conservative front bench but was supported by Liberals, with whom he increasingly socialised, particularly Liberal Imperialists like H. H. Asquith. Churchill later wrote that he &quot;drifted steadily to the left&quot;. He privately considered &quot;the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party&quot;, or alternately a &quot;Central Party&quot; to unite the Conservatives and Liberals.

By 1903, there was division between Churchill and the Conservatives, largely because he opposed their promotion of protectionism. As a free trader, he helped found the Free Food League. Churchill sensed that the animosity of party members would prevent him gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government. The Liberal Party was attracting growing support, and so his defection in 1904 may have been influenced by ambition. He increasingly voted with the Liberals. For example, he opposed an increase in military expenditure, supported a Liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions, and opposed the introduction of import tariffs. Arthur Balfour&#x27;s government announced protectionist legislation in October 1903. Two months later, incensed by Churchill&#x27;s criticism of the government, the Oldham Conservative Association informed him it would not support his candidature at the next election.

In May 1904, Churchill opposed the government&#x27;s proposed Aliens Bill, designed to curb Jewish immigration. He stated that the bill would &quot;appeal to insular prejudice against foreigners, to racial prejudice against Jews, and to labour prejudice against competition&quot; and expressed himself in favour of &quot;the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained&quot;. On 31 May 1904, he crossed the floor to sit as a member of the Liberal Party.

==Liberal MP: 1904–1908==
As a Liberal, Churchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of John Morley and David Lloyd George. In December 1905, Balfour resigned as prime minister and King Edward VII invited the Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman to replace him. Hoping to secure a working majority, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election in January 1906, which the Liberals won in a massive landslide. Churchill won the Manchester North West seat and his biography of his father was published; he received advance payment of £8,000. It was generally well received. The first biography of Churchill himself, written by the Liberal MacCallum Scott, was published.

In the new government, Churchill became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonial Office, a junior ministerial position he had requested. He worked beneath the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, and took Edward Marsh as his secretary; Marsh remained his secretary for 25 years. Churchill&#x27;s first task was helping to draft a constitution for the Transvaal; and he helped oversee the formation of a government in the Orange River Colony. In dealing with southern Africa, he sought to ensure equality between the British and Boers. He announced a gradual phasing out of the use of Chinese indentured labourers in South Africa; he and the government decided a sudden ban would cause too much upset and might damage the colony&#x27;s economy. He expressed concerns about the relations between European settlers and the black African population; after the Zulu launched their Bambatha Rebellion in Natal, Churchill complained about the &quot;disgusting butchery of the natives&quot; by Europeans.

==Asquith government: 1908–1915==
===President of the Board of Trade: 1908–1910===

With Campbell-Bannerman terminally ill, Asquith became prime minister in April 1908. He appointed Churchill as President of the Board of Trade. Aged 33, Churchill was the youngest Cabinet member since 1866. Newly appointed Cabinet ministers were legally obliged to seek re-election at a by-election. On 24 April, Churchill lost the Manchester North West by-election to the Conservative candidate by 429 votes. On 9 May, the Liberals stood him in the safe seat of Dundee, where he won comfortably.

Churchill proposed marriage to Clementine Hozier; they were married on 12 September 1908 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster and honeymooned in Baveno, Venice, and Veveří Castle in Moravia. They lived at 33 Eccleston Square, London, and their first daughter, Diana, was born in 1909. The success of their marriage was important to Churchill&#x27;s career as Clementine&#x27;s unbroken affection provided him with a secure and happy background.

One of Churchill&#x27;s first tasks as a minister was to arbitrate in an industrial dispute among ship-workers and employers, on the River Tyne. He afterwards established a Standing Court of Arbitration to deal with industrial disputes, establishing a reputation as a conciliator. He worked with Lloyd George to champion social reform. He promoted what he called a &quot;network of State intervention and regulation&quot; akin to that in Germany.

Continuing Lloyd George&#x27;s work, Churchill introduced the Mines Eight Hours Bill, which prohibited miners from working more than an eight-hour day. In 1909, he introduced the Trade Boards Bill, creating Trade Boards which could prosecute exploitative employers. Passing with a large majority, it established the principle of a minimum wage and the right to have meal breaks. In May 1909, he proposed the Labour Exchanges Bill to establish over 200 Labour Exchanges through which the unemployed would be assisted in finding employment. He promoted the idea of an unemployment insurance scheme, which would be part-funded by the state.

To ensure funding for their reforms, Lloyd George and Churchill denounced Reginald McKenna&#x27;s policy of naval expansion, refusing to believe war with Germany was inevitable. As Chancellor, Lloyd George presented his &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; on 29 April 1909, calling it a war budget to eliminate poverty. With Churchill as his closest ally, Lloyd George proposed unprecedented taxes on the rich to fund Liberal welfare programmes. The budget was vetoed by the Conservative peers who dominated the House of Lords. His social reforms under threat, Churchill became president of the Budget League, and warned that upper-class obstruction could anger working-class Britons and lead to class war. The government called the January 1910 general election, which resulted in a Liberal victory; Churchill retained his seat at Dundee. He proposed abolition of the House of Lords in a cabinet memo, suggesting it be succeeded by a unicameral system, or smaller second chamber that lacked an in-built advantage for the Conservatives. In April, the Lords relented and the People&#x27;s Budget passed. Churchill continued to campaign against the House of Lords and assisted passage of the Parliament Act 1911 which reduced and restricted its powers.

===Home Secretary: 1910–1911===
In February 1910, Churchill was promoted to Home Secretary, giving him control over the police and prison services; he implemented a prison reform programme. Measures included a distinction between criminal and political prisoners, with rules for the latter being relaxed. There were educational innovations like the establishment of libraries, and a requirement to stage entertainments four times a year. The rules on solitary confinement were relaxed, and Churchill proposed abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines. Imprisonment of people aged between 16 and 21 was abolished except for the most serious offences. Churchill reduced (&quot;commuted&quot;) 21 of the 43 death (&quot;capital&quot;) sentences passed while he was Home Secretary.

A major domestic issue was women&#x27;s suffrage. Churchill supported giving women the vote, but would only back a bill to that effect if it had majority support from the (male) electorate. His proposed solution was a referendum, but this found no favour with Asquith and women&#x27;s suffrage remained unresolved until 1918. Many suffragettes believed Churchill was a committed opponent, and targeted his meetings for protest. In November 1910, the suffragist Hugh Franklin attacked Churchill with a whip; Franklin was imprisoned for six weeks.
In November 1910, Churchill had to deal with the Tonypandy riots, in which coal miners in the Rhondda Valley violently protested against working conditions. The Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested troops to help police quell the rioting. Churchill, learning that the troops were already travelling, allowed them to go as far as Swindon and Cardiff, but blocked their deployment; he was concerned their use lead to bloodshed. Instead he sent 270 London police, who were not equipped with firearms, to assist. As the riots continued, he offered the protesters an interview with the government&#x27;s chief industrial arbitrator, which they accepted. Privately, Churchill regarded the mine owners and striking miners as &quot;very unreasonable&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; and other media outlets accused him of being soft on the rioters; in contrast, many in the Labour Party, which was linked to the trade unions, regarded him as too heavy-handed. Churchill incurred the long-term suspicion of the labour movement.

Asquith called a general election in December 1910, and the Liberals were re-elected with Churchill secure in Dundee. In January 1911, Churchill became involved in the Siege of Sidney Street; three Latvian burglars had killed police officers and hidden in a house in the East End of London, surrounded by police. Churchill stood with the police though he did not direct their operation. After the house caught fire, he told the fire brigade not to proceed into the house because of the threat posed by the armed men. Afterwards, two of the burglars were found dead. Although he faced criticism for his decision, he said he &quot;thought it better to let the house burn down rather than spend good British lives in rescuing those ferocious rascals&quot;.

In March 1911, Churchill introduced the second reading of the Coal Mines Bill; when implemented, it imposed stricter safety standards. He formulated the Shops Bill to improve working conditions of shop workers; it faced opposition from shop owners and only passed in a much emasculated form. In April, Lloyd George introduced the first health and unemployment insurance legislation, the National Insurance Act 1911, which Churchill had been instrumental in drafting. In May, Clementine gave birth to their second child, Randolph, named after Winston&#x27;s father. In response to escalating civil strife in 1911, Churchill sent troops into Liverpool to quell protesting dockers and rallied against a national railway strike.

During the Agadir Crisis of April 1911, when there was a threat of war between France and Germany, Churchill suggested an alliance with France and Russia to safeguard the independence of Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands to counter possible German expansionism. The Crisis had a profound effect on Churchill and he altered his views about the need for naval expansion.

===First Lord of the Admiralty===

In October 1911, Asquith appointed Churchill First Lord of the Admiralty, and he took up official residence at Admiralty House. He created a naval war staff and, over the next two and a half years, focused on naval preparation, visiting naval stations and dockyards, seeking to improve morale, and scrutinising German naval developments. After Germany passed its 1912 Naval Law to increase warship production, Churchill vowed that for every new German battleship, Britain would build two. He invited Germany to engage in a mutual de-escalation, but this was refused.

Churchill pushed for higher pay and greater recreational facilities for naval staff, more submarines, and a renewed focus on the Royal Naval Air Service, encouraging them to experiment with how aircraft could be used for military purposes. He coined the term &quot;seaplane&quot; and ordered 100 to be constructed. Some Liberals objected to his level of naval expenditure; in December 1913 he threatened to resign if his proposal for 4 new battleships in 1914–15 was rejected. In June 1914, he convinced the House of Commons to authorise the government purchase of a 51% share in the profits of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to secure oil access for the navy.

The central issue in Britain was Irish Home Rule and, in 1912, Asquith&#x27;s government introduced the Home Rule Bill. Churchill supported it and urged Ulster Unionists to accept it as he opposed the Partition of Ireland. Concerning the possibility of partition, Churchill stated: &quot;Whatever Ulster&#x27;s right may be, she cannot stand in the way of the whole of the rest of Ireland. Half a province cannot impose a permanent veto on the nation. Half a province cannot obstruct forever the reconciliation between the British and Irish democracies&quot;. Speaking in the House of Commons on 16 February 1922, Churchill said: &quot;What Irishmen all over the world most desire is not hostility against this country, but the unity of their own&quot;.
Following a Cabinet decision, he boosted the naval presence in Ireland to deal with any Unionist uprising. Seeking a compromise, Churchill suggested Ireland remain part of a federal UK, but this angered Liberals and Irish nationalists.

As First Lord, Churchill was tasked with overseeing Britain&#x27;s naval effort when the First World War began in August 1914. The navy transported 120,000 troops to France and began a blockade of Germany&#x27;s North Sea ports. Churchill sent submarines to the Baltic Sea to assist the Russian Navy and sent the Marine Brigade to Ostend, forcing a reallocation of German troops. In September, Churchill assumed full responsibility for Britain&#x27;s aerial defence. On 7 October, Clementine gave birth to their third child, Sarah. In October, Churchill visited Antwerp to observe Belgian defences against the besieging Germans and promised reinforcements. Soon afterwards, Antwerp fell to the Germans and Churchill was criticised in the press. He maintained that his actions had prolonged resistance and enabled the Allies to secure Calais and Dunkirk. In November, Asquith called a War Council including Churchill. Churchill set the development of the tank on the right track and financed its creation with Admiralty funds.

Churchill was interested in the Middle Eastern theatre, and wanted to relieve pressure on the Russians in the Caucasus by staging attacks against Turkey in the Dardanelles. He hoped that the British could even seize Constantinople. Approval was given and, in March 1915, an Anglo-French task force attempted a naval bombardment of Turkish defences. In April, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, including the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), began its assault at Gallipoli. Both campaigns failed and Churchill was held by many MPs, particularly Conservatives, to be responsible. In May, Asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an all-party coalition government, but the Conservatives&#x27; condition of entry was that Churchill must be removed from the Admiralty. Churchill pleaded his case with Asquith and Conservative leader Bonar Law but had to accept demotion.

==Military service, 1915–1916==
On 25 November 1915, Churchill resigned from the government, although he remained an MP. Asquith rejected his request to be appointed Governor-General of British East Africa. Churchill decided to return to active service with the Army and was attached to the 2nd Grenadier Guards, on the Western Front. In January 1916, he was temporarily promoted to lieutenant-colonel and given command of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers. The battalion was moved to a sector of the Belgian Front near Ploegsteert. For three months, they faced continual shelling, though no German offensive. Churchill narrowly escaped death when, during a visit by his cousin the Duke of Marlborough, a large piece of shrapnel fell between them. In May, the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers were merged into the 15th Division. Churchill did not request a new command, instead securing permission to leave active service. His temporary promotion ended on 16 May 1916, when he returned to the rank of major.

Back in the House of Commons, Churchill spoke out on war issues, calling for conscription to be extended to the Irish, greater recognition of soldiers&#x27; bravery, and for the introduction of steel helmets. It was in November 1916 that he penned &quot;The greater application of mechanical power to the prosecution of an offensive on land&quot;, but it fell on deaf ears. He was frustrated at being out of office, but was repeatedly blamed for the Gallipoli disaster by the pro-Conservative press. Churchill argued his case before the Dardanelles Commission, whose report placed no blame on him personally for the campaign&#x27;s failure.

==Lloyd George government: 1916–1922==
===Minister of Munitions: 1917–1919===
In October 1916, Asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Lloyd George who, in May 1917, sent Churchill to inspect the French war effort. In July, Churchill was appointed Minister of Munitions. He negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the Clyde and increased munitions production. In his October 1917 letter to his Cabinet colleagues, he penned the plan of attack for the next year, that would bring final victory to the Allies. He ended a second strike, in June 1918, by threatening to conscript strikers into the army. In the House of Commons, Churchill voted in support of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave some women the right to vote. In November 1918, four days after the Armistice, Churchill&#x27;s fourth child, Marigold, was born.

===Secretary of State for War and Air: 1919–1921===

Lloyd George called a general election for 14 December 1918. During the campaign, Churchill called for nationalisation of the railways, a control on monopolies, tax reform, and the creation of a League of Nations to prevent wars. He was returned as MP for Dundee and, though the Conservatives won a majority, Lloyd George was retained as prime minister. In January 1919, Lloyd George moved Churchill to the War Office as both Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air.

Churchill was responsible for demobilising the army, though he convinced Lloyd George to keep a million men conscripted for the British Army of the Rhine. Churchill was one of the few government figures who opposed harsh measures against Germany, and he cautioned against demobilising the German Army, warning they might be needed as a bulwark against Soviet Russia. He was outspoken against Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Communist Party government in Russia. He initially supported using British troops to assist the anti-Communist White forces in the Russian Civil War, but soon recognised the people&#x27;s desire to bring them home. After the Soviets won the civil war, Churchill proposed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around the country.

In the Irish War of Independence, he supported the use of the paramilitary Black and Tans to combat Irish revolutionaries. After British troops in Iraq clashed with Kurdish rebels, Churchill authorised two squadrons to the area, proposing they be equipped with &quot;poison gas&quot; to be used to &quot;inflict punishment upon recalcitrant natives without inflicting grave injury upon them&quot;, although this was never implemented. He saw the occupation of Iraq as a drain on Britain and proposed, unsuccessfully, that the government should hand control back to Turkey.

===Secretary of State for the Colonies: 1921–1922===
Churchill became Secretary of State for the Colonies in February 1921. The following month, the first exhibit of his paintings took place in Paris, with Churchill exhibiting under a pseudonym. In May, his mother died, followed in August by his daughter Marigold, from sepsis. Churchill was haunted by Marigold&#x27;s death for the rest of his life.

Churchill was involved in negotiations with Sinn Féin leaders and helped draft the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He was responsible for reducing the cost of occupying the Middle East, and was involved in the installations of Faisal I of Iraq and Abdullah I of Jordan. Churchill travelled to Mandatory Palestine where, as a supporter of Zionism, he refused an Arab Palestinian petition to prohibit Jewish migration. He did allow temporary restrictions following the Jaffa riots.

In September 1922, the Chanak Crisis erupted as Turkish forces threatened to occupy the Dardanelles neutral zone, which was policed by the British army based in Chanak. Churchill and Lloyd George favoured military resistance to any Turkish advance but the majority Conservatives in the coalition government opposed it. A political debacle ensued which resulted in the Conservative withdrawal from the government, precipitating the November 1922 general election.

Also in September, Churchill&#x27;s fifth and last child, Mary, was born, and in the same month he purchased Chartwell, in Kent, which became his family home. In October 1922, he underwent an appendectomy. While he was in hospital, Lloyd George&#x27;s coalition was dissolved. In the general election, Churchill lost his Dundee seat to Edwin Scrymgeour, a prohibitionist candidate. Later, he wrote that he was &quot;without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix&quot;. He was elevated as one of 50 members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, as named in Lloyd George&#x27;s 1922 Dissolution Honours list.

==Out of Parliament: 1922–1924==
Churchill spent much of the next six months at the Villa Rêve d&#x27;Or near Cannes, where he devoted himself to painting and writing his memoirs. He wrote an autobiographical history of the war, &quot;The World Crisis&quot;. The first volume was published in April 1923 and the rest over the next ten years. After the 1923 general election was called, seven Liberal associations asked Churchill to stand as their candidate, and he selected Leicester West, but did not win. A Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald took power. Churchill had hoped they would be defeated by a Conservative-Liberal coalition. He strongly opposed the MacDonald government&#x27;s decision to loan money to Soviet Russia and feared the signing of an Anglo-Soviet Treaty.

In March 1924, alienated by Liberal support for Labour, Churchill stood as an independent anti-socialist candidate in the Westminster Abbey by-election but was defeated. In May, he addressed a Conservative meeting in Liverpool and declared there was no longer a place for the Liberal Party in politics. He said that Liberals must back the Conservatives to stop Labour and ensure &quot;the successful defeat of socialism&quot;. In July, he agreed with Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin that he would be selected as a Conservative candidate in the next general election, which was held on 29 October. Churchill stood at Epping, but described himself as a &quot;Constitutionalist&quot;. The Conservatives were victorious, and Baldwin formed the new government. Although Churchill had no background in finance or economics, Baldwin appointed him as Chancellor.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1924–1929==

Becoming Chancellor on 6 November 1924, Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party. As Chancellor, he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics, as under the Liberal social reforms. In April 1925, he controversially, albeit reluctantly, restored the gold standard in his first budget, at its 1914 parity, against the advice of leading economists including John Maynard Keynes. The return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry. Churchill presented five budgets in all to April 1929. Among his measures were reduction of the state pension age from 70 to 65; immediate provision of widow&#x27;s pensions; reduction of military expenditure; income tax reductions and imposition of taxes on luxury items.

During the General Strike of 1926, Churchill edited the &quot;British Gazette&quot;, the government&#x27;s anti-strike propaganda newspaper. After the strike ended, he acted as an intermediary between striking miners and their employers. He called for the introduction of a legally binding minimum wage. In a House of Commons speech in 1926 Churchill made his feelings on the issue of Irish unity clear. He stated that Ireland should be united within itself but also &quot;united to the British Empire.&quot; In early 1927, Churchill visited Rome where he met Mussolini, whom he praised for his stand against Leninism.

==The &quot;Wilderness Years&quot;: 1929–1939==
===&quot;Marlborough&quot; and the India Question: 1929–1932===

In the 1929 general election, Churchill retained his Epping seat, but the Conservatives were defeated, and MacDonald formed his second Labour government. Out of office, Churchill was prone to depression (his &quot;black dog&quot;) but addressed this by writing. He began work on &quot;&quot;, a biography of his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. He had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker, although Jenkins believes that was often exaggerated.

Hoping that the Labour government could be ousted, he gained Baldwin&#x27;s approval to work towards establishing a Conservative-Liberal coalition, although many Liberals were reluctant. In October 1930, after his return from a trip to North America, Churchill published his autobiography, &quot;My Early Life&quot;, which sold well and was translated into multiple languages. In January 1931, Churchill resigned from the Conservative Shadow Cabinet because Baldwin supported the government&#x27;s decision to grant Dominion Status to India. Churchill believed that enhanced home rule status would hasten calls for full independence. He was particularly opposed to Mohandas Gandhi, whom he considered &quot;a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir&quot;. His views enraged Labour and Liberal opinion, though he was supported by many grassroot Conservatives.

The October 1931 general election was a landslide victory for the Conservatives. Churchill nearly doubled his majority in Epping, but was not given a ministerial position. The Commons debated Dominion Status for India on 3 December and Churchill insisted on dividing the House, but this backfired as only 43 MPs supported him. He embarked on a lecture tour of North America, hoping to recoup financial losses sustained in the Wall Street crash. On 13 December, he was crossing Fifth Avenue in New York when he was knocked down by a car, suffering a head wound from which he developed neuritis. To further his convalescence, he and Clementine took ship to Nassau for three weeks, but Churchill became depressed about his financial and political losses. He returned to America in late January 1932 and completed most of his lectures before arriving home on 18 March.

Having worked on &quot;Marlborough&quot; for much of 1932, Churchill in August decided to visit his ancestor&#x27;s battlefields. In Munich, he met Ernst Hanfstaengl, a friend of Hitler, who was then rising in prominence. Hanfstaengl tried to arrange a meeting between Churchill and Hitler, but Hitler was unenthusiastic: &quot;What on earth would I talk to him about?&quot; Soon after visiting Blenheim, Churchill was affected by paratyphoid fever and spent two weeks at a sanatorium in Salzburg. He returned to Chartwell on 25 September, still working on &quot;Marlborough&quot;. Two days later, he collapsed after a recurrence of paratyphoid which caused an ulcer to haemorrhage. He was taken to a London nursing home and remained there until late October.

===Warnings about Germany and the abdication crisis: 1933–1936===
After Hitler came to power in January 1933, Churchill was quick to recognise the menace of such a regime, and expressed alarm that the British government had reduced air force spending, and warned that Germany would soon overtake Britain in air force production. Armed with data provided clandestinely by senior civil servants, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, Churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in Germany, especially the development of the Luftwaffe. He spoke of his concerns in a radio broadcast in November 1934, having denounced the intolerance and militarism of Nazism in the House of Commons. While Churchill regarded Mussolini&#x27;s regime as a bulwark against the threat of communist revolution, he opposed the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, despite describing the country as a primitive, uncivilised nation. He admired the exiled king of Spain Alfonso XIII and feared Communism was making inroads during the Spanish Civil War. He referred to Franco&#x27;s army as the &quot;anti-red movement&quot;, but later became critical of Franco as too close to Mussolini and Hitler.

Between October 1933 and September 1938, the four volumes of &quot;Marlborough: His Life and Times&quot; were published and sold well. In December 1934, the India Bill entered Parliament and was passed in February 1935. Churchill and 83 other Conservative MPs voted against it. In June 1935, MacDonald resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Baldwin. Baldwin then led the Conservatives to victory in the 1935 general election; Churchill retained his seat, but was again left out of the government. In January 1936, Edward VIII succeeded his father, George V, as monarch. His desire to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, caused the abdication crisis. Churchill supported Edward and clashed with Baldwin on the issue. Afterwards, although Churchill immediately pledged loyalty to George VI, he wrote that the abdication was &quot;premature and probably quite unnecessary&quot;.

===Anti-appeasement: 1937–1939===

In May 1937, Baldwin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Neville Chamberlain. At first, Churchill welcomed Chamberlain&#x27;s appointment but, in February 1938, matters came to a head after Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden resigned over Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement of Mussolini, a policy which Chamberlain was extending towards Hitler. In 1938, Churchill warned the government against appeasement and called for collective action to deter German aggression. Following the Anschluss, Churchill spoke in the House of Commons:

He began calling for a mutual defence pact among European states threatened by German expansionism, arguing this was the only way to halt Hitler. In September, Germany mobilised to invade the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. Churchill visited Chamberlain and urged him to tell Germany that Britain would declare war if the Germans invaded Czechoslovak territory; Chamberlain was unwilling to do this. On 30 September, Chamberlain signed the Munich Agreement, agreeing to allow German annexation of the Sudetenland. Speaking in the House of Commons on 5 October, Churchill called the agreement &quot;a total and unmitigated defeat&quot;. Following the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Churchill and his supporters called for the foundation of a national coalition. His popularity increased as a result.

==First Lord of the Admiralty: September 1939 to May 1940==
===Phoney War and the Norwegian Campaign===
On 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain&#x27;s war cabinet. Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called &quot;Phoney War&quot;. Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on &quot;a brilliant sea fight&quot;. On 16 February 1940, Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer to board the German supply ship in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the . These actions, and his speeches, enhanced Churchill&#x27;s reputation. He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force, but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed &quot;Operation Wilfred&quot;, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany. Due to disagreements, &quot;Wilfred&quot; was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway.

===Norway Debate and Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation===
After the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held a debate from 7 to 9 May on the government&#x27;s conduct of the war. This became known as the Norway Debate, one of the most significant events in parliamentary history. On the second day, the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain&#x27;s government. Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his prestige. Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government.

Early on 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their assault on France. Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition, but Labour declared on the Friday they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip. Halifax admitted he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords, so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister. Churchill later wrote of a profound sense of relief, as he now had authority over the whole scene. He believed his life so far had been &quot;a preparation for this hour and for this trial&quot;.

==Prime Minister: 1940–45==

===Dunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941===
====War ministry created====

In May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party. Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October. By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality. He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour&#x27;s Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings. The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, a key appointment being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service. In response to criticisms, Churchill created and assumed the position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history. He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front. These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government&#x27;s scientific advisor.

====Resolve to fight on====

At the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France imminent, Halifax proposed the government should explore a peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary. There were high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including with the French premier Paul Reynaud. Churchill&#x27;s resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. By gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.

Churchill succeeded as an orator despite being handicapped from childhood with a speech impediment. He had a lateral lisp and was unable to pronounce the letter &quot;s&quot;, verbalising it with a slur. He worked on his pronunciation by repeating phrases designed to cure his problem with the sibilant &quot;s&quot;. He was ultimately successful, turning the impediment into an asset, as when he called Hitler a &quot;Nar-zee&quot; (rhymes with &quot;khazi&quot;; emphasis on the &quot;z&quot;), rather than a Nazi (&quot;ts&quot;). His first speech as prime minister, delivered to the Commons on 13 May, was the &quot;blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; speech. Churchill made it plain to the nation that a long road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal:
Churchill&#x27;s use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution – Jenkins says Churchill&#x27;s speeches were &quot;an inspiration for the nation, and a catharsis for Churchill himself&quot;.

====Operation Dynamo and the Battle of France====
The Dunkirk evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen, ended on 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and gave rise to a popular view Dunkirk had been a miracle, even a victory. Churchill himself referred to &quot;a miracle of deliverance&quot; in his &quot;we shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech to the Commons that afternoon. The speech ended on a note of defiance, with a clear appeal to the United States:

Germany initiated &quot;Fall Rot&quot;, in France, the following day, and Italy entered the war on the 10th. The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed their conquest of France on 25 June. It was now inevitable that Hitler would attack and probably try to invade Great Britain. Faced with this, Churchill addressed the Commons on 18 June with one of his most famous speeches, ending with this peroration:

Churchill ordered the commencement of the Western Desert campaign on 11 June, a response to the Italian declaration of war. This went well at first while Italy was the sole opposition and Operation Compass was a success. In early 1941, however, Mussolini requested German support. Hitler sent the Afrika Korps to Tripoli under Erwin Rommel, who arrived not long after Churchill had halted &quot;Compass&quot; so he could reassign forces to Greece where the Balkans campaign was entering a critical phase.

In other initiatives through June and July 1940, Churchill ordered the formation of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and Commandos. The SOE was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in Nazi-occupied Europe, while the Commandos were charged with raids on military targets there. Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, took political responsibility for the SOE and recorded that Churchill told him: &quot;And now go and set Europe ablaze&quot;.

====Battle of Britain and the Blitz====

On 20 August 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the situation. In the middle of it, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle:

The Luftwaffe altered its strategy from 7 September 1940 and began the Blitz, which was intensive through October and November. Churchill&#x27;s morale was high and told his private secretary John Colville, in November, he thought the threat of invasion was past. He was confident Great Britain could hold its own, given the increase in output, but was realistic about its chances of winning the war without American intervention.

====Lend-Lease====
In September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal, by which 50 American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland. An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere. Churchill&#x27;s good relations with President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes. It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain, without the need for monetary payment. He persuaded Congress that repayment for this costly service would take the form of defending the US. The policy was known as Lend-Lease and was formally enacted on 11 March 1941.

====Operation Barbarossa====
Hitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Churchill had known since April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that the attack was imminent. He had tried to warn Joseph Stalin via the ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but Stalin did not trust Churchill. The night before the attack, already intending to address the nation, Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: &quot;If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil&quot;.

====Atlantic Charter====
In August 1941, Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. On 14 August, they issued the joint statement known as the Atlantic Charter. This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the UN, founded in 1945.

===Pearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944===
====Pearl Harbor and United States entry into the war====
In December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan. With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: &quot;Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.&quot; No meeting took place and there is no record of a response. Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference. This was important for &quot;Europe first&quot;, the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic. The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success. It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway.

On 26 December, Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress but, that night, suffered a heart attack diagnosed by his physician, Sir Charles Wilson, as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks&#x27; bed rest. Churchill insisted he did not need bed rest and journeyed to Ottawa by train where he gave a speech to the Canadian Parliament that included the &quot;some chicken, some neck&quot; line in which he recalled French predictions in 1940 that &quot;Britain alone would have her neck wrung like a chicken&quot;. He arrived home mid-January, having flown from Bermuda to Plymouth in the first transatlantic air crossing by a head of government, to find there was a crisis of confidence in his government and him; he decided to face a vote of confidence in the Commons, which he won easily.

While he was away, the Eighth Army, having relieved the Siege of Tobruk, had pursued Operation Crusader against Rommel&#x27;s forces in Libya, successfully driving them back to a defensive position at El Agheila in Cyrenaica. On 21 January 1942, however, Rommel launched a surprise counter-attack which drove the Allies back to Gazala. Elsewhere, British success in the Battle of the Atlantic was compromised by the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s introduction of its M4 4-rotor Enigma, whose signals could not be deciphered by Bletchley Park for nearly a year. At a press conference in Washington, Churchill had to play down his increasing doubts about the security of Singapore, given Japanese advances.

====Fall of Singapore and loss of Burma====
Churchill already had grave concerns about the quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete. Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, he felt his misgivings were confirmed and said: &quot;(this is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history&quot;. On 11 February the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious &quot;Channel Dash&quot;, a massive blow to British naval prestige. The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill&#x27;s morale to its lowest point of the war.

==== The Bengal Famine ====
Meanwhile, the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942. Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942. A combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943, in which an estimated 2.1–3.8 million people died.

From December 1942, food shortages had prompted senior officials to ask London for grain imports, although the colonial authorities failed to recognise the seriousness of the famine and responded ineptly. Churchill&#x27;s government was criticised for refusing to approve more imports, a policy it ascribed to an acute shortage of shipping. When the British realised the full extent of the famine in September 1943, Churchill ordered the transportation of 130,000 tons of grain and the cabinet agreed to send 200,000 tons by the end of the year. During the last quarter of 1943, 100,000 tons of rice and 176,000 tons of wheat were imported, compared to averages of 55,000 and 54,000 tons respectively earlier in the year.

In October, Churchill wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, charging him with the responsibility of ending the famine. In February 1944, as preparation for Operation Overlord placed greater demands on Allied shipping, Churchill cabled Wavell saying: &quot;I will certainly help you all I can, but you must not ask the impossible&quot;. Grain shipment requests continued to be turned down by the government throughout 1944, and Wavell complained to Churchill in October that &quot;the vital problems of India are being treated by His Majesty&#x27;s Government with neglect, even sometimes with hostility and contempt&quot;. The impact of British policies on the famine death toll remains controversial.

====International conferences in 1942====
On 20 May 1942, the Soviet Foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London to sign a treaty of friendship. Molotov wanted it done on the basis of territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and a twenty-year treaty was formalised, with the question of frontiers placed on hold. Molotov also sought a Second Front in Europe; Churchill confirmed preparations were in progress and made no promises on a date.

Churchill felt pleased with these negotiations. However, Rommel had launched his counter-offensive, &quot;Operation Venice&quot;, to begin the Battle of Gazala on 26 May. The Allies were driven out of Libya and suffered a defeat in the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. Churchill was with Roosevelt when the news reached him, and was shocked by the surrender of 35,000 troops which was, apart from Singapore, &quot;the heaviest blow&quot; he received in the war. The Axis advance was halted at the First Battle of El Alamein in July and the Battle of Alam el Halfa in September. Both sides were exhausted and in need of reinforcements and supplies.

Churchill returned to Washington on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of &quot;Operation Torch&quot; as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commanding officer of the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). Having received the news from North Africa, Churchill obtained shipment from America to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. He returned to Britain on 25 June and had to face another motion of no confidence, this time in his direction of the war, but again he won easily.

In August, despite health concerns, Churchill visited British forces in North Africa, raising morale, en route to Moscow for his first meeting with Stalin. He was accompanied by Roosevelt&#x27;s special envoy Averell Harriman. He was in Moscow 12–16 August and had lengthy meetings with Stalin. Though they got along well personally, there was little chance of real progress given the state of the war. Stalin was desperate for the Allies to open the Second Front in Europe, as Churchill had discussed with Molotov in May, and the answer was the same.

====El Alamein and Stalingrad====
While he was in Cairo in August, Churchill appointed Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck&#x27;s successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, and General Montgomery succeeded him.

As 1942 drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with Allied victories in El Alamein and Stalingrad. Until November, the Allies had been on the defensive, but afterwards, the Germans were. Churchill ordered church bells to be rung throughout Great Britain for the first time since 1940. On 10 November, knowing El Alamein was a victory, he delivered one of his most memorable speeches at Mansion House in London: &quot;This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning&quot;.

====International conferences in 1943====
In January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference. It was attended by General Charles de Gaulle from the Free French Forces. Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of Stalingrad. Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;. From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers. He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for a month. He addressed the Commons on the 11th and became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than a month of convalescence: he moved to Chequers. He returned to work in London on 15 March.

Churchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year, meeting Roosevelt at the third Washington Conference in May and the first Quebec Conference in August. In November, Churchill and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference. The most important conference of the year was 28 November to 1 December at Tehran, where Churchill and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the &quot;Big Three&quot; meetings, preceding those at Yalta and Potsdam. Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading Churchill to commit to opening of second front in western Europe and it was agreed Germany would be divided after the war, but no decisions were made about how. On their way back, Churchill and Roosevelt held a Second Cairo Conference with Turkish president İsmet İnönü, but were unable to gain commitment from Turkey to join the Allies.

Churchill went to Tunis, arriving on 10 December, initially as Eisenhower&#x27;s guest (soon afterwards, Eisenhower took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new SHAEF). Churchill became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain in Tunis, until after Christmas while specialists were drafted in to ensure recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep him company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after two years in the RAF. On 27 December, the party went on to Marrakesh for convalescence. Feeling much better, Churchill flew to Gibraltar on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the . He was back in London on 18 January and surprised MPs by attending Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in the Commons. Since 12 January 1943, when he set off for Casablanca, Churchill had been abroad or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days.

====Invasions of Sicily and Italy====

In the autumn of 1942, after Churchill&#x27;s meeting with Stalin, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe. According to General Mark W. Clark, the Americans admitted a cross-Channel operation in the near future was &quot;utterly impossible&quot;. As an alternative, Churchill recommended &quot;slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean&quot; and persuaded them to invade Sicily and then mainland Italy, after they had defeated the Afrika Korps. After the war, Clark still agreed Churchill&#x27;s analysis was correct, but added that, when the Allies landed at Salerno, they found Italy was &quot;a tough old gut&quot;.

The invasion of Sicily began on 9 July and was completed by 17 August. Churchill was not keen on &quot;Overlord&quot; as he feared an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. He preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called Operation Jupiter for an invasion of Norway. Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. King Victor Emmanuel sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed Marshal Badoglio as prime minister. Badoglio opened negotiations with the Allies which resulted in the Armistice of Cassibile on 3 September. In response, the Germans activated Operation Achse and took control of most of Italy.

Although he still preferred Italy to Normandy as the Allies&#x27; main route into the Third Reich, Churchill was concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and, after the Allies successfully gained their bridgehead at Anzio but still failed to break the stalemate, he caustically said that instead of &quot;hurling a wildcat onto the shore&quot;, the Allied force had become a &quot;stranded whale&quot;. The big obstacle was Monte Cassino and it was not until May 1944 when it was finally overcome, enabling the Allies to advance on Rome, which was taken on 4 June.

====Preparations for D-Day====
The difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to change heart about strategy; when the Anzio stalemate developed after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of &quot;Overlord&quot; and set up meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff. These were attended by Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith. Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry harbours, but was keen to make the most of Allied airpower which by 1944, had become overwhelming. Churchill never lost his apprehension about the invasion, and underwent mood fluctuation as D-Day approached. Jenkins says he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier.

====Need for post-war reform====
Churchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms. The Beveridge Report with its five &quot;Giant Evils&quot; was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid popular acclaim. Even so, Churchill spent most of his focus on the war, and saw reform in terms of tidying up. His attitude was demonstrated in a radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. He was obliged to devote most of it to reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. Colville said Churchill had broadcast &quot;indifferently&quot; and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as &quot;a worn and petulant old man&quot;. In the end, however, it was demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge. Attlee, Bevin and Labour&#x27;s other coalition ministers, were seen as working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate.

===Defeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945===
====D-Day: Allied invasion of Normandy====
Churchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1. His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King. Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June. He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland. That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched. On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour.

====Quebec Conference, September 1944====
Churchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944. They reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise, but de-industrialise. Eden opposed it and was able to persuade Churchill to disown it. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull opposed it and convinced Roosevelt it was infeasible.

====Moscow Conference, October 1944====
At the fourth Moscow conference in October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called &quot;Percentages agreement&quot; in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans. By then, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, &quot;get at cross-purposes in small ways&quot;. He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it. The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria. The United Kingdom and United States would have 90% control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each. In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in &quot;The Second World War&quot;), Soviet authorities denied Stalin had accepted such an &quot;imperialist proposal&quot;.

====Yalta Conference, February 1945====

From 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second &quot;Big Three&quot; event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February. Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland&#x27;s post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for Eastern Europe. Churchill faced criticism for the agreement on Poland. For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as possible in difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support.

Another outcome of Yalta was the so-called Operation Keelhaul. The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones, including prisoners of war, to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European refugees, many of whom were anti-Communist. Keelhaul was implemented between August 1946 and May 1947.

====Area bombing controversy====
On the nights of 13–15 February 1945, 1,200 British and US bombers attacked Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front. The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war. Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll of about 24,000. On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing and sent a memo to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee:

Historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviets who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of Germans who died from Allied raids. Jenkins asks if Churchill was moved more by foreboding than by regret, but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. He adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman&#x27;s use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later. Andrew Marr, quoting Max Hastings, says that Churchill&#x27;s memo was a &quot;calculated political attempt...to distance himself...from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive&quot;.

====VE Day (Victory in Europe Day)====

On 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany&#x27;s surrender. The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night. Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: &quot;God bless you all. This is your victory. In our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this. Everyone, man or woman, has done their best&quot;.

He asked Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said: &quot;No, Winston, this is your day&quot;, and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;. In the evening, Churchill made another broadcast correctly asserting that the defeat of Japan would follow in the coming months.

Later in the month France attempted to put down a nationalist uprising in the Syria. Churchill intervened and on 31 May gave de Gaulle an ultimatum to desist, but this was ignored. In what became known as the Levant Crisis, British forces from Transjordan were mobilised to restore order. The French, outnumbered, had no option but to return to their bases. De Gaulle felt humiliated, and a diplomatic row broke outChurchill reportedly told a colleague that de Gaulle was &quot;a great danger to peace and for Great Britain&quot;.

====Operation Unthinkable====

In May 1945, Winston Churchill commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR, code-named Operation Unthinkable. One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany to impose &quot;the will of the United States and the British Empire&quot; on the Soviets. The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945.

===Caretaker government: May 1945 to July 1945===

With a general election looming, and with Labour ministers refusing to continue the coalition, Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945. Later that day, he accepted the King&#x27;s invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government but sometimes called the caretaker ministry. It contained Conservatives, National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton, but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair&#x27;s Official Liberals. Churchill was formally reappointed on 28 May.

====Potsdam Conference====
Churchill was Great Britain&#x27;s representative at the Potsdam Conference when it opened on 17 July and was accompanied at its sessions by Eden and Attlee. They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for their election counts. After the landslide Labour victory, Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were five days of discussion. Potsdam went badly for Churchill. Eden later described his performance as &quot;appalling&quot;, saying he was unprepared and verbose. Churchill upset the Chinese, exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin, whom he was supposed to be resisting.

====General election, July 1945====

Churchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour. On 4 June, he committed a serious gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require &quot;some form of Gestapo&quot; to enforce its agenda. It backfired and Attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day: &quot;The voice we heard last night was that of Mr Churchill, but the mind was that of Lord Beaverbrook&quot;. Jenkins says that this broadcast was &quot;the making of Attlee&quot;.

Although polling day was 5 July, the results did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect votes of those serving overseas. Clementine and daughter Mary had been at the count in Woodford, Churchill&#x27;s new constituency, and had returned to Downing Street to meet him for lunch. Churchill was unopposed by the major parties in Woodford, but his majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. He anticipated defeat by Labour and Mary later described the lunch as &quot;an occasion of Stygian gloom&quot;. To Clementine&#x27;s suggestion that defeat might be &quot;a blessing in disguise&quot;, Churchill retorted: &quot;At the moment it seems very effectively disguised&quot;.

That afternoon Churchill&#x27;s doctor Lord Moran commiserated with him on the &quot;ingratitude&quot; of the public, to which Churchill replied: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t call it that. They have had a very hard time&quot;. Having lost, despite enjoying personal support amongst the population, he resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Attlee who formed the first majority Labour government. Many reasons have been given for Churchill&#x27;s defeat, key being a widespread desire for reform and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead in peace. Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as prime minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed this would be possible.

==Leader of the Opposition: 1945–1951==
===&quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech===
Churchill continued to lead the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, he was in America from early January to late March. It was on this trip he gave his &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc. Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill declared:

His view was that, though the Soviet Union did not want war with the western Allies, its entrenched position in Eastern Europe had made it impossible for the three great powers to provide the world with a &quot;triangular leadership&quot;. Churchill&#x27;s desire was much closer collaboration between Britain and America. Within the same speech, he called for &quot;a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States&quot;, but emphasised the need for co-operation within the framework of the United Nations Charter.

===European politics===
Churchill was an early proponent of pan-Europeanism, having called for a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; in a 1930 article. He supported the creations of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, but his support was always with the firm proviso that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping.

=== Ireland ===
Having lived in Ireland as a child, Churchill always opposed its partition. As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, he suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government. He was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists. While he was Leader of the Opposition, he told John Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that he still hoped for reunification.

=== 1950 and 1951 Elections ===
Labour won the 1950 general election, but with a much-reduced majority. A fresh election was called the following year and the Conservatives won a majority.

==Prime Minister: 1951–1955==

===Election result and cabinet appointments===

Despite losing the popular vote, the Conservatives won a majority of 17 seats in the October 1951 general election and Churchill became prime minister, remaining in office until his resignation on 5 April 1955. Eden, his eventual successor, was restored to Foreign Affairs. Future prime minister Harold Macmillan was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government with a manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses per year, Churchill&#x27;s only real domestic concern. He achieved the target and, in 1954, was promoted to Minister of Defence.

===Health issues to eventual resignation===
Churchill was nearly 77 when he took office and not in good health following minor strokes. By December 1951, George VI had become concerned about Churchill&#x27;s decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of Eden, but the King had his own health issues and died on 6 February 1952. Churchill developed a friendship with Elizabeth II and, in spring 1953, accepted the Order of the Garter at her request. He was knighted as Sir Winston on 24 April 1953. It was widely expected he would retire after the Queen&#x27;s Coronation in June 1953 but, after Eden became seriously ill, Churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the Foreign Office. Eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and was never completely well again. On the evening of 23 June 1953, Churchill suffered a serious stroke; the matter was kept secret and Churchill went to Chartwell to recuperate. He had recovered by November. He retired in April 1955 and was succeeded by Eden.

===Foreign affairs===

Churchill feared a global conflagration and firmly believed the only way to preserve peace and freedom was friendship and co-operation between Britain and America. He made four official transatlantic visits from January 1952 to July 1954. He enjoyed a good relationship with Truman, but difficulties arose over the planned European Defence Community (EDC), by which Truman hoped to reduce America&#x27;s military presence in West Germany. Churchill wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East, but while Truman expected British military involvement in Korea, he viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism. The Americans recognised the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee government&#x27;s policy of decolonisation. Churchill believed Britain&#x27;s position as a world power depended on the empire&#x27;s continued existence.

Churchill had been obliged to recognise Colonel Nasser&#x27;s revolutionary government of Egypt, which took power in 1952. Much to Churchill&#x27;s dismay, agreement was reached in October 1954 on the phased evacuation of British troops from their Suez base. Britain agreed to terminate its rule in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan by 1956, though this was in return for Nasser&#x27;s abandonment of Egyptian claims over the region. Elsewhere, the Malayan Emergency, a guerrilla war fought by Communist fighters against Commonwealth forces, had begun in 1948 and continued until 1960. Churchill&#x27;s government maintained the military response to the crisis and adopted a similar strategy for the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya (1952–1960).

Churchill was uneasy about the election of Eisenhower as Truman&#x27;s successor. After Stalin died in March 1953, Churchill sought a summit meeting with the Soviets, but Eisenhower refused out of fear the Soviets would use it for propaganda. By July, Churchill was deeply regretting that the Democrats had not been returned. Churchill believed Eisenhower did not fully comprehend the danger posed by the H-bomb and he greatly distrusted Eisenhower&#x27;s Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. Churchill hosted Eisenhower at the Three-Powers Bermuda Conference, with French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel, in December; they met again in June/July 1954 at the White House. In the end, the Soviets proposed a four-power summit, but it did not meet until July 1955, three months after Churchill&#x27;s retirement.

==Later life: 1955–1965==
===Retirement: 1955–1964===
Elizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title. Although publicly supportive, Churchill was privately scathing about Eden&#x27;s handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations.

Churchill remained an MP until he stood down at the 1964 general election. By the time of the 1959 general election, he seldom attended the House of Commons. Despite the Conservative landslide in 1959, his own majority fell by more than 1,000. He spent most of his retirement at Chartwell or at his London home in Hyde Park Gate, and became a habitué of high society at La Pausa on the French Riviera.
In June 1962, aged 87, Churchill had a fall in Monte Carlo and broke his hip. He was flown home to a London hospital where he remained for 3 weeks. Jenkins says Churchill was never the same after this. In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy, acting under authorisation granted by an Act of Congress, proclaimed him an honorary citizen of the United States, but he was unable to attend the White House ceremony. There has been speculation he became very depressed in his final years, but this has been emphatically denied by his secretary Anthony Montague Browne, who was with him for his last 10 years. Montague Browne wrote that he never heard Churchill refer to depression and certainly did not suffer from it.

===Death, funeral and memorials===
Churchill suffered his final stroke on 10 January 1965 and died on 24 January, in his home at 28 Hyde Park Gate, London. Like the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and William Gladstone in 1898, Churchill was given a state funeral. His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days. The funeral ceremony was at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 30 January. Afterwards, the coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon.

Worldwide, numerous memorials have been dedicated to Churchill. His statue in Parliament Square was unveiled by his widow Clementine in 1973 and is one of only twelve in the square. Elsewhere in London, the Cabinet War Rooms have been renamed the Churchill War Rooms. Churchill College, Cambridge, was established as a national memorial to Churchill. In a 2002 BBC poll that attracted 447,423 votes, he was voted the greatest-ever Briton, his nearest rival being Isambard Kingdom Brunel some 56,000 votes behind.

Churchill was the first of only eight people to be granted honorary citizenship of the United States. The United States Navy honoured him in 1999 by naming a as the . Other memorials in North America include the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, where he made the 1946 &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech; Churchill Square in Edmonton, Alberta; and the Winston Churchill Range, a mountain range northwest of Lake Louise, also in Alberta, which was renamed after Churchill in 1956.

==Artist, historian, and writer==

Churchill was a prolific writer. His output included a novel (&quot;Savrola&quot;), two biographies, memoirs, histories, and press articles. Two of his most famous works were his six-volume memoir, &quot;The Second World War&quot;, and the four-volume &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;. In recognition of his &quot;mastery of historical and biographical description&quot; and oratorial output, Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.

He used either &quot;Winston S. Churchill&quot; or &quot;Winston Spencer Churchill&quot; as his pen name to avoid confusion with the American novelist Winston Churchill, whom he had a friendly correspondence with. For many years, he relied on his press articles to assuage his financial worries.

Churchill became an accomplished amateur artist beginning after his resignation from the Admiralty in 1915. Often using the pseudonym &quot;Charles Morin&quot;, he completed hundreds of paintings, many of which are on show in Chartwell and in private collections.

Churchill was an amateur bricklayer, constructing buildings and garden walls at Chartwell. He joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, but was expelled after he rejoined the Conservative Party. He bred butterflies. He was known for his love of animals and always had several pets, mainly cats but also dogs, pigs, lambs, bantams, goats and fox cubs among others. Churchill has been quoted as saying that &quot;Dogs look up to you, cats look down on you. Give me a pig! He looks you in the eye and treats you as an equal&quot;.

==Legacy and assessments==

===&quot;A man of destiny&quot;===
Jenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising:

Churchill always self-confidently believed himself to be &quot;a man of destiny&quot;. Because of this he lacked restraint and could be reckless. His self-belief manifested in his &quot;affinity with war&quot; of which, according to Sebastian Haffner, he exhibited &quot;a profound and innate understanding&quot;. Churchill considered himself a military genius, but that made him vulnerable to failure and Paul Addison says the Gallipoli disaster was &quot;the greatest blow his self-image was ever to sustain&quot;. Jenkins points out, that although Churchill was exhilarated by war, he was never indifferent to the suffering it causes.

===Political ideology===

As a politician, Churchill was perceived by some to have been largely motivated by personal ambition rather than political principle. During his early career, he was often provocative and argumentative to an unusual degree; and his barbed rhetorical style earned him enemies in parliament. On the other hand, he was deemed to be an honest politician who displayed particular loyalty to his family and close friends. Robert Rhodes James said he &quot;lacked any capacity for intrigue and was refreshingly innocent and straightforward&quot;.

Until the outbreak of the Second World War, Churchill&#x27;s approach to politics generated widespread &quot;mistrust and dislike&quot;, largely on account of his two party defections. His biographers have variously categorised him, in terms of political ideology, as &quot;fundamentally conservative&quot;, &quot;(always) liberal in outlook&quot;, and &quot;never circumscribed by party affiliation&quot;. He was nearly always opposed to socialism because of its propensity for state planning and his belief in free markets. The exception was during his wartime coalition when he was reliant upon the support of his Labour colleagues. Churchill had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class, and his response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and his anti-socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists who saw him as a reactionary. His role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of strikers and most members of the Labour movement. Paradoxically, Churchill was supportive of trade unionism, which he saw as the &quot;antithesis of socialism&quot;.

On the other hand, his detractors did not take Churchill&#x27;s domestic reforms into account, for he was in many respects a radical and reformer, but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure, displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a &quot;benevolent paternalist&quot;. Jenkins, himself a senior Labour minister, remarked that Churchill had &quot;a substantial record as a social reformer&quot; for his work in his ministerial career. Similarly, Rhodes James thought that Churchill&#x27;s achievements were &quot;considerable&quot;.

===Imperialism and racial views===
Churchill was a staunch imperialist and monarchist, and consistently exhibited a &quot;romanticised view&quot; of the British Empire and reigning monarch, especially during his last term as premier. Churchill has been described as a &quot;liberal imperialist&quot; who saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples. He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing the British Empire maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies.

According to Addison, Churchill was opposed to immigration from the Commonwealth. Addison makes the point that Churchill opposed anti-Semitism (as in 1904, when he was critical of the proposed Aliens Bill) and argues he would never have tried &quot;to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants, or to persecute minorities&quot;. In the 1920s, Churchill supported Zionism but believed that communism was the product of an international Jewish conspiracy. Although this belief was not unique among politicians, few had his stature, and the article he wrote on the subject was criticised by &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;.

Churchill made disparaging remarks about non-white ethnicities throughout his life. Philip Murphy partly attributes the strength of this vitriol to an &quot;almost childish desire to shock&quot; his inner circle. Churchill&#x27;s response to the Bengal famine was criticised by contemporaries as slow, a controversy later increased by the publication of private remarks made to Secretary for India Leo Amery, in which Churchill allegedly said aid would be inadequate because &quot;Indians [were] breeding like rabbits&quot;. Philip Murphy says that, following the independence of India in 1947, Churchill adopted a pragmatic stance towards empire, although he continued to use imperial rhetoric. During his second term as prime minister, he was seen as a moderating influence on Britain&#x27;s suppression of armed insurgencies in Malaya and Kenya; he argued that ruthless policies contradicted British values and international opinion.

==Cultural depictions==
While biographies by Addison, Gilbert, Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about Churchill, he has been the subject of numerous others. David Freeman counted 62 in English to the end of the 20th century. At a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on 30 November 1954, Churchill&#x27;s 80th birthday, the joint Houses of Parliament presented him with a full-length portrait of himself, painted by Graham Sutherland. Churchill and Clementine reportedly hated it and she had it destroyed.

Biographical films include &quot;Young Winston&quot; (1972), directed by Richard Attenborough and featuring Simon Ward in the title role; &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years&quot; (1981), starring Robert Hardy; &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (2002), starring Albert Finney as Churchill; &quot;Into the Storm&quot; (2009), starring Brendan Gleeson as Churchill; &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; (2017), starring Gary Oldman as Churchill. John Lithgow played Churchill in &quot;The Crown&quot; (2016–2019). Finney, Gleeson, Oldman and Lithgow all won awards for their performances.

==Family==
Churchill married Clementine Hozier in September 1908. They remained married for 57 years until his death. Churchill was aware of the strain his career placed on their marriage. According to Colville, he had an affair in the 1930s with Doris Castlerosse, although this is discounted by Andrew Roberts.

The Churchills&#x27; first child, Diana, was born in July 1909; Randolph, in May 1911. Sarah, was born in October 1914, and Marigold, in November 1918. Marigold died in August 1921, from sepsis. On 15 September 1922, the Churchills&#x27; last child, Mary, was born. Later that month, the Churchills bought Chartwell, which would be their home until Winston&#x27;s death in 1965.

<text>Władysław Stanisław Reymont (; born Rejment; 7 May 1867 – 5 December 1925) was a Polish novelist and the laureate of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature. His best-known work is the award-winning four-volume novel &quot;Chłopi&quot; (&quot;The Peasants&quot;).

Born into an impoverished noble family, Reymont was educated to become a master tailor, but instead worked as a gateman at a railway station and then as an actor in a troupe. His intensive travels and voyages encouraged him to publish short stories, with notions of literary realism. Reymont&#x27;s first successful and widely praised novel was &quot;The Promised Land&quot; from 1899, which brought attention to the bewildering social inequalities, poverty, conflictive multiculturalism and labour exploitation in the industrial city of Łódź (Lodz). The aim of the novel was to extensively emphasize the consequences of extreme industrialization and how it affects society as a whole. In 1900, Reymont was severely injured in a railway accident, which halted his writing career until 1904 when he published the first part of &quot;Chłopi&quot;.

Władysław Reymont was popular in communist Poland due to his style of writing and the symbolism he used, including socialist concepts, romantic portrayal of the agrarian countryside and toned criticism of capitalism, all present in literary realism. His work is widely attributed to the Young Poland movement, which featured decadence and literary impressionism.

==Surname==
Reymont&#x27;s baptism certificate gives his birth name as Stanisław Władysław Rejment. The change of surname from &quot;Rejment&quot; to &quot;Reymont&quot; was made by the author himself during his publishing debut, as it was supposed to protect him, in the Russian sector of partitioned Poland, from any potential trouble for having already published in Austrian Galicia a work not allowed under the Tsar&#x27;s censorship. Kazimierz Wyka, an enthusiast of Reymont&#x27;s work, believes that the alteration could also have been intended to remove any association with the word &quot;rejmentować&quot;, which in some local Polish dialects means &quot;to swear&quot;.

==Life==
Reymont was born in the village of Kobiele Wielkie, near Radomsko, as one of the nine children of Józef Rejment, an organist. His mother, Antonina Kupczyńska, had a talent for story-telling. She descended from the impoverished Polish nobility from the Kraków region. Reymont spent his childhood in Tuszyn, near Łódź, to which his father had moved to work at a wealthier church parish. Reymont was defiantly stubborn; after a few years of education in the local school, he was sent by his father to Warsaw into the care of his eldest sister and her husband to teach him his vocation. In 1885, after passing his examinations and presenting &quot;a tail-coat, well-made&quot;, he was given the title of journeyman tailor, his only formal certificate of education.

To his family&#x27;s annoyance, Reymont did not work a single day as a tailor. Instead, he first ran away to work in a travelling provincial theatre and then returned in the summer to Warsaw for the &quot;garden theatres&quot;. Without a penny to his name, he then returned to Tuszyn after a year, and, thanks to his father&#x27;s connections, he took up employment as a gateman at a railway crossing near Koluszki for 16 rubles a month. He ran away twice more: in 1888 to Paris and London as a medium with a German spiritualist and then again to join a theatre troupe. After his lack of success (he was not a talented actor), he returned home again. Reymont also stayed for a time in Krosnowa near Lipce and for a time considered joining the Pauline Order in Częstochowa. He also lived in Kołaczkowo, where he bought a mansion.

==Work==
When his &quot;Korespondencje&quot; (&quot;Correspondence&quot;) from Rogów, Koluszki and Skierniewice was accepted for publication by &quot;Głos&quot; (&quot;The Voice&quot;) in Warsaw in 1892, he returned to Warsaw, with several unpublished short stories and just a few rubles. Reymont visited the editorial offices of newspapers and magazines, and eventually met other writers who became interested in his talent including Świętochowski. In 1894 he went on an eleven-day pilgrimage to Częstochowa and turned his experience there into a report entitled &quot;Pielgrzymka do Jasnej Góry&quot; (Pilgrimage to the Luminous Mount) published in 1895, and considered his classic example of travel writing.

Rejmont sent his short stories to different magazines and, encouraged by good reviews, decided to write novels: &quot;Komediantka&quot; (&quot;The Deceiver&quot;) (1895) and &quot;Fermenty&quot; (&quot;Ferments&quot;) (1896). No longer poor, he would soon satisfy his passion for travel, visiting Berlin, London, Paris, and Italy. Then, he spent a few months in Łódź collecting material for a new novel ordered by the &quot;Kurier Codzienny&quot; (&quot;The Daily Courier&quot;) from Warsaw. The earnings from this book &quot;Ziemia Obiecana&quot; (&quot;The Promised Land&quot;) (1899) enabled him to go on his next trip to France where he socialized with other exiled Poles (Jan Lorentowicz, Żeromski, Przybyszewski and Lucjan Rydel).

His earnings did not allow for this kind of life of travel. However, in 1900 he was awarded 40,000 rubles in compensation from the Warsaw-Vienna Railway after an accident in which Reymont was severely injured. During the treatment he was looked after by Aurelia Szacnajder Szabłowska, whom he married in 1902, having first paid for the annulment of her earlier marriage. Thanks to her discipline, he marginally restrained his travel-mania, but never gave up either his stays in France (where he partly wrote &quot;Chłopi&quot; between 1901 and 1908) or in Zakopane. Rejmont also journeyed to the United States in 1919 at the (Polish) government&#x27;s expense. Despite his ambitions to become a landowner, which led to an unsuccessful attempt to manage an estate he bought in 1912 near Sieradz, the life of the land proved not to be for him. He would later buy a mansion in Kołaczkowo near Poznań in 1920, but still spent his winters in Warsaw or France.

==Nobel Prize==

In November 1924 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature over rivals Thomas Mann, George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Hardy, after he had been nominated by Anders Österling, member of the Swedish Academy. Public opinion in Poland supported this recognition for Stefan Żeromski, but the prize went to the author of &quot;Chłopi&quot;. Żeromski was reportedly refused for his allegedly anti-German sentiments. However, Reymont could not take part in the award ceremony in Sweden due to a heart condition. The award and the check for 116,718 Swedish kronor were sent to Reymont in France, where he was being treated.

In 1925, somewhat recovered, he went to a farmers&#x27; meeting in Wierzchosławice near Kraków, where Wincenty Witos welcomed him as a member of the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; and praised his writing skills. Soon afterward, Reymont&#x27;s health deteriorated. He died in Warsaw in December 1925 and was buried in the Powązki Cemetery. The urn holding his heart was laid in a pillar of the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw.

Reymont&#x27;s literary output includes about 30 extensive volumes of prose. There are works of reportage: &quot;Pielgrzymka do Jasnej Góry&quot; (&quot;Pilgrimage to Jasna Góra&quot;) (1894), &quot;Z ziemi chełmskiej&quot; (&quot;From the Chełm Lands&quot;) (1910 – about the persecutions of the Uniates), &quot;Z konstytucyjnych dni&quot; (&quot;From the Days of the Constitution&quot;) (about the revolution of 1905). Also, there are some sketches from the collection &quot;Za frontem&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Front&quot;) (1919) and numerous short stories on life in the theatre and the village or on the railway: &quot;Śmierć&quot; (&quot;Death&quot;) (1893), &quot;Suka&quot; (&quot;Bitch&quot;) (1894), &quot;Przy robocie&quot; (&quot;At Work&quot;) and &quot;W porębie&quot; (&quot;In the Clearing&quot;) (1895), &quot;Tomek Baran&quot; (1897), &quot;Sprawiedliwie&quot; (&quot;Justly&quot;) (1899) and a sketch for a novel &quot;Marzyciel&quot; (&quot;Dreamer&quot;) (1908). There are also novels: &quot;Komediantka&quot;, &quot;Fermenty&quot;, &quot;Ziemia obiecana&quot;, &quot;Chłopi&quot;, &quot;Wampir&quot; (&quot;The Vampire&quot;) (1911), which were sceptically received by the critics, and a trilogy written in the years 1911–1917: &quot;Rok 1794&quot; (&quot;1794&quot;) (&quot;Ostatni Sejm Rzeczypospolitej&quot;, &quot;Nil desperandum&quot; and &quot;Insurekcja&quot;) (&quot;The Last Parliament of the Commonwealth&quot;, &quot;Nil desperandum&quot; and &quot;Insurrection&quot;).

==Major books==

Critics admit a number of similarities between Reymont and the Naturalists. They stress that this was not a &quot;borrowed&quot; Naturalism but rather a record of life as experienced by the writer. Moreover, Reymont never formulated an aesthetic of his writing. In that, he resembled other Polish autodidacts such as Mikołaj Rej and Aleksander Fredro. With little higher education and inability to read another language, Reymont realized that it was his knowledge of grounded reality, not literary theory, that was his strong suit.

His novel &quot;Komediantka&quot; paints the drama of a rebellious girl from the provinces who joins a traveling theatre troupe and finds, instead of escape from the mendacity of her native surroundings, a nest of intrigue and sham. In &quot;Fermenty&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Komediantka&quot;, the heroine, rescued after a suicide attempt, returns to her family and accepts the burden of existence. Aware that dreams and ideas do not come true, she marries a &quot;nouveau riche&quot; who is in love with her.

&quot;Ziemia Obiecana&quot; (&quot;The Promised Land&quot;), possibly Reymont&#x27;s best-known novel, is a social panorama of the city of Łódź during the industrial revolution, full of dramatic detail, presented as an arena of the struggle for survival. In the novel, the city destroys those who accept the rules of the &quot;rat race&quot;, as well as those who do not. The moral gangrene equally affects the three main characters, a German, a Jew, and a Pole. This dark vision of cynicism, illustrating the bestial qualities of men and the law of the jungle, where ethics, noble ideas and holy feelings turn against those who believe in them, are, as the author intended, at the same time a denunciation of industrialisation and urbanisation.

&quot;Ziemia Obiecana&quot; has been translated into at least 15 languages and two film adaptations—one in 1927, directed by A. Węgierski and A. Hertz, the other, in 1975, directed by Andrzej Wajda.

In &quot;Chłopi&quot;, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. It is authentic and written in the local dialect. Reymont uses dialect in dialogues and in narration, creating a kind of a universal language of Polish peasants. Thanks to this, he presents the colourful reality of the &quot;spoken&quot; culture of the people better than any other author. He set the action in Lipce, a real village which he came to know during his work on the railway near Skierniewice, and restricted the time of events to ten months in the unspecified &quot;now&quot; of the 19th century. It is not history that determines the rhythm of country life, but the &quot;unspecified time&quot; of eternal returns. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality.

The titles of the volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality. It is easy to point to moments of Naturalism (e.g., some erotic elements) or to illustrative motives characteristic of Symbolism. It is equally easy to prove the Realistic values of the novel. None of the &quot;isms&quot; however, would be enough to describe it. The novel was filmed twice (directed by E. Modzelewski in 1922 and by J. Rybkowski in 1973) and has been translated into at least 27 languages.

==&quot;Revolt&quot;==

Reymont&#x27;s last book, &quot;Bunt&quot; (&quot;Revolt&quot;), serialized in 1922 and published in book form in 1924, describes a revolt by animals which take over their farm in order to introduce &quot;equality&quot;. The revolt quickly degenerates into abuse and bloody terror.

The story was a metaphor for the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and was banned from 1945 to 1989 in communist Poland, along with George Orwell&#x27;s similar novella, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (published in Britain in 1945). Reymont&#x27;s novel was reprinted in Poland in 2004.

<text>William Castle DeVries (born December 19, 1943) is an American cardiothoracic surgeon, mainly known for the first transplant of a TAH (total artificial heart) using the Jarvik-7 model.

==Early years and medical school==
William DeVries was born December 19, 1943, in Brooklyn Navy Yard. His father, Henry DeVries, was a Dutch immigrant who died in combat on the destroyer in 1944 during the Battle of Hollandia, where he had enrolled as a naval surgeon. When his father died William was only six months old. He was raised by his grandmother and his mother who was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until he was five. After his mother remarried, the family was enlarged by eight more children and they all moved to Ogden, Utah, where he attended Ben Lomond High School and where he was an athlete being on the basketball and track teams. During his childhood DeVries became an Eagle Scout. Because the family was meeting financial difficulties, William had to work throughout his high school years to help out. He also won the Utah state finals in high jumping and thanks to his sport abilities he went to the University of Utah on a track scholarship. During college he was part of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He graduated in 1966 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in molecular and Genetic biology. Later on he went to medical school also at the University of Utah and received his M.D. degree in 1970.

By the time he had finished with school, he had already built a family. He married his first wife, Ane Karen, during the last year of college and had four children. During college he was able to hold down three or four jobs and yet he graduated top of his class and received the award for the most outstanding graduate.

It was thanks to one of the jobs that he was involved in surgery. He assisted doctor Willem Johan Kolff during his work and during night he was paid to watch over the animals in the lab.
In 1969 after some advice from doctor Keith Reemtsma, he decided to leave Salt Lake City and to start his residency in another hospital. That is also the year in which doctor Denton Cooley attempted his first artificial heart transplant in a patient, in Houston. Doctor Cooley&#x27;s work would be an inspiration for doctor DeVries, who would later succeed in the transplant of the TAH. After he left Utah, he attended a series of job interviews. The first one was at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The day of the interview, on his way to the hospital, he witnessed a person being stabbed by another man, and helped the victim until he was carried to the emergency room. This episode was probably one of the reasons why he decided not to start his residency in Boston. The second interview he attended was at the Johns Hopkins hospital, but eventually he opted for a residency at the Duke University in North Carolina. At the end of his nine years surgical training, he headed back to Salt Lake City.

==The artificial heart==
In 1979 Doctor DeVries went back to the University of Utah to become the chairman of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery; there, he used to perform two to five open-heart operations a week. At that time the university was known for being one of the country&#x27;s few pioneering centers for advanced surgery on vital organs and their transplanting and implanting into animals and humans. In Salt Lake City he worked with doctor Robert Jarvik and doctor Kolff. By the time DeVries was back to Salt Lake City, the calves with artificial heart were able to live up to six, seven, even eight months. These results inspired him to take on with the work and so he started a series of long-term animal experiments. After two years of experiments, doctor DeVries and his colleagues tried to obtain the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) approval. At the beginning, nobody really paid much consideration to the work, but after a while it started to acquire new attention, things changed, and even the NIH started to be interested in the project. Therefore, DeVries started to look for a suitable patient for the first attempt. In 1982, the FDA gave the approval to experiment the device on a human, and so a panel of six members at the University of Utah Medical Center started searching for a patient. The group was composed of two cardiologists, a psychiatrist, a nurse, a social worker and DeVries; the decision had to be unanimous.

==The first patient==
The first patient was a Seattle dental surgeon named Barney Clark, affected with an end-stage congestive heart failure. The seven-hour surgery was carried out on December 2, 1982, and it was successful. Doctor William DeVries, 38 years old at that time, was known to listen occasionally to rock music while performing surgery. In his first Jarvik-7 implant the operating room was hushed, except for the voice communications to the medical team and the quietly played strains of Joseph-Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. The patient lived, but DeVries found much harder to manage the device on a patient rather than on a healthy animal. This carried to some complications which led part of the researchers to ask DeVries to turn off the device. In fact they did not want to lose the NIH approval and consequently their funds. DeVries refused to shut down the device, this caught the attention of the media, and made DeVries achieve the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine (December 10, 1984). Eventually, they had to deal with the issue of money. To keep Mr. Clark alive, he decided to sell the rights of his story to a newspaper for $1 million . Mr. Clark lived for 112 days after the surgery, as complications kept occurring and this led to multiorgan failure and eventually death. Unfortunately Mr. Clark never recovered well enough to leave the hospital. In this period DeVries and his team had to face a series of issues due to the pressure of the media and the public. He was constantly obsessed with critics and legal issues concerning about what he was doing whether it was right or wrong. With the success of the first patient, DeVries wanted to go on with his trials, but there were not enough funds and medical insurance was never going to pay for such an experimental transplant. Consequently, DeVries found himself on a quest for fund raising, which, at the beginning did not succeed until Wendell Cherry, vice chairman of the Humana Inc. offered him to relocate in Louisville, Kentucky; in exchange Cherry offered to finance the next 100 implants.

===The Jarvik-7===
The Jarvik-7 was a mechanical device, made of polyurethane and aluminium, which was used to replace the two ventricles of a human heart.

The pumping action came from air, compressed by an electrical unit located outside of the patient&#x27;s body. The human-made organ had two separate ventricles grafted with Dacron sleeves to the native atria and great vessels. It was powered by a 400-pound (180 kg) air compressor, connected to the heart, through a tube coming out of the patient body. In order to give the patients the ability to move, it was also invented a portable power console which was the size of a briefcase. Since 1982, 350 patients have used the Jarvik-7 heart model, and its original design is still used for the modern Jarvik-7, although due to propriety passages the device name is now &quot;SynCardia&quot;. In October 2004, the Jarvik-7 model was the first medical device to receive a full-FDA approval.

==In Louisville, Kentucky==
After the offer from Wendell Cherry, DeVries decided to move to Louisville in order to continue with his work on the TAH although he knew that the reason why the Humana Inc. had given him such a generous offer was mainly due to the publicity that this project was to offer them. &quot;Our name is now on every single newspaper in the world. This is the type of advertisement that you cannot buy. As far as I am concerned, you have made your money for the next hundred patients&quot; (Wendell Cherry). And even knowing this, DeVries accepted the deal because it was for medical advancement.

Bill Schroeder was his second candidate. The patient survived through the surgery, and initially did so well that when president Ronald Reagan phoned him, a week after the implant, he asked why his social security check was late. Unfortunately two weeks later mister Schroeder suffered of a series of infections and strokes that left him unable to speak. He lived for 620 days after the operation, during which he was able to leave the hospital and do a series of normal activities like traveling, attending a basketball game and even fishing. Over the following years DeVries implanted a total of four artificial-hearts, and always had someone with a TAH in his facility.

Thanks to his work, the TAH was used in many hospitals, not as a permanent solution for diseased heart patient, but as a &quot;bridge&quot; in order to assist the heart and wait for a final transplant.

In 1983, DeVries received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

During 1987, 49 diseased hearts had been substituted by surgeons all over the world with a Jarvik-7 model. In January 1988 DeVries was close to performing his fifth implantation, when a human donor heart was found for the patient. In January 1990 the approval was withdrawn, and the FDA ended the program. Before his retirement, in 1999, doctor DeVries decided, in 1988, to go back to traditional cardiovascular surgery. On December 29, 2000, he joined the United States Army Reserve as a lieutenant colonel, becoming at age 57 one of the oldest people to enter and complete the Officer Basic Course. After completion of that course, he was stationed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C. teaching surgical residents there and medical students from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and the George Washington University School of Medicine.

Collections of DeVries papers are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Media attention==
Throughout his career, DeVries had to face a series of philosophical, religious, and practical objections to the artificial heart program. The media attention to the first implant was the largest ever directed to a medical case. Never before had a medical innovation aroused such a contentious debate. Throughout the time between the implant and the death of Barney Clark, the media followed the case so intensively that teams of reporters and television crews besieged the medical center, hankering for information on the patient. Criticism came not only from the medical world, but also from the public. Indeed, many people were disturbed by the idea of replacing the heart, considering it to have special and emotional meanings which could not be substituted by any human-made machine. The question asked by Una Loy, the wife of Barney Clark, is an example of this skepticism. Before her husband underwent surgery, she asked the doctor if after the transplant her husband would still be able to love her. Many were also disturbed by the fact that Clark was never able to leave the hospital. His life was extended somewhat, but he spent it in bed. The New York Times questioned whether the artificial heart research was useful or just a &quot;Dracula&quot; sucking funds away from other programs. DeVries felt that all this attention was slowing his work in Utah, and so decided to leave Salt Lake City for a position in Louisville.
Thanks to the Humana Inc. funds, DeVries implanted another artificial heart at the Humana Human Heart Institute International in a patient called Bill Schroeder. The whole case was followed by the media, and DeVries and the Humana were accused of publicity seeking; &quot;Life&quot; magazine called it &quot;the Bill Schroeder&#x27;s show&quot;. After the death of DeVries&#x27; second patient, the critics began to charge that the mechanical heart brought more complications than benefits. In fact, both Clark and Schroeder never fully recovered from the surgery and eventually died due to complications. DeVries felt that the best way to concede the dilemma was to have people understand that the TAH was not a permanent solution but just a temporary substitution for a diseased heart.

<doc id="33270" wikidata="Q471169" url="?curid=33270" title="When Harry Met Sally...">
<text>When Harry Met Sally... is a 1989 American romantic comedy film directed by Rob Reiner and written by Nora Ephron. Starring Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, and Bruno Kirby, it follows the title characters from the time they meet in Chicago and share a drive to New York City through twelve years of chance encounters in New York, and addresses the question &quot;Can men and women ever just be friends?&quot;

Ideas for the film began when Reiner and Penny Marshall divorced. An interview Ephron conducted with Reiner provided the basis for Harry. Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends. Crystal came on board and made his own contributions to the screenplay. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. The soundtrack consists of standards from Harry Connick Jr., with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. For his work on the soundtrack, Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.

Columbia Pictures released &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; in selected cities, letting word of mouth generate interest, before gradually expanding distribution. The film grossed $92.8 million in North America, and was released to critical acclaim. Ephron received a British Academy Film Award, an Oscar nomination, and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for her screenplay. The film is ranked 23rd on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. In early 2004, the film was adapted for the stage in a production starring Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright graduate from the University of Chicago. Harry is dating Sally&#x27;s friend Amanda Reese, leading to Harry and Sally ride-sharing to New York City. Sally is attending journalism school there and Harry has a job waiting.

During the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; Sally disagrees with Harry&#x27;s assertion that men and women cannot be friends as &quot;the sex part gets in the way&quot;. They stop at a diner, and when Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, she angrily accuses him of making a pass. They part company in New York, never intending to see each other again.

Five years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry&#x27;s neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to Helen, which surprises Sally, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends.

Five years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other at a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe have broken up and Helen has left Harry for another man. They agree to pursue a friendship and have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love lives.

During a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, Harry and Sally find themselves growing attracted to each other and share an awkward midnight kiss. They remain friends and set each other up with their respective best friends, Marie and Jess. When the four go out, neither Marie nor Jess is attracted to Harry or Sally and instead immediately fall for each other. Soon after, the two are engaged.

One night, Sally tearfully calls Harry to say that her ex, Joe, is getting married. Harry goes to Sally&#x27;s apartment to comfort her but they end up having sex. Harry leaves the next morning, feeling awkward and filled with regret. Their friendship cools until they have a heated argument at Jess and Marie&#x27;s wedding reception. Harry attempts to mend their relationship, but Sally feels that they can no longer be friends.

At a 1988 New Year&#x27;s Eve party with Jess and Marie, Sally misses Harry. He is spending New Year&#x27;s Eve at home, watching Dick Clark&#x27;s 16th annual New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve. Before midnight, Harry walks around the city. As Sally is about to leave the party, Harry appears and declares his love for her. She claims he is only there because he is lonely, but he lists the many reasons he loves her. Harry and Sally marry three months later, exactly 12 years and three months after their first meeting.

The film contains several interspersed segments of older couples discussing how they met. The true stories, gathered by Nora Ephron, are reenacted by actors. The final couple interviewed, before the closing credits, is Harry and Sally.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1984, director Rob Reiner, producer Andrew Scheinman, and writer Nora Ephron met over lunch at the Russian Tea Room in New York City to develop a project. Reiner pitched an idea for a film that Ephron rejected. The second meeting transformed into a long discussion about Reiner and Scheinman&#x27;s lives as single men. Reiner remembers, &quot;I was in the middle of my single life. I&#x27;d been divorced for a while. I&#x27;d been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another.&quot; The next time they all met, Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they know it will ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.

For materials, Ephron interviewed Reiner and Scheinman about their lives, creating the basis for Harry. Reiner was constantly depressed and pessimistic yet funny. Ephron also got bits of dialogue from these interviews. Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends. She worked on several drafts over the years while Reiner made &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987). Billy Crystal &quot;experienced vicariously&quot; Reiner&#x27;s (his best friend at the time) return to single life after divorcing comedian/filmmaker Penny Marshall and in the process was unconsciously doing research for the role of Harry. Tom Hanks, Richard Dreyfuss, Michael Keaton and Albert Brooks were all offered the role of Harry Burns but all of them turned it down, with Brooks feeling the movie was too reminiscent of Woody Allen&#x27;s work.

During the screenwriting process when Ephron did not feel like writing, she would interview people who worked for the production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, the scene depicting Sally and Harry in split-screen conversing with each other by telephone and simultaneously watching television and channel surfing was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.

Originally, Ephron wanted to call the film &quot;How They Met&quot; and went through several different titles. Reiner even started a contest with the crew during principal photography: whoever came up with the title won a case of champagne. In order to get into the lonely mindset of Harry when he was divorced and single, Crystal stayed by himself in a separate room from the cast and crew while they were shooting in Manhattan. The script initially ended with Harry and Sally remaining friends and not pursuing a romantic relationship because she felt that was &quot;the true ending&quot;, as did Reiner. Eventually, Ephron and Reiner realized that it would be a more appropriate ending for them to marry, though they admit that this was generally not a realistic outcome. Reiner related that the film originally had a sad ending before he met his second wife Michele, which inspired him to change the ending.

When posed the film&#x27;s central question, can men and women just be friends, Ryan replied, &quot;Yes, men and women can just be friends. I have a lot of platonic (male) friends, and sex doesn&#x27;t get in the way.&quot; Crystal said, &quot;I&#x27;m a little more optimistic than Harry. But I think it is difficult. Men basically act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket. I do have platonic (women) friends, but not best, best, best friends.&quot; Reiner&#x27;s mother Estelle and daughter Tracy both played roles in the film.

===Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen scene===
In a scene featuring the two title characters having lunch at Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen, a well-known Jewish deli in Manhattan, the couple are arguing about a man&#x27;s ability to recognize when a woman is faking an orgasm. Sally claims that men cannot tell the difference, and to prove her point, she vividly (fully clothed) fakes one as other diners watch. The scene ends with Sally casually returning to her meal as a nearby patron (played by Reiner&#x27;s mother) places her order, deadpan: &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having.&quot; When Estelle Reiner died at age 94 in 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to her as the woman &quot;who delivered one of the most memorably funny lines in movie history&quot;. This scene was shot &quot;over and over again&quot;, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours. Katz&#x27;s Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, &quot;Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!&quot;

The memorable scene was born when the film started to focus too much on Harry. Crystal remembers saying, We need something for Sally to talk about,&#x27; and Nora said, &#x27;Well, faking orgasm is a great one,&#x27; and right away we said, &#x27;Well, the subject is good,&#x27; and then Meg came on board and we talked with her about the nature of the idea and she said, &#x27;Well, why don&#x27;t I just fake one, just do one? Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant, and it was Crystal who came up with the scene&#x27;s classic punchline – &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having.&quot; In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines. Reiner recalls that at a test screening, all of the women in the audience were laughing while all of the men were silent.

In late 2013, Improv Everywhere, the New York City initiative behind the annual No Pants Day in the subways and various flash-mob stunts, convened and filmed a re-enactment in Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen. While a look-alike couple performed the scene, 30 others joined as if it was contagious. Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation. The film and follow-up interviews are public. In October of the same year, Katz&#x27;s invited Baron Von Fancy to display his ten-foot-high mural quoting the famous line in its pop-up gallery next door, The Space.

In February 2025, Ryan and Crystal recreated the scene as part of an advert for Hellmann&#x27;s mayonnaise which aired during Super Bowl LIX. The &quot;I&#x27;ll have what she&#x27;s having&quot; line was delivered by Sydney Sweeney.

==Soundtrack==

The &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; soundtrack album features American singer and pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, was a friend of Reiner&#x27;s and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a tape of the musician&#x27;s music. Reiner was struck by Connick&#x27;s voice and how he sounded like a young Frank Sinatra. The movie&#x27;s soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.

Arrangements and orchestrations on &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;, &quot;Where or When&quot;, &quot;I Could Write a Book&quot;, and &quot;But Not for Me&quot; are by Connick and Shaiman. Other songs were performed as piano/vocal solos, or with Connick&#x27;s trio featuring Benjamin Jonah Wolfe on bass and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts on drums. Also appearing on the album are tenor saxophonist Frank Wess and guitarist Jay Berliner. The soundtrack went to #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Traditional Jazz Chart and was within the top 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Connick also toured North America in support of this album. It went on to reach double-platinum status. The soundtrack features performances by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Bing Crosby, and Harry Connick Jr.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Columbia Pictures released &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; using the &quot;platform&quot; technique which involves opening a film in a few select cities then letting word of mouth generate interest before gradually expanding distribution over subsequent weeks. On its opening weekend, the movie grossed $1,094,453 in 41 theatres, the second highest-grossing opening weekend for a film on fewer than 50 screens, behind &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Billy Crystal was worried that the film would flop at the box office because it was up against several summer blockbuster films, like &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;. The film opened in early July and went into wide release on July 21, 1989, grossing $8.8 million in 775 theaters in its first weekend of national release. The film later expanded to 1,174 theaters, and ultimately grossed $92.8 million in North America, well above its $16 million budget.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; holds an approval rating of 89% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Rob Reiner&#x27;s touching, funny film set a new standard for romantic comedies, and he was ably abetted by the sharp interplay between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

The film led Roger Ebert to call Reiner &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s very best directors of comedy&quot;, and said the film was &quot;most conventional, in terms of structure and the way it fulfills our expectations. But what makes it special, apart from the Ephron screenplay, is the chemistry between Crystal and Ryan.&quot;

In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James called &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; an &quot;often funny but amazingly hollow film&quot; that &quot;romanticized lives of intelligent, successful, neurotic New Yorkers&quot;; James characterized it as &quot;the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an uncomfortable sense of &quot;déjà vu&quot;&quot;.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Meg Ryan as the &quot;summer&#x27;s Melanie Griffith – a honey-haired blonde who finally finds a showcase for her sheer exuberance. Neither naif nor vamp, she&#x27;s a woman from a pen of a woman, not some Cinderella of a &quot;Working Girl&quot;.&quot; Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, writing, &quot;Crystal is funny enough to keep Ryan from all-out stealing the film. She, though, is smashing in an eye-opening performance, another tribute to Reiner&#x27;s flair with actors.&quot; David Ansen provided one of the rare negative reviews of the film for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. He criticized the casting of Crystal, &quot;Not surprisingly he handles the comedy superbly, but he&#x27;s too cool and self-protective an actor to work as a romantic leading man&quot;, and felt that as a film, &quot;of wonderful parts, it doesn&#x27;t quite add up&quot;.

** #6 Romantic Comedy Film

==Home media==
&quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; was first released on VHS in late 1989, a few months after its theatrical release. It was later re-released on VHS in 1994 as part of a Billy Crystal collection, and in 1997 under the &quot;Contemporary Classics&quot; edition; the latter release included trailers that were not included in the original VHS release. It was released on DVD for the first time on January 9, 2001, and included an audio commentary by Reiner, a 35-minute &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary featuring interviews with Reiner, Ephron, Crystal, and Ryan, seven deleted scenes, and a music video for &quot;It Had To Be You&quot; by Harry Connick Jr. A Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD was released on January 15, 2008, including a new audio commentary with Reiner, Ephron, and Crystal, eight deleted scenes, all new featurettes (&quot;It All Started Like This&quot;, &quot;Stories Of Love&quot;, &quot;When Rob Met Billy&quot;, &quot;Billy On Harry&quot;, &quot;I Love New York&quot;, &quot;What Harry Meeting Sally Meant&quot;, &quot;So Can Men And Women Really Be Friends?&quot;), and the original theatrical trailer. The film was released on Blu-ray on July 5, 2011, containing all of the special features found on the 2008 DVD release. In 2019, a 30th anniversary Blu-ray was released by Shout! Factory from a new 4K transfer of the original camera negative, containing special features from previous home media releases, as well as a new interview with director Rob Reiner and Billy Crystal. In 2012, critic Linda Holmes observed that significant portions of the soundtrack had been changed for the Amazon digital release.

==Legacy==
Over the years, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; has become &quot;the quintessential contemporary feel-good relationship movie that somehow still rings true&quot;. Before she died, Ephron still received letters from people obsessed with the film and still had &quot;people who say to me all the time, &#x27;I was having a Harry-and-Sally relationship with him or her&#x27;.&quot; The film is 23rd on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it as one of the Top 10 romantic movies of all time. The magazine also ranked it 12th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list. The periodical also ranked it 7th on their 25 Best Romantic Movies of the Past 25 Years list and #3 on their Top 25 Modern Romances list. The film has inspired countless romantic comedies, including &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;, &quot;No Strings Attached&quot;, &quot;Hum Tum&quot;, and &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot;. In addition, the film helped popularize many ideas about love that have become household concepts now, such as the &quot;&quot; girlfriend and the &quot;transitional person&quot;. &quot;You can find traces of &#x27;When Harry Met Sally&#x27; DNA in virtually every romantic comedy that&#x27;s been made since,&quot; The A.V. Club noted.

In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the romantic comedy genre. It is also ranked #15 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 25 Best Romantic Comedies. In early 2004, the film was adapted for the stage in a Theatre Royal Haymarket production starring Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan. Molly Ringwald and Michael Landes later replaced Hannigan and Perry for the second cast. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>William Crossing (1847–1928) was a writer and chronicler of Dartmoor and the lives of its inhabitants. He lived successively in South Brent, Brentor and Mary Tavy but died in Plymouth, Devon.

==Early life==
Crossing was born in Plymouth on 14 November 1847. Early in his youth he was fond of Dartmoor, his early associations centring on the south-west of the moor, in the neighbourhood of Sheepstor, Walkhampton, Meavy, and Yannadon. He acquired a taste for antiquities from his mother. He later went on to explore Tavistock, Coryton, Lydford, Okehampton, and the northern borders of Dartmoor, as well as South Brent, on its southern verge.

After finishing his schooling in Plymouth, he went to the Independent College at Taunton, and then returned to finish his education at the Mannamead School (later called Plymouth College).

His earliest literary efforts were in fiction: &quot;thrilling romances&quot;, composed for the delectation of his schoolfellows. His first essay in poetry was at the age of fourteen, when a poem of his appeared in the pages of &quot;Young England&quot;, December 1861.

In 1863 he went for a short coastal voyage to Wales, and gained a liking for the sea; in 1864 he joined a vessel bound for Canada, and had a narrow escape, nearly being crushed by an iceberg during the night. Returning from this voyage, he took to business pursuits in Plymouth, and then recommenced his Dartmoor explorations.

==Later life and writings==
In 1872 he married and settled down at South Brent. In 1871 he had begun making notes about his rambles, but without any systematic arrangement; after his marriage he seems to have become more methodical, and to have decided to write a book descriptive of the moorland district. He published numerous other works in the 1890s, and his &quot;Guide to Dartmoor&quot;, illustrated by Philip Guy Stevens, in 1909. He was much afflicted by rheumatism in the last 25 years of his life, and in 1921 his wife died. From July 1925 to his death Crossing was an invalid. He died at Plymouth, 3 September 1928.

He is now considered one of the best authorities on Dartmoor and its antiquities, having made it the subject of his life&#x27;s work. He was one of the earliest members of the Dartmoor Preservation Association, joining it immediately on its formation.
 It is quite probable that he effectively started the popularity of the modern pursuit of letterboxing. In his book &quot;Guide to Dartmoor&quot; he refers to what is likely to have been the first letter box. It was placed at Cranmere Pool on northern Dartmoor by a local guide in 1854. In Crossing&#x27;s memory in 1938 a plaque and letterbox were placed at Duck&#x27;s Pool on the southern moor by some individuals and members of a walking club known as Dobson&#x27;s Moormen. He was buried with his wife at Mary Tavy: his house at Mary Tavy bears a commemorative tablet unveiled in 1952.

The style of Crossing&#x27;s work in &quot;Guide to Dartmoor&quot; has similarities to the much more recent work of Alfred Wainwright. The hand-drawn sketches of views and rough maps of walks together with the descriptive nature of the walks are like those of the Wainwright guides to the Lake District (see Lakeland Guides).

<text>The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.

If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean. While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpson&#x27;s paradox.

== Examples ==
=== Basic example ===
Given two school with 20 students, one with 30 test grades in each class as follows:

:Morning class = {62, 67, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 89, 93, 98}

:Afternoon class = {81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 90, 90, 90, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99}

The mean for the morning class is 80 and the mean of the afternoon class is 90. The unweighted mean of the two means is 85. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class (20 versus 30); hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):
formula_1

Or, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class. The larger class is given more &quot;weight&quot;:

:formula_2

Thus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the mean average student grade without knowing each student&#x27;s score. Only the class means and the number of students in each class are needed.

=== Convex combination example ===
Since only the &quot;relative&quot; weights are relevant, any weighted mean can be expressed using coefficients that sum to one. Such a linear combination is called a convex combination.

Using the previous example, we would get the following weights:
:formula_3

:formula_4

Then, apply the weights like this:
:formula_5

==Mathematical definition==
Formally, the weighted mean of a non-empty finite tuple of data formula_6,
with corresponding non-negative weights formula_7 is

:formula_8

which expands to:

:formula_9

Therefore, data elements with a high weight contribute more to the weighted mean than do elements with a low weight. The weights may not be negative in order for the equation to work. Some may be zero, but not all of them (since division by zero is not allowed).

The formulas are simplified when the weights are normalized such that they sum up to 1, i.e., formula_10.
For such normalized weights, the weighted mean is equivalently:
:formula_11.
One can always normalize the weights by making the following transformation on the original weights:
:formula_12.

The ordinary mean formula_13 is a special case of the weighted mean where all data have equal weights.

If the data elements are independent and identically distributed random variables with variance formula_14, the &quot;standard error of the weighted mean&quot;, formula_15, can be shown via uncertainty propagation to be:
:formula_16

===Variance-defined weights===

For the weighted mean of a list of data for which each element formula_17 potentially comes from a different probability distribution with known variance formula_18, all having the same mean, one possible choice for the weights is given by the reciprocal of variance:

:formula_19

The weighted mean in this case is:
:formula_20
and the &quot;standard error of the weighted mean (with inverse-variance weights)&quot; is:
:formula_21

Note this reduces to formula_22 when all formula_23.
It is a special case of the general formula in previous section,
:formula_24

The equations above can be combined to obtain:
:formula_25

The significance of this choice is that this weighted mean is the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean of the probability distributions under the assumption that they are independent and normally distributed with the same mean.

==Statistical properties==
=== Expectancy ===

The weighted sample mean, formula_26, is itself a random variable. Its expected value and standard deviation are related to the expected values and standard deviations of the observations, as follows. For simplicity, we assume normalized weights (weights summing to one).

If the observations have expected values
formula_27
then the weighted sample mean has expectation
formula_28
In particular, if the means are equal, formula_29, then the expectation of the weighted sample mean will be that value,
formula_30

=== Variance ===

==== Simple i.i.d. case ====

When treating the weights as constants, and having a sample of &quot;n&quot; observations from uncorrelated random variables, all with the same variance and expectation (as is the case for i.i.d random variables), then the variance of the weighted mean can be estimated as the multiplication of the unweighted variance by Kish&#x27;s design effect (see proof):

: formula_31

With formula_32, formula_33, and formula_34

However, this estimation is rather limited due to the strong assumption about the &quot;y&quot; observations. This has led to the development of alternative, more general, estimators.

==== Survey sampling perspective ====

From a &quot;model based&quot; perspective, we are interested in estimating the variance of the weighted mean when the different formula_35 are not i.i.d random variables. An alternative perspective for this problem is that of some arbitrary sampling design of the data in which units are selected with unequal probabilities (with replacement).

In Survey methodology, the population mean, of some quantity of interest &quot;y&quot;, is calculated by taking an estimation of the total of &quot;y&quot; over all elements in the population (&quot;Y&quot; or sometimes &quot;T&quot;) and dividing it by the population size – either known (formula_36) or estimated (formula_37). In this context, each value of &quot;y&quot; is considered constant, and the variability comes from the selection procedure. This in contrast to &quot;model based&quot; approaches in which the randomness is often described in the y values. The survey sampling procedure yields a series of Bernoulli indicator values (formula_38) that get 1 if some observation &quot;i&quot; is in the sample and 0 if it was not selected. This can occur with fixed sample size, or varied sample size sampling (e.g.: Poisson sampling). The probability of some element to be chosen, given a sample, is denoted as formula_39, and the one-draw probability of selection is formula_40 (If N is very large and each formula_41 is very small). For the following derivation we&#x27;ll assume that the probability of selecting each element is fully represented by these probabilities. I.e.: selecting some element will not influence the probability of drawing another element (this doesn&#x27;t apply for things such as cluster sampling design).

Since each element (formula_35) is fixed, and the randomness comes from it being included in the sample or not (formula_38), we often talk about the multiplication of the two, which is a random variable. To avoid confusion in the following section, let&#x27;s call this term: formula_44. With the following expectancy: formula_45; and variance: formula_46.

When each element of the sample is inflated by the inverse of its selection probability, it is termed the formula_47-expanded &quot;y&quot; values, i.e.: formula_48. A related quantity is formula_49-expanded &quot;y&quot; values: formula_50. As above, we can add a tick mark if multiplying by the indicator function. I.e.: formula_51

In this &quot;design based&quot; perspective, the weights, used in the numerator of the weighted mean, are obtained from taking the inverse of the selection probability (i.e.: the inflation factor). I.e.: formula_52.

==== Variance of the weighted sum (&quot;pwr&quot;-estimator for totals) ====

If the population size &quot;N&quot; is known we can estimate the population mean using formula_53.

If the sampling design is one that results in a fixed sample size &quot;n&quot; (such as in pps sampling), then the variance of this estimator is:

: formula_54

{N} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y&#x27;_i}{p_i} }{N} \approx \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y&#x27;_i}{\pi_i}}{N} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i y&#x27;_i}{N}. &lt;/math&gt;

The population total is denoted as formula_55 and it may be estimated by the (unbiased) Horvitz–Thompson estimator, also called the &quot;formula_47&quot;-estimator. This estimator can be itself estimated using the &quot;pwr&quot;-estimator (i.e.: formula_49-expanded with replacement estimator, or &quot;probability with replacement&quot; estimator). With the above notation, it is: formula_58.

The estimated variance of the &quot;pwr&quot;-estimator is given by:
formula_59
where formula_60.

The above formula was taken from Sarndal et al. (1992) (also presented in Cochran 1977), but was written differently. The left side is how the variance was written and the right side is how we&#x27;ve developed the weighted version:

formula_61

And we got to the formula from above.

An alternative term, for when the sampling has a random sample size (as in Poisson sampling), is presented in Sarndal et al. (1992) as:

formula_62

With formula_63. Also, formula_64 where formula_65 is the probability of selecting both i and j. And formula_66, and for i=j: formula_67.

If the selection probability are uncorrelated (i.e.: formula_68), and when assuming the probability of each element is very small, then:

: formula_69

) &amp; = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \check{\Delta}_{ij} \check{y}_i \check{y}_j \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \check{\Delta}_{ii} \check{y}_i \check{y}_i \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (1- \pi_i) \frac{y_i}{\pi_i} \frac{y_i}{\pi_i} \right) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( w_i y_i \right)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Variance of the weighted mean (-estimator for ratio-mean) ====

The previous section dealt with estimating the population mean as a ratio of an estimated population total (formula_70) with a known population size (formula_36), and the variance was estimated in that context. Another common case is that the population size itself (formula_36) is unknown and is estimated using the sample (i.e.: formula_37). The estimation of formula_36 can be described as the sum of weights. So when formula_75 we get formula_76. With the above notation, the parameter we care about is the ratio of the sums of formula_35s, and 1s. I.e.: formula_78. We can estimate it using our sample with: formula_79. As we moved from using N to using n, we actually know that all the indicator variables get 1, so we could simply write: formula_80. This will be the estimand for specific values of y and w, but the statistical properties comes when including the indicator variable formula_81.

This is called a Ratio estimator and it is approximately unbiased for &quot;R&quot;.

In this case, the variability of the ratio depends on the variability of the random variables both in the numerator and the denominator - as well as their correlation. Since there is no closed analytical form to compute this variance, various methods are used for approximate estimation. Primarily Taylor series first-order linearization, asymptotics, and bootstrap/jackknife. The Taylor linearization method could lead to under-estimation of the variance for small sample sizes in general, but that depends on the complexity of the statistic. For the weighted mean, the approximate variance is supposed to be relatively accurate even for medium sample sizes. For when the sampling has a random sample size (as in Poisson sampling), it is as follows:

: formula_82.

If formula_83, then either using formula_84 or formula_85 would give the same estimator, since multiplying formula_86 by some factor would lead to the same estimator. It also means that if we scale the sum of weights to be equal to a known-from-before population size &quot;N&quot;, the variance calculation would look the same. When all weights are equal to one another, this formula is reduced to the standard unbiased variance estimator.

{\hat{Z}}&lt;/math&gt;), they can be expanded around the true value R, and give:

formula_87

And the variance can be approximated by:

formula_88.

The term formula_89 is the estimated covariance between the estimated sum of Y and estimated sum of Z. Since this is the covariance of two sums of random variables, it would include many combinations of covariances that will depend on the indicator variables. If the selection probability are uncorrelated (i.e.: formula_90), this term would still include a summation of &quot;n&quot; covariances for each element &quot;i&quot; between formula_91 and formula_92. This helps illustrate that this formula incorporates the effect of correlation between y and z on the variance of the ratio estimators.

When defining formula_93 the above becomes:

formula_94

If the selection probability are uncorrelated (i.e.: formula_90), and when assuming the probability of each element is very small (i.e.: formula_96), then the above reduced to the following:
formula_97

A similar re-creation of the proof (up to some mistakes at the end) was provided by Thomas Lumley in crossvalidated.

We have (at least) two versions of variance for the weighted mean: one with known and one with unknown population size estimation. There is no uniformly better approach, but the literature presents several arguments to prefer using the population estimation version (even when the population size is known). For example: if all y values are constant, the estimator with unknown population size will give the correct result, while the one with known population size will have some variability. Also, when the sample size itself is random (e.g.: in Poisson sampling), the version with unknown population mean is considered more stable. Lastly, if the proportion of sampling is negatively correlated with the values (i.e.: smaller chance to sample an observation that is large), then the un-known population size version slightly compensates for that.

For the trivial case in which all the weights are equal to 1, the above formula is just like the regular formula for the variance of the mean (but notice that it uses the maximum likelihood estimator for the variance instead of the unbiased variance. I.e.: dividing it by n instead of (n-1)).

==== Bootstrapping validation ====

It has been shown, by Gatz et al. (1995), that in comparison to bootstrapping methods, the following (variance estimation of ratio-mean using Taylor series linearization) is a reasonable estimation for the square of the standard error of the mean (when used in the context of measuring chemical constituents):

:formula_98

where formula_99. Further simplification leads to

:formula_100

Gatz et al. mention that the above formulation was published by Endlich et al. (1988) when treating the weighted mean as a combination of a weighted total estimator divided by an estimator of the population size, based on the formulation published by Cochran (1977), as an approximation to the ratio mean. However, Endlich et al. didn&#x27;t seem to publish this derivation in their paper (even though they mention they used it), and Cochran&#x27;s book includes a slightly different formulation. Still, it&#x27;s almost identical to the formulations described in previous sections.

==== Replication-based estimators ====

Because there is no closed analytical form for the variance of the weighted mean, it was proposed in the literature to rely on replication methods such as the Jackknife and Bootstrapping.

==== Other notes ====

For uncorrelated observations with variances formula_101, the variance of the weighted sample mean is
: formula_102
whose square root formula_103 can be called the &quot;standard error of the weighted mean (general case)&quot;.

Consequently, if all the observations have equal variance, formula_104, the weighted sample mean will have variance
: formula_105
where formula_106. The variance attains its maximum value, formula_107, when all weights except one are zero. Its minimum value is found when all weights are equal (i.e., unweighted mean), in which case we have formula_108, i.e., it degenerates into the standard error of the mean, squared.

Because one can always transform non-normalized weights to normalized weights, all formulas in this section can be adapted to non-normalized weights by replacing all formula_109.

==Related concepts==
===Weighted sample variance===
Typically when a mean is calculated it is important to know the variance and standard deviation about that mean. When a weighted mean formula_110 is used, the variance of the weighted sample is different from the variance of the unweighted sample.

The &quot;biased&quot; weighted sample variance formula_111 is defined similarly to the normal &quot;biased&quot; sample variance formula_112:

:formula_113
where formula_114 for normalized weights. If the weights are &quot;frequency weights&quot; (and thus are random variables), it can be shown that formula_111 is the maximum likelihood estimator of formula_14 for iid Gaussian observations.

For small samples, it is customary to use an unbiased estimator for the population variance. In normal unweighted samples, the &quot;N&quot; in the denominator (corresponding to the sample size) is changed to &quot;N&quot; − 1 (see Bessel&#x27;s correction). In the weighted setting, there are actually two different unbiased estimators, one for the case of &quot;frequency weights&quot; and another for the case of &quot;reliability weights&quot;.

====Frequency weights====
If the weights are &quot;frequency weights&quot; (where a weight equals the number of occurrences), then the unbiased estimator is:

:formula_117

This effectively applies Bessel&#x27;s correction for frequency weights. For example, if values formula_118 are drawn from the same distribution, then we can treat this set as an unweighted sample, or we can treat it as the weighted sample formula_119 with corresponding weights formula_120, and we get the same result either way.

If the frequency weights formula_121 are normalized to 1, then the correct expression after Bessel&#x27;s correction becomes

:formula_122

where the total number of samples is formula_123 (not formula_36). In any case, the information on total number of samples is necessary in order to obtain an unbiased correction, even if formula_86 has a different meaning other than frequency weight.

The estimator can be unbiased only if the weights are not standardized nor normalized, these processes changing the data&#x27;s mean and variance and thus leading to a loss of the base rate (the population count, which is a requirement for Bessel&#x27;s correction).

====Reliability weights====
If the weights are instead &quot;reliability weights&quot; (non-random values reflecting the sample&#x27;s relative trustworthiness, often derived from sample variance), we can determine a correction factor to yield an unbiased estimator. Assuming each random variable is sampled from the same distribution with mean formula_126 and actual variance formula_127, taking expectations we have,

:formula_128

where formula_129 and formula_130. Therefore, the bias in our estimator is formula_131, analogous to the formula_132 bias in the unweighted estimator (also notice that formula_133 is the effective sample size). This means that to unbias our estimator we need to pre-divide by formula_134, ensuring that the expected value of the estimated variance equals the actual variance of the sampling distribution. The final unbiased estimate of sample variance is:
:formula_135
where formula_136. The degrees of freedom of this weighted, unbiased sample variance vary accordingly from &quot;N&quot; − 1 down to 0. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance above.

As a side note, other approaches have been described to compute the weighted sample variance.

===Weighted sample covariance===
In a weighted sample, each row vector formula_137 (each set of single observations on each of the &quot;K&quot; random variables) is assigned a weight formula_138.

Then the weighted mean vector formula_139 is given by

:formula_140

And the weighted covariance matrix is given by:

:formula_141

Similarly to weighted sample variance, there are two different unbiased estimators depending on the type of the weights.

====Frequency weights====
If the weights are &quot;frequency weights&quot;, the &quot;unbiased&quot; weighted estimate of the covariance matrix formula_142, with Bessel&#x27;s correction, is given by:

:formula_143

This estimator can be unbiased only if the weights are not standardized nor normalized, these processes changing the data&#x27;s mean and variance and thus leading to a loss of the base rate (the population count, which is a requirement for Bessel&#x27;s correction).

==== Reliability weights ====
In the case of &quot;reliability weights&quot;, the weights are normalized:
: formula_144

(If they are not, divide the weights by their sum to normalize prior to calculating formula_145:

: formula_146

Then the weighted mean vector formula_139 can be simplified to

:formula_148

and the &quot;unbiased&quot; weighted estimate of the covariance matrix formula_149 is:

:formula_150

The reasoning here is the same as in the previous section.

Since we are assuming the weights are normalized, then formula_151 and this reduces to:

: formula_152

If all weights are the same, i.e. formula_153, then the weighted mean and covariance reduce to the unweighted sample mean and covariance above.

===Vector-valued estimates===
The above generalizes easily to the case of taking the mean of vector-valued estimates. For example, estimates of position on a plane may have less certainty in one direction than another. As in the scalar case, the weighted mean of multiple estimates can provide a maximum likelihood estimate. We simply replace the variance formula_14 by the covariance matrix formula_155 and the arithmetic inverse by the matrix inverse (both denoted in the same way, via superscripts); the weight matrix then reads:

formula_156

The weighted mean in this case is:
formula_157
(where the order of the matrix–vector product is not commutative), in terms of the covariance of the weighted mean:
formula_158

For example, consider the weighted mean of the point [1 0] with high variance in the second component and [0 1] with high variance in the first component. Then

: formula_159
: formula_160

then the weighted mean is:

: formula_161

which makes sense: the [1 0] estimate is &quot;compliant&quot; in the second component and the [0 1] estimate is compliant in the first component, so the weighted mean is nearly [1 1].

===Accounting for correlations===

In the general case, suppose that formula_162, formula_155 is the covariance matrix relating the quantities formula_17, formula_26 is the common mean to be estimated, and formula_166 is a design matrix equal to a vector of ones formula_167 (of length formula_168). The Gauss–Markov theorem states that the estimate of the mean having minimum variance is given by:
:formula_169
and
:formula_170

where:

:formula_171

===Decreasing strength of interactions===

Consider the time series of an independent variable formula_172 and a dependent variable formula_173, with formula_168 observations sampled at discrete times formula_175. In many common situations, the value of formula_173 at time formula_175 depends not only on formula_17 but also on its past values. Commonly, the strength of this dependence decreases as the separation of observations in time increases. To model this situation, one may replace the independent variable by its sliding mean formula_179 for a window size formula_180.

:formula_181

===Exponentially decreasing weights===

In the scenario described in the previous section, most frequently the decrease in interaction strength obeys a negative exponential law. If the observations are sampled at equidistant times, then exponential decrease is equivalent to decrease by a constant fraction formula_182 at each time step. Setting formula_183 we can define formula_180 normalized weights by
: formula_185
where formula_145 is the sum of the unnormalized weights. In this case formula_145 is simply
: formula_188
approaching formula_189 for large values of formula_180.

The damping constant formula_191 must correspond to the actual decrease of interaction strength. If this cannot be determined from theoretical considerations, then the following properties of exponentially decreasing weights are useful in making a suitable choice: at step formula_192, the weight approximately equals formula_193, the tail area the value formula_194, the head area formula_195. The tail area at step formula_168 is formula_197. Where primarily the closest formula_168 observations matter and the effect of the remaining observations can be ignored safely, then choose formula_191 such that the tail area is sufficiently small.

===Weighted averages of functions===
The concept of weighted average can be extended to functions. Weighted averages of functions play an important role in the systems of weighted differential and integral calculus.

===Correcting for over- or under-dispersion===

Weighted means are typically used to find the weighted mean of historical data, rather than theoretically generated data. In this case, there will be some error in the variance of each data point. Typically experimental errors may be underestimated due to the experimenter not taking into account all sources of error in calculating the variance of each data point. In this event, the variance in the weighted mean must be corrected to account for the fact that formula_200 is too large. The correction that must be made is

:formula_201

where formula_202 is the reduced chi-squared:

:formula_203

The square root formula_204 can be called the &quot;standard error of the weighted mean (variance weights, scale corrected)&quot;.

When all data variances are equal, formula_23, they cancel out in the weighted mean variance, formula_206, which again reduces to the standard error of the mean (squared), formula_207, formulated in terms of the sample standard deviation (squared),
:formula_208

<text>Wystan Hugh Auden (; 21 February 1907 – 29 September 1973) was a British-American poet. Auden&#x27;s poetry is noted for its stylistic and technical achievement, its engagement with politics, morals, love, and religion, and its variety in tone, form, and content. Some of his best known poems are about love, such as &quot;Funeral Blues&quot;; on political and social themes, such as &quot;September 1, 1939&quot; and &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot;; on cultural and psychological themes, such as &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;; and on religious themes, such as &quot;For the Time Being&quot; and &quot;Horae Canonicae&quot;.

Auden was born in York and grew up in and near Birmingham in a professional, middle-class family. He attended various English independent (or public) schools and studied English at Christ Church, Oxford. After a few months in Berlin in 1928–29, he spent five years (1930–1935) teaching in British private preparatory schools. In 1939, he moved to the United States; he became an American citizen in 1946, retaining his British citizenship. Auden taught from 1941 to 1945 in American universities, followed by occasional visiting professorships in the 1950s.

Auden came to wide public attention in 1930 with his first book, &quot;Poems&quot;; it was followed in 1932 by &quot;The Orators&quot;. Three plays written in collaboration with Christopher Isherwood between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation, and his work in the 1940s, including the long poems &quot;For the Time Being&quot; and &quot;The Sea and the Mirror&quot;, focused on religious themes. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1947 long poem &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;, the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era. From 1956 to 1961, he was Professor of Poetry at Oxford; his lectures were popular with students and faculty and served as the basis for his 1962 prose collection &quot;The Dyer&#x27;s Hand&quot;.

Auden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological, and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential. Critical views on his work ranged from sharply dismissive (treating him as a lesser figure than W. B. Yeats and T. S. Eliot) to strongly affirmative (as in Joseph Brodsky&#x27;s statement that he had &quot;the greatest mind of the twentieth century&quot;). After his death, his poems became known to a much wider public through films, broadcasts, and popular media.

==Life==
===Childhood===

Auden was born at 54 Bootham, York, England, to George Augustus Auden (1872–1957), a physician, and Constance Rosalie Auden (née Bicknell; 1869–1941), who had trained (but never served) as a missionary nurse. He was the third of three sons; the eldest, George Bernard Auden (1900–1978), became a farmer, while the second, John Bicknell Auden (1903–1991), became a geologist. The Audens were minor gentry with a strong clerical tradition, originally of Rowley Regis, later of Horninglow, Staffordshire.

Auden, whose grandfathers were both Church of England clergymen, grew up in an Anglo-Catholic household that followed a &quot;high&quot; form of Anglicanism, with doctrine and ritual resembling those of Catholicism. He traced his love of music and language partly to the church services of his childhood. He believed he was of Icelandic descent, and his lifelong fascination with Icelandic legends and Old Norse sagas is evident in his work.

His family moved to Homer Road in Solihull, near Birmingham, in 1908, where his father had been appointed the School Medical Officer and Lecturer (later Professor) of Public Health. Auden&#x27;s lifelong psychoanalytic interests began in his father&#x27;s library. From the age of eight he attended boarding schools, returning home for holidays. His visits to the Pennine landscape and its declining lead-mining industry figure in many of his poems; the remote decaying mining village of Rookhope was for him a &quot;sacred landscape&quot;, evoked in a late poem, &quot;Amor Loci&quot;. Until he was fifteen he expected to become a mining engineer, but his passion for words had already begun. He wrote later: &quot;words so excite me that a pornographic story, for example, excites me sexually more than a living person can do.&quot;

===Education===

Auden attended St Edmund&#x27;s School, Hindhead, Surrey, where he met Christopher Isherwood, later famous in his own right as a novelist. At thirteen he went to Gresham&#x27;s School in Holt, Norfolk; there, in 1922, when his friend Robert Medley asked him if he wrote poetry, Auden first realised his vocation was to be a poet. Soon after, he &quot;discover(ed) that he (had) lost his faith&quot; (through a gradual realisation that he had lost interest in religion, not through any decisive change of views). In school productions of Shakespeare, he played Katherina in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1922, and Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot; in 1925, his last year at Gresham&#x27;s. A review of his performance as Katherina noted that despite a poor wig, he had been able &quot;to infuse considerable dignity into his passionate outbursts&quot;.

His first published poems appeared in the school magazine in 1923. Auden later wrote a chapter on Gresham&#x27;s for Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Old School: Essays by Divers Hands&quot; (1934).

In 1925 he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, with a scholarship in biology; he changed to English by his second year, and was introduced to Old English poetry through the lectures of J. R. R. Tolkien. Friends he met at Oxford include Cecil Day-Lewis, Louis MacNeice, and Stephen Spender – Auden and these three were commonly though misleadingly identified in the 1930s as the &quot;Auden Group&quot; for their shared (but not identical) left-wing views. Auden left Oxford in 1928 with a third-class degree.

Auden was reintroduced to Christopher Isherwood in 1925 by his fellow student A. S. T. Fisher. For the next few years Auden sent poems to Isherwood for comments and criticism; the two maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between their relations with others. In 1935–39 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book.

From his Oxford years onward, Auden&#x27;s friends uniformly described him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while living amidst physical disorder.

===Britain and Europe, 1928–1938===
In late 1928, Auden left Britain for nine months, going to Berlin, perhaps partly as an escape from English repressiveness. In Berlin, he first experienced the political and economic unrest that became one of his central subjects. Around the same time, Stephen Spender privately printed a small pamphlet of Auden&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; in an edition of about 45 copies, distributed among Auden&#x27;s and Spender&#x27;s friends and family; this edition is usually referred to as &quot;Poems&quot; [1928] to avoid confusion with Auden&#x27;s commercially published 1930 volume.

On returning to Britain in 1929 he worked briefly as a tutor. In 1930 his first published book, &quot;Poems&quot; (1930), was accepted by T. S. Eliot for Faber and Faber, and the same firm remained the British publisher of all the books he published thereafter. In 1930, he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys&#x27; schools: two years at the Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh, Scotland, then three years at the Downs School in the Malvern Hills, where he was a much-loved teacher. At the Downs, in June 1933, he experienced what he later described as a &quot;Vision of Agape&quot;, while sitting with three fellow teachers at the school, when he suddenly found that he loved them for themselves, that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience, he said, later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.

During these years Auden&#x27;s erotic interests focused, as he later said, on an idealised &quot;Alter Ego&quot; rather than on individual people. His relationships (and his unsuccessful courtships) tended to be unequal either in age or intelligence; his sexual relations were transient, although some evolved into long friendships. He contrasted these relationships with what he later regarded as the &quot;marriage&quot; (his word) of equals that he began with Chester Kallman in 1939, based on the unique individuality of both partners.

In 1935 Auden married Erika Mann (1905–1969), the bisexual novelist daughter of Thomas Mann, when it became apparent that the Nazis were intending to strip her of her German citizenship. Mann had asked Christopher Isherwood if he would marry her so she could become a British citizen. He declined but suggested she approach Auden, who readily agreed to a marriage of convenience. Mann and Auden never lived together, but remained on good terms throughout their lives and were still married when Mann died in 1969. She left him a small bequest in her will. In 1936, Auden introduced actress Therese Giehse, Mann&#x27;s lover, to the writer John Hampson, and they too married so that Giehse could leave Germany.

From 1935 until he left Britain early in 1939, Auden worked as freelance reviewer, essayist, and lecturer, first with the GPO Film Unit, a documentary film-making branch of the post office, headed by John Grierson. Through his work for the Film Unit in 1935 he met and collaborated with Benjamin Britten, with whom he also worked on plays, song cycles, and a libretto. Auden&#x27;s plays in the 1930s were performed by the Group Theatre, in productions that he supervised to varying degrees.

His work now reflected his belief that any good artist must be &quot;more than a bit of a reporting journalist&quot;. In 1936, Auden spent three months in Iceland where he gathered material for a travel book &quot;Letters from Iceland&quot; (1937), written in collaboration with Louis MacNeice. In 1937, he went to Spain intending to drive an ambulance for the Republic in the Spanish Civil War, but was put to work writing propaganda at the Republican press and propaganda office, where he felt useless and left after a week. He returned to England after a brief visit to the front at Sarineña. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply, and his social views grew more complex as he found political realities to be more ambiguous and troubling than he had imagined. Again attempting to combine reportage and art, he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting China amid the Sino-Japanese War, working on their book &quot;Journey to a War&quot; (1939). On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent late 1938 partly in England, partly in Brussels.

Many of Auden&#x27;s poems during the 1930s and after were inspired by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: &quot;If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me&quot; (&quot;The More Loving One&quot;). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; in a letter to his friend James Stern he called marriage &quot;the &quot;only&quot; subject.&quot; Throughout his life, Auden performed charitable acts, sometimes in public, as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann, but, especially in later years, more often in private. He was embarrassed if they were publicly revealed, as when his gift to his friend Dorothy Day for the Catholic Worker movement was reported on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1956.

===United States and Europe, 1939–1973===
Auden and Isherwood sailed to New York City in January 1939, entering on temporary visas. Their departure from Britain was later seen by many as a betrayal, and Auden&#x27;s reputation suffered. In April 1939, Isherwood moved to California, and he and Auden saw each other only intermittently in later years. Around this time, Auden met the poet Chester Kallman, who became his lover for the next two years (Auden described their relation as a &quot;marriage&quot; that began with a cross-country &quot;honeymoon&quot; journey).

In 1941 Kallman ended their sexual relationship because he could not accept Auden&#x27;s insistence on mutual fidelity, but he and Auden remained companions for the rest of Auden&#x27;s life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden&#x27;s death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.

In 1940–41 Auden lived in a house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn Heights, that he shared with Carson McCullers, Benjamin Britten, and others, which became a famous centre of artistic life, nicknamed &quot;February House&quot;. In 1940, Auden joined the Episcopal Church, returning to the Anglican Communion he had abandoned at fifteen. His reconversion was influenced partly by what he called the &quot;sainthood&quot; of Charles Williams, whom he had met in 1937, and partly by reading Søren Kierkegaard and Reinhold Niebuhr; his existential, this-worldly Christianity became a central element in his life.
After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that he would return to the UK if needed. He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel were needed. In 1941–42 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.

In mid-1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, he was in Germany with the US Strategic Bombing Survey, studying the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return, he settled in Manhattan, working as a freelance writer, a lecturer at The New School for Social Research, and a visiting professor at Bennington, Smith, and other American colleges. In 1946, he became a naturalised citizen of the US.

In 1948 Auden began spending his summers in Europe, together with Chester Kallman, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house. Starting in 1958 he began spending his summers in Kirchstetten, Austria, where he bought a farmhouse with the prize money of the &quot;Premio Feltrinelli&quot; awarded to him in 1957. He said that he shed tears of joy at owning a home for the first time. His later poetry, mostly written in Austria, includes his sequence &quot;Thanksgiving for a Habitat&quot; about his Kirchstetten home. Auden&#x27;s letters and papers sent to his friend the translator Stella Musulin (1915–1996), available online, provide insights into his Austrian years.

In 1956–61 Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University, where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to spend winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark&#x27;s Place in Manhattan&#x27;s East Village, and to spend summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; &quot;The New York Review of Books,&quot; and other magazines.

In 1963 Kallman left the apartment he shared in New York with Auden, and lived during the winter in Athens while continuing to spend his summers with Auden in Austria. Auden spent the winter of 1964-1965 in Berlin through an artist-in-residence program of the Ford Foundation.

Following some years of lobbying by his friend David Luke, Auden&#x27;s old college, Christ Church, in February 1972 offered him a cottage on its grounds to live in; he moved his books and other possessions from New York to Oxford in September 1972, while continuing to spend summers in Austria with Kallman. He spent only one winter in Oxford before his death in 1973.
Auden died at 66 of heart failure at the Altenburgerhof Hotel in Vienna overnight on 28–29 September 1973, a few hours after giving a reading of his poems for the Austrian Society for Literature at the Palais Pálffy. He had intended to return to Oxford the following day. He was buried on 4 October in Kirchstetten, and a memorial stone was placed in Westminster Abbey in London a year later.

==Work==
Auden published about four hundred poems, including seven long poems (two of them book-length). His poetry was encyclopaedic in scope and method, ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as ballads and limericks, from doggerel through haiku and villanelles to a &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; and a baroque eclogue in Anglo-Saxon meters. The tone and content of his poems ranged from pop-song clichés to complex philosophical meditations, from the corns on his toes to atoms and stars, from contemporary crises to the evolution of society.

He also wrote more than four hundred essays and reviews about literature, history, politics, music, religion, and many other subjects. He collaborated on plays with Christopher Isherwood and on opera libretti with Chester Kallman, and worked with a group of artists and filmmakers on documentary films in the 1930s and with the New York Pro Musica early music group in the 1950s and 1960s. About collaboration he wrote in 1964: &quot;collaboration has brought me greater erotic joy . . . than any sexual relations I have had.&quot;

Auden controversially rewrote or discarded some of his most famous poems when he prepared his later collected editions. He wrote that he rejected poems that he found &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;dishonest&quot; in the sense that they expressed views he had never held but had used only because he felt they would be rhetorically effective. His rejected poems include &quot;Spain&quot; and &quot;September 1, 1939&quot;. His literary executor, Edward Mendelson, argues in his introduction to &quot;Selected Poems&quot; that Auden&#x27;s practice reflected his sense of the persuasive power of poetry and his reluctance to misuse it. (&quot;Selected Poems&quot; includes some poems that Auden rejected and early texts of poems that he revised.)

===Early work, 1922–1939===
====Up to 1930====

Auden began writing poems in 1922, at 15, mostly in the styles of 19th-century romantic poets, especially Wordsworth, and later poets with rural interests, especially Thomas Hardy. At 18 he discovered T. S. Eliot and adopted an extreme version of Eliot&#x27;s style. He found his own voice at 20 when he wrote the first poem later included in his collected work, &quot;From the very first coming down&quot;. This and other poems of the late 1920s tended to be in a clipped, elusive style that alluded to, but did not directly state, their themes of loneliness and loss. Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book &quot;Poems&quot; (1928), a pamphlet hand-printed by Stephen Spender.

In 1928 he wrote his first dramatic work, &quot;Paid on Both Sides&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Charade&quot;, which combined style and content from the Icelandic sagas with jokes from English school life. This mixture of tragedy and farce, with a dream play-within-a-play, introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work. This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book &quot;Poems&quot; (1930, 2nd edition with seven poems replaced, 1933); the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic meditations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal, social, and seasonal renewal; among these poems were &quot;It was Easter as I walked&quot;, &quot;Doom is dark&quot;, &quot;Sir, no man&#x27;s enemy&quot;, and &quot;This lunar beauty&quot;.

A recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of &quot;family ghosts&quot;, Auden&#x27;s term for the powerful, unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life (and the title of a poem). A parallel theme, present throughout his work, is the contrast between biological evolution (unchosen and involuntary) and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals (voluntary and deliberate even in its subconscious aspects).

====1931–1935====
Auden&#x27;s next large-scale work was &quot;The Orators: An English Study&quot; (1932; revised editions, 1934, 1966), in verse and prose, largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems, his style became more open and accessible, and the exuberant &quot;Six Odes&quot; in &quot;The Orators&quot; reflect his new interest in Robert Burns. During the next few years, many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs, and also from expansive classical forms like the &quot;Odes&quot; of Horace, which he seems to have discovered through the German poet Hölderlin. Around this time his main influences were Dante, William Langland, and Alexander Pope.

During these years much of his work expressed left-wing views, and he became widely known as a political poet although he was privately more ambivalent about revolutionary politics than many reviewers recognised, and Mendelson argues that he expounded political views partly out of a sense of moral duty and partly because it enhanced his reputation, and that he later regretted having done so. He generally wrote about revolutionary change in terms of a &quot;change of heart&quot;, a transformation of a society from a closed-off psychology of fear to an open psychology of love.

His verse drama &quot;The Dance of Death&quot; (1933) was a political extravaganza in the style of a theatrical revue, which Auden later called &quot;a nihilistic leg-pull.&quot; His next play &quot;The Dog Beneath the Skin&quot; (1935), written in collaboration with Isherwood, was similarly a quasi-Marxist updating of Gilbert and Sullivan in which the general idea of social transformation was more prominent than any specific political action or structure.

&quot;The Ascent of F6&quot; (1937), another play written with Isherwood, was partly an anti-imperialist satire, partly (in the character of the self-destroying climber Michael Ransom) an examination of Auden&#x27;s own motives in taking on a public role as a political poet. This play included the first version of &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; (&quot;Stop all the clocks&quot;), written as a satiric eulogy for a politician; Auden later rewrote the poem as a &quot;Cabaret Song&quot; about lost love (written to be sung by the soprano Hedli Anderson, for whom he wrote many lyrics in the 1930s). In 1935, he worked briefly on documentary films with the GPO Film Unit, writing his famous verse commentary for &quot;Night Mail&quot; and lyrics for other films that were among his attempts in the 1930s to create a widely accessible, socially conscious art.

====1936–1939====
In 1936 Auden&#x27;s publisher chose the title &quot;Look, Stranger!&quot; for a collection of political odes, love poems, comic songs, meditative lyrics, and a variety of intellectually intense but emotionally accessible verse; Auden hated the title and retitled the collection for the 1937 US edition &quot;On This Island&quot;. Among the poems included in the book are &quot;Hearing of harvests&quot;, &quot;Out on the lawn I lie in bed&quot;, &quot;O what is that sound&quot;, &quot;Look, stranger, on this island now&quot; (later revised versions change &quot;on&quot; to &quot;at&quot;), and &quot;Our hunting fathers&quot;.

Auden was now arguing that an artist should be a kind of journalist, and he put this view into practice in &quot;Letters from Iceland&quot; (1937) a travel book in prose and verse written with Louis MacNeice, which included his long social, literary, and autobiographical commentary &quot;Letter to Lord Byron&quot;. In 1937, after observing the Spanish Civil War he wrote a politically engaged pamphlet poem &quot;Spain&quot; (1937); he later discarded it from his collected works. &quot;Journey to a War&quot; (1939) a travel book in prose and verse, was written with Isherwood after their visit to the Sino-Japanese War. Auden&#x27;s last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play, &quot;On the Frontier&quot;, an anti-war satire written in Broadway and West End styles.

Auden&#x27;s shorter poems now engaged with the fragility and transience of personal love (&quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, &quot;The Dream&quot;, &quot;Lay your sleeping head&quot;), a subject he treated with ironic wit in his &quot;Four Cabaret Songs for Miss Hedli Anderson&quot; (which included &quot;Tell Me the Truth About Love&quot; and the revised version of &quot;Funeral Blues&quot;), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives (&quot;Casino&quot;, &quot;School Children&quot;, &quot;Dover&quot;). In 1938, he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure (&quot;Miss Gee&quot;, &quot;James Honeyman&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;). All these appeared in &quot;Another Time&quot; (1940), together with poems including &quot;Dover&quot;, &quot;As He Is&quot;, and &quot;Musée des Beaux Arts&quot; (all of which were written before he moved to America in 1939), and &quot;In Memory of W. B. Yeats&quot;, &quot;The Unknown Citizen&quot;, &quot;Law Like Love&quot;, &quot;September 1, 1939&quot;, and &quot;In Memory of Sigmund Freud&quot; (all written in America).

The elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly anti-heroic statements, in which great deeds are performed, not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate, but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were &quot;silly like us&quot; (Yeats) or of whom it could be said &quot;he wasn&#x27;t clever at all&quot; (Freud), and who became teachers of others, not awe-inspiring heroes.

===Middle period, 1940–1957===
====1940–1946====
In 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem &quot;New Year Letter&quot;, which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in &quot;The Double Man&quot; (1941). At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes, such as &quot;Canzone&quot; and &quot;Kairos and Logos&quot;. Around 1942, as he became more comfortable with religious themes, his verse became more open and relaxed, and he increasingly used the syllabic verse he had learned from the poetry of Marianne Moore.

Auden&#x27;s work in this era addresses the artist&#x27;s temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves (&quot;Prospero to Ariel&quot;) and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognising the temptation to break them (&quot;In Sickness and Health&quot;). From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form, each differing from the others in form and content: &quot;For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio&quot;, &quot;The Sea and the Mirror: A Commentary on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (both published in &quot;For the Time Being&quot;, 1944), and &quot;The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue&quot; (published separately in 1947). The first two, with Auden&#x27;s other new poems from 1940 to 1944, were included in his first collected edition, &quot;The Collected Poetry of W. H. Auden&quot; (1945), with most of his earlier poems, many in revised versions.

====1947–1957====
After completing &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot; in 1946 he focused again on shorter poems, notably &quot;A Walk After Dark&quot;, &quot;The Love Feast&quot;, and &quot;The Fall of Rome&quot;. Many of these evoked the Italian village where he spent his summers between 1948 and 1957, and his next book, &quot;Nones&quot; (1951), had a Mediterranean atmosphere new to his work. A new theme was the &quot;sacred importance&quot; of the human body in its ordinary aspect (breathing, sleeping, eating) and the continuity with nature that the body made possible (in contrast to the division between humanity and nature that he had emphasised in the 1930s); his poems on these themes included &quot;In Praise of Limestone&quot; (1948) and &quot;Memorial for the City&quot; (1949). In 1947-1948, Auden and Kallman wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s opera &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and later collaborated on two libretti for operas by Hans Werner Henze.

Auden&#x27;s first separate prose book was &quot;The Enchafèd Flood: The Romantic Iconography of the Sea&quot; (1950), based on a series of lectures on the image of the sea in romantic literature. Between 1949 and 1954 he worked on a sequence of seven Good Friday poems, titled &quot;Horae Canonicae&quot;, an encyclopaedic survey of geological, biological, cultural, and personal history, focused on the irreversible act of murder; the poem was also a study in cyclical and linear ideas of time. While writing this, he also wrote &quot;Bucolics&quot;, a sequence of seven poems about man&#x27;s relation to nature. Both sequences appeared in his next book, &quot;The Shield of Achilles&quot; (1955), with other short poems, including the book&#x27;s title poem, &quot;Fleet Visit&quot;, and &quot;Epitaph for the Unknown Soldier&quot;.

In 1955–56 Auden wrote a group of poems about &quot;history&quot;, the term he used to mean the set of unique events made by human choices, as opposed to &quot;nature&quot;, the set of involuntary events created by natural processes, statistics, and anonymous forces such as crowds. These poems included &quot;T the Great&quot;, &quot;The Maker&quot;, and the title poem of his next collection &quot;Homage to Clio&quot; (1960).

===Later work, 1958–1973===

In the late 1950s Auden&#x27;s style became less rhetorical while its range of styles increased. In 1958, having moved his summer home from Italy to Austria, he wrote &quot;Good-bye to the Mezzogiorno&quot;; other poems from this period include &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit: An Unwritten Poem&quot;, a prose poem about the relation between love and personal and poetic language, and the contrasting &quot;Dame Kind&quot;, about the anonymous impersonal reproductive instinct. These and other poems, including his 1955–66 poems about history, appeared in &quot;Homage to Clio&quot; (1960). His prose book &quot;The Dyer&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1962) gathered many of the lectures he gave in Oxford as Professor of Poetry in 1956–61, together with revised versions of essays and notes written since the mid-1940s.

Among the new styles and forms in Auden&#x27;s later work were the haiku and tanka that he began writing after translating the haiku and other verse in Dag Hammarskjöld&#x27;s &quot;Markings&quot;. A sequence of fifteen poems about his house in Austria, &quot;Thanksgiving for a Habitat&quot; (written in various styles that included an imitation of William Carlos Williams) appeared in &quot;About the House&quot; (1965), together with other poems that included his reflection on his lecture tours, &quot;On the Circuit&quot;. In the late 1960s he wrote some of his most vigorous poems, including &quot;River Profile&quot; and two poems that looked back over his life, &quot;Prologue at Sixty&quot; and &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. All these appeared in &quot;City Without Walls&quot; (1969). His lifelong passion for Icelandic legend culminated in his verse translation of &quot;The Elder Edda&quot; (1969). Among his later themes was the &quot;religionless Christianity&quot; he learned partly from Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the dedicatee of his poem &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;.
&quot;A Certain World: A Commonplace Book&quot; (1970) was a kind of self-portrait made up of favourite quotations with commentary, arranged in alphabetical order by subject. His last prose book was a selection of essays and reviews, &quot;Forewords and Afterwords&quot; (1973). His last books of verse, &quot;Epistle to a Godson&quot; (1972) and the unfinished &quot;Thank You, Fog&quot; (published posthumously, 1974) include reflective poems about language (&quot;Natural Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Aubade&quot;), philosophy and science (&quot;No, Plato, No&quot;, &quot;Unpredictable but Providential&quot;), and his own aging (&quot;A New Year Greeting&quot;, &quot;Talking to Myself&quot;—which he dedicated to his friend Oliver Sacks, &quot;A Lullaby&quot; [&quot;The din of work is subdued&quot;]). His last completed poem was &quot;Archaeology&quot;, about ritual and timelessness, two recurring themes in his later years.

===Reputation and influence===
Auden&#x27;s stature in modern literature has been contested. Probably the most common critical view from the 1930s onward ranked him as the last and least of the three major twentieth-century poets of the UK or Ireland—behind Yeats and Eliot—while a minority view, more prominent in recent years, ranks him as the highest of the three. Opinions have ranged from those of Hugh MacDiarmid, who called him &quot;a complete wash-out&quot;; F. R. Leavis, who wrote that Auden&#x27;s ironic style was &quot;self-defensive, self-indulgent or merely irresponsible&quot;; and Harold Bloom, who wrote &quot;Close thy Auden, open thy [Wallace] Stevens,&quot; to the obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot;, who wrote: &quot;W.H. Auden, for long the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of English poetry... emerges as its undisputed master.&quot; Joseph Brodsky wrote that Auden had &quot;the greatest mind of the twentieth century&quot;.

Critical estimates were divided from the start. Reviewing Auden&#x27;s first book, &quot;Poems&quot; (1930), Naomi Mitchison wrote &quot;If this is really only the beginning, we have perhaps a master to look forward to.&quot; But John Sparrow, recalling Mitchison&#x27;s comment in 1934, dismissed Auden&#x27;s early work as &quot;a monument to the misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets, and the fact that... he is being hailed as &#x27;a master&#x27; shows how criticism is helping poetry on the downward path.&quot;

Auden&#x27;s clipped, satiric, and ironic style in the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge, who wrote in a poem &quot;there waited for me in the summer morning / Auden fiercely. I read, shuddered, and knew.&quot; He was widely described as the leader of an &quot;Auden group&quot; that comprised his friends Stephen Spender, Cecil Day-Lewis, and Louis MacNeice. The four were mocked by the poet Roy Campbell as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named &quot;Macspaunday.&quot; Auden&#x27;s propagandistic poetic plays, including &quot;The Dog Beneath the Skin&quot; and &quot;The Ascent of F6&quot;, and his political poems such as &quot;Spain&quot; gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden&#x27;s work &quot;liberal, democratic, and humane&quot;, and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a &quot;characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image&quot;, to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact &quot;confined to bourgeois experience.&quot;

Auden&#x27;s departure for America in 1939 was debated in Britain (once even in Parliament), with some seeing his emigration as a betrayal. Defenders of Auden such as Geoffrey Grigson, in an introduction to a 1949 anthology of modern poetry, wrote that Auden &quot;arches over all&quot;. His stature was suggested by book titles such as &quot;Auden and After&quot; by Francis Scarfe (1942) and &quot;The Auden Generation&quot; by Samuel Hynes (1977).
In the US, starting in the late 1930s, the detached, ironic tone of Auden&#x27;s regular stanzas became influential; John Ashbery recalled that in the 1940s Auden &quot;was &quot;the&quot; modern poet&quot;. Auden&#x27;s formal influences were so pervasive in American poetry that the ecstatic style of the Beat Generation was partly a reaction against his influence. From the 1940s through the 1960s, many critics lamented that Auden&#x27;s work had declined from its earlier promise; Randall Jarrell wrote a series of essays making a case against Auden&#x27;s later work, and Philip Larkin&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Become of Wystan?&quot; (1960) had a wide impact.

The first full-length study of Auden was Richard Hoggart&#x27;s &quot;Auden: An Introductory Essay&quot; (1951), which concluded that &quot;Auden&#x27;s work, then, is a civilising force.&quot; It was followed by Joseph Warren Beach&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the Auden Canon&quot; (1957), a disapproving account of Auden&#x27;s revisions of his earlier work. The first systematic critical account was Monroe K. Spears&#x27; &quot;The Poetry of W. H. Auden: The Disenchanted Island&quot; (1963), &quot;written out of the conviction that Auden&#x27;s poetry can offer the reader entertainment, instruction, intellectual excitement, and a prodigal variety of aesthetic pleasures, all in a generous abundance that is unique in our time.&quot;

Auden was one of three candidates recommended by the Nobel Committee to the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1963 and 1965 and six recommended for the 1964 prize. By the time of his death in 1973 he had attained the status of a respected elder statesman, and a memorial stone for him was placed in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey in 1974. The Encyclopædia Britannica writes that &quot;by the time of Eliot&#x27;s death in 1965... a convincing case could be made for the assertion that Auden was indeed Eliot&#x27;s successor, as Eliot had inherited sole claim to supremacy when Yeats died in 1939.&quot; With some exceptions, British critics tended to treat his early work as his best, while American critics tended to favour his middle and later work.

Another group of critics and poets has maintained that unlike other modern poets, Auden&#x27;s reputation did not decline after his death, and the influence of his later writing was especially strong on younger American poets including John Ashbery, James Merrill, Anthony Hecht, and Maxine Kumin. Typical later evaluations describe him as &quot;arguably the [20th] century&#x27;s greatest poet&quot; (Peter Parker and Frank Kermode), who &quot;now clearly seems the greatest poet in English since Tennyson&quot; (Philip Hensher).

Auden became a close friend of neurologist Oliver Sacks and after publication of Sacks&#x27;s first book &quot;Migraine&quot;, in 1970, his review encouraged Sacks to adapt his writing style to &quot;be metaphorical, be mythical, be whatever you need.&quot;

Public recognition of Auden&#x27;s work sharply increased after his &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; (&quot;Stop all the clocks&quot;) was read aloud in the film &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994); subsequently, a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems, &quot;Tell Me the Truth About Love&quot;, sold more than 275,000 copies. An excerpt from his poem &quot;As I walked out one evening&quot; was recited in the film &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; (1995). After 11 September 2001, his 1939 poem &quot;September 1, 1939&quot; was widely circulated and frequently broadcast. Public readings and broadcast tributes in the UK and US in 2007 marked his centenary year.

Overall Auden&#x27;s poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement, its engagement with politics, morals, love, and religion, and its variety in tone, form and content.

Memorial stones and plaques commemorating Auden include those in Westminster Abbey; at his birthplace at 55 Bootham, York; near his home on Lordswood Road, Birmingham; in the chapel of Christ Church, Oxford; on the site of his apartment at 1 Montague Terrace, Brooklyn Heights; at his apartment in 77 St. Marks Place, New York (damaged and now removed); at the site of his death at Walfischgasse 5 in Vienna; and in the Rainbow Honor Walk in San Francisco. In his house in Kirchstetten, his study is open to the public upon request.

In 2023, newly declassified UK government files revealed that Auden was considered as a candidate to be the new Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1967 following the death of John Masefield. He was rejected due to having taken American citizenship.

<doc id="33277" wikidata="Q182589" url="?curid=33277" title="William Morris">
<text>William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was an English textile designer, poet, artist, writer, and socialist activist associated with the British Arts and Crafts movement. He was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he helped win acceptance of socialism in &quot;fin de siècle&quot; Great Britain.

Morris was born in Walthamstow, Essex, to a wealthy middle-class family. He came under the strong influence of medievalism while studying classics at Oxford University, where he joined the Birmingham Set. After university, he married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed Red House in Kent where Morris lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others, which became highly fashionable and much in demand. The firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, he assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris &amp; Co.

Morris rented the rural retreat of Kelmscott Manor, Oxfordshire, from 1871 while also retaining a main home in London. He was greatly influenced by visits to Iceland with Eiríkur Magnússon, and he produced a series of English-language translations of Icelandic Sagas. He also achieved success with the publication of his epic poems and novels, namely &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot; (1868–1870), &quot;A Dream of John Ball&quot; (1888), the Utopian &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; (1890), and the fantasy romance &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot; (1896). In 1877, he founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to campaign against the damage caused by architectural restoration. By the influence of medievalism and Christian socialism in the 1850s he became a sceptic of industrial capitalism, after reading works of Henry George, Alfred Russel Wallace, and Karl Marx in the 1880s Morris became a committed revolutionary socialist activist until his final acceptance of parliamentary socialism at 1896. He founded the Socialist League in 1884 after an involvement in the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), but he broke with that organisation in 1890. In 1891, he founded the Kelmscott Press to publish limited-edition, illuminated-style print books, a cause to which he devoted his final years.

Morris is recognised as one of the most significant cultural figures of Victorian Britain. He was best known in his lifetime as a poet, although he posthumously became better known for his designs. The William Morris Society founded in 1955 is devoted to his legacy, while multiple biographies and studies of his work have been published. Many of the buildings associated with his life are open to visitors, much of his work can be found in art galleries and museums, and his designs are still in production.

== Early life ==

=== Youth: 1834–1852 ===
Morris was born at Elm House in Walthamstow, Essex, on 24 March 1834. Raised into a wealthy middle-class family, he was named after his father, a financier who worked as a partner in the Sanderson &amp; Co. firm, bill brokers in the City of London. His mother was Emma Morris (née Shelton), who descended from a wealthy bourgeois family from Worcester. Morris was the third of his parents&#x27; surviving children; their first child, Charles, had been born in 1827 but died four days later. Charles had been followed by the birth of two girls, Emma in 1829 and Henrietta in 1833, before William&#x27;s birth. These children were followed by the birth of siblings Stanley in 1837, Rendall in 1839, Arthur in 1840, Isabella in 1842, Edgar in 1844, and Alice in 1846. The Morris family were followers of the evangelical Protestant form of Christianity, and William was baptised four months after his birth at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Walthamstow.

As a child, Morris was kept largely housebound at Elm House by his mother; there, he spent much time reading, favouring the novels of Walter Scott. Aged 6, Morris moved with his family to the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was surrounded by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in fishing with his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall&#x27;s grounds, and spent much time exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout the country, marveling at their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang Chine. Aged 9, he was then sent to Misses Arundale&#x27;s Academy for Young Gentlemen, a nearby preparatory school; although initially riding there by pony each day, he later began boarding, intensely disliking the experience.

In 1847, Morris&#x27;s father died unexpectedly. From this point, the family relied upon continued income from the copper mines at Devon Great Consols, and sold Woodford Hall to move into the smaller Water House. In February 1848 Morris began his studies at Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire, where he gained a reputation as an eccentric nicknamed &quot;Crab&quot;. He despised his time there, being bullied, bored, and homesick. He did use the opportunity to visit many of the prehistoric sites of Wiltshire, such as Avebury and Silbury Hill, which fascinated him. The school was Anglican in faith and in March 1849 Morris was confirmed by the Bishop of Salisbury in the college chapel, developing an enthusiastic attraction towards the Anglo-Catholic movement and its Romanticist aesthetic. At Christmas 1851, Morris was removed from the school and returned to Water House, where he was privately tutored by the Reverend Frederick B. Guy, Assistant Master at the nearby Forest School.

=== Oxford and the Birmingham Set: 1852–1856 ===
In June 1852 Morris entered Exeter College at Oxford University, although, since the college was full, he went into residence only in January 1853. He disliked the college and was bored by the manner in which they taught him Classics. Instead he developed a keen interest in medieval history and medieval architecture, inspired by the many medieval buildings in Oxford. This interest was tied to Britain&#x27;s growing Medievalist movement, a form of Romanticism that rejected many of the values of Victorian industrial capitalism. For Morris, the Middle Ages represented an era with strong chivalric values and an organic, pre-capitalist sense of community, both of which he deemed preferable to his own period. This attitude was compounded by his reading of Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s book &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1843), in which Carlyle championed medieval values as a corrective to the problems of Victorian society. Under this influence, Morris&#x27;s dislike of contemporary capitalism grew, and he came to be influenced by the work of Christian socialists Charles Kingsley and Frederick Denison Maurice.

At the college, Morris met fellow first-year undergraduate Edward Burne-Jones, who became his lifelong friend and collaborator. Although from very different backgrounds, they found that they had a shared attitude to life, both being keenly interested in Anglo-Catholicism and Arthurianism.
Through Burne-Jones, Morris joined a group of undergraduates from Birmingham who were studying at Pembroke College: William Fulford (1831–1882), Richard Watson Dixon, Charles Faulkner, and Cormell Price. They were known among themselves as the &quot;Brotherhood&quot; and to historians as the Birmingham Set. Morris was the most affluent member of the Set, and was generous with his wealth toward the others. Like Morris, the Set were fans of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and would meet together to recite the plays of William Shakespeare.

Morris was heavily influenced by the writings of the art critic John Ruskin, being particularly inspired by his chapter &quot;On the Nature of Gothic Architecture&quot; in the second volume of &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;; he later described it as &quot;one of the very few necessary and inevitable utterances of the century&quot;. Morris adopted Ruskin&#x27;s philosophy of rejecting the tawdry industrial manufacture of decorative arts and architecture in favour of a return to hand-craftsmanship, raising artisans to the status of artists, creating art that should be affordable and hand-made, with no hierarchy of artistic mediums. Ruskin had achieved attention in Victorian society for championing the art of a group of painters who had emerged in London in 1848 calling themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The Pre-Raphaelite style was heavily Medievalist and Romanticist, emphasising abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions; it greatly impressed Morris and the Set. Influenced both by Ruskin and by John Keats, Morris began to spend more time writing poetry, in a style that was imitative of much of theirs.

Both he and Burne-Jones were influenced by the Romanticist milieu and the Anglo-Catholic movement, and decided to become clergymen in order to found a monastery where they could live a life of chastity and dedication to artistic pursuit, akin to that of the contemporary Nazarene movement. However, as time went on Morris became increasingly critical of Anglican doctrine and the idea faded. In summer 1854, Morris travelled to Belgium to look at medieval paintings, and in July 1855 went with Burne-Jones and Fulford across northern France, visiting medieval churches and cathedrals. It was on this trip that he and Burne-Jones committed themselves to &quot;a life of art&quot;. For Morris, this decision resulted in a strained relationship with his family, who believed that he should have entered either commerce or the clergy. On a subsequent visit to Birmingham, Morris discovered Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, which became a core Arthurian text for him and Burne-Jones. In January 1856, the Set began publication of &quot;The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot;, designed to contain &quot;mainly Tales, Poetry, friendly critiques and social articles&quot;. Funded mainly by Morris, who briefly served as editor and heavily contributed to it with his own stories, poems, reviews and articles, the magazine lasted for twelve issues, and garnered praise from Tennyson and Ruskin.

=== Apprenticeship, the Pre-Raphaelites, and marriage: 1856–1859 ===
Having passed his finals and been awarded a BA, Morris began an apprenticeship with the Oxford-based Neo-Gothic architect George Edmund Street in January 1856. His apprenticeship focused on architectural drawing, and there he was placed under the supervision of the young architect Philip Webb, who became a close friend. Morris soon relocated to Street&#x27;s London office, in August 1856 moving into a flat in Bloomsbury in Central London with Burne-Jones, an area perhaps chosen for its avant-garde associations. Morris was fascinated by London but dismayed at its pollution and rapid expansion into neighbouring countryside, describing it as &quot;the spreading sore&quot;.

William Morris became increasingly fascinated with the idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life which appeared in the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at the Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti&#x27;s recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to the flat at Bloomsbury&#x27;s No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes in a direct rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.

Morris also continued writing poetry and began designing illuminated manuscripts and embroidered hangings. In March 1857 Bell and Dandy published a book of Morris&#x27;s poems, &quot;The Defence of Guenevere&quot;, which was largely self-funded by the author. It did not sell well and garnered few reviews, most of which were unsympathetic. Disconcerted, Morris would not publish again for a further eight years. In October 1857 Morris met Jane Burden, a woman from a poor working-class background, at a theatre performance. Rossetti initially asked her to model for him. Controversially both Rossetti and Morris were smitten with her; Morris, however, began a relationship with her and they were engaged in spring 1858; Burden would later admit that she had never loved Morris. They were married in a low-key ceremony held at St Michael at the North Gate church in Oxford on 26 April 1859, before honeymooning in Bruges, Belgium, and settling temporarily at 41 Great Ormond Street, London.

== Career and fame ==

=== Red House and the Firm: 1859–1865 ===
Morris desired a new home for himself and his daughters resulting in the construction of the Red House in the Kentish hamlet of Upton near Bexleyheath, ten miles from central London. The building&#x27;s design was a co-operative effort, with Morris focusing on the interiors and the exterior being designed by Webb, for whom the House represented his first commission as an independent architect. Named after the red bricks and red tiles from which it was constructed, Red House rejected architectural norms by being L-shaped. Influenced by various forms of contemporary Neo-Gothic architecture, the House was nevertheless unique, with Morris describing it as &quot;very mediaeval in spirit&quot;. Situated within an orchard, the house and garden were intricately linked in their design. It took a year to construct, and cost Morris £4000 at a time when his fortune was greatly reduced by a dramatic fall in the price of his shares. Burne-Jones described it as &quot;the beautifullest place on Earth.&quot;

After construction, Morris invited friends to visit, most notably Burne-Jones and his wife Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in painting murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.

In April 1861, Morris founded a decorative arts company, Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., with six other partners: Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, Ford Madox Brown, Charles Faulkner, and Peter Paul Marshall. Operating from premises at No. 6 Red Lion Square, they referred to themselves as &quot;the Firm&quot; and were intent on adopting Ruskin&#x27;s ideas of reforming British attitudes to production. They hoped to reinstate decoration as one of the fine arts and adopted an ethos of affordability and anti-elitism. For additional staff, they employed boys from the Industrial Home for Destitute Boys in Euston, central London, many of whom were trained as apprentices.

Although working within the Neo-Gothic school of design, they differed from Neo-Gothic architects like George Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm&#x27;s early years as they were in high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris&#x27;s anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.

Morris was slowly abandoning lithography and painting, recognising that his work lacked a sense of movement; none of his paintings are dated later than 1862. Instead he focused his energies on designing wallpaper patterns, the first being &quot;Trellis&quot;, designed in 1862. His designs were produced from 1864 by Jeffrey and Co. of Islington, who created them for the Firm under Morris&#x27;s supervision. Morris retained an active interest in various groups, joining the Hogarth Club, the Mediaeval Society, and the Corps of Artist Volunteers, the latter in contrast to his later pacifism.

Meanwhile, Morris&#x27;s family continued to grow. In January 1861, Morris and Janey&#x27;s first daughter was born: named Jane Alice Morris, she was commonly known as &quot;Jenny&quot;. Jenny was followed in March 1862 by the birth of their second daughter, Mary &quot;May&quot; Morris. Morris was a caring father to his daughters, and years later they both recounted having idyllic childhoods. However, there were problems in Morris&#x27;s marriage as Janey became increasingly close to Rossetti, who often painted her. It is unknown if their affair was ever sexual, although by this point other members of the group were noticing Rossetti and Janey&#x27;s closeness.

Imagining the creation of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones&#x27;s son Christopher died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.

=== Queen Square and &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot;: 1865–1870 ===
At Queen Square, the Morris family lived in a flat directly above the Firm&#x27;s shop. They were joined by Janey&#x27;s sister Elizabeth Burden and a number of household servants. Meanwhile, changes were afoot at the Firm as Faulkner left, and to replace him they employed a business manager, Warrington Taylor, who would remain with them till 1866. Taylor pulled the Firm&#x27;s finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St James&#x27;s Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum (it is now the Morris Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm&#x27;s work received increasing interest from people in the United States, resulting in Morris&#x27;s acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was not turning over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris&#x27;s stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.

Janey&#x27;s relationship with Rossetti had continued, and by the late 1860s gossip regarding their affair had spread about London, where they were regularly seen spending time together. Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy argued that it was likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronio, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, although there is no evidence that they had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris&#x27;s relationship with his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife and children to visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, Webb, and Taylor toured the churches of northern France.

In August 1866 Morris joined the Burne-Jones family on their holiday in Lymington, while in August 1867 both families holidayed together in Oxford. In August 1867 the Morrises holidayed in Southwold, Suffolk, while in the summer of 1869 Morris took his wife to Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, central Germany, where it was hoped that the local health waters would aid her ailments. While there, he enjoyed walks in the countryside and focused on writing poetry.

Morris had continued to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;The Life and Death of Jason&quot;, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris&#x27;s former publication, &quot;The Life and Death of Jason&quot; was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.
From 1865 to 1870, Morris worked on another epic poem, &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot;. Designed as a homage to Chaucer, it consisted of 24 stories, adopted from an array of different cultures, and each by a different narrator; set in the late 14th century, the synopsis revolved around a group of Norsemen who flee the Black Death by sailing away from Europe, on the way discovering an island where the inhabitants continue to venerate the ancient Greek gods. Published in four parts by F. S. Ellis, it soon gained a cult following and established Morris&#x27;s reputation as a major poet.

=== Kelmscott Manor and Iceland: 1870–1875 ===
By 1870, Morris had become a public figure in Britain, resulting in repeated press requests for photographs, which he despised. That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eiríkur Magnússon. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed a keen interest in creating handwritten illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was &quot;A Book of Verse&quot;, completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were handwritten copies of Nordic tales such as &quot;Halfdan the Black&quot;, &quot;Frithiof the Bold&quot;, and &quot;The Dwellers of Eyr&quot;. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well as learning how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published &quot;Love is Enough&quot;, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, &quot;The Novel on Blue Paper&quot;, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not well written.

By early summer 1871, Morris began to search for a house outside London where his children could spend time away from the city&#x27;s pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed &quot;circa&quot; 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. In contrast, Rossetti was unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He became fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain a new house in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris&#x27;s life.
Leaving Jane and his children with Rossetti at Kelmscott, in July 1871 Morris left for Iceland with Faulkner, W. H. Evans, and Eiríkur. Sailing from the Scottish port of Granton aboard a Danish mail boat, they proceeded to the island via Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands before arriving at Reykjavík, where they disembarked. There they met the President of the Althing, Jón Sigurðsson, with Morris being sympathetic to the Icelandic independence movement. From there, they proceeded by Icelandic horse along the south coast to Bergþórshvoll, Þórsmörk, Geysir, Þingvellir, and then back to Reykjavík, where they departed back to Britain in September. In April 1873, Morris and Burne-Jones holidayed in Italy, visiting Florence and Siena. Although generally disliking the country, Morris was interested in the Florentine Gothic architecture. Soon after, in July, Morris returned to Iceland, revisiting many of the sites he had previously seen, but then proceeding north to Vatna glacier and Fljótsdalur. His two visits to the country profoundly influenced him, in particular in his growing leftist opinions; he would comment that these trips made him realise that &quot;the most grinding poverty is a trifling evil compared with the inequality of classes.&quot;

Morris and Burne-Jones then spent time with one of the Firm&#x27;s patrons, the wealthy George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle and his wife Rosalind, at their medieval home in Naworth Castle, Cumberland. In July 1874, the Morris family then took Burne-Jones&#x27;s two children with them on their holiday to Bruges, Belgium. However, by this point Morris&#x27;s friendship with Rossetti had seriously eroded, and in July 1874 their acrimonious falling out led Rossetti to leave Kelmscott, with Morris&#x27;s publisher F.S. Ellis taking his place. With the company&#x27;s other partners drifting off to work on other projects, Morris decided to consolidate his own control of the Firm and become sole proprietor and manager. In March 1875, he paid £1000 each in compensation to Rossetti, Brown, and Marshall, although the other partners waived their claims to financial compensation. That month, the Firm was officially disbanded and replaced by Morris &amp; Co, although Burne-Jones and Webb would continue to produce designs for it in future. This accomplished, he resigned his directorship of the Devon Great Consols, selling his remaining shares in the company.

=== Textile experimentation and political embrace: 1875–1880 ===

Now in complete control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest in the process of textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, kermes, and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen&#x27;s Square.

In the Spring of 1877, the Firm opened a store at No. 449 Oxford Street and obtained new staff who were able to improve its professionalism; as a result, sales increased and its popularity grew. By 1880, Morris &amp; Co. had become a household name, having become very popular with Britain&#x27;s upper and middle classes. The Firm was obtaining increasing numbers of commissions from aristocrats, wealthy industrialists, and provincial entrepreneurs, with Morris furnishing parts of St James&#x27;s Palace and the chapel at Eaton Hall. As a result of his growing sympathy for the working-classes and poor, Morris felt personally conflicted in serving the interests of these individuals, privately describing it as &quot;ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich&quot;.

Continuing with his literary output, Morris translated his own version of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, titling it &quot;The Aeneids of Vergil&quot; (1876). Although many translations were already available, often produced by trained Classicists, Morris claimed that his unique perspective was as &quot;a poet not a pedant&quot;. He also continued producing translations of Icelandic tales with Magnússon, including &quot;Three Northern Love Stories&quot; (1875) and &quot;Völuspa Saga&quot; (1876). In 1877 Morris was approached by Oxford University and offered the largely honorary position of Professor of Poetry. He declined, asserting that he felt unqualified, knowing little about scholarship on the theory of poetry.

In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was diagnosed with epilepsy. Refusing to allow her to be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith&#x27;s Upper Mall in West London that was owned by the novelist George MacDonald. Morris named it Kelmscott House and re-decorated it according to his own taste. In the House&#x27;s grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.

Morris became politically active in this period, coming to be associated with the radicalist current within British liberalism. He joined the Eastern Question Association (EQA) and was appointed the group&#x27;s treasurer in November 1876. EQA had been founded by campaigners associated with the centre-left Liberal Party who opposed Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s alliance with the Ottoman Empire; the Association highlighted the Ottoman massacre of Bulgarians and feared that the alliance would lead Disraeli to join the Ottomans in going to war with the Russian Empire. Morris took an active role in the EQA campaign, authoring the lyrics for the song &quot;Wake, London Lads!&quot; to be sung at a rally against military intervention. Morris eventually became disillusioned with the EQA, describing it as being &quot;full of wretched little personalities&quot;. He nevertheless joined a regrouping of predominantly working-class EQA activists, the National Liberal League, becoming their treasurer in summer 1879; the group remained small and politically ineffective, with Morris resigning as treasurer in late 1881, shortly before the group&#x27;s collapse.

However, his discontent with the British liberal movement grew following the election of the Liberal Party&#x27;s William Ewart Gladstone to the Premiership in 1880. Morris was particularly angered that Gladstone&#x27;s government did not reverse the Disraeli regime&#x27;s occupation of the Transvaal, introduced the Coercion Bill, and oversaw the Bombardment of Alexandria. Morris later related that while he had once believed that &quot;one might further real Socialistic progress by doing what one could on the lines of ordinary middle-class Radicalism&quot;, following Gladstone&#x27;s election he came to realise &quot;that Radicalism is on the wrong line, so to say, and will never develope [sic] into anything more than Radicalism: in fact that it is made for and by the middle classes and will always be under the control of rich capitalists&quot;.

In 1876, Morris visited the Church of St John the Baptist, Burford, where he was appalled at the restoration conducted by his old mentor, G. E. Street. He recognised that these programs of architectural restoration led to the destruction or major alteration of genuinely old features in order to replace them with &quot;sham old&quot; features, something which appalled him. To combat the increasing trend for restoration, in March 1877 he founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB), which he personally referred to as &quot;Anti-Scrape&quot;. As he adopted the role of honorary secretary and treasurer, most of the other early members of SPAB were his friends, while the group&#x27;s program was rooted in Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; (1849). As part of SPAB&#x27;s campaign, Morris tried to build connections with art and antiquarian societies and the custodians of old buildings, and also contacted the press to highlight his cause. He was particularly strong in denouncing the ongoing restoration of Tewkesbury Abbey and was vociferous in denouncing the architects responsible, something that deeply upset Street. Turning SPAB&#x27;s attention abroad, in Autumn 1879 Morris launched a campaign to protect St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice from restoration, garnering a petition with 2000 signatures, among whom were Disraeli, Gladstone, and Ruskin.

== Later life ==

=== Merton Abbey and the Democratic Federation: 1881–1884 ===
In summer 1881, Morris took out a lease on the seven-acre former silk weaving factory, the Merton Abbey Works, next to the River Wandle on the High Street at Merton, Southwest London (not to be confused with the adjacent Merton Abbey Mills, home of the Liberty Print Works.) After he moved his workshops to the site, the premises were used for weaving, dyeing, and creating stained glass; within three years, 100 craftsmen were employed there. Working conditions at the Abbey were better than at most Victorian factories. However, despite Morris&#x27;s ideals, there was little opportunity for the workers to display their own individual creativity. Morris had initiated a system of profit sharing among the Firm&#x27;s upper clerks, however this did not include the majority of workers, who were instead employed on a piecework basis. Morris was aware that, in retaining the division between employer and employed, the company failed to live up to his own egalitarian ideals, but he defended this, asserting that it was impossible to run a socialist company within a competitive capitalist economy. The Firm itself was expanding, opening up a store in Manchester in 1883 and holding a stand at that year&#x27;s Foreign Fair in Boston.

Janey&#x27;s relationship with Rossetti had continued through a correspondence and occasional visits, although she found him extremely paranoid and was upset by his addiction to chloral. She last saw him in 1881, and he died in April the following year. Morris described his mixed feelings toward his deceased friend by stating that he had &quot;some of the very greatest qualities of genius, most of them indeed; what a great man he would have been but for the arrogant misanthropy which marred his work, and killed him before his time&quot;. In August 1883, Janey was introduced to the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, with whom she embarked on a second affair, which Morris might have been aware of.

In January 1881 Morris was involved in the establishment of the Radical Union, an amalgam of radical working-class groups which hoped to rival the Liberals, and became a member of its executive committee. However, he soon rejected liberal radicalism completely and moved toward socialism. In this period, British socialism was a small, fledgling and vaguely defined movement, with only a few hundred adherents. Britain&#x27;s first socialist party, the Democratic Federation (DF), had been founded in 1881 by Henry Hyndman, an adherent of the socio-political ideology of Marxism, with Morris joining the DF in January 1883. Morris began to read voraciously on the subject of socialism, including Henry George&#x27;s &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s &quot;Land Nationalisation&quot;, and Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, although admitted that Marx&#x27;s economic analysis of capitalism gave him &quot;agonies of confusion on the brain&quot;. Instead he preferred the writings of William Cobbett and Sergius Stepniak, although he also read the critique of socialism produced by John Stuart Mill.

In May 1883, Morris was appointed to the DF&#x27;s executive committee, and was soon elected to the position of treasurer. Devoting himself to the socialist cause, he regularly lectured at meetings across Britain, hoping to gain more converts, although was regularly criticised for doing so by the mainstream press. In November 1883 he was invited to speak at University College, Oxford, on the subject of &quot;Democracy and Art&quot; and there began espousing socialism; this shocked and embarrassed many members of staff, earning national press coverage. With other DF members, he travelled to Blackburn, Lancashire in February 1884 amid the great cotton strike, where he lectured on socialism to the strikers. The following month he marched in a central London demonstration commemorating the first anniversary of Marx&#x27;s death and the thirteenth anniversary of the Paris Commune.

Morris aided the DF using his artistic and literary talents; he designed the group&#x27;s membership card, and helped author their manifesto, &quot;Socialism Made Plain&quot;, in which they demanded improved housing for workers, free compulsory education for all children, free school meals, an eight-hour working day, the abolition of national debt, nationalisation of land, banks, and railways, and the organisation of agriculture and industry under state control and co-operative principles. Some of his DF comrades found it difficult to reconcile his socialist values with his position as proprietor of the Firm, although he was widely admired as a man of integrity. The DF began publishing a weekly newspaper, &quot;Justice&quot;, which soon faced financial losses that Morris covered. Morris also regularly contributed articles to the newspaper, in doing so befriending another contributor, George Bernard Shaw.

His socialist activism monopolised his time, forcing him to abandon a translation of the Persian &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, with whom he had strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had become increasingly conservative, and felt that the DF were exploiting Morris for his talents and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris&#x27;s circle of artistic comrades, only Webb and Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.

In 1884 the DF renamed itself the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and underwent an internal reorganisation. However, the group was facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division between the two groups developed into open conflict, with the majority of members sharing Morris&#x27;s position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.

=== Socialist League: 1884–1889 ===
In December 1884, Morris founded the Socialist League (SL) with other SDF defectors. He composed the SL&#x27;s manifesto with Bax, describing their position as that of &quot;Revolutionary International Socialism&quot;, advocating proletarian internationalism and world revolution while rejecting the concept of socialism in one country. In this, he committed himself to &quot;making Socialists&quot; by educating, organising, and agitating to establish a strong socialist movement; calling on activists to boycott elections, he hoped that socialists would take part in a proletariat revolution and help to establish a socialist society. Bax taught Morris more about Marxism, and introduced him to Marx&#x27;s collaborator, Friedrich Engels; Engels thought Morris honest but lacking in practical skills to aid the proletarian revolution. Morris remained in contact with other sectors of London&#x27;s leftist community, being a regular at the socialist International Club in Shoreditch, East London, however he avoided the recently created Fabian Society, deeming it too middle-class. Although a Marxist, he befriended prominent anarchist activists Stepniak and Peter Kropotkin, and came to be influenced by their anarchist views, to the extent that biographer Fiona MacCarthy described his approach as being &quot;Marxism with visionary libertarianism&quot;.

As the leading figure in the League, Morris embarked on a series of speeches and talks on street corners, in working men&#x27;s clubs, and in lecture theatres across England and Scotland. He also visited Dublin, there offering his support for Irish nationalism, and formed a branch of the League at his Hammersmith house. By the time of their first conference in July 1885, the League had eight branches across England and had affiliations with several socialist groups in Scotland. However, as the British socialist movement grew it faced increased opposition from the establishment, with police frequently arresting and intimidating activists. To combat this, the League joined a Defence Club with other socialist groups, including the SDF, for which Morris was appointed treasurer. Morris was passionate in denouncing the &quot;bullying and hectoring&quot; that he felt socialists faced from the police, and on one occasion was arrested himself after fighting back against a police officer; a magistrate dismissed the charges. The Black Monday riots of February 1886 led to increased political repression against left-wing agitators, and in July Morris was again arrested and fined for public obstruction while preaching socialism on the streets.

Morris oversaw production of the League&#x27;s monthly—soon to become weekly—newspaper, &quot;Commonweal&quot;, serving as its editor for six years, during which time he kept it financially afloat. First published in February 1885, it would contain contributions from such prominent socialists as Engels, Shaw, Paul Lafargue, Wilhelm Liebknecht, and Karl Kautsky, with Morris also regularly writing articles and poems for it. In &quot;Commonweal&quot; he serialised a 13-episode poem, &quot;The Pilgrims of Hope&quot;, which was set in the period of the Paris Commune. From November 1886 to January 1887, Morris&#x27;s novel &quot;A Dream of John Ball&quot; was serialised in &quot;Commonweal&quot;. Set in Kent during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, it contained strong socialist themes, although it proved popular among those of different ideological viewpoints, resulting in its publication in book form by Reeves and Turner in 1888. Shortly after, a collection of Morris&#x27;s essays, &quot;Signs of Change&quot;, was published.

From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; in &quot;Commonweal&quot;, resulting in improved circulation for the paper. In March 1891 it was published in book form, before being translated into Dutch, French, Swedish, German and Italian by 1900 and becoming a classic among Europe&#x27;s socialist community. Combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who falls asleep and awakens in the early 21st century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. In this society there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris&#x27;s ideal socialist society.

Morris had also continued with his translation work; in April 1887, Reeves and Turner published the first volume of Morris&#x27;s translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, with the second following in November. Venturing into new territory, Morris also authored and starred in a play &quot;The Tables Turned; Or Nupkins Awakened&quot;, which was performed at a League meeting in November 1887. It told the story of socialists who are put on trial in front of a corrupt judge; the tale ends with the prisoners being freed by a proletariat revolution. In June 1889, Morris travelled to Paris as the League&#x27;s delegate to the International Socialist Working Men&#x27;s Congress, where his international standing was recognised by his being chosen as English spokesman by the Congress committee. The Second International emerged from the Congress, although Morris was distraught at its chaotic and disorganised proceedings.

At the League&#x27;s Fourth Conference in May 1888, factional divisions became increasingly apparent between Morris&#x27;s anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anti-statist anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under the leadership of Charles Mowbray, the League&#x27;s anarchist wing was growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists had taken over the League&#x27;s executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of &quot;Commonweal&quot; in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.

=== The Kelmscott Press and Morris&#x27;s final years: 1889–1896 ===
The work of Morris &amp; Co. continued during Morris&#x27;s final years, producing an array of stained glass windows designed by Burne-Jones and the six narrative tapestry panels depicting the quest for the Holy Grail for Stanmore Hall, Shropshire. Morris&#x27;s influence on Britain&#x27;s artistic community became increasingly apparent as the Art Workers&#x27; Guild was founded in 1884, although at the time he was too preoccupied with his socialist activism to pay it any attention. Although the proposal faced some opposition, Morris was elected to the Guild in 1888, and to the position of master in 1892. Morris similarly did not offer initial support for the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, but changed his opinion after the success of their first exhibit, held in Regent Street in October 1888. Giving lectures on tapestries for the group, in 1892 he was elected president. At this time, Morris re-focused his attentions on preservation campaigning; those causes he championed including the structures of St Mary&#x27;s Church in Oxford, Blythburgh Church in Suffolk, Peterborough Cathedral, and Rouen Cathedral.

Although his socialist activism had decreased, he remained involved with the Hammersmith Socialist Society, and in October 1891 oversaw the creation of a short-lived newsletter, the &quot;Hammersmith Socialist Record&quot;. Coming to oppose factionalism within the socialist movement, he sought to rebuild his relationship with the SDF, appearing as a guest lecturer at some of their events and supporting SDF candidate George Lansbury when he stood in the Wandsworth by-election of February 1894. In 1893 the Hammersmith Socialist Society co-founded the Joint Committee of Socialist Bodies with representatives of the SDF and Fabian Society; Morris helped draw up its &quot;Manifesto of English Socialists&quot;. He offered support for leftist activists on trial, including a number of militant anarchists whose violent tactics he nevertheless denounced. He also began using the term &quot;communism&quot; for the first time, stating that &quot;Communism is in fact the completion of Socialism: when that ceases to be militant and becomes triumphant, it will be communism.&quot; In December 1895 he gave his final open-air talk at Stepniak&#x27;s funeral, where he spoke alongside the socialist Eleanor Marx, trade unionist Keir Hardie, and anarchist Errico Malatesta. Liberated from internal factional struggles, he retracted his anti-parliamentary position and worked for socialist unity, giving his last public lecture in January 1896 on the subject of &quot;One Socialist Party.&quot;

In December 1888, the Chiswick Press published Morris&#x27;s &quot;The House of the Wolfings&quot;, a fantasy story set in Iron Age Europe which provides a reconstructed portrait of the lives of Germanic-speaking Gothic tribes. It contained both prose and aspects of poetic verse. A sequel, &quot;The Roots of the Mountains&quot;, followed in 1889. Over the coming years he would publish a string of other poetic works: &quot;The Story of the Glittering Plain&quot; (1890), &quot;The Wood Beyond the World&quot; (1894), &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot; (1896), &quot;The Water of the Wondrous Isles&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Sundering Flood&quot; (1898). He also embarked on a translation of the Anglo-Saxon tale &quot;Beowulf&quot;; because he could not fully understand Old English, his poetic translation was based largely on that already produced by Alfred John Wyatt. On publication, Morris&#x27;s archaizing &quot;Beowulf&quot; was critically panned. Following the death of the sitting Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in October 1892, Morris was offered the position but turned it down, disliking its associations with the monarchy and political establishment; instead the position went to Alfred Austin.


In January 1891, Morris founded the Kelmscott Press, a private press which would go on to publish the celebrated &quot;Kelmscott Chaucer&quot;. By the early 1890s, Morris was increasingly ill and living largely as an invalid; aside from his gout, he also exhibited signs of epilepsy. In August 1891, he took his daughter Jenny on a tour of Northern France to visit the medieval churches and cathedrals. Back in England, he spent an increasing amount of time at Kelmscott Manor. Seeking treatment from the prominent doctor William Broadbent, he was prescribed a holiday in the coastal town of Folkestone. In December 1894 he was devastated upon learning of his 90-year-old mother&#x27;s death.

In July 1896, Morris went on a cruise to Norway with construction engineer John Carruthers, during which he visited Vadsø and Trondheim; during the trip his physical condition deteriorated and he began experiencing hallucinations. Returning to Kelmscott House, he became a complete invalid, being visited by friends and family, before dying of tuberculosis on the morning of 4 October 1896. Obituaries appearing throughout the national press reflected that at the time, Morris was widely recognised primarily as a poet. Mainstream press obituaries trivialised or dismissed his involvement in socialism, although the socialist press focused largely on this aspect of his career. His funeral was held on 6 October, during which his corpse was carried from Hammersmith to Paddington rail station, where it was transported to Oxford, and from there to Kelmscott, where it was buried in the churchyard of St George&#x27;s Church.

== Personal life ==
Morris&#x27;s biographer E. P. Thompson described him as having a &quot;robust bearing, and a slight roll in his walk&quot;, alongside a &quot;rough beard&quot; and &quot;disordered hair&quot;. The author Henry James described Morris as &quot;short, burly, corpulent, very careless and unfinished in his dress ... He has a loud voice and a nervous restless manner and a perfectly unaffected and businesslike address. His talk indeed is wonderfully to the point and remarkable for clear good sense.&quot; Morris&#x27;s first biographer Mackail described him as being both &quot;a typical Englishman&quot; and &quot;a typical Londoner of the middle class&quot; albeit one who was transformed into &quot;something quite individual&quot; through the &quot;force of his genius&quot;. MacCarthy described Morris&#x27;s lifestyle as being &quot;late Victorian, mildly bohemian, but bourgeois&quot;, with Mackail commenting that he exhibited many of the traits of the bourgeois Victorian class: &quot;industrious, honest, fair-minded up their lights, but unexpansive and unsympathetic&quot;. Although he generally disliked children, Morris also exhibited a strong sense of responsibility toward his family. Mackail nevertheless thought he &quot;was interested in things much more than in people&quot; and that while he did have &quot;lasting friendships&quot; and &quot;deep affections&quot;, he did not allow people to &quot;penetrate to the central part of him.&quot;

Politically, Morris was a staunch revolutionary socialist and anti-imperialist, and although raised a Christian he came to be an atheist. He came to reject state socialism and large centralised control, instead emphasising localised administration within a socialist society. Later political activist Derek Wall suggested that Morris could be classified as an ecosocialist. Morris was greatly influenced by Romanticism, with Thompson asserting that Romanticism was &quot;bred into his bones, and formed his early consciousness.&quot; Thompson argued that this &quot;Romantic Revolt&quot; was part of a &quot;passionate protest against an intolerable social reality&quot;, that of the industrial capitalism of Britain&#x27;s Victorian era. He believed that it led to little more than a &quot;yearning nostalgia or a sweet complaint&quot; and that Morris became &quot;a realist and a revolutionary&quot; only when he adopted socialism in 1882. Mackail was of the opinion that Morris had an &quot;innate Socialism&quot; which had &quot;penetrated and dominated all he did&quot; throughout his life. Given the conflict between his personal and professional life and his socio-political views, MacCarthy described Morris as &quot;a conservative radical&quot;.

Morris&#x27;s behaviour was often erratic. He was of a nervous disposition, and throughout his life relied on networks of male friends to aid him in dealing with this. Morris&#x27;s friends nicknamed him &quot;Topsy&quot; after a character in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. He had a wild temper and when sufficiently enraged could suffer seizures and blackouts. Rossetti was known to taunt Morris to enrage him for the amusement of himself and their other friends. Biographer Fiona MacCarthy suggests that Morris might have suffered from a form of Tourette&#x27;s syndrome. In later life he suffered from gout, a common complaint among middle-class men in the Victorian period. 

Morris&#x27;s ethos was that one should &quot;have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.&quot; He also held to the view that &quot;No work which cannot be done with pleasure in the doing is worth doing&quot; and adopted as his motto &quot;As I can&quot; from the fifteenth-century Flemish painter Jan van Eyck.

== Work ==

=== Literature ===

Besides being an artist William Morris was a prolific writer of poetry, fiction, essays, and translations of ancient and medieval texts. His first poems were published when he was 24 years old, and he was polishing his final novel, &quot;The Sundering Flood&quot;, at the time of his death. His daughter May&#x27;s edition of Morris&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot; (1910–1915) runs to 24 volumes, and two more were published in 1936.

Morris began publishing poetry and short stories in 1856 through &quot;The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot; which he founded with his friends and financed while at university. His first volume, &quot;The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems&quot; (1858), was the first book of Pre-Raphaelite poetry to be published. The dark poems, set in a sombre world of violence, were coolly received by the critics, and he was discouraged from publishing more for a number of years. &quot;The Haystack in the Floods&quot;, one of the poems in that collection, is probably now one of his better-known poems. It is a grimly realistic piece set during the Hundred Years War in which the doomed lovers Jehane and Robert have a last parting in a convincingly portrayed rain-swept countryside. One early minor poem was &quot;Masters in this Hall&quot; (1860), a Christmas carol written to an old French tune. Another Christmas-themed poem is &quot;The Snow in the Street&quot;, adapted from &quot;The Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot; in &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot;.

Morris met Eiríkur Magnússon in 1868, and began to learn the Icelandic language from him. Morris published translations of &quot;The Saga of Gunnlaug Worm-Tongue&quot; and &quot;Grettis Saga&quot; in 1869, and the &quot;Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs&quot; in 1870. An additional volume was published under the title of &quot;Three Northern Love Stories&quot; in 1873.
In the last nine years of his life, Morris wrote a series of imaginative fictions usually referred to as the &quot;prose romances&quot;. These novels – including &quot;The Wood Beyond the World&quot; and &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot; – have been credited as important milestones in the history of fantasy fiction, because, while other writers wrote of foreign lands, or of dream worlds, or the future (as Morris did in &quot;News from Nowhere&quot;), Morris&#x27;s works were the first to be set in an entirely invented fantasy world. These were attempts to revive the genre of medieval romance, and written in imitation of medieval prose. Morris&#x27;s prose style in these novels has been praised by Edward James, who described them as &quot;among the most lyrical and enchanting fantasies in the English language.&quot;

On the other hand, L. Sprague de Camp considered Morris&#x27;s fantasies to be not wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the plots of the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just happened in the romances, the novels are still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres of the field of fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers&#x27; imitation of William Morris.

Early fantasy writers like Lord Dunsany, E. R. Eddison and James Branch Cabell were familiar with Morris&#x27;s romances. &quot;The Wood Beyond the World&quot; is considered to have heavily influenced C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Narnia series, while J. R. R. Tolkien was inspired by Morris&#x27;s reconstructions of early Germanic life in &quot;The House of the Wolfings&quot; and &quot;The Roots of the Mountains&quot;. The young Tolkien attempted a retelling of the story of Kullervo from the &quot;Kalevala&quot; in the style of &quot;The House of the Wolfings&quot;; Tolkien considered much of his literary work to have been inspired by an early reading of Morris, even suggesting that he was unable to better Morris&#x27;s work; the names of characters such as &quot;Gandolf&quot; and the horse Silverfax appear in &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;.

Sir Henry Newbolt&#x27;s medieval allegorical novel Aladore was influenced by Morris&#x27;s fantasies. James Joyce also drew inspiration from his work.

=== Textile design ===


During his lifetime, Morris produced items in a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and insisted on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.

Mackail asserted that Morris became &quot;a manufacturer not because he wished to make money, but because he wished to make the things he manufactured.&quot; Morris &amp; Co.&#x27;s designs were fashionable among Britain&#x27;s upper and middle-classes, with biographer Fiona MacCarthy asserting that they had become &quot;the safe choice of the intellectual classes, an exercise in political correctitude.&quot; The company&#x27;s unique selling point was the range of different items that it produced, as well as the ethos of artistic control over production that it emphasised.

It is likely that much of Morris&#x27;s preference for medieval textiles was formed – or crystallised – during his brief apprenticeship with G. E. Street. Street had co-written a book on &quot;Ecclesiastical Embroidery&quot; in 1848, and was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish woolen work on canvas in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum, a surface embroidery technique popular in medieval England.

He was also fond of hand-knotted Persian carpet and advised the South Kensington Museum in the acquisition of fine Kerman carpets.

Morris taught himself embroidery, working with wool on a frame custom-built from an old example. Once he had mastered the technique he trained his wife Jane, her sister Bessie Burden and others to execute designs to his specifications. When &quot;embroideries of all kinds&quot; were offered through Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. catalogues, church embroidery became and remained an important line of business for its successor companies into the twentieth century. By the 1870s, the firm was offering both embroidery patterns and finished works. Following in Street&#x27;s footsteps, Morris became active in the growing movement to return originality and mastery of technique to embroidery, and was one of the first designers associated with the Royal School of Art Needlework with its aim to &quot;restore Ornamental Needlework for secular purposes to the high place it once held among decorative arts.&quot;

Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at Staffordshire dye works mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, such as the red derived from madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines. Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–1876) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–1878), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.

Morris&#x27;s patterns for woven textiles, some of which were also machine made under ordinary commercial conditions, included intricate double-woven furnishing fabrics in which two sets of warps and wefts are interlinked to create complex gradations of colour and texture. Morris long dreamed of weaving tapestries in the medieval manner, which he called &quot;the noblest of the weaving arts.&quot; In September 1879 he finished his first solo effort, a small piece called &quot;Cabbage and Vine&quot;.

=== Book illustration and design ===
Nineteenth and twentieth century avant-garde artistic movements took an interest in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. Morris&#x27;s designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the &quot;Works of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris invented three distinctive typefaces – Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.

Morris&#x27;s aesthetic and social values became a leading force in the Arts and Crafts Movement. The Kelmscott Press influenced much of the fine press movement in England and the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It brought the need for books that were aesthetic objects as well as words to the attention of the reading and publishing worlds.

At Kelmscott Press the book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that used to make a volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his &quot;golden type&quot; which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris chose the paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care with which he selected his material for binding. As a result, only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works; Morris realized that creating works in the manner of the Middle Ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.

== Legacy ==
President of the William Morris Society Hans Brill referred to Morris as &quot;one of the outstanding figures of the nineteenth century&quot;, while Linda Parry termed him the &quot;single most important figure in British textile production&quot;.
At the time of Morris&#x27;s death, his poetry was known internationally and his company&#x27;s products were found all over the world. In his lifetime, he was best known as a poet, although by the late twentieth century he was primarily known as a designer of wallpapers and fabrics.

He was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. Morris&#x27;s ethos of production was an influence on the Bauhaus movement. Another aspect of Morris&#x27;s preservationism was his desire to protect the natural world from the ravages of pollution and industrialism, causing some historians of the green movement to regard Morris as an important forerunner of modern environmentalism.

Aymer Vallance was commissioned to produce the first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris&#x27;s death, per the latter&#x27;s wishes. This presented the creation of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings as Morris&#x27;s greatest achievement. Morris&#x27;s next biographer was Burne-Jones&#x27;s son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume &quot;Life of William Morris&quot; (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, treating them as a passing phase that Morris overcame.

MacCarthy&#x27;s biography, &quot;William Morris: A Life for Our Time&quot;, was first published by Faber and Faber in 1994, and a paperback edition was published in 2010. For the 2013 Venice Biennale, artist Jeremy Deller selected Morris as the subject of a large-scale mural titled &quot;We Sit Starving Amidst our Gold&quot;, in which Morris returns from the dead to hurl the yacht of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich into the waves of an ocean.

MacCarthy curated the &quot;Anarchy &amp; Beauty&quot; exhibition—a commemoration of Morris&#x27;s legacy—for the National Portrait Gallery in 2014, for which she recruited around 70 artists who were required to undertake a test on Morris&#x27;s &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; to be accepted. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; prior to the opening of the exhibition on 16 October 2014, MacCarthy asserted:
Morris has exerted a powerful influence on thinking about art and design over the past century. He has been the constant niggle in the conscience. How can we combat all this luxury and waste? What drove him into revolutionary activism was his anger and shame at the injustices within society. He burned with guilt at the fact that his &quot;good fortune only&quot; allowed him to live in beautiful surroundings and to pursue the work he adored.

&quot;Anarchy &amp; Beauty&quot;&#x27;s arts and crafts section featured Morris&#x27;s own copy of the French edition of Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; handbound in a gold-tooled leather binding that MacCarthy describes as &quot;the ultimate example of Morris&#x27;s conviction that perfectionism of design and craftsmanship should be available to everyone.&quot;

=== Notable collections and house museums ===
A number of galleries and museums house important collections of Morris&#x27;s work and decorative items commissioned from Morris &amp; Co. The William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, England, is a public museum devoted to Morris&#x27;s life, work and influence. The William Morris Society is based at Morris&#x27;s final London home, Kelmscott House, Hammersmith, and is an international members society, museum and venue for lectures and other Morris-related events. The Art Gallery of South Australia is &quot;fortunate in holding the most comprehensive collection of Morris &amp; Co. furnishings outside Britain&quot;. The collection includes books, embroideries, tapestries, fabrics, wallpapers, drawings and sketches, furniture and stained glass, and forms the focus of two published works (produced to accompany special exhibitions).

The former &quot;green dining room&quot; at the Victoria and Albert Museum is now its &quot;Morris Room&quot;. The V&amp;A&#x27;s British Galleries house other decorative works by Morris and his associates.

One of the meeting rooms in the Oxford Union, decorated with the wallpaper in his style, is named the Morris Room.

Wightwick Manor in the West Midlands, England, is a notable example of the Morris &amp; Co. style, with lots of original Morris wallpapers, fabrics, carpets, and furniture, May Morris art and embroidery, De Morgan tiles, and Pre-Raphaelite works of art, managed by the National Trust. Standen in West Sussex, England, was designed by Webb between 1892 and 1894 and decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers. The illustrator Edward Linley Sambourne chose to decorate his London family home 18 Stafford Terrace with many Morris &amp; Co wallpapers, which have been preserved and can still be seen today. Morris&#x27;s homes Red House and Kelmscott Manor have been preserved. Red House was acquired by the National Trust in 2003 and is open to the public. Kelmscott Manor is owned by the Society of Antiquaries of London and is open to the public.

The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California, acquired the collection of Morris materials amassed by Sanford and Helen Berger in 1999. The collection includes stained glass, wallpaper, textiles, embroidery, drawings, ceramics, more than 2000 books, original woodblocks, and the complete archives of both Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. and Morris &amp; Co. These materials formed the foundation for the 2002 exhibition &quot;William Morris: Creating the Useful and the Beautiful&quot; and the 2003 exhibition &quot;The Beauty of Life: William Morris and the Art of Design&quot; and accompanying publication.

A Greater London Council blue plaque at Red House commemorates Morris and architect Philip Webb.

7, Hammersmith Terrace is the former home of Sir Emery Walker, a close friend and colleague of Morris. The house is decorated in the Arts &amp; Crafts style, including with extensive collections of Morris wallpaper, furniture, and textiles. 7, Hammersmith Terrace is operated by the Emery Walker Trust, and is open to the public for tours.

In 2013, the Cary Graphic Arts Collection at Rochester Institute of Technology bought William Morris&#x27;s London-built Hopkinson &amp; Cope Improved Albion press (No. 6551) at auction for $233,000. This printing press was specially reinforced to produce Morris&#x27;s &quot;Chaucer&quot; in 1896. Other owners of Morris&#x27;s Albion press include Frederic Goudy and J. Ben Lieberman.

In 2023 Walthamstow F.C. launched a new home football shirt with Admiral Sports featuring a William Morris print. The shirt was widely regarded as one of the best kit launches of the year and eventually won the Wood Pencil D&amp;AD award for Printed Graphic.

<doc id="33278" wikidata="Q4061" url="?curid=33278" title="Woody Guthrie">
<text>Woodrow Wilson Guthrie (; July 14, 1912 – October 3, 1967) was an American singer-songwriter and composer who was one of the most significant figures in American folk music. His work focused on themes of American socialism and anti-fascism and has inspired many generations both politically and musically with songs such as &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.

Guthrie wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children&#x27;s songs, along with ballads and improvised works. &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;, Guthrie&#x27;s album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, was included on &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 Records That Changed the World, and many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters who have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence on their work include Steve Earle, Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Donovan, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Tom Paxton, Brian Fallon, Sean Bonnette, and Sixto Rodríguez. He frequently performed with the message &quot;This machine kills fascists&quot; displayed on his guitar.

Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah, Oklahoma. He married at 19, but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD, achieving some fame from playing hillbilly music, made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck, and wrote a column for the communist newspaper &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; from May 1939 to January 1940.

Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, although he apparently did not belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the Molotov–Ribbentrop non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie&#x27;s political leanings after he wrote a song praising the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet invasion of Poland. He left the station, ending up in New York, where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;, based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the &quot;Dust Bowl Troubadour&quot;. In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;. He said it was a response to what he felt was the overplaying of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot; on the radio.

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son Arlo Guthrie became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of Huntington&#x27;s disease. His first two daughters also died of the disease.

==Early life==


Guthrie was born July 14, 1912, in Okemah, a small town in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, the son of Nora Belle (née Sherman) and Charles Edward Guthrie. His parents named him after Woodrow Wilson, then Governor of New Jersey and the Democratic candidate who was elected as President of the United States in fall 1912. Charles Guthrie was an industrious businessman, owning at one time up to of land in Okfuskee County. He was actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a conservative Democratic candidate for office in the county. Charles Guthrie was reportedly involved in the 1911 lynching of Laura and L. D. Nelson. (Woody Guthrie wrote three songs about the event in the 1960s. He said that his father, Charles, became a member of the Ku Klux Klan during its revival beginning in 1915.)

Three significant fires impacted Guthrie&#x27;s early life. In 1909, one fire caused the loss of his family&#x27;s home in Okemah a month after it was completed. When Guthrie was seven, his sister Clara died after setting her clothes on fire during an argument with her mother, and, later, in 1927, their father was severely burned in a fire at home. Guthrie&#x27;s mother, Nora, was afflicted with Huntington&#x27;s disease, although the family did not know this at the time. What they could see was dementia and muscular degeneration.

When Woody was 14, Nora was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. At the time his father Charles was living and working in Pampa, Texas, to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends.

Guthrie had a natural affinity for music, learning old ballads and traditional English and Scottish songs from the parents of friends. Guthrie befriended an African-American shoeshine boy named George, who played blues on his harmonica. After listening to George play, Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him. He used to busk for money and food. Although Guthrie did not do well as a student and dropped out of high school in his senior year before graduation, his teachers described him as bright. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics.

In 1929, Guthrie&#x27;s father sent for Woody to join him in Texas, but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa; he spent most of his time learning songs by busking on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa&#x27;s city hall. He regularly played at dances with his father&#x27;s half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player. His mother died in 1930 of complications of Huntington&#x27;s disease while still in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane.

==Career==
===1930s===
During the Dust Bowl period, Guthrie joined the thousands of Okies and others who migrated to California to look for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by working-class people.

During the latter part of that decade in Los Angeles, he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine &quot;Lefty Lou&quot; Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial hillbilly music and traditional folk music. Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family to join him from Texas. While appearing on the radio station KFVD, owned by a populist-minded New Deal Democrat, Frank W. Burke, Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that he eventually released on his album &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot;.

While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist Thomas Mooney, wrongly convicted in a case that was a cause célèbre of the time. Robbin, who became Guthrie&#x27;s political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including Will Geer. (He introduced Guthrie to writer John Steinbeck.) Robbin remained Guthrie&#x27;s lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the communist circles in Southern California.

Notwithstanding Guthrie&#x27;s later claim that &quot;the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party&quot;, he was never a member of the party. He was noted as a fellow traveler—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while avoiding party discipline. Guthrie wrote a column for the communist newspaper, &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot;. The column, titled &quot;Woody Sez&quot;, appeared a total of 174 times from May 1939 to January 1940. &quot;Woody Sez&quot; was not explicitly political, but it covered current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic. These columns were published posthumously as a collection after Guthrie&#x27;s death. 

With the outbreak of World War II and publicity about the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff &quot;spinning apologia&quot; for the Soviet Union. They fired both Robbin and Guthrie. Without the daily radio show, Guthrie&#x27;s employment chances declined, and he returned with his family to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer&#x27;s invitation to New York City and headed east.

===1940s: Building a legacy===

====New York City====
Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as &quot;the Oklahoma cowboy&quot;, was embraced by its folk music community. For a time, he slept on a couch in Will Geer&#x27;s apartment. Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress—as well as an album, &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads,&quot; for Victor Records in Camden, New Jersey.

In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot; on the radio. Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent. He adapted the melody from an old gospel song, &quot;Oh My Loving Brother&quot;, which had been adapted by the country group the Carter Family for their song &quot;Little Darling Pal Of Mine&quot;. Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment, &quot;All you can write is what you see.&quot; Although the song was written in 1940, it was four years before he recorded it for Moses Asch in April 1944. Sheet music was produced and given to schools by Howie Richmond sometime later.

In March 1940, Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers, to raise money for migrant workers. There he met the folk singer Pete Seeger, and the two men became good friends. Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family. He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie&#x27;s mother, in which she asked for Seeger&#x27;s help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better.

From April 1940, Guthrie and Seeger lived together in the Greenwich Village loft of sculptor Harold Ambellan and his fiancée. Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on CBS&#x27;s radio program &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend Huddie &quot;Lead Belly&quot; Ledbetter. Ledbetter&#x27;s Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the musician circle in New York at the time, and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends, as they had busked together at bars in Harlem.

In November 1941, Seeger introduced Guthrie to his friend the poet Charles Olson, then a junior editor at the fledgling magazine &quot;Common Ground&quot;. The meeting led to Guthrie writing the article &quot;Ear Players&quot; in the Spring 1942 issue of the magazine. The article marked Guthrie&#x27;s debut as a published writer in the mainstream media.

In September 1940, Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program &quot;Pipe Smoking Time&quot;. Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940. He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary. He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on Central Park West. The reunion represented Woody&#x27;s desire to be a better father and husband. He said, &quot;I have to set real hard to think of being a dad.&quot; Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast, claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing. Disgruntled with New York, Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California.

Choreographer Sophie Maslow developed &quot;Folksay&quot; as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet, which combined folk songs by Woody Guthrie with text from Carl Sandburg&#x27;s 1936 book-length poem &quot;The People, Yes&quot;. The premiere took place in March 1942 at the Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theatre in New York City. Guthrie provided live music for the performance, which featured Maslow and her New Dance Group. Two-and-a-half years later, Maslow brought &quot;Folksay&quot; to early television under the direction of Leo Hurwitz. The same group performed the ballet live in front of CBS TV cameras. The 30-minute broadcast aired on WCBW, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City (now WCBS-TV), from 8:15–8:45 pm ET on November 24, 1944. Featured were Maslow and the New Dance Group, which included among others Jane Dudley, Pearl Primus, and William Bales. Woody Guthrie and fellow folk singer Tony Kraber played guitar, sang songs, and read text from &quot;The People, Yes&quot;. The program received positive reviews and was performed on television over WCBW a second time in early 1945.

====Pacific Northwest====
In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved to Portland, Oregon, in the neighborhood of Lents, on the promise of a job. Gunther von Fritsch was directing a documentary about the Bonneville Power Administration&#x27;s construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie&#x27;s role. The Department of the Interior hired him for one month to write songs about the Columbia River and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary&#x27;s soundtrack. Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe it, it&#x27;s a paradise&quot;, which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: &quot;Roll On, Columbia, Roll On&quot;, &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot;, and &quot;Grand Coulee Dam&quot;. The surviving songs were released as &quot;Columbia River Songs&quot;. The film &quot;Columbia&quot; was not completed until 1949 (see below). At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York. Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children. Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a Catholic, but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943.

====Almanac Singers====

Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest, Guthrie corresponded with Pete Seeger about Seeger&#x27;s newly formed folk-protest group, the Almanac Singers. Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group. The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called &quot;hootenannies&quot;, a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in Greenwich Village.

Initially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed &quot;peace&quot; songs while the Nazi–Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Millard Lampell and Lee Hays. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of &quot;Union Maid&quot;, members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.

In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a &quot;real&quot; working class Oklahoman. &quot;There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance,&quot; a friend of the group, Irwin Silber, would say. Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham, another Okie, would later recall that Woody &quot;loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual&quot;. Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger&#x27;s post-Almanac Singers project &quot;People&#x27;s Songs&quot;, a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945.

====&quot;Bound for Glory&quot;====
Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie&#x27;s descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood. During this time, Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia (the professional name of Marjorie Greenblatt), a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the Martha Graham Dance School, where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece &quot;Folksay&quot;. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg, &quot;Folksay&quot; included the adaptation of some of Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Dust Bowl Ballads&quot; for the dance. Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, was completed with editing assistance by Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943. It is told in the artist&#x27;s down-home dialect. The &quot;Library Journal&quot; complained about the &quot;too careful reproduction of illiterate speech&quot;. However, Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, remarked that &quot;Someday people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world.&quot;

This book was the inspiration for the movie &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, starring David Carradine, which won the 1976 Academy Award for Original Music Score for Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Adaptation Score, and the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor, among other accolades.

In 1944, Guthrie met Moses &quot;Moe&quot; Asch of Folkways Records, for whom he first recorded &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;. Over the next few years, he recorded &quot;Worried Man Blues&quot;, along with hundreds of other songs. These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records, which had joint distribution rights. The Folkways recordings are available (through the Smithsonian Institution online shop); the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, is titled &quot;The Asch Recordings&quot;.

===World War II years===
Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems in the United States was the best use of his talents.
====Labor for Victory====
In April 1942, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the AFL (American Federation of Labor) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called &quot;Labor for Victory&quot;. NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a &quot;public service&quot;. The AFL and CIO presidents William Green and Philip Murray agreed to let their press chiefs, Philip Pearl and Len De Caux, narrate on alternate weeks. The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30 pm, starting on April 25, 1942. &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out.&quot; Writers for &quot;Labor for Victory&quot; included: Peter Lyon, a progressive journalist; Millard Lampell (born Allan Sloane), later an American movie and television screenwriter; and Morton Wishengrad, who worked for the AFL.

For entertainment on CIO episodes, De Caux asked singer and songwriter Woody Guthrie to contribute to the show. &quot;Personally, I would like to see a phonograph record made of your &#x27;Girl in the Red, White, and Blue. The title appears in at least one collection of Guthrie records. Guthrie consented and performed solo two or three times on this program (among several other WWII radio shows, including &quot;Answering You&quot;, &quot;Labor for Victory&quot;, &quot;Jazz in America&quot;, and &quot;We the People&quot;). On August 29, 1942, he performed &quot;The Farmer-Labor Train&quot;, with lyrics he had written to the tune of &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;. (In 1948, he reworked the &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; melody as &quot;The Wallace-Taylor Train&quot; for the 1948 Progressive National Convention, which nominated former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace for president.) The Almanac Singers (of which Guthrie and Lampell were co-founders) appeared on &quot;The Treasury Hour&quot; and CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;We the People&quot;. The latter was later produced as a television series. (Also, Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s papers show that Guthrie made some contributions to four CIO episodes (dated June 20, June 27, August 1, August 15, 1948) of &quot;Labor for Victory.&quot;) While &quot;Labor for Victory&quot; was a milestone in theory as a national platform, in practice it proved less so. Only 35 of 104 NBC affiliates carried the show. Episodes included the announcement that the show represented &quot;twelve million organized men and women, united in the high resolve to rid the world of Fascism in 1942&quot;. Speakers included Donald E. Montgomery, then &quot;consumer&#x27;s counselor&quot; at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

====Merchant Marine==== 
Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a USO performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft. When Guthrie&#x27;s attempts failed, his friends Cisco Houston and Jim Longhi persuaded the singer to join the U.S. Merchant Marine in June 1943. He made several voyages aboard merchant ships SS &quot;William B. Travis&quot;, SS &quot;William Floyd&quot;, and SS &quot;Sea Porpoise&quot;, while they traveled in convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. He served as a mess man and dishwasher, and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. His first ship, &quot;William B. Travis&quot;, hit a mine in the Mediterranean Sea, killing one person aboard, but the ship sailed to Bizerte, Tunisia under her own power.

His last ship, &quot;Sea Porpoise&quot;, took troops from the United States to England and France for the D-Day invasion. Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off Utah Beach by the German submarine U-390 on July 5, 1944, injuring 12 of the crew. Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat; Sea Porpoise returned to England, where she was repaired at Newcastle. In July 1944, she returned to the United States.

Guthrie was an active supporter of the National Maritime Union, one of many unions for wartime American merchant sailors. Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with them. Longhi later wrote about Guthrie&#x27;s marine experiences in his book &quot;Woody, Cisco and Me&quot;. The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his Merchant Marine service, at one point describing how Guthrie referred to his guitar as a &quot;Hoping Machine. But later during duty aboard the troop ship, Guthrie built an actual &quot;Hoping Machine&quot; made of cloth, whirligigs and discarded metal attached to a railing at the stern, aimed at lifting the soldiers&#x27; spirits. In 1945, the government decided that Guthrie&#x27;s association with communism excluded him from further service in the Merchant Marine; he was drafted into the U.S. Army.

While he was on from the Army, Guthrie married Marjorie. After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island and over time had four children: daughters Cathy and Nora; and sons Arlo and Joady. Cathy died as a result of a fire at the age of four, and Guthrie suffered a serious depression from his grief. Arlo and Joady followed in their father&#x27;s footsteps as singer-songwriters.

When his family was young, Guthrie wrote and recorded &quot;Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child&quot;, a collection of children&#x27;s music, which includes the song &quot;Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin&#x27;)&quot;, written when Arlo was about nine years old. During 1947, he wrote &quot;House of Earth&quot;, an historical novel containing explicit sexual material, about a couple who build a house made of clay and earth to withstand the Dust Bowl&#x27;s brutal weather. He could not get it published. It was published posthumously in 2013, by Harper, under actor Johnny Depp&#x27;s publishing imprint, Infinitum Nihil.

Guthrie was also a prolific sketcher and painter, his images ranging from simple, impressionistic images to free and characterful drawings, typically of the people in his songs.

In 1949, Guthrie&#x27;s music was used in the documentary film &quot;Columbia River&quot;, which explored government dams and hydroelectric projects on the river. Guthrie had been commissioned by the US Bonneville Power Administration in 1941 to write songs for the project, but it had been postponed by World War II.

===Post-war: Mermaid Avenue===

The years immediately after the war when he lived on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie&#x27;s most productive as a writer. His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate, mostly handled by his daughter Nora. Several of the manuscripts also contain writing by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie children.

During this time Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his home and observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie. He was inspired by the singer&#x27;s idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of the decline caused by Guthrie&#x27;s progressive Huntington&#x27;s disease, Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan both later said that they had learned much of Guthrie&#x27;s performance style from Elliott. When asked about this, Elliott said, &quot;I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn&#x27;t teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it—that&#x27;s the way I learned from Lead Belly.&quot;

==Later life and death==

=== Deteriorating health due to Huntington&#x27;s ===
By the late 1940s, Guthrie&#x27;s health was declining, and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including alcoholism and schizophrenia). In 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from Huntington&#x27;s disease, a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children because of his behavior, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her. They eventually divorced.

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the Theatricum Botanicum, a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by Will Geer. Together with singers and actors who had been blacklisted by HUAC, he waited out the anti-communist political climate.

As his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke van Kirk. They had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to Fruit Cove, Florida, where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called Beluthahatchee, owned by his friend Stetson Kennedy. Guthrie&#x27;s arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York, living in the Beach Haven apartment complex owned and operated by Fred Trump in Gravesend, Brooklyn; Guthrie composed there the song &quot;Old Man Trump&quot;. Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Anneke left New York after arranging for friends to adopt Lorina Lynn. Lorina had no further contact with her birth parents. She died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19. After the divorce, Guthrie&#x27;s second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.

Increasingly unable to control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961; at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in East Flatbush until 1966; and finally at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, New York, until his death in 1967. Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and the children played on the hospital grounds. Eventually, a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to Howard Beach, New York, where Marjorie and the children then lived.

During the final few years of his life, Guthrie had become isolated except for family. By 1965, he was unable to speak, often moving his arms or rolling his eyes to communicate. The progression of Huntington&#x27;s threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states, causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke&#x27;s. Huntington&#x27;s symptoms include uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social disinhibition.

Guthrie&#x27;s death increased awareness of the disease. Marjorie helped found the Committee to Combat Huntington&#x27;s Disease, which became the Huntington&#x27;s Disease Society of America. None of Guthrie&#x27;s three surviving children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington&#x27;s.

His son Bill (with his first wife Mary Guthrie) died in an auto-train accident in Pomona, California, at the age of 23. His two daughters, Gwendolyn and Sue with wife, Mary, suffered from Huntington&#x27;s disease. Both died at the age of 41.

===Folk revival and death===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers such as Guthrie. The American Folk Revival was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the civil rights movement and Free Speech Movement. Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. One of Guthrie&#x27;s visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old Bob Dylan, who idolized Guthrie. Dylan wrote of Guthrie&#x27;s repertoire: &quot;The songs themselves were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them.&quot; After learning of Guthrie&#x27;s whereabouts, Dylan regularly visited him.

Woody Guthrie died at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center of complications of Huntington&#x27;s disease on October 3, 1967. According to a Guthrie family legend, he was listening to his son Arlo&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Restaurant&quot;, a recording of which Arlo had delivered to Woody&#x27;s bedside, shortly before he died. His remains were cremated and scattered at sea. By the time of Guthrie&#x27;s death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them through Dylan, Pete Seeger, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, including his son Arlo Guthrie.

For a December 3, 1944 radio show, Guthrie wrote a script explaining why he sang the kinds of songs he did, reading it on air:

I hate a song that makes you think that you are not any good. I hate a song that makes you think that you are just born to lose. Bound to lose. No good to nobody. No good for nothing. Because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that. Songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard traveling.

I am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood. I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it&#x27;s hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops, no matter what color, what size you are, how you are built, I am out to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
At age 20, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Oklahoma-born Mary Jennings (1917–2014), in Texas in 1931. They had three children together: Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill.
Bill died at the age of 23 as the result of an automobile accident. The daughters both died of Huntington&#x27;s disease at the age of 41, in the 1970s. Evidently the disease had been passed on from their father, although Guthrie himself was diagnosed with the condition later in life, in 1952, when he was 43 years old. Guthrie and Mary divorced in 1940. Mary Esther Jennings Guthrie Bailey Boyle remarried, had another child, and died at the age of 97 in California.

Guthrie married twice more, to Marjorie Greenblatt (1945–1953), and Anneke van Kirk (1953–1956), having a total of eight children.

===Political views and relation to the Communist Party===
Socialism had an important impact on the work of Woody Guthrie. In the introduction to Will Kaufman’s book &quot;Woody Guthrie an American Radical&quot; Kaufman states that &quot;Woody Guthrie spent his productive life on the warpath-against poverty, political oppression, censorship, capitalism, fascism, racism, and, ultimately, war itself.&quot; Guthrie would time and time again back these beliefs up in his lyrics, specifically against capitalism at the height of the depression in the United States.

On the matter of the Communist party specifically, Guthrie never publicly declared himself a communist, though he was closely associated with the Party. Kaufman says,
The matter of Guthrie&#x27;s membership, however, remains controversial. Scholar Ronald Radosh has written:

Similarly, writer and historian Aaron J. Leonard, in an article detailing Guthrie&#x27;s Party membership for the History News Network, quoted Pete Seeger:

Leonard, in his book &quot;The Folk Singers and the Bureau&quot; also documents how the FBI treated Guthrie as if he were a member, adding him to various iterations of their Security Index – and keeping him on it till well into the early 1960s.

After the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Guthrie took an anti-war U-turn and wrote one song describing the Soviet invasion of Poland as a favor to Polish farmers, and another attacking President Roosevelt&#x27;s loans to Finland to help it defend against the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion in the 1939 Winter War. His attitude switched again in 1941 after the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union.

==Musical legacy==
===Woody Guthrie Foundation===
The Woody Guthrie Foundation is a non-profit organization that serves as administrator and caretaker of the Woody Guthrie Archives. The archives house the largest collection of Guthrie material in the world. In 2013, the archives were relocated from New York City to the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after being purchased by the Tulsa-based George Kaiser Foundation. The Center officially opened on April 27, 2013. The Woody Guthrie Center features, in addition to the archives, a museum focused on the life and the influence of Guthrie through his music, writings, art, and political activities. The museum is open to the public; the archives are open only to researchers by appointment. The archives contains thousands of items related to Guthrie, including original artwork, books, correspondence, lyrics, manuscripts, media, notebooks, periodicals, personal papers, photographs, scrapbooks, and other special collections.

Guthrie&#x27;s unrecorded written lyrics housed at the archives have been the starting point of several albums including the Wilco and Billy Bragg albums &quot;Mermaid Avenue&quot; and &quot;Mermaid Avenue Vol. II&quot;, created in 1998 sessions at the invitation of Guthrie&#x27;s daughter Nora. Blackfire interpreted previously unreleased Guthrie lyrics. Jonatha Brooke&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;The Works&quot;, includes lyrics from the Woody Guthrie Archives set to music by Jonatha Brooke. The various artists compilation &quot;Note of Hope: A Celebration of Woody Guthrie&quot; was released in 2011. Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Yim Yames recorded her father&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;New Multitudes&quot; to honor the 100th anniversary of his birth and a box set of the Mermaid Avenue sessions was also released.

===Folk Festival===
The Woody Guthrie Folk Festival, also known as &quot;WoodyFest&quot;, is held annually since 1998 in mid-July to commemorate Guthrie&#x27;s life and music. The festival is held on the weekend closest to Guthrie&#x27;s birth date (July 14) in Guthrie&#x27;s hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma. Planned and implemented annually by the Woody Guthrie Coalition, a non-profit corporation, the goal is simply to ensure Guthrie&#x27;s musical legacy. The Woody Guthrie Coalition commissioned a local Creek Indian sculptor to cast a full-body bronze statue of Guthrie and his guitar, complete with the guitar&#x27;s well-known message reading, &quot;This machine kills fascists&quot;. The statue, sculpted by artist Dan Brook, stands along Okemah&#x27;s main street in the heart of downtown and was unveiled in 1998, the inaugural year of the festival.

===Jewish songs===
Guthrie&#x27;s second wife, Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother Aliza Greenblatt was a well-known Yiddish poet. Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics which can be linked to his close collaborative relationship with Aliza Greenblatt who lived near Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie, the Oklahoma troubadour, and Greenblatt, the Jewish wordsmith, often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other&#x27;s works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that arose from this unlikely relationship; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.

These lyrics were rediscovered by Nora Guthrie and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group The Klezmatics with the release of &quot;Happy Joyous Hanukkah&quot; on JMG Records in 2007. The Klezmatics also released &quot;Wonder Wheel – Lyrics by Woody Guthrie&quot;, an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band. The album, produced by Danny Blume, was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album.

===Legacy===
Since his death, artists have paid tribute to Guthrie by covering his songs or by dedicating songs to him. On January 20, 1968, three months after Guthrie&#x27;s death, Harold Leventhal produced &quot;A Tribute to Woody Guthrie&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. Performers included Jack Elliott, Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton, Bob Dylan and The Band, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens, Odetta, and others. Leventhal repeated the tribute on September 12, 1970, at the Hollywood Bowl. Recordings of both concerts were eventually released as LPs and later combined into one CD. A film of the Hollywood Bowl concert was discovered recently and issued as a DVD in 2019 [&#x27;Woody Guthrie All star tribute concert 1970&#x27;-(MVD Visual. MVD2331D,2019)]

The Irish folk singer Christy Moore was also strongly influenced by Woody Guthrie in his seminal 1972 album &quot;Prosperous&quot;, giving renditions of &quot;The Ludlow Massacre&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Song to Woody&quot;. Dylan also penned the poem &quot;Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie&quot; as a tribute. Andy Irvine—Moore&#x27;s bandmate in Irish folk group Planxty and lifelong admirer of Guthrie—wrote his tribute song &quot;Never Tire of the Road&quot; (released on the album &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;), which includes the chorus from a song Guthrie recorded in March 1944: &quot;You Fascists Are Bound to Lose&quot;. In 1986, Irvine also recorded both parts of Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Tom Joad&quot; together as a complete song—under the title of &quot;Tom Joad&quot;—on the first album released by his other band, Patrick Street. Bruce Springsteen also performed a cover of Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; on his live album &quot;Live 1975–1985&quot;. In the introduction to the song, Springsteen referred to it as &quot;just about one of the most beautiful songs ever written&quot;.

In 1979, Sammy Walker&#x27;s LP &quot;Songs From Woody&#x27;s Pen&quot; was released by Folkways Records. Though the original recordings of these songs date back more than 30 years, Walker sings them in a traditional folk-revivalist manner reminiscent of Guthrie&#x27;s social conscience and sense of humor. Speaking of Guthrie, Walker said: &quot;I can&#x27;t think of hardly anyone who has had as much influence on my own singing and songwriting as Woody.&quot;

In September 1996, Cleveland&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum and Case Western Reserve University cohosted &quot;Hard Travelin&#x27;: The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie&quot;, a 10-day conference of panel sessions, lectures, and concerts. The conference became the first in what would become the museum&#x27;s annual American Music Masters Series conference. Highlights included Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s keynote address, a Saturday night musical jamboree at Cleveland&#x27;s Odeon Theater, and a Sunday night concert at Severance Hall, the home of the Cleveland Orchestra. Musicians performing over the course of the conference included Arlo Guthrie, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, Pete Seeger, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, the Indigo Girls, Ellis Paul, Jimmy LaFave, Ani DiFranco, and others. In 1999, Wesleyan University Press published a collection of essays from the conference and DiFranco&#x27;s record label, Righteous Babe, released a compilation of the Severance Hall concert, &quot;Til We Outnumber &#x27;Em&quot;, in 2000.

From 1999 to 2002, the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service presented the traveling exhibit, &quot;This Land Is Your Land: The Life and Legacy of Woody Guthrie&quot;. In collaboration with Nora Guthrie, the Smithsonian exhibition draws from rarely seen objects, illustrations, film footage, and recorded performances to reveal a complex man who was at once poet, musician, protester, idealist, itinerant hobo, and folk legend.

In 2003, Jimmy LaFave produced a Woody Guthrie tribute show called &quot;Ribbon of Highway, Endless Skyway&quot;. The ensemble show toured around the country and included a rotating cast of singer-songwriters individually performing Guthrie&#x27;s songs. Interspersed between songs were Guthrie&#x27;s philosophical writings read by a narrator. In addition to LaFave, members of the rotating cast included Ellis Paul, Slaid Cleaves, Eliza Gilkyson, Joel Rafael, husband-wife duo Sarah Lee Guthrie (Woody Guthrie&#x27;s granddaughter) and Johnny Irion, Michael Fracasso, and The Burns Sisters. Oklahoma songwriter Bob Childers, sometimes called &quot;the Dylan of the Dust&quot;, served as narrator.

When word spread about the tour, performers began contacting LaFave, whose only prerequisite was to have an inspirational connection to Guthrie. Each artist chose the Guthrie songs that he or she would perform as part of the tribute. LaFave said, &quot;It works because all the performers are Guthrie enthusiasts in some form&quot;. The inaugural performance of the Ribbon of Highway tour took place on February 5, 2003, at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. The abbreviated show was a featured segment of &quot;Nashville Sings Woody&quot;, yet another tribute concert to commemorate the music of Woody Guthrie held during the Folk Alliance Conference. The cast of &quot;Nashville Sings Woody&quot;, a benefit for the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives, also included Arlo Guthrie, Marty Stuart, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Janis Ian, and others.

Woody and Marjorie Guthrie were honored at a musical celebration featuring Billy Bragg and the band Brad on October 17, 2007, at Webster Hall in New York City. Steve Earle also performed. The event was hosted by actor/activist Tim Robbins to benefit the Huntington&#x27;s Disease Society of America to commemorate the organization&#x27;s 40th Anniversary.

In &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, a 2007 biographical movie about Bob Dylan, one of the characters introduced in the film as segments of Dylan&#x27;s life is a young African-American boy who calls himself &quot;Woody Guthrie&quot;. The purpose of this particular character was a reference to Dylan&#x27;s youthful obsession with Guthrie. The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity. In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York (a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol, after learning of his whereabouts, while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s). Later, a sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; would spoof these visits, alleging that Dylan stole the line, &quot;They&#x27;ll stone you for playing your guitar!&quot; from Guthrie.

Pete Seeger had the Sloop &quot;Woody Guthrie&quot; built for an organization he founded, the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater. It was launched in 1978. Now operated by the Beacon Sloop Club, it serves to educate people about sailing and the history and environs of the Hudson River.

In 1988, Woody Guthrie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and, in 2000, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Guthrie was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2006, Guthrie was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. In 1987, &quot;Roll on Columbia&quot; was chosen as the official Washington State Folk Song, and in 2001 Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma Hills&quot; was chosen to be the official state folk song of Oklahoma.

On June 26, 1998, as part of its Legends of American Music series, the United States Postal Service issued 45 million 32-cent stamps honoring folk musicians Huddie Ledbetter, Guthrie, Sonny Terry and Josh White. The four musicians were represented on sheets of 20 stamps.

In July 2001, CB&#x27;s Gallery in New York City began hosting an annual Woody Guthrie Birthday Bash concert featuring multiple performers. This event moved to the Bowery Poetry Club in 2007 after CB&#x27;s Gallery and CBGB, its parent club, closed. The final concert in the series took place on July 14, 2012, Guthrie&#x27;s 100th birthday.

In January 2005, Canadian hip-hop artist Buck 65 released &quot;This Right Here Is Buck 65&quot;. Track 8 is a cover of &quot;Talking Fishing Blues&quot;.

In 2006, The Klezmatics set Jewish lyrics written by Guthrie to music. The resulting album, &quot;Wonder Wheel&quot;, won the Grammy award for best contemporary world music album.

On February 10, 2008, &quot;The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949&quot;, a rare live recording released in cooperation with the Woody Guthrie Foundation, was the recipient of a Grammy Award in the category Best Historical Album. Less than two years later, Guthrie was again nominated for a Grammy in the same category with the 2009 release of &quot;My Dusty Road&quot; on Rounder Records.

In the centennial year of Guthrie&#x27;s birth, another album of newly composed songs on his lyrics has been released: &quot;New Multitudes&quot;. On March 10, 2012, there was a tribute concert at the Brady Theater in Tulsa, Oklahoma. John Mellencamp, Arlo Guthrie, Sarah Lee Guthrie &amp; Johnny Irion, the Del McCoury Band and the Flaming Lips performed.

The Grammy Museum held a tribute week in April 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame a tribute in June. A four-disc box &quot;Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions&quot; by Billy Bragg and Wilco, with 17 unreleased songs and a documentary, was planned for April release.

On July 10, 2012, Smithsonian Folkways released &quot;Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection&quot;, a 150-page large-format book with three CDs containing 57 tracks. The set also contains 21 previously unreleased performances and six never before released original songs, including Woody&#x27;s first known—and recently discovered—recordings from 1937. The box set received two nominations for the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best Historical Album and Best Boxed Or Special Limited Edition Package. It also won an Independent Music Award for Best Compilation Album in 2013.

From February 18 through May 22, 2022, the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in Manhattan held an exhibition titled &quot;Woody Guthrie: People Are the Song&quot;

On September 30, 2022, Dropkick Murphys released &quot;This Machine Still Kills Fascists&quot;. The acoustic album consists of ten songs featuring unused lyrics by Guthrie. Nora Guthrie, Woody&#x27;s daughter, reached out to the band giving them exclusive access to her father&#x27;s archives. &quot;I collected lyrics on all kinds of topics … lyrics that seemed to be needed to be said — or screamed — today. Ken Casey is a master at understanding Woody&#x27;s lyrics, which can be complicated, long, deadly serious, or totally ridiculous. DKM is capable of delivering them all&quot; Nora Guthrie said.

Guthrie was portrayed by Scoot McNairy in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

<text>County Wicklow ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. The last of the traditional 32 counties, having been formed as late as 1606, it is part of the Eastern and Midland Region and the province of Leinster. It is bordered by the Irish Sea to the east and the counties of Wexford to the south, Carlow to the southwest, Kildare to the west, and South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown to the north.

Wicklow is named after its county town of Wicklow, which derives from the name (Old Norse for &quot;Vikings&#x27; Meadow&quot;). Wicklow County Council is the local authority for the county, which had a population of 155,258 at the 2022 census. Colloquially known as the &quot;Garden of Ireland&quot; for its scenerywhich includes extensive woodlands, nature trails, beaches, and ancient ruins while allowing for a multitude of walking, hiking, and climbing optionsit is the 17th largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by area and the 16th largest by population. It is also the fourth largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties by size and the fifth largest in terms of population.

==History==
=== Missions and monasteries ===

During the 5th century Saint Palladius, a bishop from Britain or Gaul was sent to &#x27;the Irish believing in Christ.&#x27; He and his companions landed at Wicklow harbour in the year 431 AD. Palladius founded three ancient churches at Donard, Tigroney and Colbinstown. Along with him came two clerics named St. Sylvester and Solonius who died and were buried at Donard. The local tribe in the area were called Cualann and their chief, a man named Naithi was opposed to these Christian missionaries. Despite this hostility however Palladius seems to have gained support elsewhere as he was able to erect those three churches in the Wicklow area. After a rather unsuccessful stay in the county St. Palladius departed Ireland and journeyed to Scotland.

A large number of early Irish saints male and female founded churches, monasteries and convents in Wicklow. Among them were St. Kevin, St. Dagan, St. Ernan, St. Credan, St. Baotan and the holy women St. Cainnear, St. Ceoltigherna, St. Fledh, St. Tartinna, St. Coine and St. Croine. The ancient monastery of Glendalough is located in the county.

=== 17th century onwards ===
County Wicklow was the last of the traditional counties of Ireland to be shired in 1606 from land previously part of counties Dublin and Carlow. Established as a distinct county, it was aimed at controlling local groups such as the O&#x27;Byrnes. The &quot;Military Road&quot;, stretching from Rathfarnham to Aghavannagh crosses the mountains, north to south, and was built by government forces to assist them in defeating the rebels still active in the Wicklow Mountains following the failed Irish Rebellion of 1798. It provided them with access to an area that had been a hotbed of Irish rebellion for centuries. Several barracks to house the soldiers were built along the route; in 1974 the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation was opened alongside the remains of Glencree barracks. Battalions of the Irish Army use firing ranges in County Wicklow for tactical exercises, especially the largest one in the Glen of Imaal which was previously used by the British Army prior to independence.

There was a brief Wicklow gold rush in the year 1795 near the village of Woodenbridge that lasted for a month, during which as many as 80 kilograms of gold was recovered by unlicensed prospectors before the government took over.

During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, local authorities immediately surrendered without a fight. During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, some of the United Irishmen insurgents took refuge in the Wicklow Mountains, resulting in clashes between British forces and rebels commanded by Joseph Holt near Aughrim and later at Arklow.

The boundaries of the county were extended in 1957 by the Local Government Act which &quot;detached lands from the County of Dublin and from the jurisdiction and powers of the Council of the County of Dublin&quot; near Bray and added them to the County of Wicklow.

=== Irish language ===
Wicklow was the first county in Ireland to lose the Irish language, with only around 2% of people speaking it in the 1770s. It was spoken on the Western slopes of the Wicklow Mountains in the 1790s. Andrew and Hannah Byrne of Glenealy, who both died in 1830, were among the last native speakers speaker in the county.

==Geography==
===Location===

Wicklow is part of the Eastern and Midland Region of Ireland, within the province of Leinster. It is bounded by four counties, Dublin to the north; Kildare and Carlow to the west; Wexford to the south; and the Irish Sea to the east. Wicklow is the 17th largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties by land area, and the 16th most populous. It is the fourth largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties by size and the fifth most populous. The county is named after the town of Wicklow, located approximately south of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland.
The Wicklow Mountains are Ireland&#x27;s largest continuous upland area and occupy a significant portion of the county, spanning the entire centre of Wicklow and stretching into Dublin and Wexford at their southern and northern fringes. Lugnaquilla, at above sea level, is the tallest peak in the range, the highest mountain in Ireland outside of County Kerry, and Ireland&#x27;s 13th-highest mountain overall. The Wicklow Mountains National Park, located in the middle of the county, is a dedicated protected area covering , making it the largest national park in Ireland. The Wicklow Way was the first long-distance trail in the State, and crosses the range for .

===Geology===
The Wicklow Mountains are centred on the Leinster batholith and are primarily composed of granite surrounded by an envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. Covering , the Leinster batholith is the most expansive mass of intrusive igneous rock in Ireland or Britain. The oldest rocks in the county are the quartzites of the Bray Group that include Bray Head and the Little Sugar Loaf and Great Sugar Loaf mountains. These metamorphosed from sandstone deposited in the deep waters of the primeval Iapetus Ocean during the Cambrian period (542-488 million years ago).

As with much of Ireland, Wicklow&#x27;s terrain was sculpted by successive periods of glaciation during the quaternary. Weathering and erosion by ice carved out long valleys known as glens (from the Irish &quot;gleann&quot;) such as Glenmacnass, Glen of the Downs, Glenmalure, Glen of Imaal, Glencree and Glendalough. The Irish Sea Ice-Sheet began to retreat shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum ca. 20,000–23,000 years ago but significant ice masses persisted in the Wicklow Mountains for another 4,000–7,000 years.

===Hydrology===

Major rivers include the River Liffey, Ireland&#x27;s 8th-longest river, which rises near Tonduff mountain and flows through the centre of Dublin City, reaching the Irish Sea at Dublin Bay. Its biggest tributary by volume, the River Dodder, rises along the northern slope of Kippure in the far north of the county, while the Kings River joins at Blessington Lakes. Multiple other Liffey tributaries flow within the county.

The River Slaney, which starts at Lugnaquilla, flows west and then south before reaching St George&#x27;s Channel at Wexford town. The Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers join to form the Avoca River at the &quot;Meeting of the Waters&quot; in the Vale of Avoca. The River Derreen in the south of the county defines a section of the border with Carlow.
Most of the county&#x27;s lakes (or loughs) are glacially derived ribbon and corrie lakes found in scenic trough valleys surrounded by mountains, making them popular with tourists. Notable lakes in the county include Glendalough Upper Lake, Lough Tay (&#x27;The Guinness Lake&#x27;), Lough Ouler (&#x27;The Heart-shaped Lake&#x27;), Lough Bray, Lough Dan and Lough Nahanagan.

Poulaphouca Reservoir is the largest of Wicklow&#x27;s lakes, covering in the west of the county. It is the largest artificial lake in Ireland and was created following the damming of the River Liffey at Poulaphouca in 1940. The village of Ballinahown was completed submerged by the reservoir and its 70 families were relocated. Ruins of the old village including buildings, fences and farm machinery can be seen during droughts when water levels in the reservoir diminish. The lower Vartry Reservoir, constructed between 1862 and 1868, is the county&#x27;s second largest lake.

===Coast===

Wicklow has a relatively short coastline, at in length. Wicklow&#x27;s coastline is mostly straight, with few sizable bays or inlets and no offshore islands, giving it a shorter coastline than smaller counties like Louth and Dublin. Wicklow Head is the county&#x27;s most prominent coastal headland, and is also the most easterly mainland point of the Republic of Ireland. Wicklow&#x27;s east coast is a popular domestic summer holiday destination, and the county has numerous beaches including Brittas Bay, Clogga Beach, The Cove, Silver Strand Beach, Sallymount Bay Beach, Ennereilly Beach, Newcastle Beach, Arklow&#x27;s Porter&#x27;s Rock Beach and South Beach, Greystones North and South Beaches, Bray Strand, and Magheramore Beach.

===Forest===
The county has roughly of wooded area, the 8th highest total forest cover in Ireland. In terms of forest cover as a proportion of land area, Wicklow ranks second in the country, at 18.5%. Known as the &quot;Garden of Ireland&quot;, Wicklow was historically the county with the highest percentage of woodlands. The 2017 National Forestry Inventory revealed that County Leitrim had overtaken it for the first time. Wicklow is in a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome, although the majority of Wicklow&#x27;s forests are commercial conifers. The economic tree line in the region is around , above which hill farming and blanket bog dominates.

===Urban development===
In terms of urban development, Wicklow County Council imposes the most stringent planning restrictions in Ireland. In order to build a house outside of the main towns, a person must be &quot;born and bred in the area, or have lived there for a period of 10 years&quot; and must also demonstrate that the house is for their own housing needs, rather than for resale. Further, potential buyers in rural areas must be approved by the council before the homeowner is allowed to sell to them. The primary justification for these restrictions is to avoid one-off housing or other poorly planned developments which could put a strain on the county&#x27;s infrastructure and degrade its natural environment.

===Climate===
The climate of Wicklow is temperate oceanic (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot; in most areas, and &quot;Cfc&quot; oceanic subpolar in some highland areas), with cool, humid summers, and mild, wet winters. The climate of the eastern portion of the county is moderated by the Irish Sea and averages milder winters and cooler summers, while the western inland portion along the Kildare border experiences warmer summers and colder winters. The county&#x27;s upland interior experiences significantly lower temperatures and higher rainfall year-round. Snow typically falls from December to March, but most low-lying and coastal areas see only a few days of lying snow per year, or may see no snow at all during some winters. The Wicklow Mountains region is the snowiest part of Ireland and can experience 50 or more days of snowfall each year.
The county experiences a narrow annual temperature range. Typical daytime highs range from throughout the county in July and August, with overnight lows in the range, although temperatures in the mountains can be lower. Mean January temperatures range from on the coast to at high elevations. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, although the wettest months (October and November) receive roughly twice as much rain as the driest months (February, March and April). The driest area of Wicklow is the northeast corner of the county, which is protected from the prevailing south-westerly winds by the Wicklow Mountains and receives around of rainfall per year. The coastal region of County Dublin immediately to the north is the driest location in all of Ireland as a result of the rain shadow created by the mountains.

Easterly winds can occur between February and May, and are often associated with extreme snowfall events such as the 2018 &quot;Beast from the East&quot; and the &quot;Big Snow of 1947&quot;. Much of Wicklow is very vulnerable to heavy snowfall and the county is typically the hardest hit by such events, with some areas recording over of snow. During the winter of 1947, residents of Rathdrum called upon the Irish Red Cross to drop them food parcels by plane as the village had been inaccessible by road for over a month due to heavy snow.

Wicklow is occasionally affected by hurricanes, although they are usually extratropical storms by the time they reach Ireland. On 24 August 1986, during Hurricane Charley, of rain fell over a 24-hour period at Kippure on the Wicklow-Dublin border, the greatest daily rainfall total ever recorded in Ireland. The hurricane caused severe flooding and up to 1,000 homes had to be evacuated in Bray alone. Other major floods in Wicklow which resulted in loss of life occurred in 1886–87, 1931, 1965 and 2011.
===Subdivisions===
====Baronies====
There are eight historic baronies in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;. The largest barony in Wicklow is Lower Talbotstown, at , and the smallest barony is Rathdown, at .

==Demographics==
===Population===
As of the 2016 census, the resident population of Wicklow was 142,425, a 4.2% increase since the Census of Ireland 2011. The county&#x27;s population is one of the fastest growing in the country, increasing 38.7 percent in the 20 years between 1996 and 2016. However, its share of the Mid East&#x27;s population has steadily fallen as Meath and Kildare have experienced even more rapid population growth. While Bray remains by far the largest town in the county, improved transport links to Dublin such as upgrades to the M11 and the completion of the M50 in 2005 encouraged the growth of towns further south. Between 2002 and 2016 Bray grew by 5.3 percent. By contrast, over the same period Arklow grew by 32.2 percent, Greystones grew by 53.3 percent and Rathnew grew by 133.9%.

The most densely populated areas of the county are concentrated in the northeast, with over 50 percent of Wicklow&#x27;s residents living within of the Dublin border. Many of the county&#x27;s largest urban areas are clustered in this region along an axis stretching from Bray to Newtownmountkennedy, which incorporates Greystones, Delgany, Enniskerry, Kilmacanogue, Kilpedder and Kilcoole. Outside of this region, Wicklow, Rathnew and Arklow are the only sizable towns in the eastern portion of the county, while Blessington is the only large settlement in west Wicklow.

The county&#x27;s interior is very sparsely populated, with only a few small settlements located in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains such as Rathdrum, Laragh, Roundwood and Tinahely. Most small areas in central Wicklow have a population density of less than 20 people per km2, compared with an average of 77 people per km2 in the county as a whole.

The gender makeup of the county in 2016 was 50.74% female and 49.26% male. 29.0% of the population were under the age of 19; 58% were between the ages of 19 and 64; and 13.0% were 65 years of age or older.

Whites of any ethnic background constituted 95.2% of the population in 2016: 86.0% were White Irish, 0.6% Irish Traveller, and 8.6% White of any other background.

Asians were the second largest ethnic group, comprising 1.6% of the county&#x27;s population, followed by mixed race or other backgrounds at 1.2%. Just over 2,300 people (1.6%) did not state their ethnicity.

Accounting for just 0.4% of the population, Wicklow has by far the lowest percentage of black residents in the Greater Dublin Area. The 2016 census recorded 524 black residents in Wicklow, of which 408 (78%) were of African descent and 116 (22%) were of other black backgrounds.

===Urban areas===

The 2016 census recorded that 65 percent of Wicklow&#x27;s residents lived in urban areas (settlements with a population greater than 1,500) and 35 percent lived in rural areas. Of Wicklow&#x27;s rural population, roughly 26 percent (36,800 people) live in the open countryside outside of any designated settlements, while 9 percent (13,032 people) live in settlements with less than 1,500 people. According to the CSO report &quot;Urban and Rural Life in Ireland 2019&quot;, Wicklow (alongside Kildare) has the highest proportion of residents living in satellite towns.

The 10 largest settlements in the county are listed below. The county town is marked in bold.
===Migration===
As of 2016, around 85% of Wicklow&#x27;s population was born within the Republic of Ireland, and a further 0.9% was born in Northern Ireland. Just over 38% of Wicklow&#x27;s usually resident population was born within the county, making it the second least indigenous county in Ireland, after Meath. While around 35% of the county&#x27;s population was born in neighbouring Dublin, it is likely that a significant portion of these are Wicklow natives who were born in one of Dublin&#x27;s many hospitals.

People born in the United Kingdom are by far the largest immigrant group, comprising 5.9% of Wicklow&#x27;s population (8,388 people). Of this group, only around half (4,045 people) stated that they were either UK or dual Irish-UK citizens. The Poles are the second largest immigrant group, constituting 2.0% of the county&#x27;s population. The census recorded 2,905 Polish citizens in Wicklow, of which 2,759 were born in Poland. The fastest growing major immigrant groups between 2011 and 2016 were Romanians, Indians and Filipinos. There was also a large increase in the number of Brazilians (+107%), Italians (+59%) and Spaniards (+53%) living in Wicklow over this period.


===Religion===

The 2016 census showed that religious affiliation in Wicklow was as follows: Catholic 73%, Irreligion 13.3%, Other Christian 8.8%, Other stated religions 3.1%, and not stated 1.8%.

The single largest religious denomination in 2016 was the Roman Catholic Church, with 103,947 adherents. This is a 4.4% decrease from the 2011 census. Catholicism in Wicklow reached its peak percentage in the 1961 census, when 87.5% of the population identified as Catholic. As of 2016, Wicklow is the second least Catholic county in the State, and among the most irreligious.

Other Christian denominations comprised 8.8% of the population. As a proportion of population, Wicklow has the largest Church of Ireland affiliation of any county in the Republic of Ireland, at 6.2%, although this figure was historically much higher. The 1901 census recorded that just under 20% of Wicklow&#x27;s population was affiliated with the Church of Ireland. In 2016 Greystones had the highest percentage of Protestants in the State (10.5%), and was also Ireland&#x27;s least religious town, with 18.3% of residents stating they did not follow any religion.

Just over 0.5% of the population adhered to smaller Protestant denominations such as Presbyterian, Apostolic and Pentecostal. A further 1.05% of respondents stated that they were &quot;Christian&quot; but did not specify any denomination. Eastern Orthodox is the fastest growing of the major Christian denominations, increasing from 840 adherents in 2011 to 1,317 in 2016, a 56.7% increase.

The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (0.4%) and Hinduism (0.16%). All other stated religions constituted 2.5% of the population, and 1.8% of respondents did not state their religion.

==Economy==
===Built environment===
Wicklow is home to several major water supply and hydroelectric facilities. The Turlough Hill pumped-storage scheme, a significant civil engineering project, was carried out in the mountains in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Leisure and tourism===
Wicklow, often called &quot;The Garden of Ireland&quot;, has been a popular tourist destination for many years, due to its scenery, beaches, walking, hiking and climbing options, and attractions including the ruins of the monastic city of Glendalough, Wicklow Gaol and water-based activities on reservoirs and the coast.

The Wicklow Way is the oldest waymarked long-distance walking trail in Ireland.

The popular annual mass participation bike ride Wicklow 200 has taken place in the county every year since 1982.

==Governance and politics==
===Local government===

The local government authority is Wicklow County Council which returns 32 councillors from six local electoral areas: Arklow, Baltinglass, Bray East, Bray West, Greystones, and Wicklow. Wicklow County Council sends three members to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, where it is part of the Eastern Strategic Planning Area.

===Former districts===
County Wicklow was formerly divided into the rural districts of Baltinglass No. 1, Rathdown No. 2, Rathdrum, and Shillelagh, and the urban districts of Arklow, Bray and Wicklow. The rural districts were abolished in 1925. Greystones, in the former rural district of Rathdown No. 2, was given town commissioners in 1984. The urban districts of Arklow, Bray and Wicklow and the town commissioners of Greystones became town councils in 2002. All town councils in Ireland were abolished in 2014.

===National politics===
The whole county is in the Dáil constituency of Wicklow (5 seats).

==Transportation==
===Road===
Wicklow has a well-maintained network of regional roads which connect the county&#x27;s western portion to its eastern portion, cross-cutting the Wicklow Mountains from east to west. Several north-south regional roads also traverse the mountains, providing amenity access to the county&#x27;s interior.

The county is also serviced by a National secondary road (N81) in western Wicklow, and a National primary road (N11) in eastern Wicklow which becomes a motorway at Junction 14 north of Ashford. The N11/M11 is the main route used by Wicklow commuters heading northbound to Dublin. Southbound traffic can also be heavy on weekends due to the influx of Dublin visitors into Wicklow and Wexford.

Major routes include:
* N11/M11 – Runs near the east coast for , linking Dublin and Wexford. Becomes the M11 at Junction 14 north of Ashford.
* N81 – National secondary road that runs from Dublin to Tullow, crossing through western Wicklow from Blessington to Baltinglass.
* R115 – Ireland&#x27;s highest paved mountain pass. Follows the route of the old Military Road, constructed by the British Army from 1800 to 1809 to put down insurgents in the Wicklow mountains. Terminates at Laragh.

==Culture==
===Architecture===

The vernacular architecture of County Wicklow conformed to that of Ireland as a whole. Unlike neighbouring County Wexford however, Wicklow was not a county generally associated with thatched roofing. Historian Christiaan Corlett contends that thatch was &quot;formerly very common in Wicklow until about the 1930s&quot;, when afterwards &quot;during the 1930s, 40s and 50s the fashion in Wicklow was to replace thatch roofs with galvanised ones&quot;. Sometimes the old thatched roof was kept in place underneath the sheets of galvanising to act as a layer of insulation and dampen the noise of heavy rain.

===Media===

Mermaid, County Wicklow Arts Centre is based in Bray. Mermaid is the county&#x27;s hub of artistic activity and creation, offering a programme in many art forms: visual arts, theatre productions, opera, dance performances, arthouse cinema, comedy and a music programme. Two of the county&#x27;s festivals take place in Arklow, the Arklow Music Festival and the Arklow Seabreeze Festival.

The county is a popular film-making location in Ireland. Bray is home to Ardmore Studios, where many of Ireland&#x27;s best known feature films, including John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Zardoz&quot;, Jim Sheridan&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, &quot;Rawhead Rex&quot;, and several Neil Jordan films, have been shot. The BBC series &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; was also filmed in County Wicklow. Scenes from the movie &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; were shot in the Wicklow Mountains National Park while several scenes from other movies, from &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; to &quot;Haywire&quot;, have been filmed in the county.

<text>Coregonus is a diverse genus of fish in the salmon family (Salmonidae). The &quot;Coregonus&quot; species are known as whitefishes. The genus contains at least 68 described extant taxa, but the true number of species is a matter of debate. The type species of the genus is &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;.

Most &quot;Coregonus&quot; species inhabit lakes and rivers, and several species, including the Arctic cisco (&quot;C. autumnalis&quot;), the Bering cisco (&quot;C. laurettae&quot;), and the least cisco (&quot;C. sardinella&quot;) are anadromous, moving between salt water and fresh water.

Many whitefish species or ecotypes, especially from the Great Lakes and the Alpine lakes of Europe, have gone extinct over the past century or are endangered. Among 12 freshwater fish considered extinct in Europe, 6 are &quot;Coregonus&quot;. All &quot;Coregonus&quot; species are protected under appendix III of the Bern Convention, and Annex IV of the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC)

== Taxonomy ==
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that the most basal member of the genus is the highly endangered Atlantic whitefish (&quot;C. huntsmani&quot;), which is endemic to a single river basin in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Atlantic whitefish is thought to have diverged from the rest of the genus during the mid-Miocene, about 15 million years ago.

The genus was previously subdivided into two subgenera &quot;Coregonus&quot; (&quot;true whitefishes&quot;) and &quot;Leucichthys&quot; (&quot;ciscoes&quot;), &quot;Coregonus&quot; comprising taxa with sub-terminal mouth and usually a benthic feeding habit, &quot;Leucichthys&quot; those with terminal or supra-terminal mouth and usually a pelagic plankton-feeding habit. This classification is not natural however: based on molecular data, ciscoes comprise two distinct lineages within the genus. Moreover, the genus &quot;Stenodus&quot; is not phylogenetically distinct from &quot;Coregonus&quot;; although &quot;Stenodus&quot; occupies a basal position within the genus, phylogenetic evidence indicates that &quot;C. huntsmani&quot; is even more basal than it.

The scientific name given to this genus of fish comes from the Greek (&quot;kórē&quot;) &quot;daughter ; eye pupil&quot; and (&quot;gōnía&quot;) &quot;angle&quot;, because their pupil makes an angle, even though they share this feature with a large number of other fish.

=== Species diversity ===
There is much uncertainty and confusion in the classification of the many species of this genus. Particularly, one extreme view of diversity recognises just two main species in Northern and Central Europe, the common whitefish &quot;C. lavaretus&quot; and the vendace &quot;C. albula&quot;, whereas others would divide these into numerous, often narrowly distributed species. A drastic increase in number of recognized species occurred in 2007, when a review advocated that more than 50 local European populations should be considered as distinct based on morphological differences. It has been estimated that several of them are very young, having separated from each other less than 15,000 years ago. Many of these were primarily defined based on number of gill rakers. Although this largely is hereditary, the number is highly variable (even within single populations and species), can change relatively fast in response to changes and genetic studies have shown that they often are of limited use in predicting relationships among populations (a large difference in gill raker number does not necessarily equal a distant relationship). Genetic differences between several of the recently proposed species, even ones that are relatively distinct morphologically, are very limited and sometimes they are not monophyletic. Various &quot;Coregonus&quot;, whether regarded as separate species or not, readily interbreed with each other. A review of whitefish in the United Kingdom found that the identification key provided in 2007 did not match most individuals and that solid evidence for more than one species in that region is lacking.

Many European lakes have more than one &quot;Coregonus&quot; morph differing in ecology and morphology (especially gill rakers). Such morphs are sometimes partially reproductively isolated from each other, leading to suggestions of recognizing them as separate but clinal species. The morphs or clinal species may rapidly disappear (in 15 years or less, equalling three &quot;Coregonus&quot; generations) by merging into a single in response to changes in the habitat. A similar pattern can be seen in North America where the ciscoes of the &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; complex in the Great Lakes and elsewhere comprise several, often co-occurring morphs or ecotypes, whose taxonomic status remains controversial.

=== Species ===
In 2017, FishBase listed 78 species, including the more than 50 proposed for Europe in 2007. Some of these are recently extinct (marked with a dagger, &quot;†&quot;) and &quot;C. reighardi&quot; is likely extinct.

<text> ( , literally &quot;martial arts and chivalry&quot;) is a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China. Although is traditionally a form of historical fantasy literature, its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera, manhua, television dramas, films, and video games. It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world. According to Hong Kong film director, producer, and movie writer Ronny Yu, wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies.

The word &quot;&quot; is a compound composed of the elements (, literally &quot;martial&quot;, &quot;military&quot;, or &quot;armed&quot;) and (, literally &quot;chivalrous&quot;, &quot;vigilante&quot; or &quot;hero&quot;). A martial artist who follows the code of is often referred to as a (, literally &quot;follower of &quot;) or (, literally &quot;wandering &quot;). In some translations, the martial artist is referred to as a () or (), either of which can be interpreted as a &quot;swordsman&quot; or &quot;swordswoman&quot;, even though they may not necessarily wield a sword.

The heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord, wield military power, or belong to the aristocratic class. They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove oppressors, and bring retribution for past misdeeds. Chinese traditions may be compared to martial codes from other cultures, such as the Japanese samurai .

==History==
===Earlier precedents===
Even though the term &quot;wuxia&quot; as the name of a genre is a recent coinage, stories about xia date back more than 2,000 years. Wuxia stories have their roots in some early youxia tales from 300–200 BC. The Legalist philosopher Han Fei spoke disparagingly of youxias in his book &quot;Han Feizi&quot; in the chapter &quot;On Five &#x27;Maggot&#x27; Classes&quot; about five social classes in the Spring and Autumn period. Some well-known stories include Zhuan Zhu&#x27;s assassination of King Liao of Wu, and most notably, Jing Ke&#x27;s attempt on the life of the King of Qin (who later became Qin Shi Huang). In Volume 86 of the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (&quot;Shi Ji&quot;), Sima Qian mentioned five notable assassins – Cao Mo, Zhuan Zhu, Yu Rang, Nie Zheng and Jing Ke – in the Warring States period who undertook tasks of conducting political assassinations of aristocrats and nobles. These assassins were known as &quot;cike&quot; (刺客; literally &quot;stabbing guests&quot;). They usually rendered their loyalties and services to feudal lords and nobles in return for rewards such as riches and women. In Volume 124 of the &quot;Shi Ji&quot;, Sima Qian detailed several embryonic features of xia culture from his period. These popular phenomena were also documented in other historical records such as the &quot;Book of Han&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;.

Xiake stories made a turning point in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and returned in the form of &quot;chuanqi&quot; (傳奇; literally &quot;legendary tales&quot;). Stories from that era, such as &quot;Nie Yinniang&quot; (聶隱娘), &quot;The Kunlun Slave&quot;, &quot;Thirteenth Madame Jing&quot; (&quot;荊十三娘&quot;), &quot;Red String&quot; (紅線) and &quot;The Bearded Warrior&quot; (虬髯客), served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories. They featured fantasies and isolated protagonists – usually loners – who performed daring heroic deeds. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), similar stories circulated in the &quot;huaben&quot;, short works that were once thought to have served as prompt-books for &quot;shuochang&quot; (traditional Chinese storytelling).

The genre of the martial or military romance also developed during the Tang dynasty. In the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai&#x27;an wrote &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot; respectively, which are among the Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. The former is a romanticised historical retelling of the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, while the latter criticises the deplorable socio-economic status of the late Northern Song dynasty. &quot;Water Margin&quot; is often seen as the first full-length wuxia novel: the portrayal of the 108 heroes, and their code of honour and willingness to become outlaws rather than serve a corrupt government, played an influential role in the development of jianghu (Jianghu is the setting that wuxia stories inhabit. Literally meaning &quot;rivers and lakes&quot;, Jianghu settings are fictionalized versions of China which focus on social underworlds and the marginalized figures which inhabit them.&quot;) culture in later centuries. &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is also seen as a possible early antecedent and contains classic close-combat descriptions that were later emulated by wuxia writers in their works

In the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), further developments were the &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; (公案; literally &quot;public case&quot;) and related detective novels, where xia and other heroes, in collaboration with a judge or magistrate, solved crimes and battled injustice. The Justice Bao stories from &quot;Sanxia Wuyi&quot; (三俠五義; later extended and renamed to &quot;Qixia Wuyi&quot;) and &quot;Xiaowuyi&quot; (小五義), incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories. Xiayi stories of chivalrous romance, which frequently featured female heroes and supernatural fighting abilities, also surfaced during the Qing dynasty. Novels such as &quot;Shi Gong&#x27;an Qiwen&quot; (施公案奇聞) and &quot;Ernü Yingxiong Zhuan&quot; (兒女英雄傳) have been cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels.

The term &quot;wuxia&quot; as a genre label itself first appeared at the end of the Qing dynasty, a calque of the Japanese &quot;bukyō&quot;, a genre of oft-militaristic and bushido-influenced adventure fiction. The term was brought to China by writers such as Liang Qichao and students who hoped that China would modernise its military and place emphasis on martial virtues, and it quickly became entrenched as the term used to refer to xiayi and other predecessors of wuxia proper. In Japan, however, the term &quot;bukyō&quot; faded into obscurity.

Many wuxia works produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to the governments&#x27; crackdown on and banning of such works. Wuxia works like &quot;Water Margin&quot; were deemed responsible for brewing anti-government sentiments, which led to rebellions in those eras. The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati, which led to the stifling of the development of the wuxia genre. Nonetheless, the wuxia genre remained enormously popular with the common people.

===20th century===
The modern wuxia genre rose to prominence in the early 20th century after the May Fourth Movement of 1919. A new literature evolved, calling for a break with Confucian values, and the xia emerged as a symbol of personal freedom, defiance to Confucian tradition, and rejection of the Chinese family system.

Xiang Kairan (pen name Pingjiang Buxiaosheng) became the first notable wuxia writer, with his debut novel being &quot;The Peculiar Knights-Errant of the Jianghu&quot; (江湖奇俠傳). It was serialised from 1921 to 1928 and was adapted into the first wuxia film, &quot;The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple&quot; (1928). Zhao Huanting (趙煥亭), who wrote &quot;Chronicles of the Loyal Knights-Errant&quot; (奇俠精忠傳, serialised 1923–27), was another well-known wuxia writer based in Shanghai. Starting from the 1930s, wuxia works proliferated and its centre shifted to Beijing and Tianjin in northern China. The most prolific writers there were collectively referred to as the &quot;Five Great Masters of the Northern School&quot; (北派五大家): Huanzhulouzhu, who wrote &quot;The Swordspeople from Shu Mountains&quot; (蜀山劍俠傳); Gong Baiyu (宮白羽), who wrote &quot;Twelve Coin Darts&quot; (十二金錢鏢); Wang Dulu, who wrote &quot;The Crane-Iron Pentalogy&quot; (鹤鉄五部作); Zheng Zhengyin (郑証因), who wrote &quot;The King of Eagle Claws&quot; (鹰爪王); Zhu Zhenmu (朱貞木), who wrote &quot;The Seven &#x27;Kill&#x27; Stele&quot; (七殺碑).

Wuxia fiction was banned at various times during the Republican era and these restrictions stifled the growth of the genre. In 1949, China also banned martial arts novels as vulgar reading. In Taiwan, the government banned several wuxia works in 1959. Despite this, wuxia prevailed in other Chinese-speaking regions. In Hong Kong, between the 1960s and 1980s, the genre entered a golden age. Writers such as Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha (Jin Yong) spearheaded the founding of a &quot;new school&quot; of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors. They wrote serials for newspapers and magazines. They also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures. In Taiwan, Wolong Sheng, Sima Ling, Zhuge Qingyun (諸葛青雲), Shiao Yi (萧逸) and Gu Long became the region&#x27;s best known wuxia writers. After them, writers such as Woon Swee Oan and Huang Yi rose to prominence in a later period. Chen Yu-hui is a contemporary female wuxia novelist who made her debut with the novel &quot;The Tian-Guan Duo Heroes&quot; (天觀雙俠).

There have also been works created after the 1980s which attempt to create a post-wuxia genre. Yu Hua, one of the more notable writers from this period, published a counter-genre short story titled &quot;Blood and Plum Blossoms&quot;, in which the protagonist goes on a quest to avenge his murdered father.

Wuxia as a genre has also spread to Korean literature. The shared themes in both culture seem to be honor, revenge, martial sects and mystical prowess. While Chinese wuxia stories incorporate Daoist and Buddhist philosophy, Korean adaptations tend to put more weight in Confucius principles. Korean historical dramas depict martial arts but tend to downplay the mysticism though there are stories where it is instead embraced like the series &quot;Gu family book&quot;. The influence of Wuxia can also be found in games, manhwa and light novel in which the settings are depicted in ancient times with distinct wuxia aesthetics.

==Themes, plots and settings==

Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre-modern China. The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or mainly for use as a backdrop. Elements of fantasy, such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings, are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre. However, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as the characters must know some form of martial arts. Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales.

A typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy – such as the loss of his loved ones – and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong&#x27;s works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.

Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts school. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him. Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.

Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long&#x27;s works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi&#x27;s stories are blended with science fiction.

Despite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist&#x27;s progression from childhood to adulthood instead. The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Jin Yong&#x27;s &quot;The Smiling, Proud Wanderer&quot;, where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master.

===Code of xia===
The eight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence, justice, individualism, loyalty, courage, truthfulness, disregard for wealth, and desire for glory. Apart from individualism, these characteristics are similar to Confucian values such as &quot;ren&quot; (仁; &quot;benevolence&quot;, &quot;kindness&quot;), &quot;zhong&quot; (忠; &quot;loyalty&quot;), &quot;yong&quot; (勇; &quot;courage&quot;, &quot;bravery&quot;) and &quot;yi&quot; (義; &quot;righteousness&quot;). The code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of &quot;en&quot; (恩; &quot;grace&quot;, &quot;favour&quot;) from others, as well as seeking &quot;chou&quot; (仇; &quot;vengeance&quot;, &quot;revenge&quot;) to bring villains to justice. However, the importance of vengeance is controversial, as a number of wuxia works stress Buddhist ideals, which include forgiveness, compassion and a prohibition on killing. While borrowing ideas from the better known Confucian values, the root of Xia originated from the lesser known Mohism, which in the Warring States period saw a few Mohists stood up to defend kingdoms being attacked by other kingdoms.

In the jianghu, martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master (Shifu). This gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master-apprentice relations as well as the various schools such as Shaolin and Wudang. If there are any disputes between fighters, they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels.

===Skills and abilities===
The martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life Chinese martial arts. In wuxia tales, however, the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess.

The following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter in a wuxia story possesses:

* Martial arts (武功): Fighting techniques in a codified sequence called &quot;zhaoshi&quot; (招式), which are based on real life Chinese martial arts.
* Weapons and objects: Combatants use a wide range of weapons in combat. The most commonly used ones are the &quot;dao&quot; (broadsword or saber), &quot;jian&quot; (sword), &quot;gun&quot; (staff), and &quot;qiang&quot; (spear). Everyday objects such as abaci, benches, fans, ink brushes, smoking pipes, sewing needles, or various musical instruments, are also used as weapons as well.
* &quot;Qinggong&quot; (轻功): A form of real Chinese martial arts. In wuxia fiction, however, its use is exaggerated to the point that characters can circumvent gravity to fly, cover tremendous distances in a single stride, run across surfaces of water, mount trees, and jump over or scale high walls.
* &quot;Neili&quot; (内力; lit &quot;internal force&quot; or &quot;internal strength&quot;)/&quot;Neigong&quot; (內功; literally &quot;internal skill&quot; or &quot;internal function&quot;): The ability to build up and cultivate inner energy known as &quot;qi&quot; and use it for offensive or defensive purposes. Characters use this energy to attain skills such as superhuman strength, speed, stamina, endurance, and healing, as well as the ability to project energy beams and elemental forces from their bodies.
* &quot;Dianxue&quot; (點穴; literally &quot;touching acupuncture points&quot;): Characters use various acupuncture techniques to kill, paralyse, immobilise or even manipulate opponents by attacking their acupressure points with their bare hands or weapons. Such techniques can also be used for healing purposes, such as halting excessive bleeding. Real life martial artists do use such techniques to paralyse or stun their opponents. However, their effectiveness is highly exaggerated in wuxia stories.

In wuxia stories, characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise, but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his energy to them. The instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as &quot;miji&quot; (秘笈). In some stories, specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters.

==Menpai (门派)==
Menpai is often translated as sect, school, society, church, house, or cult. Members of the same menpai follow the guidance and train under the same leader. If the members of the menpai are related, then it can be translated as clan. Since some of the menpai are religiously affiliated, &quot;sect&quot; has come to be a common translation for the non-family based menpai. However, it would be inaccurate to use sect to denote menpais that are not associated with religion.

==Literature==
Notable modern wuxia writers include:
==Comics==
New and original wuxia writings have dwindled significantly in modern times, particularly so as patronage and readerships of the genre decimated due to readily available alternatives in entertainment such as DVDs, gaming consoles, and other newer forms of entertainment. However, the genre has persisted in the form of manhua (Chinese comics) in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan, with the core essentials of the wuxia genre living on in weekly editions equivalent to the Japanese manga.
Some notable comic artists are listed as follows:
==Film and television==

The earliest wuxia films date back to the 1920s. Extant early wuxia films produced in China include &quot;Red Heroine&quot; (1929), &quot;Woman Warrior White Rose&quot; (1929), and &quot;Woman Warrior of the Wild River 6: Rumble at Deerhorn Gully&quot; (1930), the sixth film in a series. &quot;Hua Mu Lan&quot; (1939), another surviving film, is considered a representative of the second wave of wuxia films, during the Anti-Japanese War. Films directed by King Hu and produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped-up camera techniques. The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature.

Cheng Pei-pei, Jimmy Wang and Connie Chan are among the better known wuxia movie stars in the 1960s–70s, when films made by King Hu and the Shaw Brothers Studio were most prominent. More recent wuxia movie actors and actresses include Jet Li, Brigitte Lin, Michelle Yeoh, Donnie Yen, Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi. Yuen Woo-ping is a choreographer who achieved fame by crafting action-sequences in wuxia films.

Wuxia was introduced to Hollywood studios in 2000 by Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, though influence of the genre was previously seen in the United States in the 1970s television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Following in Lee&#x27;s footsteps, Zhang Yimou made &quot;Hero&quot;, targeted for the international market in 2002, &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; in 2004, &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Shadow&quot; in 2018. Western audiences were also introduced to wuxia through Asian television stations in larger cities, which featured miniseries such as &quot;Warriors of the Yang Clan&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot;, often with English subtitles.

&quot;Ash Is Purest White&quot; (Chinese: 江湖儿女; &#x27;Sons and Daughters of Jianghu&#x27;), a 2018 Chinese drama directed by Jia Zhangke, is a modern film that refers to the underworld interpretation of jianghu. It was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. The story is loosely based on the leader of a gang from Jia Zhangke&#x27;s childhood, whom he had admired as a role model. Like the rest of Jia&#x27;s films, it opened to widespread acclaim.

There have been Western attempts at the genre, such as the 2008 film &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot;, which starred Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michael Angarano; other movies including wuxia elements are the first three in &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series (1999–2003, the fourth film from 2021 was choreographed by Joshua Grothe) and the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films from 2003 to 2004, all of which were choregraphed by Yuen Woo-ping. Perhaps the most successful example was DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s media franchise &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;. Created as an earnest, if humorous, emulation by producers who were knowledgeable admirers of the genre, the series has been particularly hailed in China as an excellent contribution to the form. From the 1990s–2000s, Hong Kong stars Daniel Wu and Stephen Fung have worked with AMC Networks to bring wuxia to a US television audience with &quot;Into the Badlands&quot;, which premiered in 2015 and ran for three seasons.

In 2013, Keanu Reeves directed and starred as the main antagonist in &quot;Man of Tai Chi&quot;, with Tiger Chen as a martial artist attending underground fights. The &quot;Mulan&quot; remake in 2020 was Disney&#x27;s attempt in making a wuxia movie. In 2021, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Shang-Chi&quot; opens with a wuxia sequence and has action sequences inspired by Jackie Chan.

==Video games==
Some notable wuxia video games of the action RPG genre include &quot;The Legend of Sword and Fairy&quot;, &quot;Xuan-Yuan Sword&quot;, &quot;Jade Empire&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom of Paradise&quot;, all of which blend wuxia with elements of Chinese mythology and fantasy. &quot;The Legend of Sword and Fairy&quot;, in particular, expanded into a franchise of eight video games, two of which were adapted into the television series &quot;Chinese Paladin&quot; (2005) and &quot;Chinese Paladin 3&quot; (2009). There are also MMORPGs, such as &quot;JX Online 3&quot;, &quot;Heroes of Kung Fu&quot; and &quot;Age of Wulin&quot;, and hack and slash games, such as &quot;Bujingai&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;.

Games adapted from the works of wuxia writers include &quot;Heroes of Jin Yong&quot;, an RPG based on characters in Jin Yong&#x27;s novels; &quot;Dragon Oath&quot;, an MMORPG inspired by Jin Yong&#x27;s &quot;Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils&quot;; and &quot;Martial Kingdoms&quot;, a strategy game featuring several martial arts schools which commonly appear in wuxia fiction.

The wuxia genre continues to be drawn as a pool of inspiration or source material for Chinese video game studios. In June 2022, Tencent&#x27;s Lightspeed Studio released a demo trailer on &quot;Code: To Jin Yong&quot;. In the following month, Everstone Studio unveiled &quot;Where Winds Meet&quot;, a game compared to &quot;Ghost of Tsushima&quot; and &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;. 2023 saw the release of &quot;Hero&#x27;s Adventure: Road to Passion&quot; in November, a wuxia-inspired open world RPG as well as &quot;Wandering Sword&quot; in September, a RPG using HD2D pixel art style.

<text>The Words of Mormon is one of the books that make up the Book of Mormon, a text that is held sacred in the Latter Day Saint movement. It consists of a single chapter of eighteen verses and is the only book in the text which is not titled as a &quot;book.&quot; According to the text, it is a comment inserted by the prophet Mormon while compiling the records which became the Book of Mormon.

Textually, Words of Mormon serves to link the Small Plates of Nephi, which precede it in the current printed version, but which would have been placed after Mormon&#x27;s full record in the golden plates, with the rest of the Book of Mormon.

== Narrative ==
Mormon explains that, while abridging the history of the Nephites, he came across the Small Plates of Nephi and decided to make them an appendix to his finished work. He then briefly summarises the reign of King Benjamin, the last king named in the Small Plates.

Mormon writes that King Benjamin, wielding the sword of Laban, stood against the Lamanites. With his efforts, and wisdom, and the help of the prophets, King Benjamin established peace in the land. Mormon also talks about how false Christs went among the people and were confounded. 
== Interpretation ==

=== Suggested purposes ===
Words of Mormon verses 12–18 have continuity with the first part of Mosiah; Jack M. Lyon and Kent R. Minson hypothesize it was originally dictated as part of a now missing portion of the Book of Mosiah. Brant Gardner suggests that Joseph Smith wrote verses 12–18 as a summary or bridge back into the large plates and that these verses were not part of the original dictation. In another perspective, religious studies scholar Grant Hardy states that that Mormon&#x27;s mention of King Benjamin links the Book of Omni with the Book of Mosiah. 

Mormon narrates that he doesn&#x27;t know why he is including the small plates with the large. Latter-day Saints believe that the inclusion serves as a replacement for the 116 pages that were lost during translation of the Book of Mormon. Author Benjamin Keogh suggests that Mormon&#x27;s explanation indicates that he views the inclusion of the small plates as an appendix to the larger record. Keogh further suggests that, for the small plates, Words of Mormon may serve a similar purpose as the title page of the Book of Mormon.

=== Style ===
Donald W. Parry broke up the Book of Mormon into its chiastic and other poetic patterns. In Words of Mormon he identified two instances of chiasmus: The first appears in verses 3-11 with an “ABcbcacababCDEFFEDCBabcA” pattern; the second is in verses 15-16 with an “abcabc” pattern.

In an article about the Words of Mormon, Benjamin Keogh searches for meaning in Mormon&#x27;s frequent use of &quot;these.&quot; Mormon, he suggests, may be referencing prophets, holy men, or the plates themselves.

=== Suggested prejudice ===
Authors Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Hemming claim that throughout the narrative of the Book of Mormon the Nephites are prejudiced toward the Lamanites. They point out that in Words of Mormon the author calls the Lamanites the brethren of his people and avoids calling them his own brethren. This, Salleh and Hemming claim, is connected to Nephite prejudice.

<text>Maria Wisława Anna Szymborska (; 2 July 1923 – 1 February 2012) was a Polish poet, essayist, translator, and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature. Born in Prowent (now part of Kórnik in west-central Poland), she resided in Kraków until the end of her life. In Poland, Szymborska&#x27;s books have reached sales rivaling prominent prose authors&#x27;, though she wrote in a poem, &quot;Some Like Poetry&quot; (&quot;Niektórzy lubią poezję&quot;), that &quot;perhaps&quot; two in a thousand people like poetry.

Szymborska was awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality&quot;. She became better known internationally as a result. Her work has been translated into many European languages, as well as into Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Persian and Chinese.

== Life ==

Wisława Szymborska was born on 2 July 1923 in Prowent, the second daughter of Wincenty Szymborski and Anna (née Rottermund) Szymborska. Her father was, at that time, the steward of Count Władysław Zamoyski, a Polish patriot and charitable patron. After Zamoyski&#x27;s death in 1924, her family moved to Toruń, and in 1931 to Kraków, where she lived and worked until her death in early 2012.

When World War II broke out in 1939, she continued her education in underground classes. From 1943, she worked as a railroad employee and managed to avoid being deported to Germany as a forced labourer. During this time, her career as an artist began, with illustrations for an English-language textbook. She also began writing stories and occasional poems. In 1945, she began studying Polish literature before switching to sociology at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. There, she became involved in the local writing scene, and met and was influenced by Czesław Miłosz. In March 1945, she published her first poem, &quot;Szukam słowa&quot; (&quot;Looking for words&quot;), in the daily newspaper &quot;Dziennik Polski&quot;. Her poems continued to be published in various newspapers and periodicals for a number of years. In 1948, she quit her studies without a degree, due to poor financial circumstances; the same year, she married poet Adam Włodek, whom she divorced in 1954. They remained close until Włodek&#x27;s death in 1986. Their union was childless. Around the time of her marriage, she was working as a secretary for an educational biweekly magazine as well as an illustrator. Her first book was to be published in 1949, but did not pass censorship as it &quot;did not meet socialist requirements&quot;.

Szymborska adhered to the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland&#x27;s (PRL) official ideology early in her career. For example, during the Polish anti-religious campaign, she signed an infamous 1953 political petition condemning Polish priests accused of treason in a Kraków show trial. Her early work supported socialist themes, as seen in her debut collection &quot;Dlatego żyjemy&quot; (&quot;That is what we are living for&quot;), containing the poems &quot;Lenin&quot; and &quot;Młodzieży budującej Nową Hutę&quot; (&quot;For the Youth who are building Nowa Huta&quot;), about the construction of a Stalinist industrial town near Kraków. She became a member of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party.

Although initially close to the official party line, as the Polish Communist Party shifted from the Stalinist communists to &quot;national&quot; communists, Szymborska grew estranged from socialist ideology and renounced her earlier political work. Although she did not officially leave the Communist party until 1966, she began to establish contacts with dissident intellectuals. As early as 1957, she befriended Jerzy Giedroyc, the editor of the influential Paris-based émigré journal &quot;Kultura&quot;, to which she contributed. In 1964, she opposed a Communist-backed protest to &quot;The Times&quot; against independent intellectuals, demanding freedom of speech instead.

In 1953, Szymborska joined the staff of the literary review magazine &quot;Życie Literackie&quot; (&quot;Literary Life&quot;), where she continued to work until 1981 and from 1968 had a book review column, &quot;Lektury Nadobowiązkowe&quot;. Many of her essays from this period were later published in book form. From 1981 to 1983, she was an editor of the Kraków-based monthly periodical &quot;NaGlos&quot; (&quot;OutLoud&quot;). In the 1980s, she intensified her oppositional activities, contributing to the samizdat periodical &quot;Arka&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Stańczykówna&quot;, as well as to &quot;Kultura&quot;. In the early 1990s, with a poem published in &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, she supported the vote of no confidence in the first non-Communist government that brought former Communists back to power. The last collection published while Szymborska was still alive, &quot;Dwukropek&quot;, was chosen as the best book of 2006 by readers of Poland&#x27;s &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;. She also translated French literature into Polish, in particular Baroque poetry and the works of Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné, a Huguenot soldier-poet during the French Wars of Religion. In the Germanosphere, Szymborska is closely associated with Łódź-born literary translator Karl Dedecius, who did much to popularize postwar Polish literature there.

==Death and last works==
Surrounded by friends and relatives, Szymborska died peacefully of lung cancer in her sleep at home in Kraków in 2012, aged 88. She was working on new poetry at the time of her death, but was unable to arrange her final poems for publication in the way she wanted. Her last poetry was published later in 2012. In 2013, the Wisława Szymborska Award was established in honour of her legacy.

In 2024, the Wisława Szymborska Foundation president Michał Rusinek signed an agreement with Polskie Radio&#x27;s OFF Radio Krakow for the rights to use her voice recordings for generated speech to be used for an interview-like programme. The programme, broadcast on 29 October that year, was swiftly condemned by both Polish audiences and media producers.

==Themes==
Szymborska frequently employed literary devices such as ironic precision, paradox, contradiction, and understatement to illuminate philosophical themes and obsessions. Many of her poems feature war and terrorism.
She wrote from unusual points of view, such as a cat in the newly empty apartment of its dead owner. Her reputation rests on a relatively small body of work, fewer than 350 poems. When asked why she had published so few poems, she said, &quot;I have a trash can in my home&quot;.

==Pop culture==
Szymborska&#x27;s poem &quot;Buffo&quot; was set to music by Barbara Maria Zakrzewska-Nikiporczyk in 1985.

Her poem &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was used in the film &quot;Turn Left, Turn Right&quot;, starring Takeshi Kaneshiro and Gigi Leung. Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s film &quot;Three Colors: Red&quot; was also inspired by &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;.

In her last year, Szymborska collaborated with Polish jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stańko, who dedicated his record &quot;Wisława&quot; (ECM, 2013) to her memory, taking inspiration from their collaboration and her poetry.

Szymborska&#x27;s poem &quot;People on the Bridge&quot; was made into a film by Beata Poźniak. It was shown worldwide and at a New Delhi film festival. As an award, it was screened 36 more times in 18 Indian cities.

The poem &quot;Nothing Twice&quot; (&quot;Nic dwa razy&quot;) has inspired multiple musical adaptations, including Łucja Prus’s performance at the Sopot International Song Festival in 1965 and Maanam&#x27;s song &quot;Nic dwa razy&quot; from their 1994 album &quot;Róża&quot;. In 2022, Sanah adapted Szymborska&#x27;s poem &quot;Nothing Twice&quot; into a song as part of her project based around Polish poetry, &quot;Sanah śpiewa Poezyje&quot;.

<text>In computing, WYSIWYG ( ), an acronym for what you see is what you get, refers to software that allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the result while the document is being created. In general, WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands.

==History==
Before the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques, text appeared in editors using the system standard typeface and style with little indication of layout (margins, spacing, etc.). Users were required to enter special non-printing &quot;control codes&quot; (now referred to as markup &quot;code tags&quot;) to indicate that some text should be in boldface, italics, or a different typeface or size. In this environment there was very little distinction between text editors and word processors.

These applications typically used an arbitrary markup language to define the codes/tags. Each program had its own special way to format a document, and it was a difficult and time-consuming process to change from one word processor to another.

The use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information. When the tags are made visible in the editor, however, they occupy space in the unformatted text, and as a result can disrupt the desired layout and flow.

Bravo, a document preparation program for the Alto produced at Xerox PARC by Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi and colleagues in 1974, is generally considered to be the first program to incorporate the WYSIWYG technology, displaying text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters). The Alto monitor (72 PPI, based on the typographic unit) was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first laser printers. When the text was laid out on the screen, 72 PPI font metric files were used, but when printed, 300 PPI files were used. As a result, one would occasionally find characters and words that are slightly off—a problem that would continue up to this day.

Bravo was released commercially, and the software eventually included in the Xerox Star can be seen as a direct descendant of it.

In late 1978, in parallel with but independent of the work at Xerox PARC, Hewlett-Packard developed and released the first commercial WYSIWYG software application for producing overhead slides (or what today are referred to as presentation graphics). The first release, named BRUNO (after an HP sales training puppet), ran on the HP 1000 minicomputer, taking advantage of HP 2640—HP&#x27;s first bitmapped computer terminal. BRUNO was then ported to the HP-3000 and re-released as &quot;HP Draw&quot;.

By 1981, MicroPro advertised that its WordStar word processor had WYSIWYG, but its display was limited to displaying styled text in WYSIWYG fashion; bold and &quot;italic&quot; text would be represented on screen, instead of being surrounded by tags or special control characters. In 1983, the &quot;Weekly Reader&quot; advertised its Stickybear educational software with the slogan &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;, with photographs of its Apple II graphics, but home computers of the 1970s and early 1980s lacked the sophisticated graphics capabilities necessary to display WYSIWYG documents, meaning that such applications were usually confined to limited-purpose, high-end workstations (such as the IBM Displaywriter System) that were too expensive for the general public to afford. As improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays, WYSIWYG software started to appear in more popular computers, including LisaWrite for the Apple Lisa, released in 1983, and MacWrite for the Apple Macintosh, released in 1984.

The Apple Macintosh system was originally designed so that the screen resolution and the resolution of the ImageWriter dot-matrix printers sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 DPI for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as MacWrite and MacPaint were easily translated to the printed output. If the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be the same size as the on-screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the ImageWriter was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh monitor had the same 640 × 480 resolution as a PC, a screen would be fixed at 832 × 624 rather than the 800 × 600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as laser printers and multisync monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;, from which the acronym derives, was a catchphrase popularized by Flip Wilson&#x27;s drag persona Geraldine, first appearing in September 1969, then regularly in the early 1970s on &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;. The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine&#x27;s entire personality and appearance.

As it relates to computing, there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase:
* Around 1974, Karen Thacker, the technophobe wife of Xerox hardware designer Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Thacker, was introduced to a Xerox Alto running Bravo, and commented, &quot;You mean, what I see is what I get?&quot;
*In mid-1975, John W. Seybold, the founder of Seybold Publications, and researchers at PARC incorporated Gypsy software into Bravo to create Bravo 3, which allowed text to be printed as displayed. Charles Simonyi and the other engineers appropriated Flip Wilson&#x27;s popular phrase around that time.
* Barbara Beeton reports that the term was coined by Bill Tunnicliffe, in a presentation at a 1978 committee meeting involving the Graphic Communications Association (GCA), the American Mathematical Society (AMS), and the Printing Industries of America (PIA).

==Variations==
Many variations are used only to illustrate a point or make a joke, and have very limited real use. Some that have been proposed include the following:
* WYGIWYG; &quot;what you get is what you get&quot;, often used in a similar way to WYSIAYG, WYSIMOLWYG, or WYSINWYW.
* WYGIWYS, &quot;what you get is what you see&quot;, used in computing to describe an interaction paradigm in results-oriented user interface. The term was used by Jakob Nielsen to describe Microsoft Office 2007&#x27;s &quot;Ribbon&quot; interface
* WYSIAWYG; &quot;what you see is almost what you get&quot;, similar to WYSIMOLWYG.
* WYSIAYG, &quot;what you see is all you get&quot;, used to point out that advanced users are sometimes limited by the user interface.
* WYSIMOLWYG, &quot;what you see is more or less what you get&quot;, recognizing that most WYSIWYG implementations are imperfect.
* WYSINWYW, &quot;what you see is not what you want&quot;, suggesting that Microsoft Word often controls the user, not the other way around
* WYSIWYW, &quot;what you see is what you want&quot;, used to describe GNU TeXmacs editing platform. The abbreviation clarifies that unlike in WYSIWYG editors, the user is able to customize WYSIWYW platforms to act (possibly in part) as manual typesetting programs such as TeX or troff.
* WYTIWYG, &quot;what you think is what you get&quot;, found in Ward Cunninghams Wiki, the first user-editable website meaning: &quot;What we look for is often what we find.&quot;, Used as a principle for WackoWiki markup, meaning that &quot;formatted output actually looks like you expect it to look&quot; 
* YAFIYGI, &quot;you asked for it you got it&quot;, used to describe a text-command oriented document editing system that does not include WYSIWYG, in reference to the fact that users of such systems often ask for something they did not really want. It is considered to be the opposite of WYSIWYG. The phrase was first used in this context in 1983 in the essay Real Programmers Don&#x27;t Use Pascal to describe the TECO text editor system, and began to be abbreviated circa 1993.
