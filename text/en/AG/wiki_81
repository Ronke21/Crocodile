<text>Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, also spelt Volodymyr Ivanovych Vernadsky (; ; – 6 January 1945), was a Russian, Ukrainian, and Soviet mineralogist and geochemist who is considered one of the founders of geochemistry, biogeochemistry, and radiogeology. He was one of the founders and the first president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (now National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). Vladimir Vernadsky is most noted for his 1926 book &quot;The Biosphere&quot; in which he inadvertently worked to popularize Eduard Suess&#x27;s 1875 term biosphere, by hypothesizing that life is the geological force that shapes the earth. In 1943 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. Vernadsky&#x27;s portrait is depicted on the Ukrainian ₴1,000 hryvnia banknote.

==Early life==

Vernadsky was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, on in the family of the native Kyiv residents Russian Imperial economist Ivan Vernadsky and music instructor Anna Konstantinovich, who came from an old Russia noble family. According to family legend, his father&#x27;s ancestors were Zaporozhian Cossacks. Ivan Vernadsky had been a professor of political economy in Kyiv at the St. Vladimir University before moving to Saint Petersburg; then he was an Active State Councillor and worked in the Governing Senate in St. Petersburg. Vladimir&#x27;s mother was a Russian noblewoman of Ukrainian Cossack descent. In 1868 his family relocated to Kharkiv, and in 1873 he entered the Kharkiv provincial gymnasium.
Vernadsky graduated from Saint Petersburg State University in 1885. As the position of mineralogist in Saint Petersburg State University was vacant, and Vasily Dokuchaev, a soil scientist, and Alexey Pavlov, a geologist, had been teaching Mineralogy for a while, Vernadsky chose to enter Mineralogy. He wrote to his wife Nataliia on 20 June 1888 from Switzerland:
 In 1888–1890, he traveled through Europe, studying the museums of Paris and London, and worked in Munich and Paris.

While trying to find a topic for his doctorate, he first went to Naples to study under crystallographer Arcangelo Scacchi, who was senile by that time. Scacchi&#x27;s condition led Vernadsky to go to Germany to study under Paul Groth, curator of minerals in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Vernadsky learned to use Groth&#x27;s modern equipment, which included a machine to study the optical, thermal, elastic, magnetic and electrical properties of crystals. He also gained access to the physics lab of Leonhard Sohncke (Direktor, , 1883–1886; Professor der Physik an der Technischen Hochschule München 1886–1897), who was studying crystallisation during that period.

In his childhood, his father had a huge influence on his development, he very carefully and consistently engaged in the upbringing and education of his son. It was he who instilled in Volodymyr interest and love for the Ukrainian people, their history and culture. The future scientist recalled that before moving from Kharkiv to St. Petersburg, he and his father were abroad and in Milan, they read about a circular in Pyotr Lavrov&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Forward&quot; that forbade printing in Ukrainian in Russia. In his memoirs, he wrote:

In St. Petersburg, a 15-year-old boy noted in his diary on 29 March 1878:

==Political activities==
Vernadsky participated in the First General Congress of the zemstvos, held in Petersburg on the eve of the 1905 Russian Revolution to discuss how best to pressure the government to the needs of the Russian society; became a member of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (KD); and served in parliament, resigning to protest the Tsar&#x27;s proroguing of the Duma. He served as professor and later as vice rector of Moscow University, from which he also resigned in 1911 in protest over the government&#x27;s reactionary policies .

Following the advent of the First World War, his proposal for the establishment of the Commission for the Study of the Natural Productive Forces (KEPS) was adopted by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in February 1915. He published &quot;War and the Progress of Science&quot; where he stressed the importance of science as regards to its contribution to the war effort:

:After the war of 1914–1915 we will have to make known and accountable the natural productive forces of our country, i.e. first of all to find means for broad scientific investigations of Russia’s nature and for the establishment of a network of well equipped research laboratories, museums and institutions ... This is no less necessary than the need for an improvement in the conditions of our civil and political life, which is so acutely perceived by the entire country.

After the February Revolution of 1917, he served on several commissions of agriculture and education of the provisional government, including as assistant minister of education.

Vladimir Vernadsky had dual &quot;Russian–Ukrainian&quot; identity and considered the Ukrainian culture as part of Russian imperial culture, and even declined to become a Ukrainian citizen in 1918.

==Scientific activities==
Vernadsky first popularized the concept of the noosphere and deepened the idea of the biosphere to the meaning largely recognized by today&#x27;s scientific community. The word &#x27;biosphere&#x27; was invented by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess, whom Vernadsky met in 1911.

In Vernadsky&#x27;s theory of the Earth&#x27;s development, the noosphere is the third stage in the earth&#x27;s development, after the geosphere (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human cognition will fundamentally transform the biosphere. In this theory, the principles of both life and cognition are essential features of the Earth&#x27;s evolution, and must have been implicit in the earth all along. This systemic and geological analysis of living systems complements Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, which looks at each individual species, rather than at its relationship to a subsuming principle.

Vernadsky&#x27;s visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West. However, he was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planets as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was an important pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.

Vernadsky was a member of the Russian and Soviet Academies of Sciences since 1912 and was a founder and first president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv, Ukraine (1918). He was a founder of the National Library of Ukrainian State and worked closely with the Tavrida University in Crimea. During the Russian Civil War, he hosted gatherings of the young intellectuals who later founded the émigré Eurasianism movement.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s Vernadsky played an early advisory role in the Soviet atomic bomb project, as one of the most forceful voices arguing for the exploitation of nuclear power, the surveying of Soviet uranium sources, and having nuclear fission research conducted at his Radium Institute. He died, however, before a full project was pursued.

On religious views, Vernadsky was an atheist. He was interested in Hinduism and Rig Veda.

Vernadsky&#x27;s son George Vernadsky (1887–1973) emigrated to the United States where he published numerous books on medieval and modern Russian history.

The National Library of Ukraine, the Tavrida National University in Crimea and many streets and avenues in Ukraine and Russia are named in honor of Vladimir Vernadsky.

UNESCO sponsored an international scientific conference, &quot;Globalistics-2013&quot;, at Moscow State University on 23–25 October 2013, in honor of Vernadsky&#x27;s 150th birthday.

<doc id="32517" wikidata="Q960616" url="?curid=32517" title="VAX">
<text>VAX (an acronym for virtual address extension) is a series of computers featuring a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA) and virtual memory that was developed and sold by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the late 20th century. The VAX-11/780, introduced October 25, 1977, was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing the VAX ISA. The VAX family was a huge success for DEC, with the last members arriving in the early 1990s. The VAX was succeeded by the DEC Alpha, which included several features from VAX machines to make porting from the VAX easier.

VAX was designed as a successor to the 16-bit PDP-11, one of the most successful minicomputers in history with approximately 600,000 units sold. The system was designed to offer backward compatibility with the PDP-11 while extending the memory to a full 32-bit implementation and adding demand paged virtual memory. The name VAX refers to its &quot;virtual address extension&quot; concept that allowed programs to make use of this newly available memory while still being compatible with unmodified user mode PDP-11 code. The name &quot;VAX-11&quot;, used on early models, was chosen to highlight this capability. The VAX ISA is considered a complex instruction set computer (CISC) design.

DEC quickly dropped the −11 branding as PDP-11 compatibility was no longer a major concern. The line expanded to both high-end mainframes like the VAX 9000 as well as to the workstation-scale systems like the VAXstation series. The VAX family ultimately contained ten distinct designs and over 100 individual models in total. All of them were compatible with each other and normally ran the VAX/VMS operating system.

VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of assembly language programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal instruction set architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion, number formatting, and polynomial evaluation.

== Name ==
The name &quot;VAX&quot; originated as an acronym for &quot;virtual address extension&quot;, both because the VAX was seen as a 32-bit extension of the older 16-bit PDP-11 and because it was (after Prime Computer) an early adopter of virtual memory to manage this larger address space.

Early versions of the VAX processor implement a &quot;compatibility mode&quot; that emulates many of the PDP-11&#x27;s instructions, giving it the 11 in VAX-11 to highlight this compatibility. Later versions offloaded the compatibility mode and some of the less used CISC instructions to emulation in the operating system software.

== Instruction set ==
The VAX instruction set was designed to be powerful and orthogonal. When it was introduced, many programs were written in assembly language, so having a &quot;programmer-friendly&quot; instruction set was important. In time, as more programs were written in high-level programming languages, the instruction set became less visible, and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers.

One unusual aspect of the VAX instruction set is the presence of register masks at the start of each subprogram. These are arbitrary bit patterns that specify, when control is passed to the subprogram, which registers are to be preserved. On most architectures, it is up to the compiler to produce instructions to save out the needed data, typically using the call stack for temporary storage. On the VAX, with 16 registers, this might require 16 instructions to save the data and another 16 to restore it. Using the mask, a single 16-bit value performs the same operations internally in hardware, saving time and memory.

Since register masks are a form of data embedded within the executable code, they can make linear parsing of the machine code difficult. This can complicate optimization techniques that are applied on machine code.

== Operating systems ==
The native VAX operating system is Digital&#x27;s VAX/VMS (renamed to OpenVMS in 1991 or early 1992 when it was ported to Alpha, modified to comply with POSIX standards, and &quot;branded&quot; as compliant with XPG4 by the X/Open consortium). The VAX architecture and VMS operating system were &quot;engineered concurrently&quot; to take maximum advantage of each other, as was the initial implementation of the VAXcluster facility.

During the 1980s, a hypervisor for the VAX architecture named &quot;VMM&quot; (Virtual Machine Monitor), also known as the &quot;VAX Security Kernel&quot;, was developed at Digital with the aim of allowing multiple isolated instances of VMS and ULTRIX to be run on the same hardware. VMM was intended to achieve TCSEC A1 compliance. By the late 1980s, it was operational on VAX 8000 series hardware, but was abandoned before release to customers.

Other VAX operating systems have included various releases of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) UNIX up to 4.3BSD, Ultrix-32, VAXELN, and Xinu. More recently, NetBSD and OpenBSD have supported various VAX models and some work has been done on porting Linux to the VAX architecture. OpenBSD discontinued support for the architecture in September 2016.

== History ==
The first VAX model sold was the VAX-11/780, which was introduced on October 25, 1977, at the Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Bill Strecker, C. Gordon Bell&#x27;s doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, was responsible for the architecture. Many different models with different prices, performance levels, and capacities were subsequently created. VAX superminicomputers were very popular in the early 1980s.

For a while the VAX-11/780 was used as a standard in CPU benchmarks. It was initially described as a one-MIPS machine, because its performance was equivalent to an IBM System/360 that ran at one MIPS, and the System/360 implementations had previously been de facto performance standards. The actual number of instructions executed in 1 second was about 500,000, which led to complaints of marketing exaggeration. The result was the definition of a &quot;VAX MIPS&quot;, the speed of a VAX-11/780; a computer performing at 27 VAX MIPS would run the same program roughly 27 times faster than the VAX-11/780.

Within the Digital community the term &quot;VUP&quot; (VAX Unit of Performance) was the more common term, because MIPS do not compare well across different architectures. The related term &quot;cluster VUPs&quot; was informally used to describe the aggregate performance of a VAXcluster. (The performance of the VAX-11/780 still serves as the baseline metric in the BRL-CAD Benchmark, a performance analysis suite included in the BRL-CAD solid modeling software distribution.) The VAX-11/780 included a subordinate stand-alone LSI-11 computer that performed microcode load, booting, and diagnostic functions for the parent computer. This was dropped from subsequent VAX models. Enterprising VAX-11/780 users could therefore run three different Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems: VMS on the VAX processor (from the hard drives), and either RSX-11S or RT-11 on the LSI-11 (from the single density single drive floppy disk).

The VAX went through many different implementations. The original VAX 11/780 was implemented in TTL and filled a four-by-five-foot cabinet with a single CPU. Through the 1980s, the high-end of the family was continually improved using ever-faster discrete components, an evolution that ended with the introduction of the VAX 9000 in October 1989. This design proved too complex and expensive and was ultimately abandoned not long after introduction. CPU implementations that consisted of multiple emitter-coupled logic (ECL) gate array or macrocell array chips included the VAX 8600 and 8800 superminis and finally the VAX 9000 mainframe class machines. CPU implementations that consisted of multiple MOSFET custom chips included the 8100 and 8200 class machines. The VAX 11-730 and 725 low-end machines were built using AMD Am2901 bit-slice components for the ALU.

The MicroVAX I represented a major transition within the VAX family. At the time of its design, it was not yet possible to implement the full VAX architecture as a single VLSI chip (or even a few VLSI chips as was later done with the V-11 CPU of the VAX 8200/8300). Instead, the MicroVAX I was the first VAX implementation to move some of the more complex VAX instructions (such as the packed decimal and related opcodes) into emulation software. This partitioning substantially reduced the amount of microcode required and was referred to as the &quot;MicroVAX&quot; architecture. In the MicroVAX I, the ALU and registers were implemented as a single gate-array chip while the rest of the machine control was conventional logic.

A full VLSI (microprocessor) implementation of the MicroVAX architecture arrived with the MicroVAX II&#x27;s 78032 (or DC333) CPU and 78132 (DC335) FPU. The 78032 was the first microprocessor with an on-board memory management unit The MicroVAX II was based on a single, quad-sized processor board which carried the processor chips and ran the MicroVMS or Ultrix-32 operating systems. The machine featured 1 MB of on-board memory and a Q22-bus interface with DMA transfers. The MicroVAX II was succeeded by many further MicroVAX models with much improved performance and memory.

Further VLSI VAX processors followed in the form of the V-11, CVAX, CVAX SOC (&quot;System On Chip&quot;, a single-chip CVAX), Rigel, Mariah and NVAX implementations. The VAX microprocessors extended the architecture to inexpensive workstations and later also supplanted the high-end VAX models. This wide range of platforms (mainframe to workstation) using one architecture was unique in the computer industry at that time. Sundry graphics were etched onto the CVAX microprocessor die. The phrase &quot;CVAX... when you care enough to steal the very best&quot; was etched in broken Russian as a play on a Hallmark Cards slogan, intended as a message to Soviet engineers who were known to be both purloining DEC computers for military applications and reverse engineering their chip design. By the late 1980s, the VAX microprocessors had grown in power to be competitive with discrete designs. This led to the abandonment of the 8000 and 9000 series and their replacement by Rigel-powered models of the VAX 6000, and later by NVAX-powered VAX 7000 systems.

In DEC&#x27;s product offerings, the VAX architecture was eventually superseded by RISC technology. In 1989 DEC introduced a range of workstations and servers that ran Ultrix, the DECstation and DECsystem respectively, using processors from MIPS Computer Systems. In 1992 DEC introduced their own RISC instruction set architecture, the Alpha AXP (later renamed Alpha), and their own Alpha-based microprocessor, the DECchip 21064, a high performance 64-bit design capable of running OpenVMS.

In August 2000, Compaq announced that the remaining VAX models would be discontinued by the end of the year, but old systems remain in widespread use. The Stromasys CHARON-VAX and SIMH software-based VAX emulators remain available. VMS is now developed by VMS Software Incorporated, albeit only for the Alpha, HPE Integrity, and x86-64 platforms.

== Processor architecture ==


=== Virtual memory map ===
The VAX virtual memory is divided into four sections. Each is one gigabyte (in the context of addressing, 230 bytes) in size:
For VMS, P0 was used for user process space, P1 for process stack, S0 for the operating system, and S1 was reserved.

=== Privilege modes ===
The VAX has four hardware implemented privilege modes:

=== Processor status longword ===
The process status longword contains 32 bits:

== VAX-based systems ==

The first VAX-based system was the VAX-11/780, a member of the VAX-11 family. The high-end VAX 8600 replaced the VAX-11/780 in October 1984 and was joined by the entry-level MicroVAX minicomputers and the VAXstation workstations in the mid-1980s. The MicroVAX was superseded by the VAX 4000, the VAX 8000 was superseded by the VAX 6000 in the late 1980s and the mainframe-class VAX 9000 was introduced. In the early 1990s, the fault-tolerant VAXft was introduced, as were the Alpha compatible VAX 7000/10000. A variant of various VAX-based systems were sold as the VAXserver.

=== SIMACS ===
&quot;System Industries&quot; developed an ability to give more than one DEC CPU, but not at the same time, write access to a shared disk. They implemented an enhancement named SIMACS (simultaneous machine access), which allowed their special disk controller to set a semaphore flag for disk access, allowing multiple WRITES to the same files; the disk is shared by multiple DEC systems. &quot;SIMACS&quot; also existed on PDP-11 RSTS systems.

=== Canceled systems ===
Canceled systems include the &quot;BVAX&quot;, a high-end emitter-coupled logic (ECL) based VAX, and two other ECL-based VAX models: &quot;Argonaut&quot; and &quot;Raven&quot;. Raven was canceled in 1990. A VAX named &quot;Gemini&quot; was also canceled, which was a fall-back in case the LSI-based &quot;Scorpio&quot; failed. It never shipped.

=== Clones ===
A number of VAX clones, both authorized and unauthorized, were produced. Examples include:

* Systime Computers Ltd of the United Kingdom produced clones of early VAX models such as the Systime 8750 (equivalent to the VAX 11/750).
* Norden Systems produced the ruggedized, Military-specification MIL VAX series.
* The Hungarian Central Research Institute for Physics (KFKI) produced a series of clones of early VAX models, the TPA-11/540, 560 and 580.
* The SM 52/12 from Czechoslovakia, developed at VUVT Žilina (today Slovakia) and produced from 1986 at ZVT Banská Bystrica (today Slovakia).
* The East German VEB Robotron K 1840 (SM 1710) is a clone of the VAX-11/780 and Robotron K 1820 (SM 1720) is a copy of the MicroVAX II.
* The &quot;SM-1700&quot; is a Soviet clone of the VAX-11/730, &quot;SM-1702&quot; was a clone of MicroVAX II and &quot;SM-1705&quot; was a clone of VAX-11/785. These systems ran a variety of clone operating systems - DEMOS (based on BSD Unix), MOS VP (based on VAX/VMS) or MOS VP RV (based on VAXELN).
* The NCI-2780 Super-mini, also sold as Taiji-2780, is a clone of the VAX-11/780 developed by North China Institute of Computing Technology in Beijing.

<text>Valens (; ; 328 – 9 August 378) was Roman emperor from 364 to 378. Following a largely unremarkable military career, he was named co-emperor by his elder brother Valentinian I, who gave him the eastern half of the Roman Empire to rule. In 378, Valens was defeated and killed at the Battle of Adrianople against the invading Goths, which astonished contemporaries and marked the beginning of barbarian encroachment into Roman territory.

As emperor, Valens continually faced threats both internal and external. He defeated, after some dithering, the usurper Procopius in 366, and campaigned against the Goths across the Danube in 367 and 369. In the following years, Valens focused on the eastern frontier, where he faced the perennial threat of Persia, particularly in Armenia, as well as additional conflicts with the Saracens and Isaurians. Domestically, he inaugurated the Aqueduct of Valens in Constantinople, which was longer than all the aqueducts of Rome. In 376–77, the Gothic War broke out, following a mismanaged attempt to settle the Goths in the Balkans. Valens returned from the east to fight the Goths in person, but lack of coordination with his nephew, the western emperor Gratian (Valentinian I&#x27;s son), as well as poor battle tactics, led to Valens and much of the eastern Roman army dying in a battle near Adrianople in 378.

A capable administrator who significantly relieved the burden of taxation on the population, Valens is also described as indecisive, impressionable, a mediocre general and overall &quot;utterly undistinguished&quot;. His suspicious and fearful disposition resulted in numerous treason trials and executions which heavily stained his reputation. In religious matters, Valens favored a compromise between Nicene Christianity and the various non-trinitarian Christian sects, and interfered little in the affairs of the pagans.

== Early life and military career ==

Valens and his brother Valentinian were born, in 328 and 321 respectively, to an Illyrian family resident in Cibalae (Vinkovci) in Pannonia Secunda. Their father Gratianus Funarius, a native of Cibalae, had served as a senior officer in the Roman army and as &quot;comes Africae&quot;. The brothers grew up on estates purchased by Gratianus in Africa and Britain. Both were Christians, but favored different sects: Valentinian was a Nicene Christian and Valens was an Arian Christian (specifically a Homoean). In adulthood, Valens served in the &quot;protectores domestici&quot; under the emperors Julian and Jovian. According to the 5th-century Greek historian Socrates Scholasticus, Valens refused pressure to offer pagan sacrifices during the reign of the polytheist emperor Julian.

Julian was killed in battle against the Persians in June 363, and his successor Jovian died the following February while traveling home to Constantinople. The Latin historian Ammianus Marcellinus relates that Valentinian was summoned to Nicaea by a council of military and civil officials, who acclaimed him &quot;augustus&quot; on 25 February 364.
Valentinian appointed his brother Valens &quot;tribunus stabulorum&quot; (or &quot;stabuli&quot;) on 1 March 364. It was the general opinion that Valentinian needed help to handle the administration, civil and military, of the large and unwieldy empire, and, on 28 March, at the express demand of the soldiers for a second &quot;augustus&quot;, he selected Valens as co-emperor at the Hebdomon, before the Constantinian Walls.

== Reign ==
Both emperors were briefly ill, delaying them in Constantinople. As soon as they recovered, the two &quot;augusti&quot; travelled together through Adrianople and Naissus to Mediana, where they divided their territories. Valens obtained the eastern half of the Empire: Greece, the Balkans, Egypt, Anatolia and the Levant as far as the border with the Sasanian Empire. Valentinian took the western half, where the Alemannic wars required his immediate attention. The brothers began their consulships in their respective capitals, Constantinople and Mediolanum (Milan).

In the summer of 365, the 365 Crete earthquake and ensuing tsunami caused destruction around the Eastern Mediterranean.

The empire had recently retreated from most of its holdings in Mesopotamia and Armenia, because of a treaty that Jovian had made with Shapur II of the Sasanian Empire. Valens&#x27;s first priority after the winter of 365 was to move east in hopes of shoring up the situation.

=== Usurpation of Procopius (365–366) ===
Recent tax increases, and Valens&#x27;s dismissal of Julian&#x27;s popular minister Salutius, contributed to a general disaffection and to the acceptability of a revolution. With the emperor absent from the imperial city, Procopius, a maternal cousin of Julian, declared himself &quot;augustus&quot; on 28 September 365. Procopius had held office under Constantius II and Julian and was rumored to have been Julian&#x27;s intended successor, despite how he had died without naming one. Jovian, aside from depriving him of his command, took no measures against this potential rival, but Valentinian regarded Procopius with hostility. Procopius met the danger from the new emperors with his own bid for power, emphasizing his connection to the revered Constantinian Dynasty: during his public appearances he was always accompanied by Constantia, the posthumous daughter of Constantius II, and her mother Faustina, the dowager empress.

News of the revolt reached Valens at Caesarea in Cappadocia (Kayseri), after most of his troops had already crossed the Cilician Gates into Syria. His first reaction was despair, and he considered abdication and perhaps even suicide. Procopius quickly gained control of the provinces of Asia and Bithynia, winning increasing support for his insurrection. Valens recovered his nerve and sent an army to Constantinople; according to Ammianus Marcellinus, the soldiers defected to Procopius, whose use of his Constantinian hostages had met with some success.

Having reappointed Salutius, Valens dispatched more troops under veteran generals, Arinthaeus and Arbitio, to march on Procopius. According to Ammianus Marcellinus and the later Greek historians Socrates Scholasticus and Sozomen, the forces of Valens eventually prevailed after eight months, defeating Procopius in battles at Thyatira and Nacoleia. On both occasions, Procopius was deserted by his own following in fear of their adversaries&#x27; formidable commanders. Put on trial by members of his own escort, Procopius was executed on 27 May 366. Ammianus Marcellinus relates that Procopius&#x27;s relative Marcellus was proclaimed emperor in his place, but according to Zosimus he was swiftly captured and executed. Valens could turn his attention back to external enemies, the Sasanian Empire and the Goths.
=== First Gothic War: 367–369 ===
During Procopius&#x27;s insurrection, the Gothic king Ermanaric, who ruled a powerful kingdom north of the Danube from the Euxine to the Baltic Sea, had engaged to supply him with troops for the struggle against Valens. The Gothic army, reportedly numbering 30,000 men, arrived too late to help Procopius, but nevertheless invaded Thrace and began plundering the farms and vineyards of the province. Valens, marching north after defeating Procopius, surrounded them with a superior force and forced them to surrender. Ermanaric protested, and when Valens, encouraged by Valentinian, refused to make atonement to the Goths for his conduct, war was declared.

In spring 367, Valens crossed the Danube and attacked the Visigoths under Athanaric, Ermanaric&#x27;s tributary. The Goths fled into the Carpathian Mountains, and the campaign ended with no decisive conclusion. The following spring, a Danube flood prevented Valens from crossing; instead the Emperor occupied his troops with the construction of fortifications. In 369, Valens crossed again, from Noviodunum, and by devastating the country forced Athanaric into giving battle. Valens was victorious, and took the title &quot;Gothicus Maximus&quot; in time for the celebration of his &quot;quinquennalia&quot;. Athanaric and his forces were able to withdraw in good order and pleaded for peace.

Fortunately for the Goths, Valens expected a new war with the Sasanid Empire in the Middle East and was therefore willing to come to terms. In early 370 Valens and Athanaric met in the middle of the Danube and agreed to a treaty that ended the war. The treaty seems to have largely cut off relations between Goths and Romans, confining trade and the exchange of troops for tribute.
=== Persian War: 373 ===
As mentioned before, among Valens&#x27;s reasons for contracting a hasty and not entirely favorable peace in 369 was the deteriorating state of affairs in the East. Jovian had surrendered Rome&#x27;s much disputed claim to control over Armenia in 363, and Shapur II was eager to make good on this new opportunity. The Persian emperor began enticing Armenian lords over to his camp and eventually forced the defection of the Arsacid Armenian king, Arshak II (Arsaces II), whom he quickly arrested and incarcerated. The Armenian nobility responded by asking Valens to return Arshak&#x27;s son, Pap. Valens agreed and sent Pap back to Armenia, but as these events took place during the war with the Goths he could not support him militarily.

In response to the return of Pap, Shapur personally led an invasion force to seize control of Armenia. Pap and his followers took refuge in the mountains while Artaxata, the Armenian capital, and the city of Artogerassa along with several strongholds and castles were destroyed. Shapur sent a second invasion force to Caucasian Iberia to drive out the pro-Roman king Sauromaces II, and put his own appointee, Sauromaces&#x27;s uncle Aspacures II, on the throne.

In the summer following his Gothic settlement, Valens sent his &quot;magister peditum&quot; (Master of Foot) Arinthaeus to support Pap. The following spring twelve legions were sent under Terentius to regain Iberia and to garrison Armenia near Mount Npat. When Shapur counterattacked into Armenia in 371, his forces were bested by Valens&#x27;s generals Traianus and Vadomarius and the Armenian &quot;sparapet&quot; (general) Mushegh Mamikonian at Bagavan and Gandzak. Valens had overstepped the 363 treaty and then successfully defended his transgression. A truce settled after the 371 victory held as a quasi-peace for the next five years while Shapur was forced to deal with a Kushan invasion on his eastern frontier.

Meanwhile, troubles broke out with the boy-king Pap, who purportedly had the Armenian patriarch Nerses assassinated and demanded control of a number of Roman cities, including Edessa. Controversy also ensued over the issue of the appointment of a new patriarch of Armenia, with Pap appointing a candidate without the traditional approval from Caesarea. Pressed by his generals and fearing that Pap would defect to the Persians, Valens made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the prince and later had him executed inside Armenia. In his stead, Valens imposed another Arsacid, Varazdat, who ruled under the regency of the &quot;sparapet&quot; Mushegh Mamikonian, a friend of Rome.

None of this sat well with the Persians, who began agitating again for compliance with the 363 treaty. As the eastern frontier heated up in 375, Valens began preparations for a major expedition. Meanwhile, trouble was brewing elsewhere. In Isauria, the mountainous region of western Cilicia, a major revolt had broken out in 375 which diverted troops formerly stationed in the East. Furthermore, by 377, the Saracens under Queen Mavia had broken into revolt and devastated a swath of territory stretching from Phoenicia and Palestine as far as the Sinai. Though Valens successfully brought both uprisings under control, the opportunities for action on the eastern frontier were limited by these skirmishes closer to home.

=== Later reign: 373–376 ===
Valens became the senior &quot;augustus&quot; on 17 November 375, after his older brother Valentinian died suddenly at Brigetio (Szőny) while on campaign against the Quadi in Pannonia. In the west, Valentinian was succeeded by his elder son Gratian, co-emperor since 367, and his younger son Valentinian II, whom the army on the Danube proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; without consulting Gratian or Valens.

=== Second Gothic War: 376–378 ===

Migrations of the Huns began to displace the Goths, who sought Roman protection. Valens allowed the Goths led by Fritigern to cross the Danube, but the Gothic settlers were abused by Roman officials and revolted in 377, seeking help from the Huns and the Alans and beginning the Gothic War (376–382).

Valens returned from the east to campaign against the Goths. He asked for assistance from his nephew and co-emperor Gratian against the Goths in Thrace, and Gratian set out eastwards, though Valens did not wait for the western armies to arrive before taking the offensive.

Valens&#x27;s plans for an eastern campaign were never realized. A transfer of troops to the Western Empire in 374 had left gaps in Valens&#x27;s mobile forces. In preparation for an eastern war, Valens initiated an ambitious recruitment program designed to fill those gaps. It was thus not entirely unwelcome news when Valens heard of Ermanaric&#x27;s death and the disintegration of his kingdom before an invasion of hordes of barbaric Huns from the far east. After failing to hold the Dniester or the Prut rivers against the Huns, the Goths retreated southward in a massive emigration, seeking new settlements and shelter south of the Danube, i.e. Roman lands, which they may have thought could be held against the enemy. In 376, the Visigoths under their leader Fritigern advanced to the far shores of the lower Danube and sent an ambassador to Valens who had set up his capital in Antioch, and requested asylum.

As Valens&#x27;s advisers were quick to point out, these Goths could supply troops who would at once swell Valens&#x27;s ranks and decrease his dependence on conscription from provinces—thereby increasing revenues from the recruitment tax. However, it would mean hiring them and paying in gold or silver for their services. Fritigern and Valens knew each other from an alliance in the 370s against Athanaric, who had persecuted Gothic Christians. Though a number of Gothic groups apparently requested entry, Valens granted admission only to Fritigern and his followers. Others would soon follow, however.

When Fritigern and his Goths, to the number of 200,000 warriors and almost a million all told, crossed the Danube, Valens&#x27;s mobile forces were tied down in the east, on the Persian frontier (Valens was attempting to withdraw from the harsh terms imposed by Shapur and was meeting some resistance on the latter&#x27;s part). This meant that only &quot;limitanei&quot; units were present to oversee the Goths&#x27; settlement. The small number of imperial troops present prevented the Romans from stopping a Danube crossing by a group of Ostrogoths and yet later on by Huns and Alans. What started out as a controlled resettlement might any moment turn into a major invasion. But the situation was worsened by corruption in the Roman administration, as Valens&#x27;s generals accepted bribes rather than depriving the Goths of their weapons as Valens had stipulated and then proceeded to enrage them by such exorbitant prices for food that they were soon driven to the last extremity. Meanwhile, the Romans failed to prevent the crossing of other barbarians who were not included in the treaty. In early 377, the Goths revolted after a commotion with the people of Marcianopolis, and defeated the corrupt Roman governor Lupicinus near the city at the Battle of Marcianople.

After joining forces with the Ostrogoths under Alatheus and Saphrax who had crossed without Valens&#x27;s consent, the combined barbarian group spread out to devastate the country before combining to meet Roman advance forces under Traianus and Richomeres. In a sanguinary battle at &quot;Ad Salices&quot;, the Goths were momentarily checked, and Saturninus, now Valens&#x27;s lieutenant in the province, undertook a strategy of hemming them in between the lower Danube and the Euxine, hoping to starve them into surrender. However, Fritigern forced him to retreat by inviting some of the Huns to cross the river in the rear of Saturninus&#x27;s ranged defenses. The Romans then fell back, incapable of containing the irruption, though with an elite force of his best soldiers the general Sebastian was able to fall upon and destroy several of the smaller predatory bands.

By 378, Valens himself was ready to march west from his eastern base in Antioch. He withdrew all but a skeletal force—some of them Goths—from the east and moved west, reaching Constantinople by 30 May, 378. The imperial councillors, &quot;comes&quot; Richomeres, and the generals Frigeridus and Victor cautioned Valens to wait for the arrival of the western army, a course Gratian also recommended in his letters. The populace of Constantinople was impatient at the delay and its opinion of Valens became hostile: he was criticized for failing to control the Goths after inviting them into his territory, and compared unfavourably with Gratian as a military commander. Valens decided to advance at once and win a victory on his own.
=== Battle of Adrianople ===

According to the Latin historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Paulus Orosius, on 9 August 378, Valens and most of his army were killed fighting the Goths near Hadrianopolis in Thrace (Adrianople, Edirne). Ammianus is the primary source for the battle.

Valens opened the campaign with arrangements aimed at building his troop strength and gaining a toehold in Thrace, then moved out to Adrianople, from whence he marched against the confederated barbarian army. Although negotiations were attempted, these broke down when a Roman unit sallied forth and carried both sides into battle. Valens had left a sizeable guard with his baggage and treasures, depleting his force. His right cavalry wing arrived at the Gothic camp sometime before the left wing arrived. It was a very hot day and the Roman cavalry was engaged without strategic support, wasting its efforts and suffering in the heat.
Meanwhile, Fritigern once again sent an emissary of peace in his continued manipulation of the situation. The resultant delay meant that the Romans present on the field began to succumb to the heat. The army&#x27;s resources were further diminished when an ill-timed attack by the Roman archers made it necessary to recall Valens&#x27;s emissary, &quot;comes&quot; Richomeres. The archers were beaten and retreated in humiliation. Returning from foraging to find the battle in full swing, Gothic cavalry under the command of Alatheus and Saphrax now struck and, in what was probably the most decisive event of the battle, the Roman cavalry fled.

From here, Ammianus gives two accounts of Valens&#x27;s demise. In the first account, Ammianus states that Valens was &quot;mortally wounded by an arrow, and presently breathed his last breath&quot; (XXXI.12). His body was never found or given a proper burial. In the second account, Ammianus states the Roman infantry was abandoned, surrounded and cut to pieces. Valens was wounded and carried to a small wooden hut. He died when the Goths, evidently unaware of the prize within, set the hut on fire (XXXI.13.14–16).

A third, apocryphal, account states that Valens was struck in the face by a Gothic dart and then perished while leading a charge. He wore no helmet, in order to encourage his men. This action turned the tide of the battle which resulted in a tactical victory but a strategic loss. The church historian Socrates likewise gives two accounts for the death of Valens.

Some have asserted that he was burnt to death in a village whither he had retired, which the barbarians assaulted and set on fire. But others affirm that having put off his imperial robe he ran into the midst of the main body of infantry; and that when the cavalry revolted and refused to engage, the infantry were surrounded by the barbarians, and completely destroyed in a body. Among these it is said the Emperor fell, but could not be distinguished, in consequence of his not having on his imperial habit.

When the battle was over, two-thirds of the eastern army lay dead. Many of their best officers had also perished. What was left of the army of Valens was led from the field under the cover of night by &quot;comes&quot; Richomeres and general Victor.

J. B. Bury, a noted historian of the period, provides a specific interpretation on the significance of the battle: it was &quot;a disaster and disgrace that need not have occurred.&quot;

For Rome, the battle incapacitated the government. Emperor Gratian, nineteen years old, was unable to deal with the catastrophe, until he appointed Theodosius I. The total defeat cost the administration important precious metal resources, as bullion had been centralized with the imperial court. Valens was deified by &quot;consecratio&quot; as .

== Assessment and legacy ==

&quot;Valens was utterly undistinguished, still only a &quot;protector&quot;, and possessed no military ability: he betrayed his consciousness of inferiority by his nervous suspicion of plots and savage punishment of alleged traitors,&quot; writes A. H. M. Jones, a modern historian. But Jones admits that &quot;he was a conscientious administrator, careful of the interests of the humble. Like his brother, he was an earnest Christian.&quot; According to Edward Gibbon (c. 1776–1789), Valens diminished the oppressive burden of the taxes which had been instituted by Constantine and his sons, and was humbly deferential to Valentinian&#x27;s edicts of reform, as with the institution of &quot;Defensors&quot; (a sort of substitute for the ancient Tribunes, guardians of the lower classes). Gibbon continues that his moderation and chastity in his private life were everywhere celebrated. At the same time, continuous proscriptions and executions, originating in his weak and fearful disposition, disgraced the dozen years of his reign. &quot;An anxious regard to his personal safety was the ruling principle of the administration of Valens&quot;, writes Gibbon. To have died in so inglorious a battle has thus come to be regarded as the nadir of an unfortunate career. This is especially true because of the profound consequences of Valens&#x27;s defeat. Adrianople spelled the beginning of the end for Roman territorial integrity in the late Empire and this fact was recognized even by contemporaries. Ammianus understood that it was the worst defeat in Roman history since the Battle of Edessa, and Rufinus called it &quot;the beginning of evils for the Roman empire then and thereafter.&quot;

Valens is also credited with the commission of a short history of the Roman State. This work, produced by Valens&#x27;s secretary Eutropius, and known by the name &quot;Breviarium ab Urbe condita&quot;, tells the story of Rome from its founding. According to some historians, Valens was motivated by the necessity of learning Roman history, that he, the royal family, and their appointees might better mix with the Roman senatorial class.

===Religious policy===

During his reign, Valens had to confront the theological diversity that was beginning to create division in the Empire. Julian (361–363), had tried to revive the pagan religions. His reactionary attempt took advantage of the dissensions among the different Christian factions, and a largely Pagan rank and file military. However, in spite of broad support, his actions were often viewed as excessive, and before he died in a campaign against the Persians, he was often treated with disdain. His death was considered a sign from the Christian God.

Valens was baptised by the Arian bishop of Constantinople before he set out on his first war against the Goths. While the Nicene Christian writers of his time identified Valens with the Arian faction and accused him of persecuting Nicene Christians, modern historians have described both Valens and Valentinian I as primarily interested in maintaining social order and have minimized their theological concerns. Although Athanasius was impelled, under his reign, to briefly go into hiding, Valens maintained a close dependency on his brother Valentinian and treated St. Basil mildly, both of whom supported the Nicene position. Not long after Valens died the cause of Arianism in the Roman East was to come to an end. His successor Theodosius I made Nicene Christianity the state religion of Rome and suppressed the Arians.

===Appearance===
The coin portraits of Valentinian and Valens give the faces of both emperors &quot;heavy features&quot;, rendered with &quot;no animation, and little consistency&quot;. Toward the end of his &quot;Res Gestae&quot; (XXXI.14.7), Ammianus says that Valens was physically compact, dark-complected, and of average height, &quot;knock-kneed, and somewhat pot-bellied&quot;, and had a &quot;dimmed&quot; pupil in one eye (the translator John C. Rolfe suggests that this is a description of a cataract).

<doc id="32524" wikidata="Q810735" url="?curid=32524" title="Batavia (1628 ship)">
<text>Batavia () was a ship of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). She was built in Amsterdam in 1628 as the flagship of one of the three annual fleets of company ships and sailed that year on her maiden voyage for Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. On 4 June 1629, &quot;Batavia&quot; was wrecked on the Houtman Abrolhos, a chain of small islands off Western Australia.

As the ship broke apart, approximately 300 of the &quot;Batavia&quot;″s 341 passengers and crew made their way ashore, the rest drowning in their attempts. Her commander, Francisco Pelsaert, sailed to Batavia to get help, leaving in charge senior VOC official Jeronimus Cornelisz, unaware he had been plotting a mutiny prior to the wreck. Cornelisz tricked about twenty men under soldier Wiebbe Hayes into searching for fresh water on nearby islands, leaving them to die. With the help of other mutineers, he then orchestrated a massacre that, over the course of several weeks, resulted in the murder of approximately 125 of the remaining survivors, including women, children and infants; a small number of women were kept as sex slaves.

Meanwhile, Hayes&#x27; group had unexpectedly found fresh water and, after learning of the atrocities, waged battles with Cornelisz&#x27;s group. In October 1629, at the height of their last and deadliest battle, they were interrupted by the return of Pelsaert aboard the rescue vessel &quot;Sardam&quot;. Pelsaert subsequently tried and convicted Cornelisz and six of his men, who became the first Europeans to be legally executed in Australia. Two other mutineers, convicted of comparatively minor crimes, were marooned on mainland Australia, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the Australian continent, although nothing more was heard of them. Only 122 of the original passengers made it to the port of Batavia.

Associated today with &quot;one of the worst horror stories in maritime history&quot;, &quot;Batavia&quot; has been the subject of numerous published histories. Due to its unique place in the history of European contact with Australia, the story of &quot;Batavia&quot; is sometimes offered as an alternative founding narrative to the landing of the First Fleet in Sydney. 

Of the forty-seven or so VOC wrecks which have been located and identified, &quot;Batavia&quot; is the only early 17th century example from which the remaining hull components have been retrieved, conserved and subject to detailed study. Many &quot;Batavia&quot; artifacts are housed at the Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum in Fremantle, while a replica of the ship is moored as a museum ship in Lelystad in the Netherlands.

==Construction==
In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch were the major ship-builders of northern Europe, innovating both designs (e.g. the Fluyt) and technology (the windmill driven sawmill). They did, though, use the &quot;bottom-based&quot; construction sequence, which uses a shell-first system for the lower part of the hull. The planks are shaped and then laid edge to edge, having the appearance of carvel construction, but are put in position before the frames are installed. The shape of the bottom of the hull is therefore derived from the shaping of the hull planks. The &quot;bottom-based&quot; construction sequence is the same as used on Medieval cogs and some argue that this is an older Romano-Celtic building tradition.

Ships belonging to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were generally built in the company&#x27;s own shipyards. The VOC issued charters which gave detailed specifications for these ships; these were updated from time to time. The charters gave a range of key hull dimensions and scheduled the sizes of the . However, the designs did not exist as plans or drawings that determined the shape of the hull. Unlike ships built for European trade, the VOC East Indiamen were planked with a double skin of oak structural planking. This was sheathed with a double layer of pine which incorporated tar and animal hair, together with closely spaced iron nails. The pine layer was intended to resist teredo worm.

The length to beam ratio of Batavia was 4.4:1. This made her narrower than preceding VOC ships. A 1619 VOC ship-building charter gives a length to beam ratio of 3.9:1. It is suggested that there was a trend for VOC to have increasingly narrower designs in the early part of the 17th century. All VOC ships had a relatively high length to beam ratio, covering a range of 3.7:1 to 4.5:1. This was at a time when a 3:1 ratio would not have been unusual.

&quot;Batavia&quot;, in common with other Dutch ships of the time, was built from oak imported from the forests bordering the Vistula. The Dutch trade in timber from the Baltic, particularly oak, dates back to the early 13th century. (By the early 17th century, Dutch merchants dominated the European timber trade.) Oak from the Vistula region ceased to be used after 1643. It is possible that Dutch shipbuilding had, by then, been a cause of deforestation of the area.

&quot;Batavia&quot; may have been one of two ships specified in the VOC shipbuilding charter of 29 March 1626normally it took 18 months to build one of these vessels, so a small delay would fit the dates. The name &quot;Batavia&quot; was chosen on 29 June 1628. The leaders of the VOC pushed for the ship to be ready for the next fleet (consisting of five other ships), which was due to leave in September or October 1628. &quot;Batavia&quot; would be the flagship of this fleet.

==Maiden voyage==
On 29 October 1628, the newly built &quot;Batavia&quot;, commissioned by the VOC, sailed from Texel in the Netherlands for the Dutch East Indies, to obtain spices. Their orders were to use the Brouwer Route, like all ships of the Dutch East India Company. This involved sailing to the south of a direct course to Jakarta, but without any way of measuring longitude, it was difficult to judge when to make the turn north. A late turn gave the risk of running aground on the coast of Australia.

She sailed under commander and senior merchant Francisco Pelsaert, with Ariaen Jacobsz serving as skipper. Pelsaert and Jacobsz had previously encountered each other in Dutch Suratte, when Pelsaert publicly dressed-down Jacobsz after he became drunk and insulted Pelsaert in front of other merchants. Animosity existed between the two men after this incident. Also on board was the junior merchant Jeronimus Cornelisz (30), a bankrupt apothecary from Haarlem who was fleeing the Netherlands, in fear of arrest because of his heretical beliefs associated with the painter Johannes van der Beeck.

=== Mutiny plot ===
According to Pelsaert&#x27;s account, Jacobsz and Cornelisz conceived a plan to take the ship during the voyage, which would allow them to start a new life elsewhere, using the huge supply of trade gold and silver on board. After leaving the Cape of Good Hope, where they had stopped for supplies, Jacobsz is alleged by Pelsaert to have deliberately steered the ship off course, and away from the rest of the fleet. Jacobsz and Cornelisz had already gathered a small group of men around them and arranged an incident from which the mutiny was to ensue. This involved sexually assaulting a prominent young female passenger, Lucretia Jans, in order to provoke Pelsaert into disciplining the crew. They hoped to paint his discipline as unfair and recruit more members out of sympathy. However, the woman was unable to identify her attackers.

=== Shipwreck ===

On 4 June 1629, &quot;Batavia&quot; struck Morning Reef near Beacon Island, part of the Houtman Abrolhos off the western coast of Australia. Of the 322 aboard, most of the passengers and crew managed to get ashore, although 40 people drowned. The survivors, including all the women and children, were then transferred to nearby islands in the ship&#x27;s longboat and yawl.

An initial survey of the islands found no fresh water and only limited food (sea lions and birds). Pelsaert realised the dire situation and decided to search for water on the mainland. A group consisting of Jacobsz, Pelsaert, senior officers, a few crew members, and some passengers left the wreck site in a longboat in search of drinking water. After an unsuccessful search for water on the mainland, they left the other survivors and headed north in a danger-fraught voyage to the city of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, the ship&#x27;s namesake, to seek rescue. En route the crew made further forays onto the mainland in search of fresh water.

In his journal, Pelsaert stated that on 15 June 1629, they sailed through a channel between a reef and the coast, finding an opening around midday at a latitude guessed to be about 23 degrees south where they were able to land, and water was found. The group spent the night on land. Pelsaert commented on the vast number of termite mounds in the vicinity and the plague of flies that afflicted them. Pelsaert stated that they continued north with the intention of finding the &quot;river of Jacob Remmessens&quot;, identified first in 1622, but owing to the wind were unable to land. Drake-Brockman has suggested that this location is to be identified with Yardie Creek.

It was not until the longboat reached the island of Nusa Kambangan in the Dutch East Indies that Pelsaert and the others found more water. The journey took 33 days, with everyone surviving. After their arrival in Batavia, the boatswain, Jan Evertsz, was arrested and executed for negligence and &quot;outrageous behavior&quot; before the loss of the ship (he was suspected to have been involved). Jacobsz was also arrested for negligence, although his culpability in the potential mutiny was not guessed by Pelsaert.

Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen immediately gave Pelsaert command of to rescue the other survivors, as well as to attempt to salvage riches from &quot;Batavia&quot;″s wreck. Within a month, Pelsaert reached the general area where the shipwreck had occurred, but it took another month of searching to locate the islands again. He finally arrived at the site only to discover that a bloody massacre had taken place among the survivors, reducing their numbers by at least a hundred.

===Murders===

Cornelisz was one of the few men who stayed on &quot;Batavia&quot; to pillage and steal. He was one of the few who survived the final break-up of the ship and made it to Beacon Island after floating for two days. Though neither sailor nor soldier, Cornelisz was elected to be in charge of the survivors due to his senior rank in the Dutch East India Company. He made plans to hijack any rescue ship that might return and use the vessel to seek another safe haven. Cornelisz made far-fetched plans to start a new kingdom, using the gold and silver from the wreck. However, to carry out this plan, he first needed to eliminate possible opponents.
Cornelisz&#x27;s first deliberate act was to have all weapons and food supplies commandeered and placed under his control. He then moved a group of soldiers, led by Wiebbe Hayes, to nearby West Wallabi Island (located roughly to the northwest), under the pretense of having them search for water. They were told to send smoke signals when they found water and they would then be rescued. Convinced that they would be unsuccessful, he then left them there to die, taking complete control of the remaining survivors.

Cornelisz never committed any of the murders himself, although he tried and failed to poison a baby (who was eventually strangled). Instead, he coerced others into doing it for him, usually under the pretense that the victim had committed a crime such as theft. Cornelisz and his henchmen had originally murdered to save themselves, but eventually they began to kill for pleasure or out of habit. Cornelisz planned to reduce the island&#x27;s population to around 45 so that their supplies would last as long as possible. He also feared that many of the survivors remained loyal to the company. In total, Cornelisz&#x27;s followers murdered at least 110 men, women, and children. A small number of women were kept as sex slaves; among them was Jans, who Cornelisz reserved for himself.

===Rescue===
Although Cornelisz had left the soldiers, led by Hayes, to die, they had in fact found good sources of water and food on West Wallabi Island. Initially, they were unaware of the massacres taking place and sent pre-arranged smoke signals announcing their finds. However, they soon learned of the killings from survivors fleeing Beacon Island. In response, the soldiers devised makeshift weapons from materials washed up from the wreck. They also set a watch so that they were ready for Cornelisz&#x27;s men, and built a small fort out of limestone and coral blocks.

Cornelisz seized on the news of water on the other island, as his own supply was dwindling and the continued survival of the soldiers threatened his own success. He was fearful that any rescue vessel would sight the soldiers first, therefore dispatched his men to eliminate this threat. But the trained soldiers were by now much better fed than Cornelisz&#x27; group and easily defeated them in several battles. Seeking to bring Hayes under his command he traveled to the island himself, whereby Hayes and his soldiers took Cornelisz hostage. The men who escaped regrouped under soldier Wouter Loos and tried again, this time employing muskets to besiege Hayes&#x27; fort and almost defeating the soldiers. However, Hayes&#x27; men prevailed again just as &quot;Sardam&quot; arrived. A race to the rescue ship ensued between Cornelisz&#x27; men and the soldiers. Hayes reached the ship first and was able to present his side of the story to Pelsaert. After a short battle, the combined force captured all of Cornelisz&#x27;s group.

===Aftermath===

Pelsaert decided to conduct a trial on the islands, because &quot;Sardam&quot; on the return voyage to Batavia would have been overcrowded with both survivors and prisoners. After a brief trial, the worst offenders were taken to Seal Island and executed. Cornelisz and several of his henchmen had both hands chopped off before being hanged.

Loos and a cabin boy, Jan Pelgrom de Bye, who were considered only minor offenders, were marooned on mainland Australia, and were never heard of again. This made them the first Europeans to have permanently lived on the Australian continent. This location is now thought to be Wittecarra Creek near Kalbarri, Western Australia, though another suggestion is nearby Port Gregory.
The rest of Cornelisz&#x27; henchmen were taken to Batavia for trial. Five were hanged, while several others were flogged, keelhauled or dropped from the yardarm on the later voyage back home. Cornelisz&#x27; second in command, Jacop Pietersz, was broken on the wheel, the most severe punishment available at the time. Jacobsz, despite being tortured, did not confess to his part in plotting the mutiny and escaped execution due to lack of evidence. What finally became of him is unknown; he might have died in prison in Batavia. A board of inquiry decided that Pelsaert had exercised a lack of authority and was therefore partly responsible for what had happened. His financial assets were seized, and he died within a year of disease. His journals on the matter would be published in 1647 and widely read, spreading knowledge of the dangers of the coast of Western Australia.

Hayes was hailed a hero and promoted to sergeant, which increased his salary, while those who had been under his command were promoted to the rank of corporal. Of the original 332 people on board &quot;Batavia&quot;, only 122 made it to the port of Batavia. &quot;Sardam&quot; eventually sailed home with most of the treasure previously carried on &quot;Batavia&quot;. Of the twelve treasure chests that were originally on board, ten were recovered and taken aboard &quot;Sardam&quot;.

== Wreck ==

Surveying the north-west coast of the Abrolhos Islands for the British Admiralty in April 1840, Captain John Lort Stokes reported that &quot;the beams of a large vessel were discovered&quot;, assumed to be , &quot;on the south west point of an island&quot;, reminding them that since &quot;Zeewijk&quot;″s crew &quot;reported having seen a wreck of a ship on this part, there is little doubt that the remains were those of the &quot;Batavia&quot;&quot;.

In the 1950s, historian Henrietta Drake-Brockman argued, from extensive archival research, that the &quot;Batavia&quot; wreck must lie in the Wallabi group of islands. The wreck was first sighted in 1963 by lobster fisherman David Johnson.

A systematic archaeological investigation was carried out in the 1970s. Most of the excavation work was carried out over four years, starting in 1972, with an initial survey in 1971. A large amount of the surviving hull was raised and conserved. This is about 20 tons of timber, which is about 3.5% of the original ship&#x27;s hull. Other large items including port-side stern timbers, cannons and an anchor. A large selection of smaller items were excavated, with a many pottery containers, weapons, cooking equipment, navigation items (including four astrolabes). Added to this were various trade items carried as part of the ship&#x27;s cargo.

The excavation was carried out in challenging conditions, with the swell coming in from the Indian Ocean preventing diving on 173 days of the 447 days spent on site. Some of that diving was restricted to the inner wreck site, where material had been carried to an area sheltered from the swell inside the reef. In the fourth season on site (starting September 1975) only 10 days of diving were possible on the more exposed main wreck site. 

To facilitate the monitoring and any future treatment, the hull timbers were erected on a steel frame. Its design—and that of a stone arch, also recovered—was such that individual components could be easily removed.

In 1972, the Dutch government transferred rights to Dutch shipwrecks in Australian waters to the Australian government. Excavated items are on display at the Western Australian Museum&#x27;s various locations, though the majority of cannons and anchors have been left &quot;in situ&quot;. The wreck remains one of the premier diving sites on the Western Australian coast.

===Bullion and jewels===

&quot;Batavia&quot; carried a considerable amount of silver coins, manufactured silver items and jewels. The manufactured silverware were trade goods that Pelsaert had specifically requested to use in improving the VOC&#x27;s trading capabilityhe had found that these were sought after by the &quot;great men&quot; he had dealt with in Agra. Though Pelsaert&#x27;s divers recovered some of the silverware in his salvage operations, a large quantity still remained to be recovered in the archaeolocial investigation. As well as more usual tableware, the silver finds included parts of bedsteads. 

Each ship in the &quot;Batavia&quot; class carried an estimated 250,000 guilders in twelve wooden chests, each containing about 8,000 silver coins. This money was intended for the purchase of spices and other commodities in Java. The bulk of these coins were silver rijksdaalder produced by the individual Dutch states, with the remainder being mostly made up of similar coins produced by German cities such as Hamburg.

Pelsaert was instructed to recover as much of the money as possible on his return to the Abrolhos Islands, using divers &quot;to try if it is possible to salvage all the money [and] the casket of jewels that before your departure was already saved on the small island&quot;. Recovery of the money was far from easy. Pelsaert reported difficulties in pulling up heavy chests, e.g. 27 October 1629, when a chest had to be marked with a buoy for later recovery. On 9 November, he recorded sending four money chests to &quot;Sardam&quot;, and three the next day, but then abandoned further recovery work. By 13 November, Pelsaert recorded that ten money chests had been recovered—about 80,000 coins—leaving two lost since there had been twelve loaded originally. One was jammed under a cannon, and the other one had been broken open by Cornelisz&#x27; men.

&quot;Batavia&quot;″s cargo also included special items being carried by Pelsaert for sale to the Mughal Court in India where he had intended to travel on to. There were four jewel bags, stated to be worth about 60,000 guilders, and an early-fourth-century Roman cameo, as well as numerous other items either now displayed in Fremantle and Geraldton, Western Australia, or recovered by Pelsaert.

== Legacy ==

A &quot;Batavia&quot; ship replica was built from 1985 to 1995, using the same materials and methods utilized in the early 17th century. Her design was based on contemporary accounts, recovered wreckage, and other contemporary ships such as . After a number of commemorative voyages, the vessel is now moored as a museum ship in Lelystad in the Netherlands.

== Media ==
The story was retold in Hugh Edwards&#x27; &quot;Islands of Angry Ghosts&quot; which described the wreck and aftermath and then followed with the story of the discovery and recovery. 

In 1973, Bruce Beresford produced a film about the ship called &quot;The Wreck of the Batavia&quot;. Another documentary film, &quot;The Batavia – Wreck, Mutiny and Murder&quot;, was aired on the Nine Network in 1995. 

In 2001 the Welsh author Mike Dash published his book, &quot;Batavia&#x27;s Graveyard: The True Story of the Mad Heretic Who Led History&#x27;s Bloodiest Mutiny&quot;, a historiographic account of the events and people aboard the &quot;Batavia&quot;. 

Arabella Edge&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Company: The Story of a Murderer&quot; (2000) provided a fictionalised account of the wreck of the ship, and the aftermath.

In 2012 Peter Fitzsimons released a book called &quot;Batavia&quot; discussing the events in detail and in 2017, a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report detailed the archaeological recovery of the skeletal remains of some of the victims. 

The voyage, shipwreck and subsequent events are the subject of David Mark&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;Anatomy of a Heretic&quot; as well as Jess Kidd&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;The Night Ship&quot;.

Several podcasts have covered the incident including: &quot;The Dollop&quot; in September 2015, &quot;Casefile True Crime Podcast&quot; in February 2020, as did &quot;Omnibus&quot;, Ken Jennings and John Roderick&#x27;s podcast in 2022 and Last Podcast on the Left in 2025.

The Dutch music ensemble Flairck processed the unfortunate voyage of the Batavia on their 1996 album &quot;De Gouden Eeuw&quot; and on a subsequent tour with stage performances.

The extreme metal band Deströyer 666 wrote a song about the mutiny, &quot;Batavia&#x27;s Graveyard&quot;, which is featured on their album &quot;Never Surrender&quot;.

In a 2023 interview, the developer of reality TV show The Traitors, Jasper Hoogendoorn, stated that the original concept of the show was strongly influenced by the story of the &quot;Batavia.&quot;

<doc id="32525" wikidata="Q26674641" url="?curid=32525" title="Amsterdam (1748)">
<text>Amsterdam () was an 18th-century cargo ship of the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: &quot;Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie&quot;; &quot;VOC&quot;). The ship started its maiden voyage from Texel to Batavia on 8 January 1749, but was wrecked in a storm on the English Channel on 26 January 1749. The shipwreck was discovered in 1969 in the bay of Bulverhythe, near Hastings on the English south coast, and is sometimes visible during low tides. The location in 1969 was found by Bill Young, the site agent/project manager for the sewage outfall being built by the William Press Group. With time on his hands during the long stay away from home, he followed up the rumour of the going aground. He was castigated by the Museum of London for scooping out the interior of the bow with a digger as it could have led to the structure collapsing. However, it uncovered the initial items which led to a more extensive excavation of the cargo which reflected life at the time. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England. Some of the findings from the site are in The Shipwreck Museum in Hastings. A replica of the ship is on display in Amsterdam.

==Ship==
The &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was a Dutch &quot;Transom Return Ship&quot; () built as an East Indiaman for transport between the Dutch Republic and the settlements and strongholds of the Dutch East India Company in the East Indies. On an outward voyage these ships carried guns and bricks for the settlements and strongholds, and silver and golden coins to purchase Asian goods. On a return journey the ships carried the goods that were purchased, such as spices, fabrics, and china. In both directions the ships carried victuals, clothes, and tools for the sailors and soldiers on the ship. On an outward voyage of eight months, the ships were populated by around 240 men, and on a return journey by around 70.

The &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was built in the shipyard for the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch East India Company in Amsterdam. The ship was made of oak wood.

==Maiden voyage==
The maiden voyage of the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was planned from the Dutch island Texel to the settlement Batavia in the East Indies. The ship, commanded by the 33-year-old captain Willem Klump, had 203 crew, 127 soldiers, and 5 passengers. The &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was laden with textiles, wine, stone ballast, cannon, paper, pens, pipes, domestic goods and 27 chests of silver guilder coins. The whole cargo would be worth several million euros in modern money.

On 15 November 1748 the ship made its first attempt but returned on 19 November 1748 due to an adverse wind. The ship made a second attempt on 21 November 1748, which also failed and from which the ship returned on 6 December 1748. The third attempt was made on 8 January 1749. The &quot;Amsterdam&quot; had problems in the English Channel tacking into a strong westerly storm. For many days she got no further than Beachy Head near Eastbourne. An epidemic appeared amongst the crew and a mutiny broke out. Finally the rudder broke off and the ship, helpless in a storm, grounded in the mud and sand in the bay of Bulverhythe on 26 January 1749, to the west of Hastings.

She began to sink into the mud, where much of the keel remains today, perfectly preserved. Some of the cargo, including silver coinage, was removed for safekeeping by local authorities. There was an outbreak of fighting between scavengers and British troops had to be called in to bring the situation to order. The crew were looked after locally before being returned to Dutch soil.

==Shipwreck==

In 1969, the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; was discovered after being exposed by a low spring tide. It is the best-preserved VOC ship ever found. Archaeologist Peter Marsden did the first surveying of the wreck, and he advised further excavation.

The wrecksite was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 5 February 1974.

The VOC Ship Amsterdam Foundation started researching the wreck, followed by major excavations in 1984, 1985 and 1986, during which huge numbers of artefacts were found. Although the wreck is submerged in the sand and mud of the beach (and is even visible at very low tides), much of the excavation was done by divers, for whom a small tower was constructed near the wreck. Additionally the wreck was surrounded by an iron girder frame. The archeological output was so dense that new ways of researching needed to be developed, all of which were needed to understand the technological, socio-economic and cultural features of the VOC. Some of the finds are on show at the Shipwreck Museum in Hastings, East Sussex, UK, including one of the anchors, the other being on display as public art at St Katharine Docks in London. The wreck is protected and diving on it or removing timbers or any artefacts is forbidden. The ship may be visited as the timbers are exposed at very low tides in the sand just opposite the footbridge over the railway line at Bulverhythe.

==Ship replica==
A replica of the ship was built in Iroko wood by 300 volunteers using modern tools as well as tools of the period, between 1985 and 1990 at the Zouthaven (now Piet Heinkade), Amsterdam. It is moored next to the Netherlands Maritime Museum, where it is open to visitors of the museum (which has now reopened after being closed for several years for renovations). 

As for the original ship, there had been hopes in the 1980s that the Dutch Government, which still owns it, might excavate the whole wreck and return it for restoration and display in Amsterdam, like the &quot;Regalskeppet Vasa&quot; in Sweden, or the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; in Portsmouth, but the funds were not forthcoming. Several decks and much of the bowsprit lie submerged in the mud and are in remarkably good condition, being naturally preserved by the mud, and much of the cargo is still aboard.

==Popular culture==
The comic book &quot;Angst op de &quot;Amsterdam&quot;&quot; of Spike and Suzy is about the &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. The book was published in 1985 in The Red Series of Spike and Suzy.

In the miniature park Madurodam in The Hague is a model of the &quot;Amsterdam&quot; on a scale of 1:25. The Amsterdam Museum also has a wooden model of the ship with to the side a &#x27;Camel&#x27; lifting mechanism.

Shanty Punk band Skinny Lister, some of whom live in Hastings, released a single &quot;Damn the Amsterdam&quot; about the ship.

<doc id="32528" wikidata="Q75785" url="?curid=32528" title="Visual cortex">
<text>The visual cortex of the brain is the area of the cerebral cortex that processes visual information. It is located in the occipital lobe. Sensory input originating from the eyes travels through the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and then reaches the visual cortex. The area of the visual cortex that receives the sensory input from the lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary visual cortex, also known as visual area 1 (V1), Brodmann area 17, or the striate cortex. The extrastriate areas consist of visual areas 2, 3, 4, and 5 (also known as V2, V3, V4, and V5, or Brodmann area 18 and all Brodmann area 19).

Both hemispheres of the brain include a visual cortex; the visual cortex in the left hemisphere receives signals from the right visual field, and the visual cortex in the right hemisphere receives signals from the left visual field.

==Introduction==
The primary visual cortex (V1) is located in and around the calcarine fissure in the occipital lobe. Each hemisphere&#x27;s V1 receives information directly from its ipsilateral lateral geniculate nucleus that receives signals from the contralateral visual hemifield.

Neurons in the visual cortex fire action potentials when visual stimuli appear within their receptive field. By definition, the receptive field is the region within the entire visual field that elicits an action potential. But, for any given neuron, it may respond best to a subset of stimuli within its receptive field. This property is called &quot;neuronal tuning&quot;. In the earlier visual areas, neurons have simpler tuning. For example, a neuron in V1 may fire to any vertical stimulus in its receptive field. In the higher visual areas, neurons have complex tuning. For example, in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), a neuron may fire only when a certain face appears in its receptive field.

Furthermore, the arrangement of receptive fields in V1 is retinotopic, meaning neighboring cells in V1 have receptive fields that correspond to adjacent portions of the visual field. This spatial organization allows for a systematic representation of the visual world within V1. Additionally, recent studies have delved into the role of contextual modulation in V1, where the perception of a stimulus is influenced not only by the stimulus itself but also by the surrounding context, highlighting the intricate processing capabilities of V1 in shaping our visual experiences.

The visual cortex receives its blood supply primarily from the calcarine branch of the posterior cerebral artery.

The size of V1, V2, and V3 can vary three-fold, a difference that is partially inherited.

== Psychological model of the neural processing of visual information ==

=== Ventral-dorsal model ===
V1 transmits information to two primary pathways, called the ventral stream and the dorsal stream.
* The ventral stream begins with V1, goes through visual area V2, then through visual area V4, and to the inferior temporal cortex (IT cortex). The ventral stream, sometimes called the &quot;What Pathway&quot;, is associated with form recognition and object representation. It is also associated with storage of long-term memory.
* The dorsal stream begins with V1, goes through Visual area V2, then to the dorsomedial area (DM/V6) and middle temporal area (MT/V5) and to the posterior parietal cortex. The dorsal stream, sometimes called the &quot;Where Pathway&quot; or &quot;How Pathway&quot;, is associated with motion, representation of object locations, and control of the eyes and arms, especially when visual information is used to guide saccades or reaching.

The what vs. where account of the ventral/dorsal pathways was first described by Ungerleider and Mishkin.

More recently, Goodale and Milner extended these ideas and suggested that the ventral stream is critical for visual perception whereas the dorsal stream mediates the visual control of skilled actions. It has been shown that visual illusions such as the Ebbinghaus illusion distort judgements of a perceptual nature, but when the subject responds with an action, such as grasping, no distortion occurs.

Work such as that from Franz &quot;et al.&quot; suggests that both the action and perception systems are equally fooled by such illusions. Other studies, however, provide strong support for the idea that skilled actions such as grasping are not affected by pictorial illusions and suggest that the action/perception dissociation is a useful way to characterize the functional division of labor between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways in the cerebral cortex.

== Primary visual cortex (V1) ==

The primary visual cortex is the most studied visual area in the brain. In mammals, it is located in the posterior pole of the occipital lobe and is the simplest, earliest cortical visual area. It is highly specialized for processing information about static and moving objects and is excellent in pattern recognition.
Moreover, V1 is characterized by a laminar organization, with six distinct layers, each playing a unique role in visual processing. Neurons in the superficial layers (II and III) are often involved in local processing and communication within the cortex, while neurons in the deeper layers (V and VI) often send information to other brain regions involved in higher-order visual processing and decision-making.

Research on V1 has also revealed the presence of orientation-selective cells, which respond preferentially to stimuli with a specific orientation, contributing to the perception of edges and contours. The discovery of these orientation-selective cells has been fundamental in shaping our understanding of how V1 processes visual information.

Furthermore, V1 exhibits plasticity, allowing it to undergo functional and structural changes in response to sensory experience. Studies have demonstrated that sensory deprivation or exposure to enriched environments can lead to alterations in the organization and responsiveness of V1 neurons, highlighting the dynamic nature of this critical visual processing hub.

The primary visual cortex, which is defined by its function or stage in the visual system, is approximately equivalent to the striate cortex, also known as Brodmann area 17, which is defined by its anatomical location. The name &quot;striate cortex&quot; is derived from the line of Gennari, a distinctive stripe visible to the naked eye that represents myelinated axons from the lateral geniculate body terminating in layer 4 of the gray matter.

Brodmann area 17 is just one subdivision of the broader Brodmann areas, which are regions of the cerebral cortex defined based on cytoarchitectural differences. In the case of the striate cortex, the line of Gennari corresponds to a band rich in myelinated nerve fibers, providing a clear marker for the primary visual processing region.

Additionally, the functional significance of the striate cortex extends beyond its role as the primary visual cortex. It serves as a crucial hub for the initial processing of visual information, such as the analysis of basic features like orientation, spatial frequency, and color. The integration of these features in the striate cortex forms the foundation for more complex visual processing carried out in higher-order visual areas. Recent neuroimaging studies have contributed to a deeper understanding of the dynamic interactions within the striate cortex and its connections with other visual and non-visual brain regions, shedding light on the intricate neural circuits that underlie visual perception.

The primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers, labeled 1 to 6. Layer 4, which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is further divided into 4 layers, labelled 4A, 4B, 4Cα, and 4Cβ. Sublamina 4Cα receives mostly magnocellular input from the LGN, while layer 4Cβ receives input from parvocellular pathways.

The average number of neurons in the adult human primary visual cortex in each hemisphere has been estimated at 140 million. The volume of each V1 area in an adult human is about 5400mmformula_1 on average. A study of 25 hemispheres from 15 normal individuals with average age 59 years at autopsy found a very high variation, from 4272 to 7027mmformula_1 for the right hemisphere (mean 5692mmformula_1), and from 3185 to 7568mmformula_1 for the left hemisphere (mean 5119mmformula_1), with 0.81 correlation between left and right hemispheres. The same study found average V1 area 2400mmformula_6 per hemisphere, but with very high variability. (Right hemisphere mean 2477mmformula_6, range 1441–3221mmformula_6. Left hemisphere mean 2315mmformula_6, range 1438–3365mmformula_6.)

=== Function ===
The initial stage of visual processing within the cortex, known as V1, plays a fundamental role in shaping our perception of the visual world. V1 possesses a meticulously defined map, referred to as the retinotopic map, which intricately organizes spatial information from the visual field. In humans, the upper bank of the calcarine sulcus in the occipital lobe robustly responds to the lower half of the visual field, while the lower bank responds to the upper half. This retinotopic mapping conceptually represents a projection of the visual image from the retina to V1.

The importance of this retinotopic organization lies in its ability to preserve spatial relationships present in the external environment. Neighboring neurons in V1 exhibit responses to adjacent portions of the visual field, creating a systematic representation of the visual scene. This mapping extends both vertically and horizontally, ensuring the conservation of both horizontal and vertical relationships within the visual input.

Moreover, the retinotopic map demonstrates a remarkable degree of plasticity, adapting to alterations in visual experience. Studies have revealed that changes in sensory input, such as those induced by visual training or deprivation, can lead to shifts in the retinotopic map. This adaptability underscores the brain&#x27;s capacity to reorganize in response to varying environmental demands, highlighting the dynamic nature of visual processing.

Beyond its spatial processing role, the retinotopic map in V1 establishes intricate connections with other visual areas, forming a network crucial for integrating diverse visual features and constructing a coherent visual percept. This dynamic mapping mechanism is indispensable for our ability to navigate and interpret the visual world effectively.

The correspondence between specific locations in V1 and the subjective visual field is exceptionally precise, even extending to map the blind spots of the retina. Evolutionarily, this correspondence is a fundamental feature found in most animals possessing a V1. In humans and other species with a fovea (cones in the retina), a substantial portion of V1 is mapped to the small central portion of the visual field—a phenomenon termed cortical magnification. This magnification reflects an increased representation and processing capacity devoted to the central visual field, essential for detailed visual acuity and high-resolution processing.

Notably, neurons in V1 have the smallest receptive field size, signifying the highest resolution, among visual cortex microscopic regions. This specialization equips V1 with the ability to capture fine details and nuances in the visual input, emphasizing its pivotal role as a critical hub in early visual processing and contributing significantly to our intricate and nuanced visual perception.

In addition to its role in spatial processing, the retinotopic map in V1 is intricately connected with other visual areas, forming a network that contributes to the integration of various visual features and the construction of a coherent visual percept. This dynamic mapping mechanism is fundamental to our ability to navigate and interpret the visual world effectively. The correspondence between a given location in V1 and in the subjective visual field is very precise: even the blind spots of the retina are mapped into V1. In terms of evolution, this correspondence is very basic and found in most animals that possess a V1. In humans and other animals with a fovea (cones in the retina), a large portion of V1 is mapped to the small, central portion of visual field, a phenomenon known as cortical magnification. Perhaps for the purpose of accurate spatial encoding, neurons in V1 have the smallest receptive field size (that is, the highest resolution) of any visual cortex microscopic regions.

The tuning properties of V1 neurons (what the neurons respond to) differ greatly over time. Early in time (40 ms and further) individual V1 neurons have strong tuning to a small set of stimuli. That is, the neuronal responses can discriminate small changes in visual orientations, spatial frequencies and colors (as in the optical system of a camera obscura, but projected onto retinal cells of the eye, which are clustered in density and fineness). Each V1 neuron propagates a signal from a retinal cell, in continuation. Furthermore, individual V1 neurons in humans and other animals with binocular vision have ocular dominance, namely tuning to one of the two eyes. In V1, and primary sensory cortex in general, neurons with similar tuning properties tend to cluster together as cortical columns. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel proposed the classic ice-cube organization model of cortical columns for two tuning properties: ocular dominance and orientation. However, this model cannot accommodate the color, spatial frequency and many other features to which neurons are tuned . The exact organization of all these cortical columns within V1 remains a hot topic of current research.

The receptive fields of V1 neurons resemble Gabor functions, so the operation of the visual cortex has been compared to the Gabor transform.

Later in time (after 100 ms), neurons in V1 are also sensitive to the more global organisation of the scene. These response properties probably stem from recurrent feedback processing (the influence of higher-tier cortical areas on lower-tier cortical areas) and lateral connections from pyramidal neurons. While feedforward connections are mainly driving, feedback connections are mostly modulatory in their effects. Evidence shows that feedback originating in higher-level areas such as V4, IT, or MT, with bigger and more complex receptive fields, can modify and shape V1 responses, accounting for contextual or extra-classical receptive field effects.

The visual information relayed by V1 is sometimes described as edge detection. As an example, for an image comprising half side black and half side white, the dividing line between black and white has strongest local contrast (that is, edge detection) and is encoded, while few neurons code the brightness information (black or white per se). As information is further relayed to subsequent visual areas, it is coded as increasingly non-local frequency/phase signals. Note that, at these early stages of cortical visual processing, spatial location of visual information is well preserved amid the local contrast encoding (edge detection).
In primates, one role of V1 might be to create a saliency map (highlights what is important) from visual inputs to guide the shifts of attention known as gaze shifts.

According to the V1 Saliency Hypothesis, V1 does this by transforming visual inputs to neural firing rates from millions of neurons, such that the visual location signaled by the highest firing neuron is the most salient location to attract gaze shift. V1&#x27;s outputs are received by the superior colliculus (in the mid-brain), among other locations, which reads out the V1 activities to guide gaze shifts.

Differences in size of V1 also seem to have an effect on the perception of illusions.

== V2 == 
Visual area V2, or secondary visual cortex, also called prestriate cortex, receives strong feedforward connections from V1 (direct and via the pulvinar) and sends robust connections to V3, V4, and V5. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in the integration and processing of visual information.

The feedforward connections from V1 to V2 contribute to the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli. V2 neurons build upon the basic features detected in V1, extracting more complex visual attributes such as texture, depth, and color. This hierarchical processing is essential for the construction of a more nuanced and detailed representation of the visual scene.

Furthermore, the reciprocal feedback connections from V2 to V1 play a significant role in modulating the activity of V1 neurons. This feedback loop is thought to be involved in processes such as attention, perceptual grouping, and figure-ground segregation. The dynamic interplay between V1 and V2 highlights the intricate nature of information processing within the visual system.

Moreover, V2&#x27;s connections with subsequent visual areas, including V3, V4, and V5, contribute to the formation of a distributed network for visual processing. These connections enable the integration of different visual features, such as motion and form, across multiple stages of the visual hierarchy.

In terms of anatomy, V2 is split into four quadrants, a dorsal and ventral representation in the left and the right hemispheres. Together, these four regions provide a complete map of the visual world. V2 has many properties in common with V1: Cells are tuned to simple properties such as orientation, spatial frequency, and color. The responses of many V2 neurons are also modulated by more complex properties, such as the orientation of illusory contours, binocular disparity, and whether the stimulus is part of the figure or the ground. Recent research has shown that V2 cells show a small amount of attentional modulation (more than V1, less than V4), are tuned for moderately complex patterns, and may be driven by multiple orientations at different subregions within a single receptive field.

It is argued that the entire ventral visual-to-hippocampal stream is important for visual memory. This theory, unlike the dominant one, predicts that object-recognition memory (ORM) alterations could result from the manipulation in V2, an area that is highly interconnected within the ventral stream of visual cortices. In the monkey brain, this area receives strong feedforward connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) and sends strong projections to other secondary visual cortices (V3, V4, and V5). Most of the neurons of this area in primates are tuned to simple visual characteristics such as orientation, spatial frequency, size, color, and shape. Anatomical studies implicate layer 3 of area V2 in visual-information processing. In contrast to layer 3, layer 6 of the visual cortex is composed of many types of neurons, and their response to visual stimuli is more complex.

In one study, the Layer 6 cells of the V2 cortex were found to play a very important role in the storage of Object Recognition Memory as well as the conversion of short-term object memories into long-term memories.

== Third visual cortex, including area V3 ==
The term third visual complex refers to the region of cortex located immediately in front of V2, which includes the region named visual area V3 in humans. The &quot;complex&quot; nomenclature is justified by the fact that some controversy still exists regarding the exact extent of area V3, with some researchers proposing that the cortex located in front of V2 may include two or three functional subdivisions. For example, David Van Essen and others (1986) have proposed the existence of a &quot;dorsal V3&quot; in the upper part of the cerebral hemisphere, which is distinct from the &quot;ventral V3&quot; (or ventral posterior area, VP) located in the lower part of the brain. Dorsal and ventral V3 have distinct connections with other parts of the brain, appear different in sections stained with a variety of methods, and contain neurons that respond to different combinations of visual stimulus (for example, colour-selective neurons are more common in the ventral V3). Additional subdivisions, including V3A and V3B have also been reported in humans. These subdivisions are located near dorsal V3, but do not adjoin V2.

Dorsal V3 is normally considered to be part of the dorsal stream, receiving inputs from V2 and from the primary visual area and projecting to the posterior parietal cortex. It may be anatomically located in Brodmann area 19. Braddick using fMRI has suggested that area V3/V3A may play a role in the processing of global motion Other studies prefer to consider dorsal V3 as part of a larger area, named the dorsomedial area (DM), which contains a representation of the entire visual field. Neurons in area DM respond to coherent motion of large patterns covering extensive portions of the visual field (Lui and collaborators, 2006).

Ventral V3 (VP), has much weaker connections from the primary visual area, and stronger connections with the inferior temporal cortex. While earlier studies proposed that VP contained a representation of only the upper part of the visual field (above the point of fixation), more recent work indicates that this area is more extensive than previously appreciated, and like other visual areas it may contain a complete visual representation. The revised, more extensive VP is referred to as the ventrolateral posterior area (VLP) by Rosa and Tweedale.

== V4 ==


Visual area V4 is one of the visual areas in the extrastriate visual cortex. In macaques, it is located anterior to V2 and posterior to the posterior inferotemporal area (PIT). It comprises at least four regions (left and right V4d, left and right V4v), and some groups report that it contains rostral and caudal subdivisions as well. It is unknown whether the human V4 is as expansive as that of the macaque homologue. This is a subject of debate.

V4 is the third cortical area in the ventral stream, receiving strong feedforward input from V2 and sending strong connections to the PIT. It also receives direct input from V1, especially for central space. In addition, it has weaker connections to V5 and the dorsal prelunate gyrus (DP).

V4 is the first area in the ventral stream to show strong attentional modulation. Most studies indicate that selective attention can change firing rates in V4 by about 20%. A seminal paper by Moran and Desimone characterizing these effects was the first paper to find attention effects anywhere in the visual cortex.

Like V2, V4 is tuned for orientation, spatial frequency, and color. Unlike V2, V4 is tuned for object features of intermediate complexity, like simple geometric shapes, although no one has developed a full parametric description of the tuning space for V4. Visual area V4 is not tuned for complex objects such as faces, as areas in the inferotemporal cortex are.

The firing properties of V4 were first described by Semir Zeki in the late 1970s, who also named the area. Before that, V4 was known by its anatomical description, the prelunate gyrus. Originally, Zeki argued that the purpose of V4 was to process color information. Work in the early 1980s proved that V4 was as directly involved in form recognition as earlier cortical areas. This research supported the two-streams hypothesis, first presented by Ungerleider and Mishkin in 1982.

Recent work has shown that V4 exhibits long-term plasticity, encodes stimulus salience, is gated by signals coming from the frontal eye fields, and shows changes in the spatial profile of its receptive fields with attention. In addition, it has recently been shown that activation of area V4 in humans (area V4h) is observed during the perception and retention of the color of objects, but not their shape.

== Middle temporal visual area (V5) ==
The middle temporal visual area (MT or V5) is a region of extrastriate visual cortex. In several species of both New World monkeys and Old World monkeys the MT area contains a high concentration of direction-selective neurons. The MT in primates is thought to play a major role in the perception of motion, the integration of local motion signals into global percepts, and the guidance of some eye movements.

=== Connections ===
MT is connected to a wide array of cortical and subcortical brain areas. Its input comes from visual cortical areas V1, V2 and dorsal V3 (dorsomedial area), the koniocellular regions of the LGN, and the inferior pulvinar. The pattern of projections to MT changes somewhat between the representations of the foveal and peripheral visual fields, with the latter receiving inputs from areas located in the midline cortex and retrosplenial region.

A standard view is that V1 provides the &quot;most important&quot; input to MT. Nonetheless, several studies have demonstrated that neurons in MT are capable of responding to visual information, often in a direction-selective manner, even after V1 has been destroyed or inactivated. Moreover, research by Semir Zeki and collaborators has suggested that certain types of visual information may reach MT before it even reaches V1.

MT sends its major output to areas located in the cortex immediately surrounding it, including areas FST, MST, and V4t (middle temporal crescent). Other projections of MT target the eye movement-related areas of the frontal and parietal lobes (frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal area).

=== Function ===
The first studies of the electrophysiological properties of neurons in MT showed that a large portion of the cells are tuned to the speed and direction of moving visual stimuli.

Lesion studies have also supported the role of MT in motion perception and eye movements. Neuropsychological studies of a patient unable to see motion, seeing the world in a series of static &#x27;frames&#x27; instead, suggested that V5 in the primate is homologous to MT in the human.

However, since neurons in V1 are also tuned to the direction and speed of motion, these early results left open the question of precisely what MT could do that V1 could not. Much work has been carried out on this region, as it appears to integrate local visual motion signals into the global motion of complex objects.
For example, &quot;lesion&quot; to the V5 leads to deficits in perceiving motion and processing of complex stimuli. It contains many neurons selective for the motion of complex visual features (line ends, corners). &quot;Microstimulation&quot; of a neuron located in the V5 affects the perception of motion. For example, if one finds a neuron with preference for upward motion in a monkey&#x27;s V5 and stimulates it with an electrode, then the monkey becomes more likely to report &#x27;upward&#x27; motion when presented with stimuli containing &#x27;left&#x27; and &#x27;right&#x27; as well as &#x27;upward&#x27; components.

There is still much controversy over the exact form of the computations carried out in area MT and some research suggests that feature motion is in fact already available at lower levels of the visual system such as V1.

=== Functional organization ===
MT was shown to be organized in direction columns. DeAngelis argued that MT neurons were also organized based on their tuning for binocular disparity.

==V6==

The dorsomedial area (DM) also known as V6, appears to respond to visual stimuli associated with self-motion and wide-field stimulation. V6 is a subdivision of the visual cortex of primates first described by John Allman and Jon Kaas in 1975. V6 is located in the dorsal part of the extrastriate cortex, near the deep groove through the centre of the brain (medial longitudinal fissure), and typically also includes portions of the medial cortex, such as the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS). DM contains a topographically organized representation of the entire field of vision.

There are similarities between the visual area V5 and V6 of the common marmoset. Both areas receive direct connections from the primary visual cortex. And both have a high myelin content, a characteristic that is usually present in brain structures involved in fast transmission of information.

For many years, it was considered that DM only existed in New World monkeys. However, more recent research has suggested that DM also exists in Old World monkeys and humans. V6 is also sometimes referred to as the parieto-occipital area (PO), although the correspondence is not exact.

===Properties===
Neurons in area DM/V6 of night monkeys and common marmosets have unique response properties, including an extremely sharp selectivity for the orientation of visual contours, and preference for long, uninterrupted lines covering large parts of the visual field.

However, in comparison with area MT, a much smaller proportion of DM cells shows selectivity for the direction of motion of visual patterns. Another notable difference with area MT is that cells in DM are attuned to low spatial frequency components of an image, and respond poorly to the motion of textured patterns such as a field of random dots. These response properties suggest that DM and MT may work in parallel, with the former analyzing self-motion relative to the environment, and the latter analyzing the motion of individual objects relative to the background.

Recently, an area responsive to wide-angle flow fields has been identified in the human and is thought to be a homologue of macaque area V6.

===Pathways===

The connections and response properties of cells in DM/V6 suggest that this area is a key node in a subset of the &quot;dorsal stream&quot;, referred to by some as the &quot;dorsomedial pathway&quot;. This pathway is likely to be important for the control of skeletomotor activity, including postural reactions and reaching movements towards objects The main &#x27;feedforward&#x27; connection of DM is to the cortex immediately rostral to it, in the interface between the occipital and parietal lobes (V6A). This region has, in turn, relatively direct connections with the regions of the frontal lobe that control arm movements, including the premotor cortex.

<text>Velociraptor (; ) is a genus of small dromaeosaurid dinosaurs that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 75 million to 71 million years ago. Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis, named and described in 1924. Fossils of this species have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation, Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China.

Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Achillobator&quot;, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was about long with a body mass around . It nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and restrain prey. &quot;Velociraptor&quot; can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.

&quot;Velociraptor&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;raptor&quot;) is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films. In reality, however, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the approximately tall and reptiles seen in the novels and films (which were based on members of the related genus &quot;Deinonychus&quot;). Today, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons. One particularly famous specimen preserves a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; locked in combat with a &quot;Protoceratops&quot;.

==History of discovery==

During an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Flaming Cliffs (Bayn Dzak or Bayanzag) of the Djadochta Formation, Gobi Desert, on 11 August 1923, Peter Kaisen discovered the first &quot;Velociraptor&quot; fossil known to science—a crushed but complete skull, associated with one of the raptorial second toe claws (AMNH 6515). In 1924, museum president Henry Fairfield Osborn designated the skull and claw (which he assumed to come from the hand) as the type specimen of his new genus, &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. This name is derived from the Latin words (&#x27;swift&#x27;) and (&#x27;robber&#x27; or &#x27;plunderer&#x27;) and refers to the animal&#x27;s cursorial nature and carnivorous diet. Osborn named the type species &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; after its country of origin. Earlier that year, Osborn had informally mentioned the animal in a popular press article, under the name &quot;Ovoraptor djadochtari&quot; (not to be confused with the similarly named &quot;Oviraptor&quot;), eventually changed into &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; during its formal description.

While North American teams were shut out of communist Mongolia during the Cold War, expeditions by Soviet and Polish scientists, in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues, recovered several more specimens of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. The most famous is part of the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen (MPC-D 100/25; formerly IGM, GIN, or GI SPS), discovered by a Polish-Mongolian team in 1971. The fossil preserves a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in battle against a &quot;Protoceratops&quot;. It is considered a national treasure of Mongolia, and in 2000 it was loaned to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City for a temporary exhibition.

Between 1988 and 1990, a joint Chinese-Canadian team discovered &quot;Velociraptor&quot; remains in northern China. American scientists returned to Mongolia in 1990, and a joint Mongolian-American expedition to the Gobi, led by the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, turned up several well-preserved skeletons. One such specimen, MPC-D 100/980, was nicknamed &quot;Ichabodcraniosaurus&quot; by Norell&#x27;s team because the fairly complete specimen was found without its skull (an allusion to the Washington Irving character Ichabod Crane). While Norell and Makovicky provisionally considered it a specimen of &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot;, it was named as a new species &quot;Shri devi&quot; in 2021.

In 1999, Rinchen Barsbold and Halszka Osmólska reported a juvenile &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen (GIN or IGM 100/2000), represented by a complete skeleton including the skull of a young individual. It was found at the Tugriken Shireh locality of the Djadochta Formation during the context of the Mongolian-Japanese Palaeontological Expeditions. The coauthors stated that detailed descriptions of this and other specimens would be published at a later date.

===Additional species===

Maxillae and a lacrimal (the main tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw, and the bone that forms the anterior margin of the eye socket, respectively) recovered from the Bayan Mandahu Formation in 1999 by the Sino-Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, but not to the type species &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;. Pascal Godefroit and colleagues named these bones &quot;V. osmolskae&quot; (for Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska) in 2008. However, the 2013 study noted that while &quot;the elongate shape of the maxilla in &quot;V. osmolskae&quot; is similar to that of &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;,&quot; phylogenetic analysis found it to be closer to &quot;Linheraptor&quot;, making the genus paraphyletic; thus, &quot;V. osmolskae&quot; might not actually belong to the genus &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and requires reassessment.

Paleontologists Mark A. Norell and Peter J. Makovicky in 1997 described new and well preserved specimens of &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;, namely MPC-D 100/985 collected from the Tugrik Shireh locality in 1993, and MPC-D 100/986 collected in 1993 from the Chimney Buttes locality. The team briefly mentioned another specimen, MPC-D 100/982, which by the time of this publication remained undescribed. In 1999 Norell and Makovicky provided more insights into the anatomy of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; with additional specimens. Among these, MPC-D 100/982 was partially described and figured, and referred to &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; mainly based on cranial similarities with the holotype skull, although they stated that differences were present between the pelvic region of this specimen and other &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimens. This relatively well-preserved specimen including the skull was discovered and collected in 1995 at the Bayn Dzak locality (specifically at the &quot;Volcano&quot; sub-locality). Martin Kundrát in a 2004 abstract compared the neurocranium of MPC-D 100/982 to another &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen, MPC-D 100/976. He concluded that the overall morphology of the former was more derived (advanced) than the latter, suggesting that they could represent distinct taxa.
Mark J. Powers in his 2020 master thesis fully described MPC-D 100/982, which he concluded to represent a new and third species of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. This species, which he considered distinct, was stated to mainly differ from other &quot;Velociraptor&quot; species in having a shallow maxilla morphology. Powers and colleagues also in 2020 used morphometric analyses to compare several dromaeosaurid maxillae, and found the maxilla of MPC-D 100/982 to strongly differ from specimens referred to &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. They indicated that this specimen, based on these results, represents a different species. In 2021 Powers with team used Principal Component Analysis to separate dromaeosaurid maxillae, most notably finding that MPC-D 100/982 falls outside the instraspecific variability of &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;, arguing for a distinct species. They considered that both &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; and this new species were ecologically separated based on their skull anatomy. The team in another 2021 abstract reinforced again the species-level separation, noting that additional differences can be found in the hindlimbs.

==Description==

&quot;Velociraptor&quot; was a small to medium-sized dromaeosaurid, with adults measuring between long, approximately high at the hips, and weighing about .

Prominent quill knobs—attachment site of &quot;wing&quot; feathers and direct indicator of a feather covering—have been reported from the ulna of a single &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen (IGM 100/981), which represents an animal of estimated long and in weight. The spacing of 6 preserved knobs suggests that 8 additional knobs may have been present, giving a total of 14 quill knobs that developed large secondaries (&quot;wing&quot; feathers stemming from the forearm). However, the specimen number has been corrected to IGM 100/3503 and its referral to &quot;Velociraptor&quot; may require reevaluation, pending further study. Nevertheless, there is strong phylogenetic evidence from other dromaeosaurid relatives that indicates the presence of feathers in &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, including dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Daurlong&quot;, &quot;Microraptor&quot;, or &quot;Zhenyuanlong&quot;.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was rather elongated and grew up to long. It was uniquely up-curved at the snout region, concave on the upper surface, and convex on the lower surface. The snout, which occupied about 60% of the entire skull length, was notably narrow and mainly formed by the nasal, premaxilla, and maxilla bones. The was the anteriormost bone in the skull, and it was longer than taller. While its posterior end joined the nasal, the main body of the premaxilla touched the maxilla. The was nearly triangular in shape and the largest element of the snout. On its center or main body, there was a depression developing a small oval to circular-shaped hole, called maxillary fenestra. Though in front of this fenestra were two small openings, referred to as promaxillary fenestrae. The posterior border of the maxilla formed (predominantly) the antorbital fenestra, one of the several large holes in the skull. Both premaxilla and maxilla had several alveoli (tooth sockets) on their bottom surfaces. Above the maxilla and making contact with the premaxilla, there was the bone. It was a thin/narrow and elongated bone contributing to the top surface of the snout. Together, both premaxilla and nasal bones gave form to the naris or narial fenestra (nostril opening), which was relatively large and circular. The posterior end of the nasal was joined by the frontal and lacrimal bones.

The back or anterior region of the skull was built by the frontal, lacrimal, postorbital, jugal, parietal, quadrate, and quadratojugal bones. The was large element, having a vaguely rectangular shape when seen from above. On its posterior end, this bone was in contact with the , and such elements were the main bodies of the skull roof. The was a T-shaped bone and its main body was thin and delicated. Its lower end meet the (often called cheek bone), which was a large, sub-triangular-shaped element. Its lower border was notably straight/horizontal. The was located just above the jugal: a stocky and strongly T-shaped bone. As a whole, the orbit or orbital fenestra (eye socket)—formed by the lacrimal, jugal, frontal, and postorbital—was large and near circular in shape, being longer than taller. When seen from above, a pair of large and markedly rounded holes were present near the rear of the skull (the temporal fenestrae), whose main components were the postorbital and squamosal. Behind the jugal, an inverted T-shaped bone (also seen in other dromaeosaurids), known as the , was developed. While the upper end of the quadratojugal joined the , an irregularly-shaped element, its inner side meet the . The latter was of great importance for the articulation with the lower jaw. The posteriormost bone was the and its projection the occipital condyle: a rounded and bulbous protuberance that meet the first vertebra of the neck.

The lower jaw of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; comprised mainly the dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, and articular bones. The was a very long, weakly curved, and narrow element that developed several alveoli on its top surface. On its posterior end, it meet the . It had a small hole near its posterior end, called surangular foramen or fenestra. Both bones were the largest elements of the lower jaw of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, contributing to virtually its entire length. Below them were the smaller and , closely articulated to each other. The , located on the inner side of the surangular, was a small element that joined the quadrate of the upper skull, enabling the articulation with the lower jaw. An elongated, near oval-shaped hole was developed in the center of the lower jaw (the mandibular fenestra), and it was produced by the joint of the dentary, surangular, and angular bones.

The teeth of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; were fairly homodont (equal in shape) and had several denticles (serrations), each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front. The premaxilla had 4 alveoli (meaning that 4 teeth were developed), and the maxilla had 11 alveoli. At the dentary, between 14–15 alveoli were present. All teeth present at the premaxilla were poorly curved, and the two first teeth were the longest, with the second having a characteristic large size. The maxillary teeth were more slender, recurved, and most notably, the lower end was strongly more serrated than the upper one.

===Postcranial skeleton===

The arm of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was formed by the humerus (upper arm bone), radius and ulna (forearm bones), and manus (hand). &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, like other dromaeosaurids, had a large manus with three elongated digits (fingers), which ended up in strongly curved unguals (claw bones) that were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds. The second digit was the longest of the three digits present, while the first was shortest. The structure of the carpal (wrist) bones prevented pronation of the wrist and forced the manus to be held with the palmar surface facing inward (medially), not downward. The pes (foot) anatomy of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; consisted of the metatarsus—a large element composed of three metatarsals of which the first one was extremely reduced in size—and four digits that developed large unguals. The first digit, as in other theropods, was a small dewclaw. The second digit, for which &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is most famous, was highly modified and held retracted off the ground, which caused &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and other dromaeosaurids to walk on only their third and fourth digits. It bore a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw, typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, which could grow to over long around its outer edge, was most likely a predatory device used to restrain struggling prey.

As in other dromaeosaurs, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; tails had prezygapophyses (long bony projections) on the upper surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail to act as a single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an &quot;S&quot;-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.

==Classification==
&quot;Velociraptor&quot; is a member of the group Eudromaeosauria, a derived sub-group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. It is often placed within its own subfamily, Velociraptorinae. In phylogenetic taxonomy, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as &quot;all dromaeosaurs more closely related to &quot;Velociraptor&quot; than to &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot;.&quot; However, dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Other analyses have often included other genera, usually &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, and more recently &quot;Tsaagan&quot;. Several studies published during the 2010s, including expanded versions of the analyses that found support for Velociraptorinae, have failed to resolve it as a distinct group, but rather have suggested it is a paraphyletic grade which gave rise to the Dromaeosaurinae.

When first described in 1924, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was placed in the family Megalosauridae, as was the case with most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, functioned as a sort of &#x27;wastebin&#x27; taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make &quot;Velociraptor&quot; a flightless bird). In the past, other dromaeosaurid species, including &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot; and &quot;Saurornitholestes langstoni&quot;, have sometimes been classified in the genus &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. Since &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was the first to be named, these species were renamed &quot;Velociraptor antirrhopus&quot; and &quot;V. langstoni&quot;. the only currently recognized species of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; are &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; and &quot;V. osmolskae&quot;. However, several studies have found &quot;V.&quot; &quot;osmolskae&quot; to be distantly related to &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot;.
Below are the results for the Eudromaeosauria phylogeny based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by James G. Napoli and team in 2021 during the description of &quot;Kuru&quot;, showing the position of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;:
==Paleobiology==
===Feathers===
In 2007 Alan H. Turner and colleagues reported the presence of six quill knobs in the ulna of a referred &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen (IGM 100/981) from the Ukhaa Tolgod locality of the Djadochta Formation. Turner and colleagues interpreted the presence of feathers on &quot;Velociraptor&quot; as evidence against the idea that the larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size. Furthermore, they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today, and that their presence in &quot;Velociraptor&quot; (presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and other large members of this family secondarily flightless, though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; had a purpose other than flight. The feathers of the flightless &quot;Velociraptor&quot; may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding, or for added speed and thrust when running up inclined slopes.

Because of the presence of another dromaeosaurid in Ukhaa Tolgod, &quot;Tsaagan&quot;, Napoli and team have noted that the referral of this specimen to &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is currently subject to reexamination.

===Senses===
Examinations of the endocranium of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; indicate that it was able to detect and hear a wide range of sound frequencies (2,368–3,965 Hz) and could track prey with ease as a result. The endocranium examinations also further cemented the theory that the dromaeosaur was an agile, swift predator. Fossil evidence suggesting &quot;Velociraptor&quot; scavenged also indicates that it was an opportunistic and actively predatory animal, feeding on carrion during times of drought or famine, if in poor health, or depending on the animal&#x27;s age.

===Feeding===
In 2020, Powers and colleagues re-examined the maxillae of several eudromaeosaur taxa concluding that most Asian and North American eudromaeosaurs were separated by snout morphology and ecological strategies. They found the maxilla to be a reliable reference when inferring the shape of the premaxilla and overall snout. For instance, most Asian species have elongated snouts based on the maxilla (namely velociraptorines), indicating a selective feeding in &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and relatives, such as picking up small, fast prey. In contrast, most North American eudromaeosaurs, mostly dromaeosaurines, feature a robust and deep maxillar morphology. However, the large dromaeosurine &quot;Achillobator&quot; is a unique exception to Asian taxa with its deep maxilla.

Manabu Sakamoto in 2022 performed a Bayesian phylogenetic predictive modelling framework for estimating jaw muscle parameters and bite forces of several extinct archosaurs, based on skull widths and phylogenetic relationships between groups. Among studied taxa, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was scored with a bite force of 304 N, which was lower than that of other dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; (885 N) or &quot;Deinonychus&quot; (706 N).

===Predatory behavior===
The &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen, found in 1971, preserves a &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot; in combat and provides direct evidence of predatory behavior. When originally reported, it was hypothesized that the two animals drowned. However, as the animals were preserved in ancient sand dune deposits, it is now thought that the animals were buried in sand, either from a collapsing dune or in a sandstorm. Burial must have been extremely rapid, judging from the lifelike poses in which the animals were preserved. Parts of the &quot;Protoceratops&quot; are missing, which has been seen as evidence of scavenging by other animals. Comparisons between the scleral rings of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, &quot;Protoceratops&quot;, and modern birds and reptiles indicates that &quot;Velociraptor&quot; may have been nocturnal, while &quot;Protoceratops&quot; may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day during short intervals, suggesting that the fight may have occurred at twilight or during low-light conditions.

The distinctive claw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has traditionally been depicted as a slashing weapon; its assumed use being to cut and disembowel prey. In the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; specimen, the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; lies underneath, with one of its sickle claws apparently embedded in the throat of its prey, while the beak of &quot;Protoceratops&quot; is clamped down upon the right forelimb of its attacker. This suggests &quot;Velociraptor&quot; may have used its sickle claw to pierce vital organs of the throat, such as the jugular vein, carotid artery, or trachea (windpipe), rather than slashing the abdomen. The inside edge of the claw was rounded and not unusually sharp, which may have precluded any sort of cutting or slashing action, although only the bony core of the claw is preserved. The thick abdominal wall of skin and muscle of large prey species would have been difficult to slash without a specialized cutting surface. The slashing hypothesis was tested during a 2005 BBC documentary, &quot;The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs&quot;. The producers of the program created an artificial &quot;Velociraptor&quot; leg with a sickle claw and used a pork belly to simulate the dinosaur&#x27;s prey. Though the sickle claw did penetrate the abdominal wall, it was unable to tear it open, indicating that the claw was not used to disembowel prey.

Remains of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, a closely related dromaeosaurid, have commonly been found in aggregations of several individuals. &quot;Deinonychus&quot; has also been found in association with the large ornithopod &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;, which has been cited as evidence of cooperative (pack) hunting. However, the only solid evidence for social behavior of any kind among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group. Although many isolated fossils of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; have been found in Mongolia, none were closely associated with other individuals. Therefore, while &quot;Velociraptor&quot; is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general and none specific to &quot;Velociraptor&quot; itself. Dromeosaur footprints in China suggest that a few other raptor genera may have hunted in packs, but there have been no conclusive examples of pack behavior found.

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which dromaeosaurs like &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and similar dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey. This model, known as the &quot;raptor prey restraint&quot; (RPR) model of predation, proposes that dromaeosaurs killed their prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey: by leaping onto their quarry, pinning it under their body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. These researchers proposed that, like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while it was still alive, and prey death would eventually result from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. The short metatarsus and foot strength, however, would have been more similar to that of owls. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;″s anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms, which could exert a lot of force but were likely covered in long feathers, may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. The jaws, thought by Fowler and colleagues to be comparatively weak, would have been useful for row saw motion bites like the modern day Komodo dragon, which also has a weak bite, to finish off its prey if the kicks were not powerful enough. These predatory adaptations working together may also have implications for the origin of flapping in paravians.

===Scavenging behavior===
In 2010, Hone and colleagues published a paper on their 2008 discovery of shed teeth of what they believed to be a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; near a tooth-marked jaw bone of what they believed to be a &quot;Protoceratops&quot; in the Bayan Mandahu Formation. The authors concluded that the find represented &quot;late-stage carcass consumption by &quot;Velociraptor&quot;&quot; as the predator would have eaten other parts of a freshly killed &quot;Protoceratops&quot; before biting in the jaw area. The evidence was seen as supporting the inference from the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; fossil that &quot;Protoceratops&quot; was part of the diet of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

In 2012, Hone and colleagues published a paper that described a &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen with a long bone of an azhdarchid pterosaur in its gut. This was interpreted as showing scavenging behaviour.

In a 2024 study by Tse, Miller, and Pittman et al., focusing on the skull morphology and bite forces of various dromaeosaurids, it was discovered that &quot;Velociraptor&quot; had high bite force resistance compared to other dromaeosaurids such as &quot;Dromaeosaurus&quot; itself and &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, the latter of which was much larger. It is theorized by the authors that high bite force resistance was an adaptation towards obtaining food through scavenging more often than through active predation in &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

===Metabolism===

&quot;Velociraptor&quot; was warm-blooded to some degree, as it required a significant amount of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like &quot;Velociraptor&quot; did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.

In 2023, Seishiro Tada and team examined the nasal cavities of ectotherm (cold-blooded) or endotherm (warm-blooded) species, in order to evaluate the thermoregulatory physiology of non-avian dinosaurs compared to these groups. They found that the size of the nasal cavity relative to the head size of extant endotherms is larger than those of extant ectotherms, and among taxa, &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was recovered below the extant endotherms level by reconstructing its nasal respiratory cavity. Tada with team suggested that &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and most other non-avian dinosaurs may not have possessed a fully or well-developed nasal thermoregulation apparatus as modern endothermic animals do.

===Paleopathology===

Norell with colleagues in 1995 reported one &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; skull bearing two parallel rows of small punctures on its frontal bones that, upon closer examination, match the spacing and size of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; teeth. They suggested that the wound was likely inflicted by another &quot;Velociraptor&quot; during a fight within the species. Because its bone structure shows no sign of healing near the bite wounds and the overall specimen was not scavenged, this individual was likely killed by this fatal wound. In 2001 Molnar and team noted that this specimen is MPC-D 100/976 hailing from the Tugrik Shireh locality, which has also yielded the Fighting Dinosaurs specimen.

In 2012 David Hone and team reported another injured &quot;Velociraptor&quot; specimen (MPC-D 100/54, roughly a sub-adult individual) found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to one broken rib. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury. Nevertheless, the team noted that this broken ribs shows signs of bone healing.

==Paleoenvironment==
===Bayan Mandahu Formation===
In both Bayan Mandahu and Djadochta formations many of the same genera were present, though they varied at the species level. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively close to each other geographically. However, given the lack of any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, it is more likely that those differences indicate a slight time difference.

&quot;V. osmolskae&quot; lived alongside the ankylosaurid &quot;Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus&quot;; alvarezsaurid &quot;Linhenykus&quot;; closely related dromaeosaurid &quot;Linheraptor&quot;; oviraptorids &quot;Machairasaurus&quot; and &quot;Wulatelong&quot;; protoceratopsids &quot;Bagaceratops&quot; and &quot;Protoceratops hellenikorhinus&quot;; and troodontids &quot;Linhevenator&quot;, &quot;Papiliovenator&quot;, and &quot;Philovenator&quot;. Sediments across the formation indicate a similar depositional environment to that of the Djadochta Formation.

===Djadochta Formation===

Known specimens of &quot;Velociraptor mongoliensis&quot; have been recovered from the Djadochta Formation (also spelled Djadokhta), in the Mongolian province of Ömnögovi. This geological formation is estimated to date back to the Campanian stage (between 75 million and 71 million years ago) of the Late Cretaceous epoch. The abundant sediments—sands, sandstones, or caliche—of the Djadochta Formation were deposited by eolian (wind) processes in arid settings with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams, as indicated by very sparse fluvial (river-deposited) sedimentation, under a semi-arid climate.

The Djadochta Formation is separated into a lower Bayn Dzak Member and upper Turgrugyin Member. &quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; is known from both members, represented by numerous specimens. The Bayn Dzak Member (mainly Bayn Dzak locality) has yielded the oviraptorid &quot;Oviraptor&quot;; ankylosaurid &quot;Pinacosaurus grangeri&quot;; protoceratopsid &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot;; and troodontid &quot;Saurornithoides&quot;. The younger Turgrugyin Member (mainly Tugriken Shireh locality) has produced the bird &quot;Elsornis&quot;; dromaeosaurid &quot;Mahakala&quot;: ornithomimid &quot;Aepyornithomimus&quot;; and protoceratopsid &quot;Protoceratops andrewsi&quot;.

&quot;V. mongoliensis&quot; has been found at many of the most famous and prolific Djadochta localities. The type specimen was discovered at the Flaming Cliffs site (sublocality of the larger Bayn Dzak locality/region), while the &quot;Fighting Dinosaurs&quot; were found at the Tugrik Shire locality (also known as Tugrugeen Shireh and many other spellings). The latter is notorious for its exceptional &quot;in situ&quot; fossil preservation. Based on deposits (such as structureless sandstones), it has been concluded that a large number of specimens were buried alive during powerful sand-bearing events, common to these paleoenvironments.

==Cultural significance==

&quot;Velociraptor&quot; is commonly perceived as a vicious and cunning killer thanks to their portrayal in the 1990 novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; by Michael Crichton and its 1993 film adaptation, directed by Steven Spielberg. The &quot;raptors&quot; portrayed in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; were actually modeled after the closely related dromaeosaurid &quot;Deinonychus&quot;. Paleontologists in both the novel and film excavate a skeleton in Montana, far from the central Asian range of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; but characteristic of the &quot;Deinonychus&quot; range. Crichton met with the discoverer of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, John Ostrom, several times at Yale University to discuss details of the animal&#x27;s possible range of behaviors and appearance. Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in place of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; because the former name was &quot;more dramatic.&quot; According to Ostrom, Crichton stated that the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; of the novel was based on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; in almost every detail, and that only the name had been changed. The &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; filmmakers also requested all of Ostrom&#x27;s published papers on &quot;Deinonychus&quot; during production. They portrayed the animals with the size, proportions, and snout shape of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; rather than &quot;Velociraptor&quot;.

Production on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; began before the discovery of the large dromaeosaurid &quot;Utahraptor&quot; was made public in 1991, but as Jody Duncan wrote about this discovery: &quot;Later, after we had designed and built the raptor, there was a discovery of a raptor skeleton in Utah, which they labeled &#x27;super-slasher.&#x27; They had uncovered the largest Velociraptor to date and it measured five-and-a-half-feet tall, just like ours. So we designed it, we built it, and then they discovered it. That still boggles my mind.&quot; Spielberg&#x27;s name was briefly considered for naming of the new dinosaur in exchange for funding of field work, but no agreement was reached. 

&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; were released before the discovery that dromaeosaurs had feathers, so the &quot;Velociraptor&quot; in both films were depicted as scaled and featherless. For &quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; the male &quot;Velociraptor&quot; was given quill-like structures along the back of the head and neck, but these structures do not resemble the feathers that &quot;Velociraptor&quot; would have had in reality due to reasons of continuity. The &quot;Jurassic World&quot; sequel trilogy ignored the feathers of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, adhering to the designs from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. However, the dromaeosaur &quot;Pyroraptor&quot; was feathered for &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot;, along with other changes such as stiffening the tail to account for ossified tendons and de-pronating the hands.

<text>The Visigoths (; ) were a Germanic people united under the rule of a king and living within the Roman Empire during late antiquity. The Visigoths first appeared in the Balkans, as a Roman-allied barbarian military group united under the command of Alaric I. Their exact origins are believed to have been diverse but they probably included many descendants of the Thervingi who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and Alaric&#x27;s Visigoths varied, with the two groups making treaties when convenient, and warring with one another when not. Under Alaric, the Visigoths invaded Italy and sacked Rome in August 410. 

The Visigoths were subsequently settled in southern Gaul as &quot;foederati&quot; to the Romans, a relationship that was established in 418. This developed as an independent kingdom with its capital at Toulouse, and they extended their authority into Hispania at the expense of the Suebi and Vandals who had taken control of large swathes of Roman territory. In 507, Visigothic rule in Gaul was ended by the Franks under Clovis I, who defeated them in the Battle of Vouillé.

It is within what is now Spain and Portugal that the Visigoths created the polity for which they are best remembered. During their governance of Hispania, the Visigoths built several churches that survived and left many artifacts, items which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent years. The Treasure of Guarrazar of votive crowns and crosses are the most spectacular among the finds thus far. In or around 589, the Visigoths under Reccared I converted from Arian Christianity to Nicene Christianity, gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects. Their legal code, the &quot;Visigothic Code&quot; (completed in 654), abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Hispano-Roman population and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between &quot;Romani&quot; and &quot;Gothi&quot;, they became known collectively as &quot;Hispani&quot;. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the Councils of Toledo and the episcopacy. In 711, an invading force of Arabs and Berbers defeated the Visigoths during the Battle of Guadalete. The Visigoth king, Roderic, and many members of the Visigothic governing elite were killed and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. This was followed by the subsequent formation of the Kingdom of Asturias in northern Spain and the beginning of the Reconquista by Christian troops under Pelagius.

The Visigoths founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the Carolingian dynasty. Many Visigothic names are still in use in the modern Spanish and Portuguese languages. Their most notable legacy, however, was the &quot;Visigothic Code&quot;, which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian Iberia until the Late Middle Ages, centuries after the demise of the kingdom.

==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==

The Visigoths were never called Visigoths, only Goths, until Cassiodorus used the term, when referring to their loss against Clovis I in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the &quot;Ostrogoths&quot;, but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the fifth-century poet Sidonius Apollinaris, had already used when referring to the Visigoths. The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word &quot;east&quot;, and Jordanes, the medieval writer, later clearly contrasted them in his &quot;Getica&quot;, stating that &quot;Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.&quot; According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east–west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex. Cassiodorus used the term &quot;Goths&quot; to refer to only the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographic reference &quot;Visigoths&quot; for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. The term &quot;Visigoths&quot; was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the Byzantine Empire, and was still in use in the 7th century.

Two older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the third century, notably including the Thervingi, who were once referred to as Goths by Ammianus Marcellinus. Much less is known of the &quot;Vesi&quot; or &quot;Visi&quot;, from whom the term &quot;Visigoth&quot; was derived. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the , a late-4th- or early-5th-century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the &quot;Thervingi&quot; in a classical source.

Although he did not refer to the Vesi, Tervingi or Greuthungi, Jordanes identified the Visigothic kings from Alaric I to Alaric II as the successors of the fourth-century Tervingian king Athanaric, and the Ostrogoth kings from Theoderic the Great to Theodahad as the heirs of the Greuthungi king Ermanaric. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms &quot;Vesi&quot; and &quot;Tervingi&quot; as referring to one distinct tribe, while the terms &quot;Ostrogothi&quot; and &quot;Greuthungi&quot; were used to refer to another.

Wolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, &quot;Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi&quot;), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to &quot;the Vesi and the Ostrogothi&quot; or to &quot;the Tervingi and the Greuthungi&quot;, and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388–391. On the other hand, another recent interpretation of the &quot;Notitia&quot; is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, &quot;a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples&quot;. Peter Heather has written that Wolfram&#x27;s position is &quot;entirely arguable, but so is the opposite&quot;.

Wolfram believes that &quot;Vesi&quot; and &quot;Ostrogothi&quot; were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that &quot;Tervingi&quot; and &quot;Greuthungi&quot; were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other. This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the Hunnic invasions. Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest. For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.

Many recent scholars, such as Peter Heather, have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire. Roger Collins also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the Gothic War of 376–382 when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi and other &quot;barbarian&quot; contingents banded together in multiethnic &quot;foederati&quot; (Wolfram&#x27;s &quot;federate armies&quot;) under Alaric I in the eastern Balkans, since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.

Other names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the &quot;Alaric Goths&quot;. The Frankish Table of Nations, probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the &quot;Walagothi&quot;, meaning &quot;Roman Goths&quot; (from Germanic *&quot;walhaz&quot;, foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain. Landolfus Sagax, writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the &quot;Hypogothi&quot;.

===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===
The name &quot;Tervingi&quot; may mean &quot;forest people&quot;, with the first part of the name related to Gothic &quot;triu&quot;, and English &quot;tree&quot;. This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi–Greuthungi than the late third century. That the name &quot;Tervingi&quot; has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.

The Visigoths are called &quot;Wesi&quot; or &quot;Wisi&quot; by Trebellius Pollio, Claudian and Sidonius Apollinaris. The word is Gothic for &quot;good&quot;, implying the &quot;good or worthy people&quot;, related to Gothic &quot;iusiza&quot; &quot;better&quot; and a reflex of Indo-European *&quot;wesu&quot; &quot;good&quot;, akin to Welsh &quot;gwiw&quot; &quot;excellent&quot;, Greek &quot;eus&quot; &quot;good&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;vásu-ş&quot; &quot;id.&quot;. Jordanes relates the tribe&#x27;s name to a river, though this is probably a folk etymology or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.

==History==
===Early origins===
The Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, probably a derivative name for the Gutones, a people believed to have their origins in Scandinavia and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe. Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the Franks and Alamanni. The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the Middle Ages.

Long struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the Oder and Vistula rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the Black Sea. However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large &quot;en masse&quot; migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was probably the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of Ukraine and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the third century AD, they were &quot;the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier&quot;.

====Contact with Rome====
Throughout the 3rd and 4th centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths. In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of Moesia, pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of Gordian III. When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva. Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern Balkans and deeper into Anatolia. Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of Pityus fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266 and 267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Throughout the reign of emperor Constantine the Great, the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River. By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.

===War with Rome (376–382)===

The Goths remained in Dacia until 376, when one of their leaders, Fritigern, appealed to the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the Huns. Valens permitted this, as he saw in them &quot;a splendid recruiting ground for his army&quot;. However, a famine broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans, who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation. Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.

The Battle of Adrianople in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor Valens was killed during the fighting. Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell&#x27;s torment. Many of Rome&#x27;s leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire&#x27;s military capabilities. Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire&#x27;s boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual fall of Rome. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian Ammianus Marcellinus ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.

Despite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths. Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first &quot;foedus&quot; on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.

===Reign of Alaric I===
The new emperor, Theodosius I, made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395. In that year, the Visigoths&#x27; most famous king, Alaric I, made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General Stilicho tried to maintain his position in the empire. Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: Arcadius in the east and Honorius in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.

Over the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire. Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome. After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric&#x27;s troops entered Rome through the Salarian Gate, and sacked the city. However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, Milan was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to Ravenna in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome&#x27;s fall severely shook the Empire&#x27;s confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern Africa. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife&#x27;s brother.

=== Visigothic Kingdom ===

The Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 8th centuries, created first in Gaul, when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire and then in Hispania until 711. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe. In response to the invasion of Roman Hispania of 409 by the Vandals, Alans, and Suebi, Honorius, the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.

In 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic federates by giving them land in Gallia Aquitania on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes—Suebi, Asding and Siling Vandals, as well as Alans—who had crossed the Rhine near Mogontiacum (modern Mainz) the last day of 406 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the autumn of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under &quot;hospitalitas&quot;, the rules for billeting army soldiers. The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the Pyrenees and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe&#x27;s future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side by side with the Roman troops under general Flavius Aetius, it is perhaps possible that Attila would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.

The Visigoths&#x27; second great king, Euric, unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, concluded the peace treaty with the emperor Julius Nepos. In the treaty the emperor was called a friend (&quot;amicus&quot;) to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (&quot;dominus&quot;). Though the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty, according to some views under this treaty the Visigothic kingdom became an independent kingdom. Between 471 and 476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul. According to historian J. B. Bury, Euric was probably the &quot;greatest of the Visigothic kings&quot; for he managed to secure territorial gains denied to his predecessors and even acquired access to the Mediterranean Sea. At his death, the Visigoths were the most powerful of the successor states to the Western Roman Empire and were at the very height of their power. Not only had Euric secured significant territory, he and his son, Alaric II, who succeeded him, adopted Roman administrative and bureaucratic governance, including Rome&#x27;s tax gathering policies and legal codes.

At this point, the Visigoths were also the dominant power in the Iberian Peninsula, quickly crushing the Alans and forcing the Vandals into north Africa. By 500, the Visigothic Kingdom, centred at Toulouse, controlled Aquitania and Gallia Narbonensis and most of Hispania with the exception of the Kingdom of the Suebi in the northwest and small areas controlled by the Basques and Cantabrians. Any survey of western Europe taken during this moment would have led one to conclude that the very future of Europe itself &quot;depended on the Visigoths&quot;. However, in 507, the Franks under Clovis I defeated the Visigoths in the Battle of Vouillé and wrested control of Aquitaine. King Alaric II was killed in battle. French national myths romanticize this moment as the time when a previously divided Gaul morphed into the united kingdom of Francia under Clovis.

Visigothic power throughout Gaul was not lost in its entirety due to the support from the powerful Ostrogothic king in Italy, Theodoric the Great, whose forces pushed Clovis I and his armies out of Visigothic territories. Theodoric the Great&#x27;s assistance was not some expression of ethnic altruism, but formed part of his plan to extend his power across Spain and its associated lands.

After Alaric II&#x27;s death, Visigothic nobles spirited his heir, the child-king Amalaric, first to Narbonne, which was the last Gothic outpost in Gaul, and further across the Pyrenees into Hispania. The center of Visigothic rule shifted first to Barcelona, then inland and south to Toledo. From 511 to 526, the Visigoths were ruled by Theoderic the Great of the Ostrogoths as &quot;de jure&quot; regent for the young Amalaric. Theodoric&#x27;s death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II&#x27;s son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho. Amalaric reigned independently for five years. Following Amalaric&#x27;s assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place. For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.

Sometime in 549, the Visigoth Athanagild sought military assistance from Justinian I and while this aide helped Athanagild win his wars, the Romans had much more in mind. Granada and southernmost Baetica were lost to representatives of the Byzantine Empire (to form the province of Spania) who had been invited in to help settle this Visigothic dynastic struggle, but who stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a &quot;Reconquest&quot; of the far west envisaged by emperor Justinian I. Imperial Roman armies took advantage of Visigothic rivalries and established a government at Córdoba.
The last Arian Visigothic king, Liuvigild, conquered most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574, the Suevic kingdom in 584, and regained part of the southern areas lost to the Byzantines, which King Suintila recovered in 624. Suintila reigned until 631. Only one historical source was written between the years 625 through 711, which comes from Julian of Toledo and only deals with the years 672 and 673. Wamba was the king of the Visigoths from 672 to 680. During his reign, the Visigothic kingdom encompassed all of Hispania and part of southern Gaul known as Septimania. Wamba was succeeded by King Ervig, whose rule lasted until 687. Collins observes that &quot;Ervig proclaimed Egica as his chosen successor&quot; on 14 November 687. In 700, Egica&#x27;s son Wittiza followed him on the throne according to the &quot;Chronica Regum Visigothorum&quot;.

The kingdom survived until 711, when King Roderic (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the Umayyad Caliphate in the Battle of Guadalete. This marked the beginning of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, when most of the Iberian Peninsula came under Islamic rule in the early 8th century.

A Visigothic nobleman, Pelayo, defeated the Umayyad forces in the Battle of Covadonga in 718 and established the Kingdom of Asturias in the northern part of the peninsula. According to Joseph F. O&#x27;Callaghan, the remnants of the Hispano-Gothic aristocracy still played an important role in the society of Hispania. At the end of Visigothic rule, the assimilation of Hispano-Romans and Visigoths was occurring at a fast pace. Their nobility had begun to think of themselves as constituting one people, the &quot;gens Gothorum&quot; or the &quot;Hispani&quot;. An unknown number of them fled and took refuge in Asturias or Septimania. In Asturias they supported Pelagius&#x27;s uprising, and joining with the indigenous leaders, formed a new aristocracy. The population of the mountain region consisted of native Astures, Galicians, Cantabri, Basques and other groups unassimilated into Hispano-Gothic society. Other Visigoths who refused to adopt the Muslim faith or live under their rule fled north to the kingdom of the Franks, and Visigoths played key roles in the empire of Charlemagne a few generations later. In the early years of the Emirate of Córdoba, a group of Visigoths who remained under Muslim dominance constituted the personal bodyguard of the Emir, al-Haras.

During their long reign in Spain, the Visigoths were responsible for the only new cities founded in Western Europe between the 5th and 8th centuries. It is certain (through contemporary Spanish accounts) that they founded four: Reccopolis, Victoriacum (modern Vitoria-Gasteiz, though perhaps Iruña-Veleia), Luceo and Olite. There is also a possible 5th city ascribed to them by a later Arabic source: &quot;Baiyara&quot; (perhaps modern Montoro). All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory. Despite the fact that the Visigoths reigned in Spain for upwards of 250 years, there are few remnants of the Gothic language borrowed into Spanish.
The Visigoths as heirs of the Roman empire lost their language and intermarried with the Hispano-Roman population of Spain.

The medieval Spanish nobility has its most remote origin in the Visigothic Monarchy. After the Arab invasion of the peninsula in the eighth century, Christians were forced to retreat to the north of the peninsula where that primitive Visigoth nobility settled. Among these Christians who took refuge in the north were a large part of the nobles linked to the disappeared Visigoth monarchy of Don Rodrigo (King Roderic), and who were welcomed by the local population and later became part of the local nobility.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in March 2019 analyzed the remains of eight Visigoths buried at Pla de l&#x27;Horta, dating to the 6th century. The genetic analysis of these individuals revealed that 73% of their ancestry derives from 7th-8th century Northeast Iberian populations (described as approximately 3/4 Iron-Age Iberian and 1/4 Central/Eastern Mediterranean). Additionally, 23% of their ancestry was linked to Central/Northern European populations, while the remaining 4% was traced to supplementary Central/Eastern Mediterranean origins. A preprint posted on &quot;BioRxiv&quot; in March 2024 also reveals that the Ostrogoths and Visigoths derive the majority of their ancestry from Southern Europe. However, two Iberian Gothic samples have around 50% northern European ancestry. These outliers share genetic similarity with populations from the Baltic Bronze Age and those associated with the spread of Slavic populations in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, indicating origins in Northeast Europe.

==Culture==
===Law===
The Visigothic Code of Law (Latin: &quot;Forum Iudicum),&quot; also called &quot;Liber Iudiciorum&quot; (English: Book of the Judges) and &quot;Lex Visigothorum&quot; (English: Law of the Visigoths), is a set of laws first promulgated by king Chindasuinth (642–653 AD) that had been part of aristocratic oral tradition and were set in writing in the year 654. This book survives in two separate codices preserved at el Escorial (Spain). It goes into more detail than a modern constitution commonly does and reveals a great deal about Visigothic social structure. The code abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans (&quot;leges romanae&quot;) and Visigoths (&quot;leges barbarorum&quot;), and under which all the subjects of the Visigothic kingdom ceased being &quot;romani&quot; and &quot;gothi&quot; and instead became &quot;hispani&quot;. All the kingdom&#x27;s subjects were under the same jurisdiction, which eliminated social and legal differences and facilitated greater assimilation of the various population groups. The Visigothic Code marks the transition from Roman law to Germanic law.

One of the greatest contributions of the Visigoths to family law was their protection of the property rights of married women, which was continued by Spanish law and ultimately evolved into the community property system now in force throughout the majority of western Europe.

===Religion===
Before the Middle Ages, the Visigoths, as well as other Germanic peoples, followed what is now referred to as Germanic paganism. While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to Christianity by varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in the more rural and distant regions.

The Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Vandals were Christianized while they were still outside the bounds of the Roman Empire; however, they converted to Arianism rather than to the Nicene version (Trinitarianism) followed by most Romans, who considered them heretics. There was a religious gulf between the Visigoths, who had for a long time adhered to Arianism, and their Catholic subjects in Hispania. There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order. King Liuvigild (568–586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed. Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild&#x27;s reign. When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.

While the Visigoths retained their Arian faith, the Jews were well tolerated. Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example. Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews &quot;held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank&quot;. In general, then, they were well respected and well treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism. Conversion to Catholicism across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between the Visigoths and the Hispano-Roman population. However, the Visigothic conversion negatively impacted the Jews, who came under scrutiny for their religious practices.

King Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism. The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency. These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well. The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who officially decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews residing in Spain. This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the 7th century the Jews were persecuted for religious reasons, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices. The decree of 613 set off a century of difficulty for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.

The political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to Chalcedonian Christianity, the bishops increased their power, until, at the Fourth Council of Toledo in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that spoke out against those who had been baptized but had relapsed into Judaism. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism &quot;was past&quot;. By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.

In the eighth through 11th centuries, the &quot;muwallad&quot; clan of the Banu Qasi claimed descent from the Visigothic Count Cassius.

== Architecture ==

During their governance of Hispania, the Visigoths built several churches in the basilical or cruciform style that survive, including the churches of San Pedro de la Nave in El Campillo, Santa María de Melque in San Martín de Montalbán, Santa Lucía del Trampal in Alcuéscar, Santa Comba in Bande, and Santa María de Lara in Quintanilla de las Viñas. The Visigothic crypt (the Crypt of San Antolín) in the Palencia Cathedral is a Visigothic chapel from the mid-7th century, built during the reign of Wamba to preserve the remains of the martyr Saint Antoninus of Pamiers, a Visigothic-Gallic nobleman brought from Narbonne to Visigothic Hispania in 672 or 673 by Wamba himself. These are the only remains of the Visigothic cathedral of Palencia.

Reccopolis, located near the tiny modern village of Zorita de los Canes in the province of Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha, Spain, is an archaeological site of one of at least four cities founded in Hispania by the Visigoths. It is the only city in Western Europe to have been founded between the 5th and 8th centuries. The city&#x27;s construction was ordered by the Visigothic king Liuvigild to honor his son Reccared and to serve as Reccared&#x27;s seat as co-king in the Visigothic province of Celtiberia, to the west of Carpetania, where the main capital, Toledo, lay.

== Goldsmithery ==

In Spain, an important collection of Visigothic metalwork was found in Guadamur, in the Province of Toledo, known as the Treasure of Guarrazar. This archeological find is composed of twenty-six votive crowns and gold crosses from the royal workshop in Toledo, with signs of Byzantine influence. According to Spanish archaeologists, this treasure represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmithery. The two most important votive crowns are those of Recceswinth and of Suintila, displayed in the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid; both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls and other precious stones.
The discoverer of the second lot gave Spanish Queen Elizabeth II some of the pieces that she still had in her possession, including the crown of Suintila, this crown was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses in the treasure.

These findings, along with others from some neighbouring sites and with the archaeological excavation of the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Spanish Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

* National Archaeological Museum of Spain: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
* Royal Palace of Madrid: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
* National Museum of the Middle Ages, Paris: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

The aquiliform (eagle-shaped) fibulae that have been discovered in necropolises such as Duratón, Madrona or Castiltierra (cities of Segovia), are an unmistakable example of the Visigothic presence in Spain. These fibulae were used individually or in pairs, as clasps or pins in gold, bronze and glass to join clothes, showing the work of the goldsmiths of Visigothic Hispania.

The Visigothic belt buckles, a symbol of rank and status characteristic of Visigothic women&#x27;s clothing, are also notable as works of goldsmithery. Some pieces contain exceptional Byzantine-style lapis lazuli inlays and are generally rectangular in shape, with copper alloy, garnets and glass.

<text>In mathematics, physics, and engineering, a Euclidean vector or simply a vector (sometimes called a geometric vector or spatial vector) is a geometric object that has magnitude (or length) and direction. Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a vector space. A &quot;vector quantity&quot; is a vector-valued physical quantity, including units of measurement and possibly a support, formulated as a &quot;directed line segment&quot;. A vector is frequently depicted graphically as an arrow connecting an &quot;initial point&quot; &quot;A&quot; with a &quot;terminal point&quot; &quot;B&quot;, and denoted by formula_1

A vector is what is needed to &quot;carry&quot; the point &quot;A&quot; to the point &quot;B&quot;; the Latin word &quot;vector&quot; means &quot;carrier&quot;. It was first used by 18th century astronomers investigating planetary revolution around the Sun. The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points, and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. Many algebraic operations on real numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and negation have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity. These operations and associated laws qualify Euclidean vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a vector space.

Vectors play an important role in physics: the velocity and acceleration of a moving object and the forces acting on it can all be described with vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, position or displacement), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the coordinate system used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include pseudovectors and tensors.

==History==
The vector concept, as it is known today, is the result of a gradual development over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people contributed significantly to its development. In 1835, Giusto Bellavitis abstracted the basic idea when he established the concept of equipollence. Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of parallel line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially, he realized an equivalence relation on the pairs of points (bipoints) in the plane, and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane. The term &quot;vector&quot; was introduced by William Rowan Hamilton as part of a quaternion, which is a sum of a real number (also called &quot;scalar&quot;) and a 3-dimensional &quot;vector&quot;. Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of classes of equipollent directed segments. As complex numbers use an imaginary unit to complement the real line, Hamilton considered the vector to be the &quot;imaginary part&quot; of a quaternion:

Several other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century, including Augustin Cauchy, Hermann Grassmann, August Möbius, Comte de Saint-Venant, and Matthew O&#x27;Brien. Grassmann&#x27;s 1840 work &quot;Theorie der Ebbe und Flut&quot; (Theory of the Ebb and Flow) was the first system of spatial analysis that is similar to today&#x27;s system, and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann&#x27;s work was largely neglected until the 1870s. Peter Guthrie Tait carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867 &quot;Elementary Treatise of Quaternions&quot; included extensive treatment of the nabla or del operator ∇. In 1878, &quot;Elements of Dynamic&quot; was published by William Kingdon Clifford. Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the dot product and cross product of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers—and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.

Josiah Willard Gibbs, who was exposed to quaternions through James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Vector Analysis&quot;, published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis. In 1901, Edwin Bidwell Wilson published &quot;Vector Analysis&quot;, adapted from Gibbs&#x27;s lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.

==Overview==
In physics and engineering, a vector is typically regarded as a geometric entity characterized by a magnitude and a relative direction. It is formally defined as a directed line segment, or arrow, in a Euclidean space. In pure mathematics, a vector is defined more generally as any element of a vector space. In this context, vectors are abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction. This generalized definition implies that the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of abstract vectors, as they are elements of a special kind of vector space called Euclidean space. This particular article is about vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space. When it becomes necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics, they are sometimes referred to as geometric, spatial, or Euclidean vectors.

A Euclidean vector may possess a definite &quot;initial point&quot; and &quot;terminal point&quot;; such a condition may be emphasized calling the result a bound vector. When only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, and the particular initial or terminal points are of no importance, the vector is called a free vector. The distinction between bound and free vectors is especially relevant in mechanics, where a force applied to a body has a point of contact (see resultant force and couple).

Two arrows formula_2 and formula_3 in space represent the same free vector if they have the same magnitude and direction: that is, they are equipollent if the quadrilateral &quot;ABB′A′&quot; is a parallelogram. If the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of origin, then a free vector is equivalent to the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin.

The term &quot;vector&quot; also has generalizations to higher dimensions, and to more formal approaches with much wider applications.

===Further information===

In classical Euclidean geometry (i.e., synthetic geometry), vectors were introduced (during the 19th century) as equivalence classes under equipollence, of ordered pairs of points; two pairs and being equipollent if the points , in this order, form a parallelogram. Such an equivalence class is called a &quot;vector&quot;, more precisely, a Euclidean vector. The equivalence class of is often denoted formula_4

A Euclidean vector is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude (e.g., the length of the line segment ) and same direction (e.g., the direction from to ). In physics, Euclidean vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, but are not located at a specific place, in contrast to scalars, which have no direction. For example, velocity, forces and acceleration are represented by vectors.

In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from linear algebra. More precisely, a Euclidean space is defined as a set to which is associated an inner product space of finite dimension over the reals formula_5 and a group action of the additive group of formula_5 which is free and transitive (See Affine space for details of this construction). The elements of formula_7 are called translations. It has been proven that the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent, and that the equivalence classes under equipollence may be identified with translations.

Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are considered without reference to a Euclidean space. In this case, a Euclidean vector is an element of a normed vector space of finite dimension over the reals, or, typically, an element of the real coordinate space formula_8 equipped with the dot product. This makes sense, as the addition in such a vector space acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. That is, formula_8 is a Euclidean space, with itself as an associated vector space, and the dot product as an inner product.

The Euclidean space formula_8 is often presented as &quot;the&quot; standard Euclidean space of dimension . This is motivated by the fact that every Euclidean space of dimension is isomorphic to the Euclidean space formula_11 More precisely, given such a Euclidean space, one may choose any point as an origin. By Gram–Schmidt process, one may also find an orthonormal basis of the associated vector space (a basis such that the inner product of two basis vectors is 0 if they are different and 1 if they are equal). This defines Cartesian coordinates of any point of the space, as the coordinates on this basis of the vector formula_12 These choices define an isomorphism of the given Euclidean space onto formula_13 by mapping any point to the -tuple of its Cartesian coordinates, and every vector to its coordinate vector.

===Examples in one dimension===
Since the physicist&#x27;s concept of force has a direction and a magnitude, it may be seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force &quot;F&quot; of 15 newtons. If the positive axis is also directed rightward, then &quot;F&quot; is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then the vector for &quot;F&quot; is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δ&quot;s&quot; of 4 meters would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.

===In physics and engineering===
Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For instance, the velocity &quot;5 meters per second upward&quot; could be represented by the vector (0, 5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive &quot;y&quot;-axis as &#x27;up&#x27;). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, linear acceleration, angular acceleration, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction, but fail to follow the rules of vector addition, are angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.

===In Cartesian space===
In the Cartesian coordinate system, a bound vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point. For instance, the points and in space determine the bound vector formula_14 pointing from the point on the &quot;x&quot;-axis to the point on the &quot;y&quot;-axis.

In Cartesian coordinates, a free vector may be thought of in terms of a corresponding bound vector, in this sense, whose initial point has the coordinates of the origin . It is then determined by the coordinates of that bound vector&#x27;s terminal point. Thus the free vector represented by (1, 0, 0) is a vector of unit length—pointing along the direction of the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis.

This coordinate representation of free vectors allows their algebraic features to be expressed in a convenient numerical fashion. For example, the sum of the two (free) vectors (1, 2, 3) and (−2, 0, 4) is the (free) vector
formula_15

===Euclidean and affine vectors===
In the geometrical and physical settings, it is sometimes possible to associate, in a natural way, a &quot;length&quot; or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In addition, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an &quot;angle&quot; between two vectors. If the dot product of two vectors is defined—a scalar-valued product of two vectors—then it is also possible to define a length; the dot product gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both angle (a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors) and length (the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define the cross product, which supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the parallelogram defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram). In any dimension (and, in particular, higher dimensions), it is possible to define the exterior product, which (among other things) supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parallelotope defined by &quot;n&quot; vectors.

In a pseudo-Euclidean space, a vector&#x27;s squared length can be positive, negative, or zero. An important example is Minkowski space (which is important to our understanding of special relativity).

However, it is not always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector. This more general type of spatial vector is the subject of vector spaces (for free vectors) and affine spaces (for bound vectors, as each represented by an ordered pair of &quot;points&quot;). One physical example comes from thermodynamics, where many quantities of interest can be considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle.

===Generalizations===
In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a tuple of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of basis vectors. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called &quot;covariant&quot; or &quot;contravariant&quot;, depending on how the transformation of the vector&#x27;s components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are &quot;regular vectors&quot; with units of distance (such as a displacement), or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as gradient. If you change units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm—a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1 K/m becomes 0.001 K/mm—a covariant change in value (for more, see covariance and contravariance of vectors). Tensors are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of tensor.

In pure mathematics, a vector is any element of a vector space over some field and is often represented as a coordinate vector. The vectors described in this article are a very special case of this general definition, because they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space. Contravariance captures the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has &quot;magnitude and direction&quot;.

==Representations==

Vectors are usually denoted in lowercase boldface, as in formula_16, formula_17 and formula_18, or in lowercase italic boldface, as in a. (Uppercase letters are typically used to represent matrices.) Other conventions include formula_19 or &quot;a&quot;, especially in handwriting. Alternatively, some use a tilde (~) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, e.g. formula_20, which is a convention for indicating boldface type. If the vector represents a directed distance or displacement from a point &quot;A&quot; to a point &quot;B&quot; (see figure), it can also be denoted as formula_21 or &quot;AB&quot;. In German literature, it was especially common to represent vectors with small fraktur letters such as formula_22.

Vectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows (directed line segments), as illustrated in the figure. Here, the point &quot;A&quot; is called the &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;, &quot;base&quot;, or &quot;initial point&quot;, and the point &quot;B&quot; is called the &quot;head&quot;, &quot;tip&quot;, &quot;endpoint&quot;, &quot;terminal point&quot; or &quot;final point&quot;. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector&#x27;s magnitude, while the direction in which the arrow points indicates the vector&#x27;s direction.
On a two-dimensional diagram, a vector perpendicular to the plane of the diagram is sometimes desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre (Unicode U+2299 ⊙) indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, toward the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it (Unicode U+2297 ⊗) indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip of an arrow head on and viewing the flights of an arrow from the back.

In order to calculate with vectors, the graphical representation may be too cumbersome. Vectors in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as coordinate vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of &quot;n&quot; real numbers (&quot;n&quot;-tuple). These numbers are the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector, with respect to a given Cartesian coordinate system, and are typically called the &quot;scalar components&quot; (or &quot;scalar projections&quot;) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.

As an example in two dimensions (see figure), the vector from the origin &quot;O&quot; = (0, 0) to the point &quot;A&quot; = (2, 3) is simply written as
formula_23

The notion that the tail of the vector coincides with the origin is implicit and easily understood. Thus, the more explicit notation formula_24 is usually deemed not necessary (and is indeed rarely used).

In &quot;three dimensional&quot; Euclidean space (or ), vectors are identified with triples of scalar components:
formula_25
also written,
formula_26

This can be generalised to &quot;n-dimensional&quot; Euclidean space (or ).
formula_27

These numbers are often arranged into a column vector or row vector, particularly when dealing with matrices, as follows:
formula_28

Another way to represent a vector in &quot;n&quot;-dimensions is to introduce the standard basis vectors. For instance, in three dimensions, there are three of them:
formula_29
These have the intuitive interpretation as vectors of unit length pointing up the &quot;x&quot;-, &quot;y&quot;-, and &quot;z&quot;-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, respectively. In terms of these, any vector a in can be expressed in the form:
formula_30

or
formula_31

where a1, a2, a3 are called the vector components (or vector projections) of a on the basis vectors or, equivalently, on the corresponding Cartesian axes &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; (see figure), while &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3 are the respective scalar components (or scalar projections).

In introductory physics textbooks, the standard basis vectors are often denoted formula_32 instead (or formula_33, in which the hat symbol formula_34 typically denotes unit vectors). In this case, the scalar and vector components are denoted respectively &quot;ax&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, &quot;az&quot;, and a&quot;x&quot;, a&quot;y&quot;, a&quot;z&quot; (note the difference in boldface). Thus,

formula_35

The notation e&quot;i&quot; is compatible with the index notation and the summation convention commonly used in higher level mathematics, physics, and engineering.

=== Decomposition or resolution===

As explained above, a vector is often described by a set of vector components that add up to form the given vector. Typically, these components are the projections of the vector on a set of mutually perpendicular reference axes (basis vectors). The vector is said to be &quot;decomposed&quot; or &quot;resolved with respect to&quot; that set.

The decomposition or resolution of a vector into components is not unique, because it depends on the choice of the axes on which the vector is projected.

Moreover, the use of Cartesian unit vectors such as formula_33 as a basis in which to represent a vector is not mandated. Vectors can also be expressed in terms of an arbitrary basis, including the unit vectors of a cylindrical coordinate system (formula_37) or spherical coordinate system (formula_38). The latter two choices are more convenient for solving problems which possess cylindrical or spherical symmetry, respectively.

The choice of a basis does not affect the properties of a vector or its behaviour under transformations.

A vector can also be broken up with respect to &quot;non-fixed&quot; basis vectors that change their orientation as a function of time or space. For example, a vector in three-dimensional space can be decomposed with respect to two axes, respectively &quot;normal&quot;, and &quot;tangent&quot; to a surface (see figure). Moreover, the &quot;radial&quot; and &quot;tangential components&quot; of a vector relate to the &quot;radius of rotation&quot; of an object. The former is parallel to the radius and the latter is orthogonal to it.

In these cases, each of the components may be in turn decomposed with respect to a fixed coordinate system or basis set (e.g., a &quot;global&quot; coordinate system, or inertial reference frame).

==Properties and operations==
The following section uses the Cartesian coordinate system with basis vectors
formula_39
and assumes that all vectors have the origin as a common base point. A vector a will be written as
formula_40

===Equality===
Two vectors are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. Equivalently they will be equal if their coordinates are equal. So two vectors
formula_41
and
formula_42
are equal if
formula_43

=== Opposite, parallel, and antiparallel vectors ===

Two vectors are &quot;opposite&quot; if they have the same magnitude but opposite direction; so two vectors

formula_41

and

formula_42

are opposite if

formula_46

Two vectors are &quot;equidirectional&quot; (or &quot;codirectional&quot;) if they have the same direction but not necessarily the same magnitude.
Two vectors are &quot;parallel&quot; if they have either the same or opposite direction, but not necessarily the same magnitude; two vectors are &quot;antiparallel&quot; if they have strictly opposite direction, but not necessarily the same magnitude.

===Addition and subtraction===

The sum of a and b of two vectors may be defined as
formula_47
The resulting vector is sometimes called the resultant vector of a and b.

The addition may be represented graphically by placing the tail of the arrow b at the head of the arrow a, and then drawing an arrow from the tail of a to the head of b. The new arrow drawn represents the vector a + b, as illustrated below:

This addition method is sometimes called the &quot;parallelogram rule&quot; because a and b form the sides of a parallelogram and a + b is one of the diagonals. If a and b are bound vectors that have the same base point, this point will also be the base point of a + b. One can check geometrically that a + b = b + a and (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

The difference of a and b is

formula_48

Subtraction of two vectors can be geometrically illustrated as follows: to subtract b from a, place the tails of a and b at the same point, and then draw an arrow from the head of b to the head of a. This new arrow represents the vector (-b) + a, with (-b) being the opposite of b, see drawing. And (-b) + a = a − b.

===Scalar multiplication===

A vector may also be multiplied, or re-&quot;scaled&quot;, by any real number &quot;r&quot;. In the context of conventional vector algebra, these real numbers are often called scalars (from &quot;scale&quot;) to distinguish them from vectors. The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar is called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;. The resulting vector is

formula_49

Intuitively, multiplying by a scalar &quot;r&quot; stretches a vector out by a factor of &quot;r&quot;. Geometrically, this can be visualized (at least in the case when &quot;r&quot; is an integer) as placing &quot;r&quot; copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector.

If &quot;r&quot; is negative, then the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180°. Two examples (&quot;r&quot; = −1 and &quot;r&quot; = 2) are given below:

Scalar multiplication is distributive over vector addition in the following sense: &quot;r&quot;(a + b) = &quot;ra + &quot;rb for all vectors a and b and all scalars &quot;r&quot;. One can also show that a − b = a + (−1)b.

===Length===
The &quot;length&quot;, &quot;magnitude&quot; or &quot;norm&quot; of the vector a is denoted by ‖a‖ or, less commonly, |a|, which is not to be confused with the absolute value (a scalar &quot;norm&quot;).

The length of the vector a can be computed with the &quot;Euclidean norm&quot;,

formula_50

which is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem since the basis vectors e1, e2, e3 are orthogonal unit vectors.

This happens to be equal to the square root of the dot product, discussed below, of the vector with itself:

formula_51

====Unit vector====

A &quot;unit vector&quot; is any vector with a length of one; normally unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a unit vector. This is known as &quot;normalizing&quot; a vector. A unit vector is often indicated with a hat as in â.

To normalize a vector , scale the vector by the reciprocal of its length ‖a‖. That is:

formula_52

====Zero vector====
The &quot;zero vector&quot; is the vector with length zero. Written out in coordinates, the vector is , and it is commonly denoted formula_53, 0, or simply 0. Unlike any other vector, it has an arbitrary or indeterminate direction, and cannot be normalized (that is, there is no unit vector that is a multiple of the zero vector). The sum of the zero vector with any vector a is a (that is, ).

===Dot product===
The &quot;dot product&quot; of two vectors a and b (sometimes called the &quot;inner product&quot;, or, since its result is a scalar, the &quot;scalar product&quot;) is denoted by a ∙ b, and is defined as:

formula_54

where &quot;θ&quot; is the measure of the angle between a and b (see trigonometric function for an explanation of cosine). Geometrically, this means that a and b are drawn with a common start point, and then the length of a is multiplied with the length of the component of b that points in the same direction as a.

The dot product can also be defined as the sum of the products of the components of each vector as

formula_55

===Cross product===
The &quot;cross product&quot; (also called the &quot;vector product&quot; or &quot;outer product&quot;) is only meaningful in three or seven dimensions. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector. The cross product, denoted a × b, is a vector perpendicular to both a and b and is defined as

formula_56

where &quot;θ&quot; is the measure of the angle between a and b, and n is a unit vector perpendicular to both a and b which completes a right-handed system. The right-handedness constraint is necessary because there exist &quot;two&quot; unit vectors that are perpendicular to both a and b, namely, n and (−n).
The cross product a × b is defined so that a, b, and a × b also becomes a right-handed system (although a and b are not necessarily orthogonal). This is the right-hand rule.

The length of a × b can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram having a and b as sides.

The cross product can be written as
formula_57

For arbitrary choices of spatial orientation (that is, allowing for left-handed as well as right-handed coordinate systems) the cross product of two vectors is a pseudovector instead of a vector (see below).

===Scalar triple product===

The &quot;scalar triple product&quot; (also called the &quot;box product&quot; or &quot;mixed triple product&quot;) is not really a new operator, but a way of applying the other two multiplication operators to three vectors. The scalar triple product is sometimes denoted by (a b c) and defined as:

formula_58

It has three primary uses. First, the absolute value of the box product is the volume of the parallelepiped which has edges that are defined by the three vectors. Second, the scalar triple product is zero if and only if the three vectors are linearly dependent, which can be easily proved by considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane. Third, the box product is positive if and only if the three vectors a, b and c are right-handed.

In components (&quot;with respect to a right-handed orthonormal basis&quot;), if the three vectors are thought of as rows (or columns, but in the same order), the scalar triple product is simply the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix having the three vectors as rows
formula_59

The scalar triple product is linear in all three entries and anti-symmetric in the following sense:
formula_60

===Conversion between multiple Cartesian bases===
All examples thus far have dealt with vectors expressed in terms of the same basis, namely, the &quot;e&quot; basis {e1, e2, e3}. However, a vector can be expressed in terms of any number of different bases that are not necessarily aligned with each other, and still remain the same vector. In the &quot;e&quot; basis, a vector a is expressed, by definition, as

formula_61

The scalar components in the &quot;e&quot; basis are, by definition,

formula_62

In another orthonormal basis &quot;n&quot; = {n1, n2, n3} that is not necessarily aligned with &quot;e&quot;, the vector a is expressed as

formula_63

and the scalar components in the &quot;n&quot; basis are, by definition,

formula_64

The values of &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; relate to the unit vectors in such a way that the resulting vector sum is exactly the same physical vector a in both cases. It is common to encounter vectors known in terms of different bases (for example, one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle). In such a case it is necessary to develop a method to convert between bases so the basic vector operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed. One way to express &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; in terms of &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot; is to use column matrices along with a direction cosine matrix containing the information that relates the two bases. Such an expression can be formed by substitution of the above equations to form

formula_65

Distributing the dot-multiplication gives

formula_66

Replacing each dot product with a unique scalar gives

formula_67

and these equations can be expressed as the single matrix equation

formula_68

This matrix equation relates the scalar components of a in the &quot;n&quot; basis (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;, and &quot;w&quot;) with those in the &quot;e&quot; basis (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot;). Each matrix element &quot;c&quot;&quot;jk&quot; is the direction cosine relating n&quot;j&quot; to e&quot;k&quot;. The term &quot;direction cosine&quot; refers to the cosine of the angle between two unit vectors, which is also equal to their dot product. Therefore,

formula_69

By referring collectively to e1, e2, e3 as the &quot;e&quot; basis and to n1, n2, n3 as the &quot;n&quot; basis, the matrix containing all the &quot;c&quot;&quot;jk&quot; is known as the &quot;transformation matrix from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;n&quot;&quot;, or the &quot;rotation matrix from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;n&quot;&quot; (because it can be imagined as the &quot;rotation&quot; of a vector from one basis to another), or the &quot;direction cosine matrix from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;n&quot;&quot; (because it contains direction cosines). The properties of a rotation matrix are such that its inverse is equal to its transpose. This means that the &quot;rotation matrix from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;n&quot;&quot; is the transpose of &quot;rotation matrix from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;e&quot;&quot;.

The properties of a direction cosine matrix, C are:
* the determinant is unity, |C| = 1;
* the inverse is equal to the transpose;
* the rows and columns are orthogonal unit vectors, therefore their dot products are zero.

The advantage of this method is that a direction cosine matrix can usually be obtained independently by using Euler angles or a quaternion to relate the two vector bases, so the basis conversions can be performed directly, without having to work out all the dot products described above.

By applying several matrix multiplications in succession, any vector can be expressed in any basis so long as the set of direction cosines is known relating the successive bases.

===Other dimensions===
With the exception of the cross and triple products, the above formulae generalise to two dimensions and higher dimensions. For example, addition generalises to two dimensions as 
formula_70
and in four dimensions as
formula_71

The cross product does not readily generalise to other dimensions, though the closely related exterior product does, whose result is a bivector. In two dimensions this is simply a pseudoscalar
formula_72

A seven-dimensional cross product is similar to the cross product in that its result is a vector orthogonal to the two arguments; there is however no natural way of selecting one of the possible such products.

==Physics==

Vectors have many uses in physics and other sciences.

===Length and units===
In abstract vector spaces, the length of the arrow depends on a dimensionless scale. If it represents, for example, a force, the &quot;scale&quot; is of physical dimension length/force. Thus there is typically consistency in scale among quantities of the same dimension, but otherwise scale ratios may vary; for example, if &quot;1 newton&quot; and &quot;5 m&quot; are both represented with an arrow of 2 cm, the scales are 1 m:50 N and 1:250 respectively. Equal length of vectors of different dimension has no particular significance unless there is some proportionality constant inherent in the system that the diagram represents. Also length of a unit vector (of dimension length, not length/force, etc.) has no coordinate-system-invariant significance.

===Vector-valued functions===

Often in areas of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time parameter &quot;t&quot;. For instance, if r represents the position vector of a particle, then r(&quot;t&quot;) gives a parametric representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be differentiated and integrated by differentiating or integrating the components of the vector, and many of the familiar rules from calculus continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.

===Position, velocity and acceleration===
The position of a point x = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a position vector whose base point is the origin
formula_73
The position vector has dimensions of length.

Given two points x = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3), y = (&quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;3) their displacement is a vector
formula_74
which specifies the position of &quot;y&quot; relative to &quot;x&quot;. The length of this vector gives the straight-line distance from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot;. Displacement has the dimensions of length.

The velocity v of a point or particle is a vector, its length gives the speed. For constant velocity the position at time &quot;t&quot; will be
formula_75
where x0 is the position at time &quot;t&quot; = 0. Velocity is the time derivative of position. Its dimensions are length/time.

Acceleration a of a point is vector which is the time derivative of velocity. Its dimensions are length/time2.

===Force, energy, work===
Force is a vector with dimensions of mass×length/time2 (N m s −2) and Newton&#x27;s second law is the scalar multiplication
formula_76

Work is the dot product of force and displacement
formula_77
==Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations==

An alternative characterization of Euclidean vectors, especially in physics, describes them as lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a coordinate transformation. A &quot;contravariant vector&quot; is required to have components that &quot;transform opposite to the basis&quot; under changes of basis. The vector itself does not change when the basis is transformed; instead, the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis. In other words, if the reference axes (and the basis derived from it) were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the basis undergoes a transformation described by an invertible matrix &quot;M&quot;, so that a coordinate vector x is transformed to , then a contravariant vector v must be similarly transformed via . This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if &quot;v&quot; consists of the &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;-components of velocity, then &quot;v&quot; is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract vector, but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box&#x27;s length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include displacement, velocity, electric field, momentum, force, and acceleration.

In the language of differential geometry, the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a &quot;contravariant vector&quot; to be a tensor of contravariant rank one. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be a tangent vector, and the rules for transforming a contravariant vector follow from the chain rule.

Some vectors transform like contravariant vectors, except that when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the &quot;orientation&quot; of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a &quot;pseudovector&quot; or an &quot;axial vector&quot;. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called &quot;true vectors&quot; or &quot;polar vectors&quot; to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the cross product of two ordinary vectors.

One example of a pseudovector is angular velocity. Driving in a car, and looking forward, each of the wheels has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the &quot;reflection&quot; of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include magnetic field, torque, or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.

This distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is often ignored, but it becomes important in studying symmetry properties.

<text>In Norse mythology, Valhalla ( , ; , ) is described as a majestic hall located in Asgard and presided over by the god Odin. There were five possible realms the soul could travel to after death. First was, Fólkvangr which was ruled by the goddess Freyja. Second, was Hel, ruled by Hel, Loki&#x27;s daughter. The third realm was that of the goddess Rán. The fourth realm was the Burial Mound where the dead could live, and the last realm was Valhalla, ruled by Odin and was called the Hall of Heroes. The masses of those killed in combat (known as the einherjar), along with various legendary Germanic heroes and kings, live in Valhalla until Ragnarök, when they will march out of its many doors to fight in aid of Odin against the jötnar. This eternal battle and life in Valhalla was a reflection of greater Viking ideals, for &quot;what finer way to exist other than fighting, killing, and feasting with your erstwhile enemies, united in the common enterprise of training for the final battle”. Valhalla was idealized in Viking culture and gave the Scandinavians a wide spread cultural belief that there is nothing more glorious than death in battle. The belief in a Viking paradise and eternal life in Valhalla with Odin gave the Vikings a violent edge over the other raiders of their time period. 
Valhalla is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson), in (also written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson), and in stanzas of an anonymous 10th-century poem commemorating the death of Eric Bloodaxe known as &quot;Eiríksmál&quot; as compiled in &quot;Fagrskinna&quot;. Valhalla has inspired innumerable works of art, publication titles, and elements of popular culture and is synonymous with a martial (or otherwise) hall of the chosen dead. The name is rendered in modern Scandinavian languages as in Icelandic, while the Swedish and Norwegian form is ; in Faroese it is , and in Danish it is .

== Etymology ==
The Modern English noun &quot;Valhalla&quot; derives from Old Norse , a compound noun composed of two elements: the masculine noun &#x27;the slain&#x27; and the feminine noun which originally referred to a rock, rocks, or mountain; not a hall, thus meaning Valhalla was originally understood as the &quot;rock of the Slain&quot;. The form &quot;Valhalla&quot; comes from an attempt to clarify the grammatical gender of the word. has cognates in other Germanic languages such as Old English &#x27;the slain, slaughter, carnage&#x27;, Old Saxon &#x27;murder&#x27;, Old High German &#x27;battlefield, blood bath&#x27;. All of these forms descend from the Proto-Germanic masculine noun *&quot;walaz&quot;. Among related Old Norse concepts, also appears as the first element of the noun &#x27;chooser of the slain, valkyrie&#x27;.

The second element, , is a common Old Norse noun. It is cognate to Modern English &quot;hall&quot; and offers the same meaning. Both developed from Proto-Germanic *&quot;xallō&quot; or *&quot;hallō&quot;, meaning &#x27;covered place, hall&#x27;, from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;kol-&quot;. As philologists such as Calvert Watkins note, the same Indo-European root produced Old Norse , a proper noun employed for both the name of another afterlife location and a supernatural female entity as its overseer, as well as the modern English noun &quot;hell&quot;. In Swedish folklore, some mountains traditionally regarded as abodes of the dead were also called . According to many researchers, the element derives from , &quot;rock&quot;, and referred to an underworld, not a hall.

== Attestations ==

=== &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; ===
Valhalla is referenced at length in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, while Valhalla receives lesser direct references in stanza 32 of the &quot;Völuspá&quot;, where the god Baldr&#x27;s death is referred to as the &quot;woe of Valhalla&quot;, and in stanzas 1 to 3 of &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, where the goddess Freyja states her intention of riding to Valhalla with Hyndla, in an effort to help Óttar, as well as in stanzas 6 through 7, where Valhalla is mentioned again during a dispute between the two.

==== &quot;Grímnismál&quot; ====
In stanzas 8 to 10 of &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the god Odin (in the guise of Grímnir) proclaims Valhalla is in the realm of Glaðsheimr. Odin describes Valhalla as shining and golden, and it &quot;rises peacefully&quot; as seen from afar. From Valhalla, every day Odin chooses from those killed in combat. Valhalla has spear-shafts for rafters, a roof thatched with shields, coats of mail are strewn over its benches, a wolf hangs in front of its west doors, and an eagle hovers above it.&lt;poem&gt;
 The hall is easily recognised by those who come to Óðinn:
 Spear-shafts are the rafters, the hall is thatched with shields,
 And the benches are strewn with byrnies.

 The hall is easily recognised by those who come to Óðinn:
 A warg hangs before the western door,
 And an eagle hovers above . . .

 Andhrímnir lets Saehrímnir, best of flesh,
 Be seethed in Eldhrímnir, the cauldron,
 Though few know what the Einherjar feast on.

 Battle-accustomed, glorious Host-Father feeds Geri and Freki;
 But weapon-stately Óðinn lives on wine alone.

 Huginn and Muninn fly over the mighty earth every day;
 I fear for Huginn, that he not come back,
 But I look more for Muninn.

 Thundr roars loudly;
 Thjóðvitnir’s fish sports in the flood;
 The river roars loudly,
 The battle-slain think it too strong to wade.

 That which stands on the holy fields,
 Before the holy doors,
 Is called Valgrind, the Slain-Gate;
 Those gates are old,
 And few know how they may be locked.

 Five hundred and forty doors:
 So I know to be in Valhöll;
 Eight hundred Einherjar go out of one door,
 When they fare to battle the Wolf.

 The goat who stands on Host-Father’s hall
 Is called Heiðrún,
 And bites off the limbs of Laeraðr;
 She shall fill a cauldron with the shining mead,
 That drink will never be exhausted.

 The hart who stands on Host-Father’s hall
 Is called Eikthyrnir,
 And bites off the limbs of Laeraðr;
 And drops fall from his horns into Hvergelmir,
 To which all waters wend their way.

 Shaker and Mist I wish to have bear a horn to me;
 Skeggjöld and Striker, Shrieker and Battle-Fetter,
 Loudness and Spear-Striker, Shield-Strength and Rede-Strength,
 And God-Inheritance,
 They bear ale to the Einherjar.
(Grímnismál 9–10, 18–22, 23–26)
&lt;/poem&gt;
Odin, throughout this story is seen to have pet ravens that he sends out, and the warriors of his hall are dead men and ghosts who endlessly fight battles and endlessly die. There are also women who feed them and serve them alcohol and are the same spirits who chose them to die in the battles they fight. Valhalla in this story can be seen as a beautiful hall for the dead but it can also be seen as a lofty stylization of a battlefield after a fight. There are broken weapons and shields and dead bodies and ghosts cover the hall that gets ravaged by wolves and ravens. To the Vikings of the time, this was not only their desired afterlife, but a way to cope with the horrors of battle.

==== &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; ====

In stanza 38 of the poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, the hero Helgi Hundingsbane dies and goes to Valhalla. In stanza 38, Helgi&#x27;s glory there is described:

&lt;poem&gt;
So was Helgi beside the chieftains
like the bright-growing ash beside the thorn-bush
and the young stag, drenched in dew,
who surpasses all other animals
and whose horns glow against the sky itself.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Prose follows after this stanza, stating a burial-mound was made for Helgi. After Helgi arrived in Valhalla, he was asked by Odin to manage things with him. In stanza 39, Helgi, now in Valhalla, has his former enemy Hunding—also in Valhalla—do menial tasks; fetching foot-baths for all of the men there, kindling fire, tying dogs, keeping watch of horses, and feeding the pigs before he can get any sleep. In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi returns to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi&#x27;s valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök is started, or if Helgi and his men were allowed to return.

In the following stanzas, Helgi responds none of these things occurred, and so Sigrún&#x27;s maid goes home to Sigrún. The maid tells Sigrún the burial mound is opened, and Sigrún should go to Helgi there. Helgi asked her to come and tend his wounds after they opened and are bleeding. Sigrún goes into the mound, and finds Helgi is drenched in gore, his hair is thick with frost. Filled with joy at the re-union, Sigrún kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail, and asks how she can heal him. Sigrún makes a bed there, and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound. Helgi awakens, stating he must &quot;ride along the blood-red roads, to set the pale horse to tread the path of the sky,&quot; and return before the rooster Salgófnir crows. Helgi and the host of men ride away, and Sigrún and her servant go back to their house. Sigrún orders her maid to wait for him by the mound the next night, but after she arrives at dawn, she finds he is still journeying. The prose narrative at the end of the poem relates Sigrún dies of sadness, but the two are thought to be re-born as Helgi Haddingjaskati and the valkyrie Kára.

==== Vafthrúðnismál ====
In the story of Vafthrúðnismál Odin disguises himself as a man named Gagnráð and visits the all knowing giant, Vafthrúðnir, to not only test his knowledge, but gain wisdom from the giant as well. Odin and Vafthrúðnir exchange questions and tests Odin on his knowledge of the afterlife and cosmology. Vafthrúðnir asks Odin about the topography of Valhalla in Stanzas 15 and 16&lt;poem&gt;
Vafthrúðnir said: Say this, Gagnráðr,
since you want to test your talent on the floor:
What is the river called that divides the earth
among the sons of giants and among the gods?

Óðinn said: The river is called Ífing,
which divides the earth among the sons 
of giants and among the gods.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Then, it is Odin&#x27;s turn to ask the giant questions but instead of asking questions on the afterlife, Odin asks more esoteric questions like the fate of the gods and the end of the world. Those that are chosen to live in Valhalla with Odin prepare every day for the end of the world, also known as Ragnarök. These Vikings prepare for the battle of the end of the world everyday in the eternal battle and is the main characteristic to daily life in Valhalla. Stanzas 17 &amp; 18 of the poem describe the field in Valhalla where this battle takes place&lt;poem&gt;
Vafþrúðnir said:
Say this, Gagnráðr,
since you want to test your talent on the floor:
What is the field called
where Surtr and the sweet gods
will meet in battle?

Óðinn said:
The field is called Vígríðr,
where Surtr and the sweet gods
will meet in battle.
It is a hundred leagues
in every direction —
that is the field determined for them.
&lt;/poem&gt;
This poem also describes the picking of slain warriors and their entrance into Valhalla in stanza 41 that states&lt;poem&gt;
Vafþrúðnir said:
All the unique champions
in Óðinn’s enclosed fields
fight each other every day;
they choose the slain
and ride from battle;
thereafter they sit together in peace.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The last question Odin asks, is what he himself whispered into the ear of his dying son, Baldr, at Baldr&#x27;s funeral pyre. This question, revealed Odin&#x27;s true identity since only he can know the answer to that question. Vafthrúðnir realizes he has been tricked, and the story concludes with the All-father, Odin, himself humbling the wise giant who must acknowledge his unparalleled wisdom. 

=== &quot;Prose Edda&quot; ===
Valhalla is referenced in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

==== &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; ====
Valhalla is first mentioned in chapter 2 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where it is described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard in the guise of an old man going by the name of &quot;Gangleri&quot; to find the source of the power of the gods.

The narrative states the Æsir prophesied his arrival and prepared grand illusions for him, so as Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height, he has trouble seeing over it, and notices the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air simultaneously. Among other things, the man says the hall belongs to his king, and adds he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him, he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him High is the king of the hall.

In chapter 20, Third states Odin mans Valhalla with the Einherjar: those killed in battle and become Odin&#x27;s adopted sons. In chapter 36, High states valkyries serve drinks and see to the tables in Valhalla, and &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanzas 40 to 41 are quoted in reference to this. High continues the valkyries are sent by Odin to every battle; they choose who is to die, and determine victory.

In chapter 38, Gangleri says: &quot;You say all men who have fallen in battle from the beginning of the world are now with Odin in Valhalla. With what does he feed them? I should think the crowd there is large.&quot; High responds this is indeed true, a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount will seem to be too few before &quot;the wolf comes.&quot; High describes there are never too many to feed in Valhalla, for they feast from Sæhrímnir (here described as a boar), and this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza 18 is recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds Odin needs nothing to eat—Odin only consumes wine—and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza 19 is recounted. High additionally states, at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.

In chapter 39, Gangleri asks about the food and drinks the Einherjar consume, and asks if only water is available there. High replies of course, Valhalla has food and drinks fit for kings and jarls, for the mead consumed in Valhalla is produced from the udders of the goat Heiðrún, who in turn feeds on the leaves of the &quot;famous tree&quot; Læraðr. The goat produces so much mead in a day, it fills a massive vat large enough for all of the Einherjar in Valhalla to satisfy their thirst from it. High further states the stag Eikþyrnir stands atop Valhalla and chews on the branches of Læraðr. So much moisture drips from his horns, it falls down to the well Hvelgelmir, resulting in numerous rivers.

In chapter 40, Gangleri muses Valhalla must be quite crowded, to which High responds Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite the large amount of inhabitants, and then quotes &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord, controlling quite a big army, but he wonders how the Einherjar keep busy while they are not drinking. High replies daily, after they dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one-on-one combat for sport. Then, before mealtime, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High quotes &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot; stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes &quot;right at the beginning, while the gods were settling&quot;, they established Asgard, then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, with the mistletoe used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.

==== &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; ====
At the beginning of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a partially euhemerized account is given of Ægir visiting the gods in Asgard and shimmering swords are brought out and used as their sole source of light as they drink. There, numerous gods feast, they have plenty of strong mead, and the hall has wall-panels covered with attractive shields. This location is confirmed as Valhalla in chapter 33.

In chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th-century poem Eiríksmál is provided (see the &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; section below for more detail and another translation from another source):

What sort of dream is that, Odin? I dreamed I rose up before dawn to clear up Val-hall for slain people. I aroused the Einheriar, bade them get up to strew the benches, clean the beer-cups, the valkyries to serve wine for the arrival of a prince.

In chapter 17 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, the jötunn Hrungnir is in a rage and, while attempting to catch up and attack Odin on his steed Sleipnir, ends up at the doors to Valhalla. There, the Æsir invite him in for a drink. Hrungnir goes in, demands a drink, and becomes drunk and belligerent, stating that he will remove Valhalla and take it to the land of the jötunn, Jötunheimr, among various other things. Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that he is under the Aesir&#x27;s protection as a guest and therefore he can&#x27;t be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir&#x27;s death.

In chapter 34, the tree Glasir is stated as located in front of the doors of Valhalla. The tree is described as having foliage of red gold and being the most beautiful tree among both gods and men. A quote from a work by the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason is presented that confirms the description.

=== &quot;Heimskringla&quot; ===
Valhalla is mentioned in euhemerized form and as an element of remaining Norse pagan belief in . In chapter 8 of &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, the &quot;historical&quot; Odin is described as ordaining burial laws over his country. These laws include that all the dead are to be burned on a pyre on a burial mound with their possessions, and their ashes are to be brought out to sea or buried in the earth. The dead would then arrive in Valhalla with everything that one had on their pyre, and whatever one had hidden in the ground. Valhalla is additionally referenced in the phrase &quot;visiting Odin&quot; in a work by the 10th-century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir describing that, upon his death, King Vanlandi went to Valhalla.

In chapter 32 of &quot;Hákonar saga Góða&quot;, Haakon I of Norway is given a pagan burial, which is described as sending him on his way to Valhalla. Verses from &quot;Hákonarmál&quot; are then quoted in support, themselves containing references to Valhalla.

===&quot;Fagrskinna&quot;===
In chapter 8 of &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; a prose narrative states that after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as &quot;Eiríksmál&quot;, and describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse &quot;Óðinn&quot;):

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;What kind of a dream is it,&quot; said Óðinn,
in which just before daybreak,
I thought I cleared Valhǫll,
for coming of slain men?
I waked the Einherjar,
bade valkyries rise up,
to strew the bench,
and scour the beakers,

wine to carry,
as for a king&#x27;s coming,
here to me I expect
heroes&#x27; coming from the world,
certain great ones,
so glad is my heart.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.

Sigmund asks Odin why he would expect Eric more than any other king, to which Odin responds that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name of them all, and that he, himself, is the sixth.

== Women of Valhalla and their role in the afterlife ==
The women of Valhalla and their role in the theology of the Norse afterlife is in stark contrast to the commonly male-dominated perceptions of Viking society, mythology, and cultural practices. Those chosen for Valhalla are often associated with heroic deeds in battle; the god Odin was said to have employed women - battle-maidens called valkyries - to carry the dead to his hall. These valkyries play a vital role in the functioning of Valhalla, and shape the Norse afterlife and fate of the dead. They are seen as active agents in the cosmic balance of life, death, and honor. 

Valkyries are often described as &quot;Odin&#x27;s Vultures&quot;, whose purpose is to select the most glorious of men who die in battle. They are women of violence that were seen as precursors to both honor and horror. Valkyries were physically important to the processing of men into Valhalla, which inherently entwined their fate with Viking warriors and they were heavily associated with the death of men. The valkyries haunted their dreams and looked over the slaughter of battle, making them culturally dreaded creatures. Over time, this view of valkyries in Valhalla softened, making them into protective spirits. They are the women who serve the men of Valhalla in feasts and care for the warriors until Ragnarök. This later shift from violent overseers to sustainers of life shows how the image of women changed within Norse culture with the introduction of Christianity.

Valhalla is also the only hall of the dead that is ruled by a man. All the other realms are tended to by women. Hel, the jötunn and daughter of Loki, presides over the eponymous Hel, where those who die of illness or old age dwell. Freyja, the goddess of love and war, claims half of the fallen warriors in her realm of Fólkvangr. Rán, the sea goddess, gathers the drowned into her underwater hall. These female goddesses further enforce this image of women as the overseers of death. Women in Norse Mythology then, &quot;collect the dead, women portend death, they care for the dead and women keep the dead. In all respects except Óðin’s, it seems like an almost exclusively feminine role to keep”.

== Cultural practices ==
The belief in Valhalla influenced many cultural practices in Norse society, specifically those surrounding death and commemoration. These practices during the death and burial of a Viking reflects the society&#x27;s greater understanding of honor, legacy, and the afterlife. Valhalla and the practices that occurred were deeply tied to its role in immortalizing and honoring the dead. these customs later evolved with the introduction of Christianity and created a complex tradition of the Norse afterlife. 

=== Horse burial: transportation to Valhalla ===
Horses played a critical role in the burial and funeral processions of Viking burials. They were seen to be the dead&#x27;s main transportation to Valhalla. In &quot;Egils saga Skallagrímssonar&quot;, for instance, Skallagrímr is buried with his horse, weapons, and smith’s tools, illustrating the belief in the horse’s importance for the deceased’s passage to Odin’s hall. It is also noted that Old Norse sources mention only horses, not ships, as a means of traveling to and from Valhalla. This belief in horses being the main way of getting to Valhalla is also supported in the story, Sögubrot, where the character Harald Wartooth is buried with his horse and a wagon so he could ride to Valhalla. The riding of a horse to Valhalla is also mention in the story, &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, where the hero Helgi rides to Valhalla after his burial and later returns on horseback to visit his living bride.

=== Death chants as appeals to Valhalla ===
Death chants were poetic compositions made to appease Odin and to earn a dead loved one&#x27;s place in Valhalla. These death chants recorded a loved one&#x27;s deed and accounted their victories to prove their worthiness to the hall of hero&#x27;s. The witnesses of these death chants were often daughters of the dying Vikings who acted at intermediaries by recording these poems in runes or orally. “By witnessing and recording these poems, they are in essence lending their fathers’ deaths a certain amount of weight”. These rituals ensured that the deeds of the fallen would remain influential, securing their place among the honored dead in Valhalla. This also once again placed women as a central role in death and the procession of death in Viking society. 

=== Political continuity through death ===
The belief in Valhalla also committed to the deification of political leaders and heroes. Instead of being a hall for those that died in battle, it became a symbol of honor and continuity in a heritage-based society. As Gundarsson notes, “The purpose of the deification of a dead leader or hero is clear. It offers a sense of continuity”, with rulers often seated on their forebears’ burial mounds to evoke the authority of the dead. As Scandinavia transitioned into larger and more unified nations, the importance of the deification of political leaders grew and Valhalla became a resting place for kings and political heroes. So, to enter Valhalla was not to achieve a &quot;good death&quot; but to secure a legacy among the gods and kings. 

== Modern influence ==
The concept of Valhalla continues to influence modern popular culture. Examples include the Walhalla temple built by Leo von Klenze for Ludwig I of Bavaria between 1830 and 1847 near Regensburg, Germany, and the Tresco Abbey Gardens Valhalla museum built by August Smith around 1830 to house ship figureheads from shipwrecks that occurred at the Isles of Scilly, England, near the museum.

References to Valhalla appear in literature, art, and other forms of media. Examples include K. Ehrenberg&#x27;s charcoal illustration &quot;Gastmahl in Walhalla (mit einziehenden Einheriern)&quot; (1880), Richard Wagner&#x27;s depiction of Valhalla in his opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (1848–1874), the Munich, Germany-based Germanic Neopagan magazine &quot;Walhalla&quot; (1905–1913), the book series Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard by Rick Riordan, the comic series &quot;Valhalla&quot; (1978–2009) by Peter Madsen, and its subsequent animated film of the same name (1986). 
Valhalla also gives its name to a thrill ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, UK.

Before Hunter S. Thompson became the counter-culture&#x27;s Gonzo journalist, he lived in Big Sur, California, while writing his novel &quot;The Rum Diary.&quot; He wrote &quot;Big Sur is very like Valhalla—a place that a lot of people have heard of, and that very few can tell you anything about&quot; (&quot;Proud Highway: Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman,&quot; chapter 20).

In the 2015 film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, the cult of the War Boys believe a heroic death in the service of dictator Immortan Joe will take them to Valhalla.

A video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot; was released in November 2020. The video game &quot;Apex Legends&quot; features a character named Bloodhound, who often references Valhalla and the Allfather, a commonly used kenning for the Norse god Odin. Valhalla is also referenced in the manga &#x27;Heart Gear&#x27; by Tsuyoshi Takaki as a battle ground where the &#x27;combat&#x27; gears take turns in fighting each other to the death as their leader, Odin, observes. Another video game, &quot;Overwatch 2,&quot; features two in game cosmetic skins that were inspired by Valhalla&#x27;s Valkyries. These skins are both on the flying support hero, Mercy, who heals and resurrects her team. These Valkyrie inspired skins feature a voice line where Mercy says, &quot;till Valhalla&quot; when she uses one of her mass team healing ability. 

Elton John&#x27;s first album, &quot;Empty Sky&quot; (1969), contains a song called &quot;Valhalla&quot;. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; from their third album, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970), contains the following Valhalla reference: &quot;The hammer of the gods/ Will drive our ships to new lands/ To fight the horde, sing and cry/ Valhalla, I am coming&quot;. Judas Priest&#x27;s seventeenth studio album &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot; released in 2014 included the song &quot;Halls of Valhalla&quot;, as lead singer Rob Halford describes as &quot;singing about being on the North Sea and heading to Denmark or Sweden searching for Valhalla&quot;. Australian band Skegss&#x27;s third album, &quot;Rehearsal&quot; (2021), contains a song called &quot;Valhalla&quot;. 
Jethro Tull&#x27;s album, &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; (1975), contains a song called &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot;.

On 14 April 1989, Blind Guardian released &quot;Follow the Blind,&quot; track number 8 is titled &quot;Valhalla.&quot;

<text>The Viking Age (about ) was the period during the Middle Ages when Norsemen known as Vikings undertook large-scale raiding, colonising, conquest, and trading throughout Europe and reached North America. The Viking Age applies not only to their homeland of Scandinavia but also to any place significantly settled by Scandinavians during the period. The Scandinavians of the Viking Age are often referred to as &quot;Vikings&quot; as well as &quot;Norsemen&quot;, although few of them were Vikings in the sense of being engaged in piracy.

Voyaging by sea from their homelands in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the Norse people settled in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic coast and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in eastern Europe, where they were also known as Varangians. They also briefly settled in Newfoundland, becoming the first Europeans to reach North America. The Norse-Gaels, Normans, Rus&#x27; people, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. The Vikings founded several kingdoms and earldoms in Europe: the Kingdom of the Isles (&quot;Suðreyjar&quot;), Orkney (&quot;Norðreyjar&quot;), York (&quot;Jórvík&quot;) and the Danelaw (&quot;Danalǫg&quot;), Dublin (&quot;Dyflin&quot;), Normandy, and Kievan Rus&#x27; (&quot;Garðaríki&quot;). The Norse homelands were also unified into larger kingdoms during the Viking Age, and the short-lived North Sea Empire included large swathes of Scandinavia and Britain. In 1021, the Vikings achieved the feat of reaching North America—the date of which was not determined until a millennium later.

Several things drove this expansion. The Vikings were drawn by the growth of wealthy towns and monasteries overseas and weak kingdoms. They may also have been pushed to leave their homeland by overpopulation, lack of good farmland, and political strife arising from the unification of Norway. The aggressive expansion of the Carolingian Empire and forced conversion of the neighbouring Saxons to Christianity may also have been a factor. Sailing innovations had allowed the Vikings to sail farther and longer to begin with.

Information about the Viking Age is drawn largely from primary sources written by those the Vikings encountered, as well as archaeology, supplemented with secondary sources such as the Icelandic Sagas.
== Context ==
In England, the Viking attack of 8 June 793 that destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne, a centre of learning on an island off the northeast coast of England in Northumberland, is regarded as the beginning of the Viking Age. Judith Jesch has argued that the start of the Viking Age can be pushed back to 700–750, as it was unlikely that the Lindisfarne attack was the first attack, and given archeological evidence that suggests contacts between Scandinavia and the British isles earlier in the century. The earliest raids were most likely small in scale, but expanded in scale during the 9th century.

In the Lindisfarne attack, monks were killed in the abbey, thrown into the sea to drown, or carried away as slaves along with the church treasures, giving rise to the traditional (but unattested) prayer—&quot;&quot;, &quot;Free us from the fury of the Northmen, Lord.&quot; Three Viking ships had beached in Weymouth Bay four years earlier (although due to a scribal error the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; dates this event to 787 rather than 789), but that incursion may have been a trading expedition that went wrong rather than a piratical raid. Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of Northumbria&#x27;s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York, who wrote: &quot;Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared&quot;. Vikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. Robert of Gloucester&#x27;s Chronicle, c. 1300, mentions Viking attacks on the people of East Anglia wherein they are described as &quot;wolves among sheep&quot;.

The first challenges to the many negative depictions of Vikings in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached only a small readership there, while linguists traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries and grammars of the Old Icelandic language appeared, enabling more Victorian scholars to read the primary texts of the Icelandic Sagas.

In Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars Thomas Bartholin and Ole Worm and Swedish scholar Olaus Rudbeck were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the Enlightenment and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian Thormodus Torfæus, Danish-Norwegian Ludvig Holberg, and Swedish Olof von Dalin developed a more &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach to historical scholarship.

By the latter half of the 18th century, while the Icelandic sagas were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries. Scholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.

== Background ==

The Vikings who invaded western and eastern Europe were mainly pagans from the same area as present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They also settled in the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland (Caithness, the Hebrides and the Northern Isles), Greenland, and Canada.

Their North Germanic language, Old Norse, became the precursor to present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in Jutland, and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.

In Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.

The sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The North Sea rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers who were notorious in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and other places in Europe for being brutal.

== Probable causes ==
Many theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the Scandes, was a possible reason, although some disagree with this theory. Technological advances like the use of iron and a shortage of women due to selective female infanticide also likely had an impact. Tensions caused by Frankish expansion to the south of Scandinavia, and their subsequent attacks upon the Viking peoples, may have also played a role in Viking pillaging. Harald I of Norway (&quot;Harald Fairhair&quot;) had united Norway around this time and displaced many peoples. As a result, these people sought for new bases to launch counter-raids against Harald.
Debate among scholars is ongoing as to why the Scandinavians began to expand from the eighth through 11th centuries. Various factors have been highlighted: demographic, economic, ideological, political, technological, and environmental models.

===Demographic models===
Barrett considers that prior scholarship having examined causes of the Viking Age in terms of demographic determinism, the resulting explanations have generated a &quot;wide variety of possible models&quot;. While admitting that Scandinavia did share in the general European population and settlement expansion at the end of the first millennium, he dismisses &#x27;population pressure&#x27; as a realistic cause of the Viking Age. Bagge alludes to the evidence of demographic growth at the time, manifested in an increase of new settlements, but he declares that a warlike people do not require population pressure to resort to plundering abroad. He grants that although population increase was a factor in this expansion, it was not the incentive for such expeditions. According to Ferguson, the proliferation of the use of iron in Scandinavia at the time increased agricultural yields, allowing for demographic growth that strained the limited capacity of the land. As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually into all of Europe. Historian Anders Winroth has also challenged the &quot;overpopulation&quot; thesis, arguing that scholars are &quot;simply repeating an ancient cliché that has no basis in fact.&quot;

===Economic model===
The economic model states that the Viking Age was the result of growing urbanism and trade throughout mainland Europe. As the Islamic world grew, so did its trade routes, and the wealth which moved along them was pushed further and further north. In Western Europe, proto-urban centres such as those with names ending in &quot;wich&quot;, the so-called -wich towns of Anglo-Saxon England, began to boom during the prosperous era known as the &quot;Long Eighth Century&quot;. The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier &quot;urban&quot; centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the Cuerdale Hoard and the Vale of York Hoard, offer insight into this phenomenon. Barrett rejects this model, arguing that the earliest recorded Viking raids were in Western Norway and northern Britain, which were not highly economically integrated areas. He proposes a version of the economic model that points to new economic incentives stemming from a &quot;bulge&quot; in the population of young Scandinavian men, impelling them to engage in maritime activity due to limited economic alternatives.

===Ideological model===
This era coincided with the Medieval Warm Period (800–1300) and stopped with the start of the Little Ice Age (about 1250–1850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with Charlemagne&#x27;s Saxon Wars, or Christian wars with pagans in Saxony. Bruno Dumézil theorises that the Viking attacks may have been in response to the spread of Christianity among pagan peoples. Because of the penetration of Christianity in Scandinavia, serious conflict divided Norway for almost a century.

===Political model===
The first of two main components to the political model is the external &quot;pull&quot; factor, which suggests that the weak political bodies of Britain and Western Europe made for an attractive target for Viking raiders. The reasons for these weaknesses vary, but generally can be simplified into decentralised polities, or religious sites. As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal &quot;push&quot; factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralisation of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralisation of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being appropriated by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe. Anders Winroth argues that purposeful choices by warlords &quot;propelled the Viking Age movement of people from Scandinavia.&quot;

;Technological model: This model suggests that the Viking Age occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the Vikings to go on their raids in the first place. There is no doubt that piracy existed in the Baltic before the Viking Age, but developments in sailing technology and practice made it possible for early Viking raiders to attack lands farther away. Among these developments are included the use of larger sails, tacking practices, and 24-hour sailing. Anders Winroth writes, &quot;If early medieval Scandinavians had not become exquisite shipwrights, there would have been no Vikings and no Viking Age.&quot;

These models constitute much of what is known about the motivations for and the causes of the Viking Age. In all likelihood, the beginning of this age was the result of some combination of the aforementioned hypotheses.

The Viking colonisation of islands in the North Atlantic has in part been attributed to a period of favourable climate (the Medieval Climactic Optimum), as the weather was relatively stable and predictable, with calm seas. Sea ice was rare, harvests were typically strong, and fishing conditions were good.

== Overview ==

The earliest date given for the coming of Vikings to England is 789 during the reign of King Beorhtric of Wessex. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; three Norwegian boats from Hordaland (Old Norse: &quot;Hǫrðalandi&quot;) landed at the Isle of Portland off the coast of Dorset. They apparently were mistaken for merchants by a royal official, Beaduhard, a king&#x27;s reeve who attempted to force them to come to the king&#x27;s manor, whereupon they killed the reeve and his men. The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is often set at 793. It was recorded in the &quot;Anglo–Saxon Chronicle&quot; that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne (the generally accepted date is actually 8 June, not January):

In 794, according to the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, a serious attack was made on Lindisfarne&#x27;s mother-house of Iona, which was followed in 795 by raids upon the northern coast of Ireland. From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the &quot;Céli Dé&quot; Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.

The Vikings primarily targeted Ireland until 830, as England and the Carolingian Empire were able to fight the Vikings off. However, after , the Vikings had considerable success against England, the Carolingian Empire, and other parts of Western Europe. After 830, the Vikings exploited disunity within the Carolingian Empire, as well as pitting the English kingdoms against each other.
The Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was particularly devastated by these raiders, who could sail up the Seine with near impunity. Near the end of Charlemagne&#x27;s reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy in 911. Frankish King Charles the Simple granted the Duchy of Normandy to Viking warleader Rollo (a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins) in order to stave off attacks by other Vikings. Charles gave Rollo the title of duke. In return, Rollo swore fealty to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the Norman language (either a French dialect or a Romance language which can be classified as one of the Oïl languages along with French, Picard and Walloon), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the Norman Conquest, they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo–Saxon England.

The clinker-built longships used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. Rurik also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of Novgorod (which means &quot;new city&quot;) on the Volkhov River. His successors moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of Kievan Rus&#x27; with the capital in Kiev. This persisted until 1240, when the Mongols invaded Kievan Rus&#x27;.

Other Norse people continued south to the Black Sea and then on to Constantinople. The eastern connections of these &quot;Varangians&quot; brought Byzantine silk, a cowrie shell from the Red Sea, and even coins from Samarkand, to Viking York.

In 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the Battle of Norditi (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic North Sea coast by a Frisian army under Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from East Frisia. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Saxons and Slavs began to use trained mobile cavalry successfully against Viking foot soldiers, making it hard for Viking invaders to fight inland.

In Scandinavia, the Viking Age is considered by some scholars to have ended with the establishment of royal authority and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion. Scholars have proposed different end dates for the Viking Age, but many argue it ended in the 11th century. The year 1000 is sometimes used, as that was the year in which Iceland converted to Christianity, marking the conversion of all of Scandinavia to Christianity. The death of Harthacnut, the Danish King of England, in 1042 has also been used as an end date. History does not often allow such clear-cut separation between arbitrary &quot;ages&quot;, and it is not easy to pin down a single date that applies to all the Viking world. The Viking Age was not a &quot;monolithic chronological period&quot; across three or four hundred years, but was characterised by various distinct phases of Viking activity. It is unlikely that the Viking Age could be so neatly assigned a terminal event. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030, in which Óláfr Haraldsson (later known as Olav the Holy), a fervent Christianiser who dealt harshly with those suspected of clinging to pagan cult, was killed. Although Óláfr&#x27;s army lost the battle, Christianity continued to spread, and after his death he became one of the subjects of the three miracle stories given in the Manx Chronicle. In Sweden, the reign of king Olof Skötkonung () is considered to be the transition from the Viking Age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century; Olof was the last king in Scandinavia to adopt Christianity.

The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III (Haraldr Harðráði), who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; in Ireland, the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King Hákon Hákonarson at the Battle of Largs by troops loyal to Alexander III. Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, William, Duke of Normandy. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the Norse between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the Western Isles and the Isle of Man remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266. Orkney and Shetland belonged to the king of Norway as late as 1469. Consequently, a &quot;long Viking Age&quot; may stretch into the 15th century.

== Northern Europe ==
=== England ===
According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot;, Viking raiders struck England in 793 and raided Lindisfarne, the monastery that held Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s relics, killing the monks and capturing the valuables. The raid marked the beginning of the &quot;Viking Age of Invasion&quot;. Great but sporadic violence continued on England&#x27;s northern and eastern shores, with raids continuing on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been involved. The Vikings raided during the winter of 840–841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland.

In 850, the Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the island of Thanet, Kent. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.

The following year, the Great Heathen Army, led by brothers Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan and Ubba, and also by another Viking Guthrum, arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing a Viking community in Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing Danelaw, after its conquest by the Ragnarsson brothers, who installed an Englishman, Ecgberht, as a puppet king. By 870, the &quot;Great Summer Army&quot; arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called Bagsecg and his five earls. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg&#x27;s forces, and Halfdan&#x27;s forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the Battle of Ashdown along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but Alfred of Wessex managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Vikings appeared in England in 947, when Eric Bloodaxe captured York.

In 1003, the Danish King Sweyn Forkbeard started a series of raids against England to avenge the St. Brice&#x27;s Day massacre of England&#x27;s Danish inhabitants, culminating in a full-scale invasion that led to Sweyn being crowned king of England in 1013. Sweyn was also king of Denmark and parts of Norway at this time. The throne of England passed to Edmund Ironside of Wessex after Sweyn&#x27;s death in 1014. Sweyn&#x27;s son, Cnut the Great, won the throne of England in 1016 through conquest. When Cnut the Great died in 1035 he was a king of Denmark, England, Norway, and parts of Sweden. Harold Harefoot became king of England after Cnut&#x27;s death, and Viking rule of England ceased.

The Viking presence declined until 1066, when they lost their final battle with the English at Stamford Bridge. The death in the battle of King Harald Hardrada of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut&#x27;s North Sea Empire, and it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age. Nineteen days later, a large army containing and led by senior Normans, themselves mostly male-line descendants of Norsemen, invaded England and defeated the weakened English army at the Battle of Hastings. The army invited others from across Norman gentry and ecclesiastical society to join them. There were several unsuccessful attempts by Scandinavian kings to regain control of England, the last of which took place in 1086.

In 1152, Eystein II of Norway led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.

=== Ireland ===

In 795, small bands of Vikings began plundering monastic settlements along the coast of Gaelic Ireland. The Annals of Ulster state that in 821 the Vikings plundered Howth and &quot;carried off a great number of women into captivity&quot;. From 840 the Vikings began building fortified encampments, &quot;longphorts&quot;, on the coast and overwintering in Ireland. The first were at Dublin and Linn Duachaill. Their attacks became bigger and reached further inland, striking larger monastic settlements such as Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Kells, and Kildare, and also plundering the ancient tombs of Brú na Bóinne. Viking chief Thorgest is said to have raided the whole midlands of Ireland until he was killed by Máel Sechnaill I in 845.

In 853, Viking leader Amlaíb (Olaf) became the first king of Dublin. He ruled along with his brothers Ímar (possibly Ivar the Boneless) and Auisle. Over the following decades, there was regular warfare between the Vikings and the Irish, and between two groups of Vikings: the Dubgaill and Finngaill (dark and fair foreigners). The Vikings also briefly allied with various Irish kings against their rivals. In 866, Áed Findliath burnt all Viking longphorts in the north, and they never managed to establish permanent settlements in that region. The Vikings were driven from Dublin in 902.

They returned in 914, now led by the Uí Ímair (House of Ivar). During the next eight years the Vikings won decisive battles against the Irish, regained control of Dublin, and founded settlements at Waterford, Wexford, Cork, and Limerick, which became Ireland&#x27;s first large towns. They were important trading hubs, and Viking Dublin was the biggest slave port in western Europe.

These Viking territories became part of the patchwork of kingdoms in Ireland. Vikings intermarried with the Irish and adopted elements of Irish culture, becoming the Norse-Gaels. Some Viking kings of Dublin also ruled the kingdom of the Isles and York; such as Sitric Cáech, Gofraid ua Ímair, Olaf Guthfrithson, and Olaf Cuaran. Sigtrygg Silkbeard was &quot;a patron of the arts, a benefactor of the church, and an economic innovator&quot; who established Ireland&#x27;s first mint, in Dublin.

In , Máel Sechnaill Mór defeated the Dublin Vikings and forced them into submission. Over the following thirty years, Brian Boru subdued the Viking territories and made himself High King of Ireland. The Dublin Vikings, together with Leinster, twice rebelled against him, but they were defeated in the battles of Glenmama () and Clontarf (). After the battle of Clontarf, the Dublin Vikings could no longer &quot;single-handedly threaten the power of the most powerful kings of Ireland&quot;. Brian&#x27;s rise to power and conflict with the Vikings is chronicled in &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot; (&quot;The War of the Irish with the Foreigners&quot;).

=== Scotland ===

While few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.

In 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the River Tay and River Earn, both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu. They defeated Eogán mac Óengusa, king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of Óengus mac Fergusa (The accession of Cináed mac Ailpín as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).

In 870, the Britons of the Old North around the Firth of Clyde came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop Alt Clut (&quot;Rock of the Clyde&quot;, the Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, which had become the metonym for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings Amlaíb and Ímar. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12miles (20km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of Govan and Partick (within present-day Glasgow), and became known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde, which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.

The land that now comprises most of the Scottish Lowlands had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England. The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the Kingdom of Alba, and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland. The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years.

==== Earldom of Orkney ====
By the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- &quot;Norðreyjar&quot;), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- &quot;Suðreyjar&quot;—this survives in the Diocese of Sodor and Man) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local Gaelic population (see Norse-Gaels) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local Jarls, originally captains of ships or &quot;hersirs&quot;. The Jarl of Orkney and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.

In 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. After organising a fleet, Harald was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.

==== Kings of the Isles ====

In 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by Ketil Flatnose to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of King Harald. His grandson, Thorstein the Red, and Sigurd the Mighty, Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.

The Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and Strathclyde. In 1095, the King of Mann and the Isles Godred Crovan was killed by Magnus Barelegs, King of Norway. Magnus and King Edgar of Scotland agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the &quot;Kingdom of Man and the Isles&quot;, but the Inner Hebrides came under the influence of Somerled, a Gaelic speaker, who was styled &#x27;King of the Hebrides&#x27;. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the Lordship of the Isles.

In eastern Aberdeenshire, the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near Cruden Bay.

The Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when Harald Maddadsson agreed to pay tribute to William the Lion, King of Scots, for his territories on the mainland.

The end of the Viking Age &quot;proper&quot; in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to Skye, arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of King Magnus of Man and King Dougal of the Hebrides. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at Largs, in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son Magnus the Law-Mender ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the Treaty of Perth.

Orkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King Christian I pledged them as security on the dowry of his daughter, who was betrothed to James III of Scotland. Although attempts were made during the 17th and 18th centuries to redeem Shetland, without success, and Charles II ratifying the pawning in the Orkney and Shetland Act 1669, explicitly exempting them from any &quot;dissolution of His Majesty&#x27;s lands&quot;, they are currently considered as being officially part of the United Kingdom.

=== Wales ===
Incursions in Wales were decisively reversed at the Battle of Buttington in Powys, in 893, when a combined Welsh and Mercian army under Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, defeated a Danish band.

Wales was not colonised by the Vikings as heavily as eastern England. The Vikings did, however, settle in the south around St. David&#x27;s, Haverfordwest, and Gower, among other places. Place names such as Skokholm, Skomer, and Swansea remain as evidence of the Norse settlement. The Vikings, however, did not subdue the Welsh mountain kingdoms.

=== Iceland ===
According to the Icelandic sagas, Iceland was discovered by Naddodd, a Viking from the Faroe Islands, after which it was settled by mostly Norwegians fleeing the oppressive rule of Harald Fairhair in . While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the Norse. According to the saga of Erik the Red, when Erik was exiled from Iceland, he sailed west and pioneered Greenland.

=== Kvenland ===

Kvenland, known as Cwenland, Kænland, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Scandinavia and Fennoscandia. A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an Old English account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named Ohthere. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from Nordic sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.

All the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of them—in part at least—are believed to be rewrites of older texts. Other references and possible references to Kvenland by other names or spellings are discussed in the main article of Kvenland.

=== Estonia ===


During the Viking Age, Estonia was a Finnic area divided between two major cultural regions, a coastal and an inland one, corresponding to the historical cultural and linguistic division between Northern and Southern Estonian. These two areas were further divided between loosely allied regions. The Viking Age in Estonia is considered to be part of the Iron Age period which started around and ended . Some 16th-century Swedish chronicles attribute the Pillage of Sigtuna in 1187 to Estonian raiders.

The society, economy, settlement and culture of the territory of what is in the present-day the country of Estonia is studied mainly through archaeological sources. The era is seen to have been a period of rapid change. The Estonian peasant culture came into existence by the end of the Viking Age. The overall understanding of the Viking Age in Estonia is deemed to be fragmentary and superficial, because of the limited amount of surviving source material. The main sources for understanding the period are remains of the farms and fortresses of the era, cemeteries and a large amount of excavated objects.

The landscape of Ancient Estonia featured numerous hillforts, some later hillforts on Saaremaa heavily fortified during the Viking Age and on to the 12th century. There were a number of late prehistoric or medieval harbour sites on the coast of Saaremaa, but none have been found that are large enough to be international trade centres. The Estonian islands also have a number of graves from the Viking Age, both individual and collective, with weapons and jewellery. Weapons found in Estonian Viking Age graves are common to types found throughout Northern Europe and Scandinavia.

=== Curonians ===

The Curonians were known as fierce warriors, excellent sailors and pirates. They were involved in several wars and alliances with Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic Vikings.

In , according to Norna-Gests þáttr saga from , Sigurd Hring (&quot;ring&quot;), a legendary king of Denmark and Sweden, fought against the invading Curonians and Kvens (Kvænir) in the southern part of what today is Sweden:

:&quot;Sigurd Ring (Sigurðr) was not there, since he had to defend his land, Sweden (Svíþjóð), since Curonians (Kúrir) and Kvænir were raiding there.&quot;

Curonians are mentioned among other participants of the Battle of Brávellir.

Grobin (Grobiņa) was the main centre of the Curonians during the Vendel Age. From the 10th to 13th century, Palanga served as an important economical, political and cultural centre for the Curonians. Chapter 46 of Egils Saga describes one Viking expedition by the Vikings Thorolf and Egill Skallagrímsson in Courland. According to some opinions, they took part in attacking Sweden&#x27;s main city Sigtuna in 1187. Curonians established temporary settlements near Riga and in overseas regions including eastern Sweden and the islands of Gotland and Bornholm.

Scandinavian settlements existed along the southeastern Baltic coast in Truso and Kaup (Old Prussia), Palanga (Samogitia, Lithuania) as well as Grobin (Courland, Latvia).

== Eastern Europe ==
The Varangians or &quot;Varyagi&quot; were Scandinavians, often Swedes, who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries. Engaging in trade, piracy, and mercenary activities, they roamed the river systems and portages of &quot;Gardariki&quot;, reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople.
Contemporary English publications also use the name &quot;Viking&quot; for early Varangians in some contexts.

The term &quot;Varangian&quot; remained in usage in the Byzantine Empire until the 13th century, largely disconnected from its Scandinavian roots by then. Having settled Aldeigja (Ladoga) in the 750s, Scandinavian colonists were probably an element in the early ethnogenesis of the Rus&#x27; people, and likely played a role in the formation of the Rus&#x27; Khaganate. The Varangians are first mentioned by the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in . It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay Danegeld in , and the Curonians of Grobin faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.
The text of the Primary Chronicle says that in 860–862, the Finnic and Slavic tribes rebelled against the Varangian Rus&#x27;, driving them back to Scandinavia, but soon started to conflict with each other. The disorder prompted the tribes to invite back the Varangian Rus&#x27; to &quot;Come and rule and reign over us&quot; and bring peace to the region. This was a somewhat bilateral relation with the Varangians defending the cities that they ruled. Led by Rurik and his brothers Truvor and Sineus, the Varangians settled around the town of Novgorod (Holmgarðr).

In the 9th century, the Rus&#x27; operated the Volga trade route, which connected northern Russia (&quot;Gardariki&quot;) with the Middle East (&quot;Serkland&quot;). As the Volga route declined by the end of the century, the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks rapidly overtook it in popularity. Apart from Ladoga and Novgorod, Gnezdovo and Gotland were major centres for Varangian trade.

The consensus among western scholars, disputed by Russian scholars, who believe them to be a Slavic tribe, is that the Rus&#x27; people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the 8th century, and that their name has the same origin as that of Roslagen in Sweden. The maritime districts of East Götland and Uppland were known in earlier times as Roþer or Roþin, and later as Roslagen. According to Thorsten Andersson, the Russian folk name &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27; ultimately derives from the noun roþer (&#x27;rowing&#x27;), a word also used in naval campaigns in the leþunger (Old Norse: &quot;leiðangr&quot;) system of organizing a coastal fleet. The Old Swedish place name Roþrin, in the older iteration &quot;Roþer&quot;, contains the word &quot;roþer&quot; and is still used in the form of Roden as a historical name for the coastal areas of Svealand. In modern times the name still exists as Roslagen, the name of the coastal area of Uppland province. According to Stefan Brink, the name &quot;Rus&quot;″ derives from the words &quot;ro&quot; (row) and &quot;rodd&quot; (a rowing session).

The term &quot;Varangian&quot; became more common from the 11th century onwards. In these years, Swedish men left to enlist in the Byzantine Varangian Guard in such numbers that a medieval Swedish law, Västgötalagen, used in the province Västergötland, declared that no one could inherit while staying in &quot;Greece&quot;—the then Scandinavian term for the Byzantine Empire—to stop the emigration, especially as two other European courts simultaneously also recruited Scandinavians: Kievan Rus&#x27; and London 1018–1066 (the Þingalið).

In contrast to the notable Scandinavian influence in Normandy and the British Isles, Varangian culture did not survive to a great extent in the East. Instead, the Varangian ruling classes of the two powerful city-states of Novgorod and Kiev were thoroughly Slavicised by the beginning of the 11th century. Some evidence suggests that Old Norse may have been spoken amongst the Rus&#x27; later, however. Old East Norse was probably still spoken in Kievan Rus&#x27; at Novgorod until the 13th century, according to the &quot;Nationalencyklopedin&quot; (Swedish National Encyclopedia).

== Central Europe ==

Viking Age Scandinavian settlements were set up along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, primarily for trade purposes. Their emergence appears to coincide with the settlement and consolidation of the coastal Slavic tribes in the respective areas. The archaeological record indicates that substantial cultural exchange between Scandinavian and Slavic traditions and technologies occurred. It is known that Slavic and Scandinavian craftsmen had different processes in crafts and productions. In the lagoons and delta of the eastern and southern Baltic there is evidence of Slavic boatbuilding practices somewhat divergent from the Viking tradition, and of a fusion of the two in a shipyard site from the Viking Age on the island of Falster in Denmark.

Slavic-Scandinavian settlements on the Mecklenburgian coast include the maritime trading center Reric (Groß Strömkendorf) on the eastern coast of Wismar Bay, and the multi-ethnic trade emporium Dierkow (near Rostock). Reric was set up around the year 700, but following later warfare between Obodrites and Danes, the inhabitants, who were subject to the Danish king, were resettled to Haithabu by him. Dierkow apparently belongs to the late 8th to the early 9th century.

Scandinavian settlements on the Pomeranian coast include Wolin (on the isle of Wolin), Ralswiek (on the isle of Rügen), Altes Lager Menzlin (on the lower Peene river), and Bardy-Świelubie near modern Kołobrzeg. Menzlin was set up in the mid-8th century. Wolin and Ralswiek began to prosper in the course of the 9th century. A merchants&#x27; settlement has also been suggested near Arkona, but no archeological evidence supports this theory. Menzlin and Bardy-Świelubie were vacated in the late 9th century, Ralswiek survived into the new millennium, but by the time written chronicles reported news of the island of Rügen in the 12th century, it had lost all its importance. Wolin, thought to be identical with the legendary Vineta and the semilegendary Jomsborg, base of the Jomsvikings, was destroyed in 1043 by Dano-Norwegian king Magnus the Good, according to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. Castle building by the Slavs seems to have reached a high level on the southern Baltic coast in the 8th and 9th centuries, possibly explained by a threat coming from the sea or from the trade emporiums, as Scandinavian arrowheads found in the area indicate advances penetrating as far as the lake chains in the Mecklenburgian and Pomeranian hinterlands.

== Western Europe ==
=== Frisia ===
Frisia was a region which spanned from around modern-day Bruges to the islands on the west coast of Jutland—including large parts of the Low Countries. This region was progressively brought under Frankish control (Frisian-Frankish wars), but the Christianization of the local population and cultural assimilation was a slow process. However, several Frisian towns, most notably Dorestad were raided by Vikings. Rorik of Dorestad was a famous Viking raider in Frisia. On Wieringen the Vikings most likely had a base of operations. Viking leaders took an active role in Frisian politics, such as Godfrid, Duke of Frisia, as well as Rorik.

=== France ===
The French region of Normandy takes its name from the Viking invaders who were called &quot;Normanni&quot;, which means &#x27;men of the North&#x27;.

The first Viking raids began between 790 and 800 along the coasts of western France. They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to Francia during the reign of Louis the Pious (814–840). But the Vikings took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of Louis the Pious to settle their first colony in the south-west (Gascony) of the kingdom of Francia, which was more or less abandoned by the Frankish kings after their two defeats at Roncevaux. The incursions in caused severe damage to Rouen and Jumièges. The Viking attackers sought to capture the treasures stored at monasteries, easy prey given the monks&#x27; lack of defensive capacity. In an expedition up the Seine reached Paris. The presence of Carolingian &quot;deniers&quot; of , found in 1871 among a hoard at Mullaghboden, County Limerick, where coins were neither minted nor normally used in trade, probably represents booty from the raids of 843–846.

However, from 885 to 886, Odo of Paris (Eudes de Paris) succeeded in defending Paris against Viking raiders. His military success allowed him to replace the Carolingians. In 911, a band of Viking warriors attempted to siege Chartres but was defeated by Robert I of France. Robert&#x27;s victory later paved way for the baptism, and settlement in Normandy, of Viking leader Rollo. Rollo reached an agreement with Charles the Simple to sign the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, under which Charles gave Rouen and the area of present-day Upper Normandy to Rollo, establishing the Duchy of Normandy. In exchange, Rollo pledged vassalage to Charles in 940, agreed to be baptised, and vowed to guard the estuaries of the Seine from further Viking attacks. During Rollo&#x27;s baptism Robert I of France stood as his godfather. The Duchy of Normandy also annexed further areas in Northern France, expanding the territory which was originally negotiated.

The Scandinavian expansion included Danish and Norwegian as well as Swedish elements, all under the leadership of Rollo. By the end of the reign of Richard I of Normandy in 996 (aka Richard the Fearless / Richard sans Peur), all descendants of Vikings became, according to Cambridge Medieval History (Volume 5, Chapter XV), &#x27;not only Christians but in all essentials Frenchmen&#x27;. During the Middle Ages, the Normans created one of the most powerful feudal states of Western Europe. The Normans conquered England and southern Italy in 11th century, and played a key role in the Crusades.

== Southern Europe ==

=== Italy ===
In 860, according to an account by the Norman monk Dudo of Saint-Quentin, a Viking fleet, probably under Björn Ironside and Hastein, landed at the Ligurian port of Luni and sacked the city. The Vikings then moved another 60 miles down the Tuscan coast to the mouth of the Arno, sacking Pisa and then, following the river upstream, also the hill-town of Fiesole above Florence, among other victories around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and Nekor (Morocco), North Africa).

Many Anglo-Danish and Varangian mercenaries fought in Southern Italy, including Harald Hardrada and William de Hauteville who conquered parts of Sicily between 1038 and 1040, and Edgar the Ætheling who fought in the Norman conquest of southern Italy. Runestones were raised in Sweden in memory of warriors who died in Langbarðaland (Land of the Lombards), the Old Norse name for southern Italy.

Several Anglo-Danish and Norwegian nobles participated in the Norman conquest of southern Italy, like Edgar the Ætheling, who left England in 1086, and Jarl Erling Skakke, who won his nickname &quot;(&quot;Skakke&quot;, meaning bent head)&quot; after a battle against Arabs in Sicily. On the other hand, many Anglo-Danish rebels fleeing William the Conqueror, joined the Byzantines in their struggle against the Robert Guiscard, duke of Apulia, in Southern Italy.

=== Spain ===

After 842, the Vikings set up a permanent base at the mouth of the river Loire from whence they could strike as far as northern Spain. These Vikings were Hispanicised in all the Christian kingdoms, while they kept their ethnic identity and culture in al-Andalus.

The southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, and much of the Iberian peninsula were under Muslim rule when Vikings first entered the Mediterranean in the 9th century. The Vikings launched their campaigns from their strongholds in Francia into this realm of Muslim influence; following the coastline of the Kingdom of Asturias they sailed through the Gibraltar strait (known to them as &quot;Nǫrvasund&quot;, the &#x27;Narrow Sound&#x27;) into what they called &quot;Miðjarðarhaf&quot;, literally &#x27;Middle of the earth&#x27; sea, with the same meaning as the Late Latin &quot;Mare Mediterrāneum&quot;.

The first Viking attacks in al-Andalus in AD 844 greatly affected the region. Medieval texts such as the &quot;Chronicon albeldense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; tell of a Viking fleet that left Toulouse and made raids in Asturias and Galicia. According to the &quot;Historia silense&quot; it had 60 ships. Being repulsed in Galicia (&quot;Ghilīsīa&quot;), the fleet sailed southward around the peninsula, raiding coastal towns along the way.

In Irene García Losquiño&#x27;s telling, these Vikings navigated their boats up the river Guadalquivir towards &quot;Išbīliya&quot; (Seville) and destroyed &quot;Qawra&quot; (Coria del Río), a small town about 15 km south of the city. Then they took &quot;Išbīliya&quot;, from which they controlled the region for several weeks. Their attack on the city forced its inhabitants to flee to &quot;Qarmūnâ&quot; (Carmona), a fortified city. The Emirate of Qurṭuba made great exertions to recover &quot;Išbīliya&quot;, and succeeded with the assistance of &quot;Qurṭuba&quot; (Córdoba) and the Banu Qasi, who ruled over a semi-autonomous state in the Upper March of the Ebro Valley. Consequently, defensive walls were built at &quot;Išbīliya&quot;, and the emir Abd al-Raḥmān II invested in the construction of a large fleet of ships to protect the entrance of the Guadalquivir and the coast of southern al-Andalus, after which Viking fleets had difficulties battling the Andalusī armada.

Gwyn Jones writes that this Viking raid had occurred on 1 October 844, when most of the Iberian peninsula was controlled by the emirate. His account says a flotilla of about 80 Viking ships, after attacking Asturias, Galicia and Lisbon, had ascended the Guadalquivir to &quot;Išbīliya&quot;, and besieged it for seven days, inflicting many casualties and taking numerous hostages with the intent to ransom them. Another group of Vikings had gone to &quot;Qādis&quot; (Cádiz) to plunder while those in &quot;Išbīliya&quot; waited on &quot;Qubtil&quot; (&quot;Isla Menor&quot;), an island in the river, for the ransom money to arrive. Meantime, the emir of Qurṭuba, Abd ar-Rahman II, prepared a military contingent to meet them, and on 11 November a pitched battle ensued on the grounds of &quot;Talayata&quot; (Tablada). The Vikings held their ground, but the results were catastrophic for the invaders, who suffered a thousand casualties; four hundred were captured and executed, some thirty ships were destroyed. It was not a total victory for the emir&#x27;s forces, but the Viking survivors had to negotiate a peace to leave the area, surrendering their plunder and the hostages they had taken to sell as slaves, in exchange for food and clothing. According to the Arabist Lévi-Provençal, over time, the few Norse survivors converted to Islam and settled as farmers in the area of &quot;Qawra&quot;, &quot;Qarmūnâ&quot;, and &quot;Moron&quot;, where they engaged in animal husbandry and made dairy products (reputedly the origin of Sevillian cheese). Knutson and Caitlin write that Lévi-Provençal offered no sources for the proposition of conversion to Islam by northern Europeans in al-Andalus and thus it &quot;remains unsubstantiated&quot;.

By the year 859 a large Viking force again invaded al-Andalus, beginning a campaign along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula with smaller groups that assaulted various locations. They attacked Išbīliya (Seville), but were driven off and they returned down the Guadalquivir to the Strait of Gibraltar. The Vikings then sailed round Cape Gata and followed the coastline to the &quot;Kūra&quot; (cora) of Tudmir, raiding various settlements, as mentioned by the 10th-century historian Ibn Hayyān. They finally ventured inland, entering the mouth of the river Segura and sailing towards &quot;ḥiṣn Ūriyūla&quot; (Orihuela), whose inhabitants had fled. The assailants sacked this important town, and according to the Arab sources, they attacked the fortress and burnt it to the ground. There is only brief mention in the historical record of this Viking army&#x27;s attacks on south-eastern al-Andalus, including at &quot;al-Jazīra al-Khadrā&quot; (Algeciras), &quot;Ūriyūla&quot;, and the &quot;Juzur al-Balyār&quot; (جزُر البليار) (Balearic Islands).

Ibn Hayyān wrote about the Viking campaign of 859–861 in al-Andalus, perhaps relying on the account given by Muslim historian Aḥmad al-Rāzī, who tells of a Viking fleet of sixty-two ships that sailed up to Išbīliya and occupied &quot;al-Jazīra al-Khadrā&quot;. The Muslims seized two of their ships, laden with goods and coins, off the coast of &quot;Shidūnah&quot; (Sidonia). The ships were destroyed and their Viking crews killed. The remaining vessels continued up the Atlantic coast and landed near (Pampeluna), called &quot;Banbalūna&quot; in Arabic, where they took their emir Gharsīa ibn Wanaqu (García Iñiquez) prisoner until in 861 he was ransomed for 70,000 dinars.

According to the Annales Bertiniani, Danish Vikings embarked on a long voyage in 859, sailing eastward through the Strait of Gibraltar then up the river Rhône, where they raided monasteries and towns and established a base in the Camargue. Afterwards they raided Nakūr in what is now Morocco, kidnapped women of the royal family, and returned them when the emir of Córdoba paid their ransoms.

The Vikings made several incursions in the years 859, 966 and 971, with intentions more diplomatic than bellicose, although an invasion in 971 was repelled when the Viking fleet was totally annihilated. Vikings attacked Talayata again in 889 at the instigation of Kurayb ibn Khaldun of Išbīliya. In 1015, a Viking fleet entered the river Minho and sacked the episcopal city of Tui Galicia; no new bishop was appointed until 1070.

=== Portugal ===
In 844, a fleet of several dozen Viking longships with square brown sails appeared in the &quot;Mar da Palha&quot; (&quot;Sea of Straw&quot;), i.e., the mouth of the river Tagus. At the time, the city later called Lisbon was under Muslim rule and known in Arabic as &quot;al-Us̲h̲būna&quot; or &quot;al-ʾIšbūnah&quot; (الأشبونة). After a thirteen-day siege in which they plundered the surrounding countryside, the Vikings conquered &quot;al-Us̲h̲būna&quot;, but eventually retreated in the face of continued resistance by the townspeople led by their governor, Wahb Allah ibn Hazm.

The chronicler Ibn Hayyān, who wrote the most reliable early history of al-Andalus, in his &quot;Kitāb almuqtabis&quot;, quoted the Muslim historian Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Rāzī:

== North America ==
=== Greenland ===

The Viking-Age settlements in Greenland were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast. They settled in three separate areas along roughly of the western coast. While harsh, the microclimates along some fjords allowed for a pastoral lifestyle similar to that of Iceland, until the climate changed for the worse with the Little Ice Age .
* The Eastern Settlement: The remains of about 450 farms have been found here. Erik the Red settled at Brattahlid on Ericsfjord.
* The Middle Settlement, near modern Ivigtut, consisted of about 20 farms.
* The Western Settlement at modern Godthåbsfjord, was established before the 12th century. It has been extensively excavated by archaeologists.

=== Mainland North America ===

In about 986, the Norwegian Vikings Bjarni Herjólfsson, Leif Ericson, and Þórfinnr Karlsefni from Greenland reached Mainland North America, over 500 years before Christopher Columbus, and they attempted to settle the land they called Vinland. They created a small settlement on the northern peninsula of present-day Newfoundland, near L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows. Conflict with indigenous peoples and lack of support from Greenland brought the Vinland colony to an end within a few years. The archaeological remains are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Technology ==

The Vikings were among the most advanced of all societies of the time in their naval technology, and were noted in other technological works as well. The Vikings were equipped with the technologically superior longships; for purposes of conducting trade however, another type of ship, the &quot;knarr&quot;, wider and deeper in draft, were customarily used. The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.

The Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships&#x27; negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. &quot;Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.&quot; The ships&#x27; speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of . The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.

While battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.

Together with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of &quot;leidang&quot;—a fleet mobilisation system, where every &quot;skipreide&quot; (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew—was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish–Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, perhaps in response to the longships, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements—e.g., with the Hanseatic League.

The Vikings were also said to have fine weapons. Generally, Vikings used axes as weapons due to the lessened amount of iron required for their creations; swords were typically seen as a mark of wealth. Spears were also a common weapon among Vikings. Great amounts of time and artistry were expended in the creation of Viking weapons; ornamentation is commonly seen among them. Scandinavian architecture during the Viking Age most often involved wood, due to the abundance of the material. Longhouses, a form of home, often featuring ornamentation, are commonly seen as the defining building of the Viking Age.

Exactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. A study published by the Royal Society in its journal, &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences&quot;, suggests that the Vikings made use of an optical compass as a navigation aid, using the light-splitting and polarisation-filtering properties of Iceland spar to find the location of the sun when it was not directly visible. While some evidence points to such use of calcite &quot;sunstones&quot; to find the sun&#x27;s location, modern reproductions of Viking &quot;sky-polarimetric&quot; navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.

The archaeological find known as the Visby lenses from the Swedish island of Gotland may be components of a telescope. It appears to date from long before the invention of the telescope in the 17th century.

== Religion ==
For most of the Viking Age, Scandinavian society generally followed Norse paganism. The traditions of this faith, including Valhalla and the Æsir, are sometimes cited as a factor in the creation of Viking warrior culture. However, Scandinavia was eventually Christianised towards the later Viking Age, with early centres of Christianity especially in Denmark.

== Trade ==
Some of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period include both existing and former cities such as Aarhus (Denmark), Ribe (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), Bjørgvin (Norway), Kaupang (Norway), Skiringssal (Norway), Birka (Sweden), Bordeaux (France), York (England), Dublin (Ireland) and Aldeigjuborg (Russia).

As Viking ships carried cargo and trade goods throughout the Baltic area and beyond, their active trading centres grew into thriving towns. One important centre of trade was at Hedeby. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. York was the centre of the kingdom of Jórvík from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand, and a cowry shell from the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond Byzantium. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the Varangians travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the Caspian Sea.

Viking trade routes extended far beyond Scandinavia. As Scandinavian ships penetrated southward on the rivers of Eastern Europe to acquire financial capital, they encountered the nomad peoples of the steppes, leading to the beginning of a trading system that connected Russia and Scandinavia with the northern routes of the Eurasian Silk Road network. During the Middle Ages, the Volga trade route connected Northern Europe and Northwestern Russia with the Caspian Sea, via the Volga River. The international trade routes that enabled the passage of goods by ship from Scandinavia to the east were mentioned in early medieval literature as the &quot;Austrrvegr&quot; passing through the eastern Baltic region. Ships headed to the river Volga sailed through the Gulf of Finland, while those destined for Byzantium might take one of several routes through present-day north-eastern Poland or the Baltic lands.

The Vikings catered to the demand for slaves in the southern slave markets in the Orthodox Eastern Roman Empire and the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate, both of whom desired slaves of a religion different from their own. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks connected Scandinavia, Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Rus&#x27; were of note as merchants who supplied honey, wax, and slaves to Constantinople. The Varangians served as mercenaries of Russian princes, then of the Swedish princes who founded and ruled Norse kingdoms in Eastern Europe such as at Kiev and Novgorod.

== Culture ==
The Viking Age saw many of the earliest Scandinavian cultural developments. The traditional Icelandic Sagas, still often read today, are seen as characteristic literary works of Northern Europe. Old English works such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, written in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend, show Viking influences; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, this influence is seen in the language and setting of the poem. Another example of Viking Age cultural influence is the Old Norse influence in the English language; this influence is primarily a legacy of the various Viking invasions of England.

=== Women in Viking society ===
According to archaeologist Liv Helga Dommasnes writing in 1998, although archaeological sources pertinent to the study of women&#x27;s roles in Scandinavia were most plentiful from the Viking Age compared to other historical eras, not many archaeologists took advantage of the opportunities they represented. She alludes to the fact that the picture commonly presented of Viking society during the Viking Age was of a society of men engaged in their various occupations or positions, with scant mention of the women and children who were also part of it.

In her reckoning, given this basic flaw in the modern image of Viking society, how knowledge of the past is organised must be considered. Accordingly, language is an essential part of this organisation of knowledge, and the concepts of modern languages are tools for understanding the realities of the past and for organising that knowledge, even though they are artefacts of our own time and perceived reality. Written sources, although scarce, appear to have been prioritised, even though it is understood that these written sources are biased. Almost all of them originate from other cultures, as literature from Viking societies is sparse. Since it unambiguously transmits meaning in literary terms, it is fairly clear that this meaning is not derived from the ideology of Viking Age people, but rather from that of early northern Christianity. Medieval studies scholar Gro Steinsland argues that the transformation from heathen to Christian religion in Viking society was a &quot;radical break&quot; rather than a gradual transition, and Dommasnes says this should have bearing on consideration of the transformation of late Viking Age traditions before they were recorded in 12th- or 13th-century literature. By this reasoning, changing cultural values necessarily greatly affected perceptions of women particularly and of gender roles generally.

Judith Jesch, professor of Viking Age studies at the University of Nottingham, suggests in her &quot;Women in the Viking Age&quot; that &quot;If historians&#x27; emphasis on vikings as warriors made invisible the women in the background, then it is not always clear where the more visible female counterparts of the new urban vikings have come from.&quot; She says it is impossible to study the Vikings without a conception of the entire historical period they lived in, of the culture that produced them, and of other cultures they influenced. By her lights, not accounting for the doings of half the population would be ludicrous.

Published in 1991, &quot;Women in the Viking Age&quot; develops Jesch&#x27;s thesis that the texts of the Icelandic sagas (&quot;Íslendingasögur&quot;) are recordings of mythological narratives preserved in the forms in which they were written by 13th-century antiquaries in Iceland. They cannot be interpreted literally as the &quot;authentic voice of Vikings&quot;, embodying as they do the preconceptions of those medieval Icelanders. These sagas, formerly believed to have been based on actual historical traditions, are now commonly regarded as imaginative creations. With their origins in oral traditions, there is little confidence in them as historical truth, but they express what they tell more directly than &quot;the dry bones of archaeology&quot; or the brief messages on runestones. The modern view of the Viking Age is completely entwined with knowledge imparted by the sagas, and they are the main source of a broadly held belief that women in the Viking Age were independent, assertive, and had agency.

Jesch describes the content of runic inscriptions as connecting people who live in modern times with women of the Viking Age similarly to archaeological evidence, often telling more about the lives of women than the material remains revealed in archaeological excavations. She considers these inscriptions as contemporary evidence originating within the culture instead of from the incomplete or prejudiced viewpoint of the cultural outsider, and sees most of them as narratives in a narrow sense that supply details illuminating the overall picture derived from archaeological sources. They allow actual persons to be identified and reveal information about them such as their family relationships, their names, and perhaps facts concerning their individual lives.

Birgit Sawyer says her book &quot;The Viking-age Rune-stones&quot; aims to show that the corpus of runestones considered as a whole is a fruitful source of knowledge about the religious, political, social, and economic history of Scandinavia in the 10th and 11th centuries. Using data from her database she finds that runestones cast light on settlement patterns, communications, kinship and naming customs, and the evolution of language and poetry. Systematically researching the material leads to her hypothesis that runic inscriptions mirrored inheritance customs entailing not only lands or goods, but also rights, obligations, and rank in society. Although women in Viking society, like men, had tombstones over their graves, runestones were raised primarily to memorialise men, with the lives of few women being commemorated by runestones (Sawyer says only 7 per cent), and half of those were with men. Because there was a much larger per centage of women&#x27;s graves with rich appointments in the Iron Age, the comparatively smaller number of runestones memorialising women indicates that the trend reflects changes in burial customs and religion only in part. Most of those honoured with runestones were men, and the emphasis was on those who sponsored the monuments. Typical medieval grave monuments name only the deceased, but Viking Age runestones prioritise the sponsors, first and foremost; therefore, they &quot;are monuments to the &quot;living&quot; as much as to the &quot;dead&quot;&quot;.

=== Language ===
The 12th-century Icelandic &quot;Gray Goose Laws&quot; () state that Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, (&quot;Danish tongue&quot;; speakers of Old East Norse would have said &quot;&quot;). Another term was (&quot;northern speech&quot;). Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages: Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, and other North Germanic varieties of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable mutual intelligibility while Icelandic remains the closest to Old Norse. In present-day Iceland schoolchildren are able to read the 12th-century Icelandic sagas in the original language (in editions with normalised spelling).

Written sources of Old Norse from the Viking Age are rare: there are rune stones, but the inscriptions are mostly short. A good deal of the vocabulary, morphology, and phonology of the runic inscriptions (little is known definitely about their syntax) &quot;can be shown to develop regularly into Viking-Age, medieval and modern Scandinavian reflexes&quot;, says Michael Barnes.

According to David Arter, Old Norse was for a while during the Viking Age a &quot;lingua franca&quot; spoken not just in Scandinavia but also in the courts of the Scandinavian rulers in Ireland, Scotland, England, France and Russia. The Norse origin of some words used today is obvious, as in the word &quot;haar&quot; referring to the cold sea mist on the east coast of Scotland and England; it derives from the Old Norse &quot;haárr&quot;.

=== Old Norse influence on other languages ===
The long-term linguistic effects of the Viking settlements in England were threefold: over a thousand Old Norse words eventually became part of Standard English; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin. Scandinavian words that entered the English language included &quot;landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting&quot;, and &quot;steersman&quot;. The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used &quot;sk-&quot; sounds, such as &quot;skirt, sky,&quot; and &quot;skin&quot;; other words appearing in written sources at this time included &quot;again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak&quot; and &quot;window&quot; from Old Norse meaning &quot;wind-eye&quot;. Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as &quot;to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get&quot; and &quot;give&quot;. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with &quot;they, them&quot; and &quot;their&quot; replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb &quot;to be&quot;; the replacement of &quot;sindon&quot; by &quot;are&quot; is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending &quot;-s&quot; in the present tense of verbs.

There are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the &quot;Danelaw&quot;): over 600 end in &quot;-by&quot;, the Scandinavian word for &quot;village&quot;—for example &quot;Grimsby, Naseby&quot;, and &quot;Whitby&quot;; many others end in &quot;-thorpe&quot; (&quot;farm&quot;), &quot;-thwaite&quot; (&quot;clearing&quot;), and &quot;-toft&quot; (&quot;homestead&quot;).

According to an analysis of names ending in &quot;-son&quot;, the distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement. Early medieval records indicate that over 60% of personal names in Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire showed Scandinavian influence.

==Genetics==
A genetic study published at bioRxiv in July 2019 and in &quot;Nature&quot; in September 2020 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. The remains of four hundred forty-two ancient humans from across Europe and the North Atlantic were surveyed, stretching from the Bronze Age to the early modern period. In terms of Y-DNA composition, Viking individuals were similar to present-day Scandinavians. The most common Y-DNA haplogroup in the study was I1 (95 samples), R1b (84 samples) and R1a, especially (but not exclusively) of the Scandinavian R1a-Z284 subclade (61 samples). It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered Denmark and eastern Sweden, from which it spread into the rest of Scandinavia. The Y-DNA of Viking Age samples suggests that this may partly have been descendants of the Germanic tribes from the Migration Period returning to Scandinavia. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as Öland and Gotland. These islands were probably important trade settlements. Consistent with historical records, the study found evidence of a major influx of Danish Viking ancestry into England, a Swedish influx into Estonia and Finland; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and Greenland during the Viking Age. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times with, e.g., the contemporary population of the United Kingdom having up to 6% Viking DNA. The study also showed that some local people of Scotland were buried as Vikings and may have taken on Viking identities.

Margaryan et al. 2020 examined the skeletal remains of 42 individuals from the Salme ship burials in Estonia. The skeletal remains belonged to warriors killed in battle who were later buried together with numerous valuable weapons and armour. DNA testing and isotope analysis revealed that the men came from central Sweden.

Margaryan et al. 2020 examined an elite warrior burial from Bodzia (Poland) dated to 1010–1020. The cemetery in Bodzia is exceptional in terms of Scandinavian and Kievian Rus links. The Bodzia man (sample VK157, or burial E864/I) was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue, but he belonged to the princely family himself. His burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery; moreover, strontium analysis of his teeth enamel shows he was not local. It is assumed that he came to Poland with the Prince of Kiev, Sviatopolk the Accursed, and met a violent death in combat. This corresponds to the events of 1018 when Sviatopolk himself disappeared after having retreated from Kiev to Poland. It cannot be excluded that the Bodzia man was Sviatopolk himself, as the genealogy of the Rurikids at this period is extremely dubious, and the dates of birth of many princes of this dynasty may be quite approximative. The Bodzia man carried haplogroup I1-S2077 and had both Scandinavian ancestry and Russian admixture.

The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.

<doc id="32541" wikidata="Q182338" url="?curid=32541" title="Vitamin K">
<text>Vitamin K is a family of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamers found in foods and marketed as dietary supplements. The human body requires vitamin K for post-synthesis modification of certain proteins that are required for blood coagulation (&quot;K&quot; from Danish &quot;koagulation&quot;, for &quot;coagulation&quot;) or for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues. The complete synthesis involves final modification of these &quot;Gla proteins&quot; by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that uses vitamin K as a cofactor.

Vitamin K is used in the liver as the intermediate VKH2 to deprotonate a glutamate residue and then is reprocessed into vitamin K through a vitamin K oxide intermediate. The presence of uncarboxylated proteins indicates a vitamin K deficiency. Carboxylation allows them to bind (chelate) calcium ions, which they cannot do otherwise. Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Research suggests that deficiency of vitamin K may also weaken bones, potentially contributing to osteoporosis, and may promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues.

Chemically, the vitamin K family comprises 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives. Vitamin K includes two natural vitamers: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone). Vitamin K2, in turn, consists of a number of related chemical subtypes, with differing lengths of carbon side chains made of isoprenoid groups of atoms. The two most studied are menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and menaquinone-7 (MK-7).

Vitamin K1 is made by plants, and is found in highest amounts in green leafy vegetables, being directly involved in photosynthesis. It is active as a vitamin in animals and performs the classic functions of vitamin K, including its activity in the production of blood-clotting proteins. Animals may also convert it to vitamin K2, variant MK-4. Bacteria in the gut flora can also convert K1 into K2. All forms of K2 other than MK-4 can only be produced by bacteria, which use these during anaerobic respiration. Vitamin K3 (menadione), a synthetic form of vitamin K, was used to treat vitamin K deficiency, but because it interferes with the function of glutathione, it is no longer used in this manner in human nutrition.

==Definition==
Vitamin K refers to structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamers found in foods and marketed as dietary supplements. &quot;Vitamin K&quot; include several chemical compounds. These are similar in structure in that they share a quinone ring, but differ in the length and degree of saturation of the carbon tail and the number of repeating isoprene units in the side chain (see figures in Chemistry section). Plant-sourced forms are primarily vitamin K1. Animal-sourced foods are primarily vitamin K2. Vitamin K has several roles: an essential nutrient absorbed from food, a product synthesized and marketed as part of a multi-vitamin or as a single-vitamin dietary supplement, and a prescription medication for specific purposes.

==Dietary recommendations==
The US National Academy of Medicine does not distinguish between K1 and K2 – both are counted as vitamin K. When recommendations were last updated in 1998, sufficient information was not available to establish an estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance, terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as these, the academy defines adequate intakes (AIs) as amounts that appear to be sufficient to maintain good health, with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AIs for adult women and men ages 19 and older are 90 and 120 μg/day, respectively, for pregnancy is 90 μg/day, and for lactation is 90 μg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 2.0–2.5 μg/day; for children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 30 to 75 μg/day. As for safety, the academy sets tolerable upper intake levels (known as &quot;upper limits&quot;) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. Vitamin K has no upper limit, as human data for adverse effects from high doses are not sufficient.

In the European Union, adequate intake is defined the same way as in the US. For women and men over age 18 the adequate intake is set at 70 μg/day, for pregnancy 70 μg/day, and for lactation 70 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, adequate intake values increase with age from 12 to 65 μg/day. Japan set adequate intakes for adult women at 65 μg/day and for men at 75 μg/day. The European Union and Japan also reviewed safety and concluded – as had the United States – that there was insufficient evidence to set an upper limit for vitamin K.

For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percentage of daily value. For vitamin K labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 80 μg, but on 27 May 2016 it was revised upwards to 120 μg, to bring it into agreement with the highest value for adequate intake. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by 1 January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by 1 January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

===Fortification===
According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, vitamin K deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. The World Health Organization does not have recommendations on vitamin K fortification.

== Sources ==
Vitamin K1 is primarily from plants, especially leafy green vegetables. Small amounts are provided by animal-sourced foods. Vitamin K2 is primarily from animal-sourced foods, with poultry and eggs much better sources than beef, pork or fish. One exception to the latter is &quot;nattō&quot;, which is made from bacteria-fermented soybeans. It is a rich food source of vitamin K2 variant MK-7, made by the bacteria.

=== Vitamin K1 ===


=== Vitamin K2 ===

Animal-sourced foods are a source of vitamin K2. The MK-4 form is from conversion of plant-sourced vitamin K1 in various tissues in the body.



==Vitamin K deficiency==
Because vitamin K aids mechanisms for blood clotting, its deficiency may lead to reduced blood clotting, and in severe cases, can result in reduced clotting, increased bleeding, and increased prothrombin time.

Normal diets are usually not deficient in vitamin K, indicating that deficiency is uncommon in healthy children and adults. An exception may be infants who are at an increased risk of deficiency regardless of the vitamin status of the mother during pregnancy and breast feeding due to poor transfer of the vitamin to the placenta and low amounts of the vitamin in breast milk.

Secondary deficiencies can occur in people who consume adequate amounts, but have malabsorption conditions, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic pancreatitis, and in people who have liver damage or disease. Secondary vitamin K deficiency can also occur in people who have a prescription for a vitamin K antagonist drug, such as warfarin. A drug associated with increased risk of vitamin K deficiency is cefamandole, although the mechanism is unknown.

== Medical uses ==
=== Treating vitamin deficiency in newborns ===
Vitamin K is given as an injection to newborns to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding. The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; this appears to be a consequence of poor transfer of the vitamin across the placenta, and thus low fetal plasma vitamin K. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant&#x27;s life is estimated at between 1 in 60 and 1 in 250. 

Human milk contains 0.85–9.2 μg/L (median 2.5 μg/L) of vitamin K1, while infant formula is formulated in range of 24–175 μg/L. Late onset bleeding, with onset 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be a consequence of exclusive breastfeeding, especially if there was no preventive treatment. Late onset prevalence reported at 35 cases per 100,000 live births in infants who had not received prophylaxis at or shortly after birth. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding occurs more frequently in the Asian population compared to the Caucasian population.

Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, brain damage, and death. Intramuscular injection, typically given shortly after birth, is more effective in preventing vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration, which calls for weekly dosing up to three months of age.

===Managing warfarin therapy===

Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug. It functions by inhibiting an enzyme that is responsible for recycling vitamin K to a functional state. As a consequence, proteins that should be modified by vitamin K are not, including proteins essential to blood clotting, and are thus not functional. The purpose of the drug is to reduce risk of inappropriate blood clotting, which can have serious, potentially fatal consequences. The proper anticoagulant action of warfarin is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose. Due to differing absorption of the drug and amounts of vitamin K in the diet, dosing must be monitored and customized for each patient. Some foods are so high in vitamin K1 that medical advice is to avoid those (examples: collard greens, spinach, turnip greens) entirely, and for foods with a modestly high vitamin content, keep consumption as consistent as possible, so that the combination of vitamin intake and warfarin keep the anti-clotting activity in the therapeutic range.

Vitamin K is a treatment for bleeding events caused by overdose of the drug. The vitamin can be administered by mouth, intravenously or subcutaneously. Oral vitamin K is used in situations when a person&#x27;s International normalized ratio is greater than 10 but there is no active bleeding. The newer anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are not vitamin K antagonists.

===Treating rodenticide poisoning===
Coumarin is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor reagent in the synthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals. One subset, 4-hydroxycoumarins, act as vitamin K antagonists. They block the regeneration and recycling of vitamin K. Some of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant class of chemicals are designed to have high potency and long residence times in the body, and these are used specifically as second generation rodenticides (&quot;rat poison&quot;). Death occurs after a period of several days to two weeks, usually from internal hemorrhaging. For humans, and for animals that have consumed either the rodenticide or rats poisoned by the rodenticide, treatment is prolonged administration of large amounts of vitamin K. This dosing must sometimes be continued for up to nine months in cases of poisoning by &quot;superwarfarin&quot; rodenticides such as brodifacoum. Oral vitamin K1 is preferred over other vitamin K1 routes of administration because it has fewer side effects.

=== Methods of assessment ===
An increase in prothrombin time, a coagulation assay, has been used as an indicator of vitamin K status, but it lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity for this application. Serum phylloquinone is the most commonly used marker of vitamin K status. Concentrations &lt;0.15 μg/L are indicative of deficiency. Disadvantages include exclusion of the other vitamin K vitamers and interference from recent dietary intake. Vitamin K is required for the gamma-carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues within the Gla domain of the 17 vitamin K–dependent proteins. Thus, a rise in uncarboxylated versions of these proteins is an indirect but sensitive and specific marker for vitamin K deficiency. If uncarboxylated prothrombin is being measured, this &quot;Protein induced by Vitamin K Absence/antagonism (PIVKA-II)&quot; is elevated in vitamin K deficiency. 

The test is used to assess risk of vitamin K–deficient bleeding in newborn infants. Osteocalcin is involved in calcification of bone tissue. The ratio of uncarboxylated osteocalcin to carboxylated osteocalcin increases with vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K2 has been shown to lower this ratio and improve lumbar vertebrae bone mineral density. Matrix Gla protein must undergo vitamin K dependent phosphorylation and carboxylation. Elevated plasma concentration of dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated MGP is indicative of vitamin K deficiency.

=== Side effects ===
No known toxicity is associated with high oral doses of the vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 forms of vitamin K, so regulatory agencies from US, Japan and European Union concur that no tolerable upper intake levels needs to be set. However, vitamin K1 has been associated with severe adverse reactions such as bronchospasm and cardiac arrest when given intravenously. The reaction is described as a nonimmune-mediated anaphylactoid reaction, with incidence of 3 per 10,000 treatments. The majority of reactions occurred when polyoxyethylated castor oil was used as the solubilizing agent.

==Non-human uses==

Menadione, a natural compound sometimes referred to as vitamin K3, is used in the pet food industry because once consumed it is converted to vitamin K2. The US Food and Drug Administration has banned this form from sale as a human dietary supplement because overdoses have been shown to cause allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.

4-amino-2-methyl-1-naphthol (&quot;K5&quot;) is not natural and hence not a &quot;vitamin&quot;. Research with &quot;K5&quot; suggests it may inhibit fungal growth in fruit juices.

==Chemistry==

The structure of phylloquinone, Vitamin K1, is marked by the presence of a phytyl sidechain. Vitamin K1 has an (E) trans double bond responsible for its biological activity, and two chiral centers on the phytyl sidechain. Vitamin K1 appears as a yellow viscous liquid at room temperature due to its absorption of violet light in the UV-visible spectra obtained by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. The structures of menaquinones, vitamin K2, are marked by the polyisoprenyl side chain present in the molecule that can contain four to 13 isoprenyl units. MK-4 is the most common form. The large size of Vitamin K1 gives many different peaks in mass spectroscopy, most of which involve derivatives of the naphthoquinone ring base and the alkyl side chain.
=== Conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2 ===
In animals, the MK-4 form of vitamin K2 is produced by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls. While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats and in parenterally administered K1 in rats. There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione (also referred to as vitamin K3) as an intermediate, which is then prenylated to produce MK-4.

== Physiology ==
In animals, vitamin K is involved in the carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues. The modified residues are often (but not always) situated within specific protein domains called Gla domains. Gla residues are usually involved in binding calcium, and are essential for the biological activity of all known Gla proteins.

17 human proteins with Gla domains have been discovered; they play key roles in the regulation of three physiological processes:
* Blood coagulation: prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins C, S, and Z
* Bone metabolism: osteocalcin, matrix Gla protein (MGP), periostin, and Gla-rich protein.
* Vascular biology: Matrix Gla protein, growth arrest – specific protein 6 (Gas6)
* Unknown functions: proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamyl proteins 1 and 2, and transmembrane γ-carboxy glutamyl proteins 3 and 4.

=== Absorption ===
Vitamin K is absorbed through the jejunum and ileum in the small intestine. The process requires bile and pancreatic juices. Estimates for absorption are on the order of 80% for vitamin K1 in its free form (as a dietary supplement) but much lower when present in foods. For example, the absorption of vitamin K from kale and spinach – foods identified as having a high vitamin K content – are on the order of 4% to 17% regardless of whether raw or cooked. Less information is available for absorption of vitamin K2 from foods.

The intestinal membrane protein Niemann–Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) mediates cholesterol absorption. Animal studies show that it also factors into absorption of vitamins E and K1. The same study predicts potential interaction between SR-BI and CD36 proteins as well. The drug ezetimibe inhibits NPC1L1 causing a reduction in cholesterol absorption in humans, and in animal studies, also reduces vitamin E and vitamin K1 absorption. An expected consequence would be that administration of ezetimibe to people who take warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) would potentiate the warfarin effect. This has been confirmed in humans.

=== Function in animals ===

Vitamin K is distributed differently within animals depending on its specific homologue. Vitamin K1 is mainly present in the liver, heart and pancreas, while MK-4 is better represented in the kidneys, brain and pancreas. The liver also contains longer chain homologues MK-7 to MK-13.

The function of vitamin K2 in the animal cell is to add a carboxylic acid functional group to a glutamate (Glu) amino acid residue in a protein, to form a gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residue. This is a somewhat uncommon posttranslational modification of the protein, which is then known as a &quot;Gla protein&quot;. The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K–dependent clotting factors discussed below.

Within the cell, vitamin K participates in a cyclic process. The vitamin undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form called vitamin K hydroquinone (quinol), catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glu to Gla; this enzyme is called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase or the vitamin K–dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled. Vitamin K epoxide is then restored to vitamin K by VKOR. The reduction and subsequent reoxidation of vitamin K coupled with carboxylation of Glu is called the vitamin K cycle. Humans are rarely deficient in vitamin K because, in part, vitamin K2 is continuously recycled in cells.

Warfarin and other 4-hydroxycoumarins block the action of VKOR. This results in decreased concentrations of vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in tissues, such that the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the glutamyl carboxylase is inefficient. This results in the production of clotting factors with inadequate Gla. Without Gla on the amino termini of these factors, they no longer bind stably to the blood vessel endothelium and cannot activate clotting to allow formation of a clot during tissue injury. As it is impossible to predict what dose of warfarin will give the desired degree of clotting suppression, warfarin treatment must be carefully monitored to avoid underdose and overdose.

==== Gamma-carboxyglutamate proteins ====

The following human Gla-containing proteins (&quot;Gla proteins&quot;) have been characterized to the level of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant protein C and protein S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein, and the four transmembrane Gla proteins, the function of which is at present unknown. The Gla domain is responsible for high-affinity binding of calcium ions (Ca2+) to Gla proteins, which is often necessary for their conformation, and always necessary for their function.

Gla proteins are known to occur in a wide variety of vertebrates: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The venom of a number of Australian snakes acts by activating the human blood-clotting system. In some cases, activation is accomplished by snake Gla-containing enzymes that bind to the endothelium of human blood vessels and catalyze the conversion of procoagulant clotting factors into activated ones, leading to unwanted and potentially deadly clotting.

Another interesting class of invertebrate Gla-containing proteins is synthesized by the fish-hunting snail &quot;Conus geographus&quot;. These snails produce a venom containing hundreds of neuroactive peptides, or conotoxins, which is sufficiently toxic to kill an adult human. Several of the conotoxins contain two to five Gla residues.

===Function in plants and cyanobacteria===
Vitamin K1 is an important chemical in green plants (including land plants and green algae) and some species of cyanobacteria, where it functions as an electron acceptor transferring one electron in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 is found in large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale, and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues.

Detection of VKORC1 homologues active on the K1-epioxide suggest that K1 may have a non-redox function in these organisms. In plants but not cyanobacteria, knockout of this gene show growth restriction similar to mutants lacking the ability to produce K1.

=== Function in other bacteria ===
Many bacteria, including &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; found in the large intestine, can synthesize vitamin K2 (MK-7 up to MK-11), but not vitamin K1. In the vitamin K2 synthesizing bacteria, menaquinone transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration). For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, with the help of an enzyme, passes two electrons to menaquinone. The menaquinone, with the help of another enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such as fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively. 

Some of these reactions generate a cellular energy source, ATP, in a manner similar to eukaryotic cell aerobic respiration, except the final electron acceptor is not molecular oxygen, but fumarate or nitrate. In aerobic respiration, the final oxidant is molecular oxygen, which accepts four electrons from an electron donor such as NADH to be converted to water. &quot;E. coli&quot;, as facultative anaerobes, can carry out both aerobic respiration and menaquinone-mediated anaerobic respiration.

== History ==
In 1929, Danish scientist Henrik Dam investigated the role of cholesterol by feeding chickens a cholesterol-depleted diet. He initially replicated experiments reported by scientists at the Ontario Agricultural College. McFarlane, Graham and Richardson, working on the chick feed program at OAC, used chloroform to remove all fat from chick chow. They noticed that chicks fed only fat-depleted chow developed hemorrhages and started bleeding from tag sites. Dam found that these defects could not be restored by adding purified cholesterol to the diet. It appeared that – together with the cholesterol – a second compound was extracted from the food, and this compound was called the coagulation vitamin. The new vitamin received the letter K because the initial discoveries were reported in a German journal, in which it was designated as &quot;Koagulationsvitamin&quot;. Edward Adelbert Doisy of Saint Louis University did much of the research that led to the discovery of the structure and chemical nature of vitamin K. Dam and Doisy shared the 1943 Nobel Prize for medicine for their work on vitamin K1 and K2 published in 1939. Several laboratories synthesized the compound(s) in 1939.

For several decades, the vitamin K–deficient chick model was the only method of quantifying vitamin K in various foods: the chicks were made vitamin K–deficient and subsequently fed with known amounts of vitamin K–containing food. The extent to which blood coagulation was restored by the diet was taken as a measure for its vitamin K content. Three groups of physicians independently found this: Biochemical Institute, University of Copenhagen (Dam and Johannes Glavind), University of Iowa Department of Pathology (Emory Warner, Kenneth Brinkhous, and Harry Pratt Smith), and the Mayo Clinic (Hugh Butt, Albert Snell, and Arnold Osterberg).

The first published report of successful treatment with vitamin K of life-threatening hemorrhage in a jaundiced patient with prothrombin deficiency was made in 1938 by Smith, Warner, and Brinkhous.

The precise function of vitamin K was not discovered until 1974, when prothrombin, a blood coagulation protein, was confirmed to be vitamin K dependent. When the vitamin is present, prothrombin has amino acids near the amino terminus of the protein as γ-carboxyglutamate instead of glutamate, and is able to bind calcium, part of the clotting process.

==Research==
=== Osteoporosis ===
Vitamin K is required for the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin in bone. The risk of osteoporosis, assessed via bone mineral density and fractures, was not affected for people on warfarin therapy – a vitamin K antagonist. Studies investigating whether vitamin K supplementation reduces risk of bone fractures have shown mixed results.

=== Cardiovascular health ===
Matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K-dependent protein found in bone, but also in soft tissues such as arteries, where it appears to function as an anti-calcification protein. In animal studies, animals that lack the gene for MGP exhibit calcification of arteries and other soft tissues. In humans, Keutel syndrome is a rare recessive genetic disorder associated with abnormalities in the gene coding for MGP and characterized by abnormal diffuse cartilage calcification. These observations led to a theory that in humans, inadequately carboxylated MGP, due to low dietary intake of the vitamin, could result in increased risk of arterial calcification and coronary heart disease.

In meta-analyses of population studies, low intake of vitamin K was associated with inactive MGP, arterial calcification and arterial stiffness. Lower dietary intakes of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 were also associated with higher coronary heart disease. When blood concentration of circulating vitamin K1 was assessed there was an increased risk in all cause mortality linked to low concentration. In contrast to these population studies, a review of randomized trials using supplementation with either vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 reported no role in mitigating vascular calcification or reducing arterial stiffness. The trials were too short to assess any impact on coronary heart disease or mortality.

===Other===
Population studies suggest that vitamin K status may have roles in inflammation, brain function, endocrine function and an anti-cancer effect. For all of these, there is not sufficient evidence from intervention trials to draw any conclusions. From a review of observational trials, long-term use of vitamin K antagonists as anticoagulation therapy is associated with lower cancer incidence in general. There are conflicting reviews as to whether agonists reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

<text>Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. &quot;Volvox&quot; species form spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells, and for this reason they are sometimes called globe algae. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. &quot;Volvox&quot; diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately .

== Description ==

&quot;Volvox&quot; is a polyphyletic genus in the volvocine green algae clade. Each mature &quot;Volvox&quot; colony is composed of up to thousands of cells from two differentiated cell types: numerous flagellate somatic cells and a smaller number of germ cells lacking in soma that are embedded in the surface of a hollow sphere or coenobium containing an extracellular matrix made of glycoproteins.

Adult somatic cells comprise a single layer with the flagella facing outward. The cells swim in a coordinated fashion, with distinct anterior and posterior poles. The cells have anterior eyespots that enable the colony to swim toward light. The cells of colonies in the more basal Euvolvox clade are interconnected by thin strands of cytoplasm, called protoplasmates. Cell number is specified during development and is dependent on the number of rounds of division.

=== Reproduction ===

&quot;Volvox&quot; is facultatively sexual and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In the lab, asexual reproduction is most commonly observed; the relative frequencies of sexual and asexual reproduction in the wild is unknown. The switch from asexual to sexual reproduction can be triggered by environmental conditions and by the production of a sex-inducing pheromone. Desiccation-resistant diploid zygotes are produced following successful fertilization.

An asexual colony includes both somatic (vegetative) cells, which do not reproduce, and large, non-motile &quot;gonidia&quot; in the interior, which produce new colonies asexually through repeated division. In sexual reproduction two types of gametes are produced. &quot;Volvox&quot; species can be monoecious or dioecious. Male colonies release numerous sperm packets, while in female colonies single cells enlarge to become oogametes, or eggs.

Kirk and Kirk showed that sex-inducing pheromone production can be triggered in somatic cells by a short heat shock given to asexually growing organisms. The induction of sex by heat shock is mediated by oxidative stress that likely also causes oxidative DNA damage. It has been suggested that switching to the sexual pathway is the key to surviving environmental stresses that include heat and drought. Consistent with this idea, the induction of sex involves a signal transduction pathway that is also induced in &quot;Volvox&quot; by wounding.

=== Colony inversion ===
Colony inversion is a special characteristic during development in the order Volvocaceae that results in new colonies having their flagella facing outwards. During this process the asexual reproductive cells (gonidia) first undergo successive cell divisions to form a concave-to-cup-shaped embryo or plakea composed of a single cell layer. Immediately after, the cell layer is inside out compared with the adult configuration—the apical ends of the embryo protoplasts from which flagella are formed, are oriented toward the interior of the plakea. Then the embryo undergoes inversion, during which the cell layer inverts to form a spheroidal daughter colony with the apical ends and flagella of daughter protoplasts positioned outside. This process enables appropriate locomotion of spheroidal colonies of the Volvocaceae. The mechanism of inversion has been investigated extensively at the cellular and molecular levels using the model species, &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;.

== Habitats ==
&quot;Volvox&quot; is a genus of freshwater algae found in ponds and ditches, even in shallow puddles. According to Charles Joseph Chamberlain,
&quot;The most favorable place to look for it is in the deeper ponds, lagoons, and ditches which receive an abundance of rain water. It has been said that where you find &quot;Lemna&quot;, you are likely to find &quot;Volvox&quot;; and it is true that such water is favorable, but the shading is unfavorable. Look where you find &quot;Sphagnum&quot;, &quot;Vaucheria&quot;, &quot;Alisma&quot;, &quot;Equisetum fluviatile&quot;, &quot;Utricularia&quot;, &quot;Typha&quot;, and &quot;Chara&quot;. Dr. Nieuwland reports that &quot;Pandorina&quot;, &quot;Eudorina&quot; and &quot;Gonium&quot; are commonly found as constituents of the green scum on wallows in fields where pigs are kept. The flagellate, &quot;Euglena&quot;, is often associated with these forms.&quot;

== History ==
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first reported observations of &quot;Volvox&quot; in 1700.

After some drawings of Henry Baker (1753), Linnaeus (1758) would describe the genus &quot;Volvox&quot;, with two species: &quot;V. globator&quot; and &quot;V. chaos&quot;. &quot;Volvox chaos&quot; is an amoeba now known as &quot;Chaos&quot; sp.

== Evolution ==
Ancestors of &quot;Volvox&quot; transitioned from single cells that initially resembled &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; to form multicellular colonies at least , during the Triassic period.
The middle stage, Conium, contained 16 chlamydomonas-like cells. An estimate using DNA sequences from about 45 different species of volvocine green algae, including &quot;Volvox&quot;, suggests that the transition from single cells to undifferentiated multicellular colonies took about 35 million years.

<text>Vermouth (, ) is an aromatized fortified wine, flavoured with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, and spices) and sometimes colored. The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to late 18th century in Turin, Italy. While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, it was later served as an apéritif, with fashionable cafés in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. In the late 19th century, it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient for cocktails, such as the martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an apéritif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative to white wine in cooking.

Historically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (blanc or bianco), red (rosso), amber and rosé.

Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit, or spirit only – which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.

Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world. Nevertheless, in 2022 an Australian company won a gold medal for its extra-dry vermouth at the World Vermouth Awards in London. Further, a Canadian company was a double winner in 2023, the first producer outside Europe to be judged &quot;best&quot; for both the dry and semi-sweet categories.

==Etymology and history==
Consumption of wines fortified with herbs or roots is believed to have begun in China at least as early as the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties (1250–1000 BC). The extra ingredients were added to wine to make it a medicinal drink. Medicinal drinks made by the alcoholic fermentation of herbs and sugars are mentioned in early Indian texts on medicine, though this does not imply that European vermouths originated from ancient Chinese and Indian drinks. Recipes for infusing white wine date back to ancient Greece from around 400 BC. A popular ingredient was wormwood, based on the belief that it was effective at treating stomach disorders and intestinal parasites.

It was commonly used in Hungary at least since the 15th century with different species of artemisia plants like mugwort or wormwood and other spices like mustard seeds, horseradish, elfdock, etc. Wormwood is called &quot;üröm&quot; or &quot;irem&quot; in Hungarian hence the drink is called &quot;ürmös&quot; (wormwoodish) or &quot;ürmösbor&quot; (wormwoodish wine). In the 16th century, it was used with imported spices too like cinnamon, clove, etc. It was well known for healing stomach and digestion problems.

The name &quot;vermouth&quot; is the French pronunciation of the German word &quot;Wermut&quot; for wormwood that has been used as an ingredient in the drink over its history. Fortified wines containing wormwood as a principal ingredient existed in Germany around the 16th century. At about this time, an Italian merchant named D&#x27;Alessio began producing a similar product in Piedmont as a &quot;wormwood wine&quot;. D&#x27;Alessio&#x27;s version of the libation contained other botanical ingredients in addition to wormwood. Competing brands developed shortly thereafter in eastern and southeastern France, containing their own proprietary mix of ingredients, including herbs, roots, bark, and spices. By the mid-17th century, the drink was being consumed in England under the name &quot;vermouth&quot; which has been the common name for the beverage until the present day.

Over time, two distinct versions of vermouth became established, one pale, dry, and bitter, and the other red and sweeter. Merchant Antonio Benedetto Carpano introduced the first sweet vermouth in 1786 in Turin, Italy. The drink reportedly quickly became popular with the royal court of Turin. Around 1800 to 1813, the first pale, dry vermouth was produced in France by Joseph Noilly. However, not all pale vermouths produced over time have been dry, and not all red vermouths have been sweet.

The use of vermouth as a medicinal liquor waned by the end of the 18th century, but its use as an apéritif increased in Italy and France. By the late 19th century, vermouth was being used in cocktails. Bartenders found that it was an ideal mixer for many cocktails, including the Manhattan (beginning around 1880) and the precursors to the martini. In addition, the popular Vermouth cocktail, first appearing in 1868, consisted of chilled vermouth and a twist of lemon peel with the occasional addition of small amounts of bitters or maraschino. The popularity of vermouth-heavy cocktails in America, often using twice as much vermouth as gin or whiskey, continued through the 1880s and 1890s. Although the amount of vermouth used in cocktail recipes had somewhat declined, it has recently been experiencing a rise as a favorite among a new breed of bartenders, as a key ingredient in many cocktails. Vermouth gained popularity in the 1950s with help from the martini, which was being marketed by liquor companies. Product placement and celebrity endorsements from personalities such as Ernest Hemingway and Humphrey Bogart helped to increase the martini&#x27;s profile. However, the most successful advertiser of the martini was the fictional character James Bond.

The popularity of vermouth in the United States and Great Britain declined after the mid-20th century but was still used in those countries in many classic cocktails such as the Manhattan, albeit in smaller amounts. The drink is more popular in other parts of Europe (such as Italy, France, and Spain, where it is often consumed by itself as an apéritif). It is also very popular in Argentina, where—due to major Italian immigration during the late 19th and early 20th centuries—it is more than a drink: it is a cultural tradition among families, at the table and afterwards. Even such international brands as Cinzano have Argentinian-only products like Cinzano Segundo, made with local grapes.

In the years since 2013, there has been renewed interest in vermouth in the US. Artisanal makers have created new brands of vermouth which do not seek to imitate European styles, and vermouth has been a fast-growing category within the wine trade.

==Production, ingredients, and flavours==
Several wine grapes, including Clairette blanche, Piquepoul, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Catarratto, and Trebbiano, are generally used as the base ingredients for vermouths. From these grapes, a low-alcohol white wine is produced by vermouth manufacturers. The wine may be aged for a short while before the addition of other ingredients. For sweet vermouths, sugar syrup is added before the wine is fortified with extra alcohol. The added alcohol is usually a neutral grape spirit, but may also come from vegetable sources such as sugar beets. The wine is then placed in large barrels or tanks to which the dry ingredients have already been added. The mixture is stirred at intervals until the dry ingredients have been absorbed and the drink is ready for bottling. Red vermouths can derive their color from botanicals, added red wine, or sometimes from caramel color. Rose-colored vermouth uses red and white wines as its base. Most vermouths are bottled at between 16% and 18% ABV, as compared with the 9–14% ABV of most unfortified wines.

Spice ingredients often used in vermouths include cloves, cinnamon, quinine, citrus peel, cardamom, marjoram, chamomile, coriander, juniper, hyssop, ginger, and labdanum. The prohibition of wormwood as a drink ingredient in the early 20th century in some countries sharply reduced its use in vermouth, but small amounts of the herb are still sometimes included in artisan products. Vermouth brand recipes vary, with most manufacturers marketing their own unique flavour and version of the beverage. Vermouth manufacturers keep their recipes for the drink secret.

Sweet vermouths usually contain 10–15% sugar. The sugar content in dry vermouths generally does not exceed 4%. Dry vermouths usually are lighter in body than sweet vermouths.

In addition to pale and red vermouths, there exist golden and rosé versions, but these are not as internationally popular. The region of Chambéry in France has received an appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée for its vermouths, which is where the blanc style originated and also includes a strawberry-flavored version called Chambéryzette. Lillet, St. Raphael, and Dubonnet are fortified wines similar to vermouth, but are usually considered separate products. The two predominant styles of vermouth – the red, Italian rosso and the dry, white vermouth from France – were created and commercialized more than two centuries ago.

The term &quot;Italian vermouth&quot; is often used to refer to red-colored, mildly bitter, and slightly sweet vermouths. These types of vermouths have also been called &quot;rosso&quot;. The label &quot;French vermouth&quot; generally refers to pale, dry vermouths that are more bitter than sweet vermouths. The extra bitterness is often obtained by using nutmeg or bitter orange peel in the drink recipe. Blanc or Bianco is a name given to a type of pale, sweeter vermouth.

According to Stuart Walton and Brian Glover, vermouth &quot;is as far removed from the natural produce of the vine as it is possible for a fortified wine to get.&quot;

==Modern use==

===Beverage===
Vermouth is a common cocktail ingredient, particularly in martinis and Manhattans. When vermouth is drunk by itself it is normally consumed as an apéritif. Vermouth is used as an ingredient in many different cocktails, as people found it beneficial for lowering the alcohol content of cocktails with strong spirits as their base, for providing a pleasant herbal flavor and aroma, and for accentuating the flavors in the base liquor. As previously stated, vermouth is an ingredient in the martini, one of the most popular and well-known cocktails. At first, martinis used sweet vermouth. Around 1904, however, drier French vermouths began to be used in the cocktail. The term &quot;dry martini&quot; originally meant using drier vermouth as a mixer, not using less vermouth, as in the modern definition.

Sharon Tyler Herbst&#x27;s book, &quot;The Ultimate A-To-Z Bar Guide&quot;, lists 112 cocktails using dry vermouth and 82 containing sweet vermouth. Cocktails using either dry or sweet vermouth or both include the Americano, Bronx, Gibson, Malecon, Manhattan, Negroni, Rob Roy, and Rose. Variations of cocktail recipes using equal portions of dry and sweet vermouths are called &quot;perfect&quot;, as in a &quot;Perfect Manhattan&quot;.

===Cooking===
While vermouth can be used as a substitute for white wine in food recipes, because it is more flavorful than wine, it may be overwhelming when used in certain dishes. The herbs in dry vermouth make it an attractive ingredient in sauces for fish dishes or as a marinade for other meats, including pork and chicken.

===Storing===
Because vermouth is fortified, an opened bottle will not sour as quickly as white wine. Opened vermouth, however, will gradually deteriorate over time. Gourmets recommend that opened bottles of vermouth be consumed within one to three months and should be kept refrigerated to slow oxidation.

==Notable brands==
The Carpano family originated several notable brands of vermouth, including Punt e Mes, a deep red vermouth with sweet and bitter flavors, and the Antica Formula brand, a bitter, fuller-flavored version of vermouth. Distillerie Fratelli Branca of Milan bought 50% of the Giuseppe B. Carpano company in 1982 and acquired the company outright in 2001. Gancia, Drapò Vermouth, Delmistero, 9diDANTE and Cocchi are other Italian producers.

The Cinzano family began production in 1757 in Turin. Their Bianco product is sweet, pale vermouth.

 vermouth from Chambéry, France, has been made since 1815. Their product lineup carries both a traditional dry, two different kinds of sweet (red and blanco), and a strawberry (chamberyzette). Dolin is recognized as creating the blanc style.

Martini &amp; Rossi, the top-selling international brand of vermouth, started in 1863 in Turin and produces both dry and sweet vermouths, but is mostly known for its Rosso. Cinzano and Martini &amp; Rossi also produce rosé vermouths, which are mainly distributed in Italy and France.

Noilly Prat, based in southern France, is primarily known for its dry, pale vermouths, but also produces a sweeter version. The company was founded by Joseph Noilly in 1813.

Esquimalt Vermouth &amp; Apéritifs, on Vancouver Island, Canada, is the first producer outside Europe to win two gold medals at London’s 2023 World Vermouth Awards. In the blind tasting competition, they were judged best for both Dry Vermouth, and also for Semi-Sweet Vermouth (for its Rosso). A year after the company began production, Esquimalt Vermouth &amp; Apéritifs won a gold medal at the 2020 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. The following year, 2021, they were awarded three double gold medals for their dry vermouth, the semisweet Rosso, and their Kina-Rouge.

<text>Vinland, Vineland, or Winland () was an area of coastal North America explored by Vikings. Leif Eriksson landed there around 1000 AD, nearly five centuries before the voyages of Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. The name appears in the Vinland Sagas, and describes Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far as northeastern New Brunswick. Much of the geographical content of the sagas corresponds to present-day knowledge of transatlantic travel and North America.

In 1960, archaeological evidence of the only known Norse site in North America, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, was found on the northern tip of the island of Newfoundland. Before the discovery of archaeological evidence, Vinland was known only from the sagas and medieval historiography. The 1960 discovery further proved the pre-Columbian Norse exploration of mainland North America. L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows has been hypothesized to be the camp &quot;Straumfjörð&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;.

==Name==
Vinland was the name given to part of North America by the Icelandic Norseman Leif Eriksson, about 1000 AD. It was also spelled &quot;Winland&quot;, as early as Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Descriptio insularum Aquilonis&quot; (&quot;Description of the Northern Islands&quot;, ch. 39, in the 4th part of Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum), written circa 1075. Adam&#x27;s main source regarding &quot;Winland&quot; appears to have been king Svend Estridson, who had knowledge of the &quot;northern islands&quot;. The etymology of the Old Norse root &quot;vin-&quot; is disputed; while it has usually been assumed to be &quot;wine&quot;, some scholars give credence to the homophone &quot;vin&quot;, meaning &quot;pasture&quot; or &quot;meadow&quot;.
Adam of Bremen implies that the name contains Old Norse vín (cognate with Latin &quot;vinum&quot;) &quot;wine&quot; (rendered as Old Saxon or Old High German &quot;wīn&quot;): &quot;Moreover, he has also reported one island discovered by many in that ocean, which is called &quot;Winland&quot;, for the reason that grapevines grow there by themselves, producing the best wine.&quot; This etymology is retained in the 13th-century &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot;, which provides a circumstantial account of the discovery of Vinland and its being named from the vínber, i.e. &quot;wineberry&quot;, a term for grapes or currants (black or red), found there.

There is also a long-standing Scandinavian tradition of fermenting berries into wine. The discovery of butternuts at the site implies that the Norse explored Vinland further to the south, at least as far as St. Lawrence River and parts of New Brunswick, the northern limit for both butternut and wild grapes (&quot;Vitis riparia&quot;).

Another proposal for the name&#x27;s etymology, was introduced by Sven Söderberg in 1898 (first published in 1910). This suggestion involves interpreting the Old Norse name not as vín-land with the first vowel spoken as /iː/, but as vin-land, spoken as /ɪ/; a short vowel. Old Norse vin (from Proto-Norse &quot;winju&quot;) has a meaning of &quot;meadow, pasture&quot;.
This interpretation of Vinland as &quot;pasture-land&quot; rather than &quot;wine-land&quot; was accepted by Valter Jansson in his classic 1951 dissertation on the vin-names of Scandinavia, by way of which it entered popular knowledge in the later 20th century. It was rejected by Einar Haugen (1977), who argued that the vin element had changed its meaning from &quot;pasture&quot; to &quot;farm&quot; long before the Old Norse period. Names in vin were given in the Proto Norse period, and they are absent from places colonized in the Viking Age.

Kirsten A. Seaver also rejects the &quot;Pastureland&quot; interpretation of the name &#x27;Vínland&#x27;. On page 24 of &quot;The Frozen Echo&quot; 1996, she writes, &quot;The notion that the first syllable was vin with a short vowel (meaning ”green meadow”) has been so thoroughly discarded that we are left with the incontrovertible, long-vowelled vín or “wine”
There is a runestone which may have contained a record of the Old Norse name slightly predating Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Winland&quot;. The &quot;Hønen Runestone&quot; was discovered in Norderhov, Norway, shortly before 1817, but it was subsequently lost. Its assessment depends on a sketch made by antiquarian L. D. Klüwer (1823), now also lost but in turn copied by Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (1838). The Younger Futhark inscription was dated to c. 1010–1050. The stone had been erected in memory of a Norwegian, possibly a descendant of Sigurd Syr. Sophus Bugge (1902) read part of the inscription as:

This is highly uncertain; the same sequence is read by Magnus Olsen (1951) as:

==The Vinland Sagas==
The main sources of information about the Norse voyages to Vinland are two Icelandic Sagas: the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; and the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, which are known collectively as the Vinland Sagas. These stories were preserved by oral tradition until they were written down some 250 years after the events they describe. The existence of two versions of the story shows some of the challenges of using traditional sources for history, because they share a large number of story elements but use them in different ways. A possible example is the reference to two different men named Bjarni who are blown off course. A brief summary of the plots of the two sagas, given at the end of this article, shows other examples.

The sagas report that a considerable number of Vikings were in parties that visited Vinland. Thorfinn Karlsefni&#x27;s crew consisted of 140 or 160 people according to the Saga of Erik the Red, 60 according to the Saga of the Greenlanders. Still according to the latter, Leif Ericson led a company of 35, Thorvald Eiriksson a company of 30, and Helgi and Finnbogi had 30 crew members.

According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Þorfinnr &quot;Karlsefni&quot; Þórðarson and a company of 160 men, going south from Greenland traversed an open stretch of sea, found Helluland, another stretch of sea, Markland, another stretch of sea, the headland of &quot;Kjalarnes&quot;, the Wonderstrands, Straumfjörð and at last a place called &quot;Hóp&quot;, a bountiful place where no snow fell during winter. However, after several years away from Greenland, they chose to turn back to their homes when they realized that they would otherwise face an indefinite conflict with the natives.

This saga references the place-name Vinland in four ways. First, it is identified as the land found by Leif Erikson. Karlsefni and his men subsequently find &quot;vín-ber&quot; near the Wonderstrands. Later, the tale locates Vinland to the south of Markland, with the headland of &quot;Kjalarnes&quot; at its northern extreme. However, it also mentions that while at Straumfjord, some of the explorers wished to go in search for Vinland west of &quot;Kjalarnes&quot;.

===&quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;===


In &quot;Grænlendinga saga&quot; or the &#x27;Saga of the Greenlanders&#x27;, Bjarni Herjólfsson accidentally discovered the new land when traveling from Norway to visit his father, in the second year of Erik the Red&#x27;s Greenland settlement (about 986 CE). When he managed to reach Greenland, making land at Herjolfsness, the site of his father&#x27;s farm, he remained there for the rest of his father&#x27;s life and didn&#x27;t return to Norway until about 1000 CE. There, he told his overlord (the Earl, also named Erik) about the new land and was criticized for his long delay in reporting this. On his return to Greenland he retold the story and inspired Leif Eriksson to organize an expedition, which retraced in reverse the route Bjarni had followed, past a land of flat stones (Helluland) and a land of forests (Markland). After having sailed another two days across open sea, the expedition found a headland with an island just off the shore, with a nearby pool, accessible to ships at high tide, in an area where the sea was shallow with sandbanks. Here the explorers landed and established a base which can plausibly be matched to L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows; except that the winter was described as mild, not freezing. One day an old family servant, Tyrker, went missing and was found mumbling to himself. He eventually explained that he found grapes/currants. In the spring, Leif returned to Greenland with a shipload of timber, towing a boatload of grapes/currants. On the way home, he spotted another ship aground on the rocks, rescued the crew and later salvaged the cargo. A second expedition, one ship of about 40 men led by Leif&#x27;s brother Thorvald, sets out in the autumn after Leif&#x27;s return and stayed over three winters at the new base (&quot;Leifsbúðir&quot; (-budir), meaning Leif&#x27;s temporary shelters), exploring the west coast of the new land during the first summer, and the east coast during the second, running aground and losing the ship&#x27;s keel on a headland they christen Keel Point (&quot;Kjalarnes&quot;). Further south, at a point where Thorvald wanted to establish a settlement, the Greenlanders encountered some of the local inhabitants (&quot;Skrælingjar&quot;) and killed them, following which they were attacked by a large force in hide boats, and Thorvald died from an arrow-wound. After the exploration party returned to base, the Greenlanders decided to return home the following spring.

Thorstein, Leif&#x27;s brother, married Gudrid, widow of the captain rescued by Leif, then led a third expedition to bring home Thorvald&#x27;s body, but drifted off course and spent the whole summer sailing the Atlantic. Spending the winter as a guest at a farm on Greenland with Gudrid, Thorstein died of disease, reviving just long enough to make a prophecy about her future as a Christian. The next winter, Gudrid married a visiting Icelander named Thorfinn Karlsefni, who agreed to undertake a major expedition to Vinland, taking livestock. On arrival, they soon found a beached whale which sustained them until spring. In the summer, they were visited by some of the local inhabitants who were scared by the Greenlanders&#x27; bull, but happy to trade goods for milk and other products. In autumn, Gudrid gave birth to a son, Snorri. Shortly after this, one of the local people tried to take a weapon and was killed. The explorers were then attacked in force, but managed to survive with only minor casualties by retreating to a well-chosen defensive position, a short distance from their base. One of the local people picked up an iron axe, tried it, and threw it away.

The explorers returned to Greenland in summer with a cargo of grapes/currants and hides. Shortly thereafter, a ship captained by two Icelanders arrived in Greenland, and Freydis, daughter of Eric the Red, persuaded them to join her in an expedition to Vinland. When they arrived at Vinland, the brothers stored their belongings in Leif Eriksson&#x27;s houses, which angered Freydis and she banished them. She then visited them during the winter and asked for their ship, claiming that she wanted to go back to Greenland, which the brothers happily agreed to. Freydis went back and told her husband the exact opposite, which led to the killing, at Freydis&#x27; order, of all the Icelanders, including five women, as they lay sleeping. In the spring, the Greenlanders returned home with a good cargo, but Leif found out the truth about the Icelanders. That was the last Vinland expedition recorded in the saga.

===&quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;===

In the other version of the story, &quot;Eiríks saga rauða&quot; or the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, Leif Ericsson accidentally discovered the new land when traveling from Norway back to Greenland after a visit to his overlord, King Olaf Tryggvason, who commissioned him to spread Christianity in the colony. Returning to Greenland with samples of grapes/currants, wheat and timber, he rescued the survivors from a wrecked ship and gained a reputation for good luck; his religious mission was a swift success. The next spring, Thorstein, Leif&#x27;s brother, led an expedition to the new land, but drifted off course and spent the whole summer sailing the Atlantic. On his return, he met and married Gudrid, one of the survivors from a ship which made land at Herjolfsnes after a difficult voyage from Iceland. Spending the winter as a guest at a farm on Greenland with Gudrid, Thorstein died of disease, reviving just long enough to make a prophecy about her future as a far-traveling Christian. The next winter, Gudrid married a visiting Icelander named Thorfinn Karlsefni, who, with his business partner Snorri Thorbrandsson, agreed to undertake a major expedition to the new land, taking livestock with them. Also contributing ships for this expedition were another pair of visiting Icelanders, Bjarni Grimolfsson and Thorhall Gamlason, and Leif&#x27;s brother and sister Thorvald and Freydis, with her husband Thorvard. Sailing past landscapes of flat stones (Helluland) and forests (Markland) they rounded a cape where they saw the keel of a boat (Kjalarnes), then continued past some extraordinarily long beaches (&quot;Furðustrandir&quot;) before they landed and sent out two runners to explore inland. After three days, the pair returned with samples of grapes/currants and wheat. After they sailed a little farther, the expedition landed at an inlet next to an area of strong currents (Straumfjörð), with an island just off shore (Straumsey), and they made camp. The winter months were harsh, and food was in short supply. One day an old family servant, Thorhall the Hunter (who had not become Christian), went missing and was found mumbling to himself. Shortly afterwards, a beached whale was found, which Thorhall claimed had been provided in answer to his praise of the pagan gods. The explorers found that eating it made them ill, so they prayed to the Christian God, and shortly afterwards the weather improved.

When spring arrived, Thorhall Gamlason, the Icelander, wanted to sail north around Kjalarnes to seek Vinland, while Thorfinn Karlsefni preferred to sail southward down the east coast. Thorhall took only nine men, and his vessel is swept out into the ocean by contrary winds; he and his crew never returned. Thorfinn and Snorri, with Freydis (plus possibly Bjarni), sailed down the east coast with 40 men or more and established a settlement on the shore of a seaside lake, protected by barrier islands and connected to the open ocean by a river which was navigable by ships only at high tide. The settlement was known as &quot;Hóp&quot;, and the land abounded with grapes/currants and wheat. The teller of this saga was uncertain whether the explorers remained here over the next winter (said to be very mild) or for only a few weeks of summer. One morning they saw nine hide boats; the local people (&quot;Skrælings&quot;) examined the Norse ships and departed in peace. Later a much larger flotilla of boats arrived, and trade commenced (Karlsefni forbade the sale of weapons). One day, the local traders were frightened by the sudden arrival of the Greenlanders&#x27; bull, and they stayed away for three weeks. They then attacked in force, but the explorers managed to survive with only minor casualties, by retreating inland to a defensive position, a short distance from their camp. Pregnancy slowed Freydis down, so she picked up the sword of a fallen companion and brandished it against her bare breast, scaring the attackers into withdrawal. One of the local people picked up an iron axe, tried using it, but threw it away. The explorers subsequently abandoned the southern camp and sailed back to Straumsfjord, killing five natives they encountered on the way, lying asleep in hide sacks.

Karlsefni, accompanied by Thorvald Eriksson and others, sailed around Kjalarnes and then south, keeping land on their left side, hoping to find Thorhall. After sailing for a long time, while moored on the south side of a west-flowing river, they were shot at by a one-footed man, and Thorvald died from an arrow-wound. Once they reached Markland, the men encountered five natives, of whom they kidnapped two boys, baptizing them and teaching them their own language. The explorers returned to Straumsfjord, but disagreements during the following winter led to the abandonment of the venture. On the way home, the ship of Bjarni the Icelander was swept into the Sea of Worms (Maðkasjár in Skálholtsbók, Maðksjár in Hauksbók) by contrary winds. The marine worms destroyed the hull, and only those who escaped in the ship&#x27;s worm-proofed boat survived. This was the last Vinland expedition recorded in the saga.

==Medieval geographers==

=== Adam of Bremen ===

The oldest commonly acknowledged surviving written record of Vinland appears in &quot;Descriptio insularum Aquilonis&quot; by Adam of Bremen written in about 1075. Adam was told about &quot;islands&quot; discovered by Norse sailors in the Atlantic by the Danish king Svend Estridsen.

=== Galvano Fiamma ===

The nearby Norse outpost of Markland was mentioned in the writings of Galvano Fiamma in his book, &quot;Cronica universalis&quot;. He is believed to be the first Southern European to write about the New World.&quot;&quot;

=== Sigurd Stefansson ===
The earliest map of Vinland was drawn by Sigurd Stefansson, a schoolmaster at Skalholt, Iceland, around 1570, which placed Vinland somewhere that can be Chesapeake Bay, St. Lawrence, or Cape Cod Bay.

In the early 14th Century, a geography encyclopedia called &quot;Geographica Universalis&quot; was compiled at Malmesbury Abbey in England, which was in turn used as a source for one of the most widely circulated medieval English educational works, &quot;Polychronicon&quot; by Ranulf Higden, a few years later. Both these works, with Adam of Bremen as a possible source, were confused about the location of what they called &quot;Wintland&quot;—the Malmesbury monk had it on the ocean east of Norway, while Higden put it west of Denmark but failed to explain the distance. Copies of &quot;Polychronicon&quot; commonly included a world map on which &quot;Wintland&quot; was marked in the Atlantic Ocean near Iceland, but again much closer to the Scandinavian mainland than in reality. The name was explained in both texts as referring to the savage inhabitants&#x27; ability to tie the wind up in knotted cords, which they sold to sailors who could then undo a knot whenever they needed a good wind. Neither mentioned grapes, and the Malmesbury work specifically states that little grows there but grass and trees, which reflects the saga descriptions of the area round the main Norse expedition base.
More geographically correct were Icelandic texts from about the same time, which presented a clear picture of the northern countries as experienced by Norse explorers: north of Iceland a vast, barren plain (which we now know to be the Polar ice-cap) extended from &quot;Biarmeland&quot; (northern Russia) east of the White Sea, to Greenland, then further west and south were, in succession, Helluland, Markland and Vinland. The Icelanders had no knowledge of how far south Vinland extended, and they speculated that it might reach as far as Africa.

The &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; (History of Norway), compiled around 15th–16th century, does not refer directly to Vinland and tries to reconcile information from Greenland with mainland European sources; in this text Greenland&#x27;s territory extends so that it is &quot;almost touching the African islands, where the waters of ocean flood in&quot;.

==Later Norse voyages==
Icelandic chronicles record another attempt to visit Vinland from Greenland, over a century after the saga voyages. In 1121, Icelandic bishop Eric Gnupsson, who had been based on Greenland since 1112, &quot;went to seek Vinland&quot;. Nothing more is reported of him, and three years later another bishop, Arnald, was sent to Greenland. No written records, other than inscribed stones, have survived in Greenland, so the next reference to a voyage also comes from Icelandic chronicles. In 1347, a ship arrived in Iceland, after being blown off course on its way home from Markland to Greenland with a load of timber. The implication is that the Greenlanders had continued to use Markland as a source of timber over several centuries.

==Controversy over the location of Vinland==

The definition of Vinland is somewhat elusive. According to a 1969 article by Douglas McManis in the &quot;Annals of the Association of American Geographers&quot;, 

This leads him to conclude that &quot;there is not a Vinland, there are many Vinlands&quot;. According to a 1970 reply by Matti Kaups in the same journal, 

In geographical terms, Vinland is sometimes used to refer generally to all areas in Atlantic Canada. In the sagas, Vinland is sometimes indicated to not include the territories of Helluland and Markland, which appear to also be located in North America beyond Greenland. Moreover, some sagas establish vague links between Vinland and an island or territory that some sources refer to as &quot;Hvítramannaland&quot;.

Another possibility is to interpret the name of Vinland as not referring to one defined location, but to every location where &quot;vínber&quot; could be found, i.e. to understand it as a common noun, vinland, rather than a toponym, Vinland. The Old Norse and Icelandic languages were, and are, very flexible in forming compound words.

Sixteenth century Icelanders realized that the &quot;New World&quot; which European geographers were calling &quot;America&quot; was the land described in their Vinland Sagas. The Skálholt Map, drawn in 1570 or 1590 but surviving only through later copies, shows &quot;Promontorium Winlandiae&quot; (&quot;promontory/cape/foreland of Vinland&quot;) as a narrow cape with its northern tip at the same latitude as southern Ireland. (The scales of degrees in the map margins are inaccurate.) This effective identification of northern Newfoundland with the northern tip of Vinland was taken up by later Scandinavian scholars such as bishop Hans Resen.

Although it is generally agreed, based on the saga descriptions, that Helluland includes Baffin Island, and Markland represents at least the southern part of the modern Labrador, there has been considerable controversy over the location of the actual Norse landings and settlement. Comparison of the sagas, as summarized below, shows that they give similar descriptions and names to different places. One of the few reasonably consistent pieces of information is that exploration voyages from the main base sailed down both the east and west coasts of the land; this was one of the factors which helped archaeologists locate the site at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, at the tip of Newfoundland&#x27;s long northern peninsula.

Erik Wahlgren examines the question in his book &quot;The Vikings and America&quot;, and points out clearly that L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows cannot be the location of Vínland, as the location described in the sagas has both salmon in the rivers and the &#x27;vínber&#x27; (meaning specifically &#x27;grape&#x27;, that according to Wahlgren the explorers were familiar with and would have thus recognized), growing freely.
Charting the overlap of the limits of wild vine and wild salmon habitats, as well as nautical clues from the sagas, Wahlgren indicates a location in Maine or New Brunswick. He hazards a guess that Leif Erikson camped at Passamaquoddy Bay and Thorvald Erikson was killed in the Bay of Fundy.

On the other hand, Sir Wilfred Grenfell, a medical missionary and scholar living in Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 20th century wrote of the issue of the location of Vinland that,

Other clues appear to place the main settlement farther south, such as the mention of a winter with no snow and the reports in both sagas of grapes being found. A very specific indication in the Greenlanders&#x27; Saga of the latitude of the base has also been subject to misinterpretation. This passage states that in the shortest days of midwinter, the sun was still above the horizon at &quot;dagmal&quot; and &quot;eykt&quot;, two specific times in the Norse day. Carl Christian Rafn, in the first detailed study of the Norse exploration of the New World, &quot;Antiquitates Americanae&quot; (1837), interpreted these times as equivalent to 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., which would put the base a long way south of Newfoundland. According to the 1880 Sephton translation of the saga, Rafn and other Danish scholars placed &quot;Kjalarnes&quot; at Cape Cod, Straumfjörð at Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, and Straumsey at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

An Icelandic law text gives a very specific explanation of &quot;eykt&quot;, with reference to Norse navigation techniques. The eight major divisions of the compass were subdivided into three hours each, to make a total of 24, and &quot;eykt&quot; was the end of the second hour of the south-west division. In modern terms this would be 3:30 p.m. &quot;Dagmal&quot;, the &quot;day-meal,&quot; is specifically distinguished from the earlier &quot;rismal&quot; (breakfast), and would thus be about 8:30 a.m.

A 2012 article by Jónas Kristjánsson in the scientific journal &quot;Acta Archeologica&quot;, which assumes that the headland of &quot;Kjalarnes&quot; referred to in the Saga of Erik the Red is at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, suggests that Straumfjörð refers to Sop&#x27;s Arm, Newfoundland, as no other fjord in Newfoundland was found to have an island at its mouth.

===L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows===

Newfoundland marine insurance agent and historian William A. Munn (1864–1939), after studying literary sources in Europe, suggested in his 1914 book &quot;Location of Helluland, Markland &amp; Vinland from the Icelandic Sagas&quot; that the Vinland explorers &quot;went ashore at Lancey Meadows, as it is called to-day&quot;. In 1960, the remains of a small Norse encampment were discovered by Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad at that exact spot, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland, and excavated during the 1960s and 1970s. It is most likely this was the main settlement of the sagas, a &quot;gateway&quot; for the Norse Greenlanders to the rich lands farther south. Many wooden objects were found at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, and radiocarbon dating confirms the site&#x27;s occupation as being confined to a short period around 1000 CE. In addition, small pieces of jasper, known to have been used in the Norse world as fire-strikers, were found in and around the different buildings. When these were analyzed and compared with samples from jasper sources around the North Atlantic area, it was found that two buildings contained only Icelandic jasper pieces, while another contained some from Greenland; a single piece from the east coast of Newfoundland was found. These finds appear to confirm the saga claim that some Vinland exploration ships came from Iceland and that they ventured down the east coast of the new land. In 2021, wood from the site was shown to have been cut in 1021, using metal blades, which the local indigenous people did not have.

Although it is now generally accepted that L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows was the main base of the Norse explorers, the southernmost limit of Norse exploration remains a subject of intense speculation. Gustav Storm (1887) and Joseph Fischer (1902) both suggested Cape Breton; Samuel Eliot Morison (1971) the southern part of Newfoundland; Erik Wahlgren (1986) Miramichi Bay in New Brunswick; and Icelandic climate specialist Pall Bergthorsson (1997) proposed New York City. The insistence in all the main historical sources that grapes were found in Vinland suggests that the explorers ventured at least to the south side of the St. Lawrence River, as Jacques Cartier did 500 years later, finding both wild vines and nut trees. Three butternuts were found at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, another species which grows only as far north as the St. Lawrence.

The vinviðir (wine wood) the Norse were cutting down in the sagas may refer to the vines of &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, a species of wild grape that grows on trees. As the Norse were searching for lumber, a material that was needed in Greenland, they found trees covered with &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; south of L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows and called them vinviðir.
L&#x27;Anse Aux Meadows was a small and short-lived encampment; perhaps it was primarily used for timber-gathering forays and boat repair, rather than permanent settlements like Greenland.

===Vinland in Colonial Discourses===
Sverrir Jakobsson notes that there are no contemporary written records of journeys to Vinland - pointing out that the earliest mentions of the location occurred in 1070 and 1120. 

According to Christopher Crocker, the search for Vinland is appropriately contextualized as a form of colonial construction of history. He suggests that centering Norse expeditions to North America play into the Vanishing Indian trope and allow for the continued centering of European historical narratives farther back into the history of North America, at the expense of Indigenous people. He points out that the claims of Beothuck extinction which the Vinland narrative supported were used by British setlers to deny Mi&#x27;kmaq land claims. Anette Kolodny suggests that attempts to situate Vinland in New England &quot;owed much to the fact that, by 1850 and the decades beyond, New England was in decline, and this effort reflected the attempt to recapture glory for the region.

==Life in Vinland==
The main resources that the people of Vinland relied on were wheat, berries, wine and fish. However, the wheat in the Vinlandic context is sandwort and not traditional wheat, and the grapes mentioned are native North American grapes, because the European grape (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;) and wheat (&quot;Triticum&quot; sp.) existing in the New World before the Viking arrival in the tenth century is highly unlikely. Both the sagas reference a river and a lake that had an abundance of fish. The sagas specifically mention salmon, and note how the salmon that was encountered was larger than any salmon they had seen before. 
Before arriving in Vinland, the Norsemen imported their lumber from Norway while in Greenland and had occasional birch trees for firewood. Therefore, the timber they acquired in North America increased their supply of wood.

===Other possible Norse finds===
An authentic late-11th-century Norwegian silver penny, with a hole for stringing on a necklace, was found in Maine. Its discovery by an amateur archaeologist in 1957 is controversial; questions have been raised whether it was planted as a hoax. Numerous artifacts attributed to the Norse have been found in Canada, particularly on Baffin Island and in northern Labrador.

Other claimed Norse artifacts in the area south of the St. Lawrence include a number of stones inscribed with runic letters. The Kensington Runestone was found in Minnesota, but is generally considered a hoax. The authenticity of the Spirit Pond runestones, recovered in Phippsburg, Maine, is also questioned. Other examples are the Heavener Runestone, the Shawnee Runestone, and the Vérendrye Runestone. The age and origin of these stones is debated, and so far none has been firmly dated or associated with clear evidence of a medieval Norse presence. In general, script in the runic alphabet does not in itself guarantee a Viking age or medieval connection, as it has been suggested that Dalecarlian runes have been used until the 20th century.

Point Rosee, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, was thought to be the location of a possible Norse settlement. The site was discovered through satellite imagery in 2014 by Sarah Parcak. In their November 8, 2017, report, which was submitted to the Provincial Archaeology Office in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Sarah Parcak and Gregory &quot;Greg&quot; Mumford wrote that they &quot;found no evidence whatsoever for either a Norse presence or human activity at Point Rosee prior to the historic period&quot; and that &quot;None of the team members, including the Norse specialists, deemed this area as having any traces of human activity.&quot;

<doc id="32546" wikidata="Q826059" url="?curid=32546" title="Vietnamese cuisine">
<text>Vietnamese cuisine encompasses the foods and beverages originated from Vietnam. Meals feature a combination of five fundamental tastes (): sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and spicy. The distinctive nature of each dish reflects one or more elements (such as nutrients and colors), which are also based around a five-pronged philosophy. Vietnamese recipes use ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird&#x27;s eye chili, lime, and Thai basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking has often been characterised as using fresh ingredients, not using much dairy or oil, having interesting textures, and making use of herbs and vegetables. The cuisine is also low in sugar and is almost always naturally gluten-free, as many of the dishes are rice-based instead of wheat-based, made with rice noodles, rice papers and rice flour.

== Historical influences ==
Besides indigenous Vietnamese influences, which are the major core of Vietnamese food, owing to historical contact with China and centuries of sinicization, some Vietnamese dishes share similarities with Chinese cuisine. In culinary traditions, the Chinese introduced to Vietnam several dishes, including &quot;vằn thắn&quot;/&quot;hoành thánh&quot; (wonton), &quot;xá xíu&quot; (&quot;char siu&quot;), &quot;há cảo&quot; (&quot;har gow&quot;), &quot;hủ tiếu&quot; (&quot;shahe fen&quot;), &quot;mì&quot; (wheat noodles), &quot;bò bía&quot; (&quot;popiah&quot;), &quot;bánh quẩy&quot; (&quot;youtiao&quot;), mooncake and &quot;bánh pía&quot; (Suzhou-style mooncake), &quot;bánh tổ&quot; (&quot;nian gao&quot;), &quot;sủi dìn&quot; (&quot;tang yuan&quot;), &quot;bánh bò&quot;, &quot;bánh bao&quot; (&quot;baozi&quot;), &quot;cơm chiên Dương Châu&quot; (Yangzhou fried rice), and &quot;mì xào&quot; (chow mein). The Vietnamese adopted these foods and added their own styles and flavors to the foods. Ethnic minorities in the mountainous region near the China–Vietnam border also adopted some foods from China. Ethnic Tày and Nùng in Lạng Sơn province adopted &quot;thịt lợn quay&quot; (roasted pork) and &quot;khâu nhục&quot; (braised pork belly) from China. Some New World vegetables, such as chili peppers and corn (maize), also made their way to Vietnam from the Ming dynasty.

The French introduced baguettes to Vietnam, which were combined with Vietnamese stuffing to become a popular fast food in Vietnam called &quot;bánh mì thịt&quot;, known overseas as &quot;Vietnamese baguettes&quot;. &quot;Bánh mì&quot; is just the bread, whereas &quot;thịt&quot; implies meat or stuffing. The French also introduced Vietnam to onions, potatoes, broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, lettuce, tarragon, carrot, artichoke, asparagus, and coffee.

The western-introduced ingredients often have a name derived from a similar native Vietnamese ingredient, then adding the word &quot;tây&quot; (meaning &quot;western&quot;). Onions are called &quot;hành tây&quot; (literally &quot;western shallots&quot;), asparagus as &quot;măng tây&quot; (western bamboo shoots) and potatoes are called &quot;khoai tây&quot; (western yam) in Vietnamese, which reflects their origin before arriving in Vietnam. French-influenced dishes are numerous and not limited to: &quot;sa lát&quot; (salad), &quot;pâté&quot;, &quot;patê sô&quot; (a Brittany pasty called &quot;pâté chaud&quot;), &quot;bánh sừng trâu/bánh sừng bò&quot; (croissant), &quot;bánh flan&quot;, y&quot;a ua&quot; (yogurt), &quot;rôti&quot; (rotisserie), &quot;bơ&quot; (butter), &quot;vịt nấu cam&quot; (duck à l&#x27;orange), &quot;ốp lết&quot; (omelette), &quot;ốp la&quot; (&quot;œufs au plat&quot;), &quot;phá xí&quot; (farcies), &quot;bít tết&quot; (beefsteak), &quot;sốt vang&quot; (cooking with wine), &quot;dăm bông&quot; (&quot;jambon&quot;), and &quot;xúc xích&quot; (&quot;saucisse&quot;). Owing to influences from French colonial rule, the French Indochinese countries of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia have several shared dishes and beverages, including baguettes and coffee. The French also introduced the use of dairy products in Vietnamese-French fusion dishes.

Vietnamese cuisine also has influences from Champa, Malaysia and Cambodia. The use of coconut milk and various central dishes such as &quot;bánh khọt&quot; were influenced by Cham cuisine. Spices including curries were also introduced to Vietnam by Malay and Indian traders. Though not common in the north, &quot;cà ri&quot; is a quite popular dish in central and southern Vietnam. The most common form is chicken curry, and to a lesser extent, goat curry. Chicken curry is an indispensable dish in many social gathering events, such as weddings, funerals, graduations, and the yearly death anniversary of a loved one. Similar to Cambodia, curry in Vietnam is eaten either with bread, steamed rice, or round rice noodles (rice vermicelli). &quot;Mắm bồ hóc&quot; or prahok, adopted from ethnic Khmer in Southern Vietnam, is used as a central ingredient of a Vietnamese rice noodle soup called &quot;bún nước lèo&quot; which originated with ethnic Khmers in Vietnam and is not found in Cambodia.

Owing to contact with previous communist countries from Eastern Europe, the Vietnamese adopted dishes such as stuffed cabbage soup, &quot;sa lát Nga&quot; (Olivier salad) and &quot;bia Tiệp&quot; (Czech beer).

== Regional cuisines ==

The mainstream culinary traditions in all three regions of Vietnam share some fundamental features:
* Freshness of food: Most meats are only briefly cooked. Vegetables are eaten fresh; if they are cooked, they are boiled or only briefly stir-fried.
* Presence of herbs and vegetables: Herbs and vegetables are essential to many Vietnamese dishes and are often abundantly used.
* Variety and harmony of textures: Crisp with soft, watery with crunchy, delicate with rough.
* Broths or soup-based dishes are common in all three regions.
* Presentation: The condiments accompanying Vietnamese meals are usually colorful and arranged in eye-pleasing manners.

While sharing some key features, Vietnamese culinary tradition differs from region to region.

In northern Vietnam, a colder climate limits the production and availability of spices. As a result, the foods there are often less spicy than those in other regions. Black pepper is used in place of chilies as the most popular ingredient to produce spicy flavors. In general, northern Vietnamese cuisine is not bold in any particular taste—sweet, salty, spicy, bitter, or sour. Most northern Vietnamese foods feature light and balanced flavors that result from subtle combinations of many different flavoring ingredients. The use of meats such as pork, beef, and chicken were relatively limited in the past. Freshwater fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, such as prawns/shrimp, squids, crabs, clams, and mussels, are widely used. Many notable dishes of northern Vietnam are crab-centered (e.g., &quot;bún riêu&quot;). Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce, and limes are among the main flavoring ingredients. Being the cradle of Vietnamese civilization, northern Vietnam produces many signature dishes of Vietnam, such as &quot;bún riêu&quot; and &quot;bánh cuốn&quot;, which were carried to central and southern Vietnam through Vietnamese migration. Other famous Vietnamese dishes that originated from the north, particularly from Hanoi include &quot;&quot;bún chả&quot;&quot; (rice noodle with grilled marinated pork), &quot;phở gà&quot; (chicken soup with rice noodles), &quot;chả cá Lã Vọng&quot; (rice noodle with grilled fish).

The abundance of spices produced by Central Vietnam&#x27;s mountainous terrain makes this region&#x27;s cuisine notable for its spicy food, which sets it apart from the two other regions of Vietnam, where foods are mostly not spicy. Once the capital of the last dynasty of Vietnam, Huế&#x27;s culinary tradition features highly decorative and colorful food, reflecting the influence of ancient Vietnamese royal cuisine. The region&#x27;s cuisine is also notable for its sophisticated meals consisting of many complex dishes served in small portions. Chili peppers and shrimp sauces are among the frequently used ingredients. Some Vietnamese signature dishes produced in central Vietnam are &quot;bún bò Huế&quot; and &quot;bánh khoái&quot;.

The warm weather and fertile soil of southern Vietnam create an ideal condition for growing a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and livestock. As a result, foods in southern Vietnam are often vibrant and flavorful, with liberal uses of garlic, shallots, and fresh herbs. Sugar is added to food more than in the other regions. The preference for sweetness in southern Vietnam can also be seen through the widespread use of coconut milk in southern Vietnamese cuisine. Vast shorelines make seafood a natural staple for people in this region. Some signature seafood dishes from southern Vietnam include &quot;bánh khọt&quot; and &quot;bún mắm&quot;.

The Mekong Delta cuisine relies heavily on fresh products which is abundant in the new land with heavy use of palm sugar, fermented fishes, seafoods and wild herbs and flowers. The history of the region being a newly settled area reflects on its cuisine, with &quot;Ẩm thực khẩn hoang&quot; or Settlers cuisine means dishes are prepared fresh from wild and newly-caught ingredients. The cuisine is also influenced by Khmer, Cham and Chinese settlers.

The cuisine of the Northern and Central Highlands regions is influenced by tribal traditions, with items such as &quot;thắng cố&quot; (Hmong horse stew), dried meats, &quot;cơm lam&quot; and &quot;rượu cần&quot;.

== Relation to Vietnamese philosophy ==
Vietnamese cuisine always has five elements which are known for its balance in each of these features.

* Many Vietnamese dishes include five fundamental taste senses (): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth), corresponding to five organs (): gall bladder, small intestine, large intestine, stomach, and urinary bladder.
* Vietnamese dishes also include five types of nutrients (): powder, water or liquid, mineral elements, protein, and fat.
* Vietnamese cooks try to have five colours () in their dishes: white (metal), green (wood), yellow (earth), red (fire) and black (water).
* Dishes in Vietnam appeal to gastronomes via the five senses (): food arrangement attracts the eyes, sounds come from crisp ingredients, five spices are detected on the tongue, aromatic ingredients coming mainly from herbs stimulate the nose, and some meals, especially finger food, can be perceived by touching.

=== Five-element correspondence ===

Vietnamese cuisine is influenced by the Asian principle of five elements and &quot;mahābhūta&quot;.

=== Yin-yang balance ===
The principle of yin and yang () is applied in composing a meal in a way that provides a balance that is beneficial for the body. While contrasting texture and flavors are important, the principle primarily concerns the &quot;heating&quot; and &quot;cooling&quot; properties of ingredients. Certain dishes are served in their respective seasons to provide contrasts in temperature and spiciness of the food and environment. Some examples are:
* Duck meat, considered &quot;cool&quot;, is served during the hot summer with ginger fish sauce, which is &quot;warm&quot;. Conversely, chicken, which is &quot;warm&quot;, and pork, which is &quot;hot&quot;, are eaten in the winter.
* Seafoods ranging from &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;cold&quot; are suitable to use with ginger (&quot;warm&quot;).
* Spicy foods (&quot;hot&quot;) are typically balanced with sourness, which is considered &quot;cool&quot;.
* Balut (), meaning &quot;upside-down egg&quot; (&quot;cold&quot;), must be combined with Vietnamese mint () (&quot;hot&quot;).
== Food in relation to lifestyle ==

Vietnamese cuisine is reflective of the Vietnamese lifestyle, from the preparation to how the food is served. Going through long phases of war and political conflict, as well as cultural shifts, the vast majority of the Vietnamese people have been living in poverty. Therefore, the ingredients for Vietnamese food are often very inexpensive but nonetheless, the way they are cooked together to create a yin–yang balance makes the food simple in appearance but rich in flavor.

Because of economic conditions, maximizing the use of ingredients to save money has become a tradition in Vietnamese cooking. In earlier decades and even nowadays in rural areas, every part of a cow is used, from the muscle meat to the intestines; nothing is wasted. The higher quality cuts from farmed animals (cows, pigs) would be cooked in stirfry, soup or other dishes, while the secondary cuts would be used in blood sausages or soup. The same goes for vegetables like scallions: the leafy part is diced into small bits which are used to add flavor to the food while the crunchy stalk and roots are replanted.

 (fish sauce) is the most commonly used and iconic condiment in Vietnamese cooking. It is made from fermented raw fish and is served with most of the Vietnamese dishes. Vietnamese cuisines are not known for ingredients with top quality, but rather for the very inexpensive and simple scraps that are creatively mixed to create dishes with bold flavor. A traditional southern Vietnamese meal usually includes (plain white rice), (catfish in a clay pot), (sour soup with snakehead fish), and it would be incomplete without fish sauce served as a condiment. Dishes are prepared less with an appearance in mind but are served family-style to bring everyone together after a long day of work. Cooking and then serving fish in the same clay pot has been proven to be an ancient tradition.

Despite being a small country in Southeast Asia, the foods from each region in Vietnam carry their distinctive and unique characteristics that reflect the geographical and living conditions of the people there. The traditional southern Vietnamese meal is made up of fresh ingredients that only the fertile Mekong Delta could provide, such as , and a wide range of tropical fruit like mangosteen, mango, and dragon fruit. The southern-style diet is very &#x27;green&#x27;, with vegetables, fish and tropical fruits as the main ingredients.

Central Vietnam is the region in which food is prepared with the strongest, boldest flavors. This region is constantly under harsh weather conditions throughout the year, so people there do not have as many green ingredients as others do in the north and south of Vietnam. Instead, the coastline around the central Vietnam area is known for its salt and fish sauce industries; these two condiments are central to their daily diets.

Northern Vietnamese cuisine has a strong Chinese influence, and its iconic dish is . While rice is a staple in the southern Vietnamese diet, the north has a preference for noodles. Owing to the drastic differences in climate and lifestyles throughout the three main regions of Vietnam, the foods vary. Northern Vietnamese cooking is the least bold and spicy in flavor compared to the foods from central and southern Vietnam.

=== Typical Vietnamese family meal ===

Daily meals of Vietnamese people are quite different from Vietnamese foods served in restaurants or stalls. A typical meal for the average Vietnamese family would include:
* &quot;Cơm trắng&quot;: Cooked white rice
* &quot;Món mặn&quot; or main dishes to eat with rice: Fish/seafood, meat, tofu (grilled, boiled, steamed, stewed or stir-fried with vegetables)
* &quot;Rau&quot;: Sauteed, boiled or raw fresh green vegetables
* &quot;Canh&quot; (a clear broth with vegetables and often meat or seafood) or other kinds of soup
* &quot;Nước chấm&quot;: Dipping sauces and condiments depending on the main dishes, such as pure fish sauce, ginger fish sauce, tamarind fish sauce, soy sauce, &quot;muối tiêu chanh&quot; (salt and pepper with lime juice) or &quot;muối ớt&quot; (salt and chili)
* Small dish of relishes, such as salted eggplant, pickled white cabbage, pickled papaya, pickled garlic or pickled bean sprouts
* &quot;Tráng miệng&quot; or desserts: Fresh fruits, drinks or sweets, such as &quot;chè&quot;.

Except individual bowls of rice, all dishes are communal and are to be shared in the middle of the table. It is also customary for younger people to ask/wait for the elders to eat first and for the woman who sits directly next to the rice pot to serve rice for other people. People should &quot;invite&quot; the others to enjoy the meal (somehow similar to saying &quot;Enjoy your meal&quot;), in order from the elders to younger people. They also pick up food for each other as an action of care.

=== Feast ===

A feast (, ) is a significant event for families or villages, usually up to 12 people for each table. A feast is prepared for weddings, funerals, and festivals, including the longevity-wishing ceremony. In a feast, ordinary foods are not served, but boiled rice is still used.

A Vietnamese feast has two courses: the main course (—salty dish) and dessert (—sweet dish). All dishes, except for individual bowls of rice, are enjoyed collectively. All main course dishes are served simultaneously rather than one after another. The major dish of the main course is placed in the center of the tables, usually big pots of soup or a hot pot.

A basic feast () consists of 10 dishes: five in bowls (): (dried and fried pork skin), (cellophane noodles), (bamboo shoot), (meatball), or (bird or chicken stew dishes) and five on plates (): (Vietnamese sausage), , or (boiled chicken or duck), (Vietnamese salad) and (stir-fried dishes). This kind of feast is traditional and is organized only in northern Vietnam. Other variations are found in central and southern Vietnam.

Four dishes essential in the feast of Tết are (spring rolls), (in northern Vietnam, refers to a spring roll called or ; in southern Vietnam, mainly refer to , fermented pork rolls), (stew dishes) and (noodle soup). At this time, the feast for offering ancestors includes sticky rice, boiled chicken, Vietnamese rice wine, and other foods preferred by ancestors. Gifts are given before guests leave the feast.

=== Royal cuisine ===

In the Nguyễn dynasty, the 50 best chefs from all over the kingdom were selected for the board to serve the king. There were three meals per day—12 dishes at breakfast and 66 dishes for lunch and dinner (including 50 main dishes and 16 sweets). An essential dish was bird&#x27;s nest soup (). Other dishes included shark fin (), abalone (), deer&#x27;s tendon (), bears&#x27; hands (), and rhinoceros&#x27; skin (). Water had to come from the well, the pagoda, the well (near the base of &quot;&quot; mountain), or from the source of the River. Rice was the variety from the imperial rice field. clay pots for cooking rice were used only a single time before disposal. No one was allowed to have any contact with the cooked dishes except for the cooks and board members. The dishes were first served to eunuchs, then the king&#x27;s wives, after which they were offered to the king. The king enjoyed meals () alone in a comfortable, music-filled space.

== Cultural importance ==
Salt is used as the connection between the worlds of the living and the dead. &quot;Bánh phu thê&quot; is used to remind new couples of perfection and harmony at their weddings. Food is often placed at the ancestral altar as an offering to the dead on special occasions (such as Lunar New Year). Cooking and eating play an extremely important role in Vietnamese culture.

=== Proverbs ===
The word &quot;ăn&quot; (to eat) is included in a great number of proverbs and has a large range of semantic extensions.
* (&quot;Checking the status of the rice pot when eating, watch where/what direction you are sitting.&quot;) = Be careful of possible faux pas.
* = living in accordance to one&#x27;s limit and social circumstance (Eat according to the season; live according to the season)
* (&quot;The father eats salty food, the children go thirsty.&quot;) = Bad actions will later bring bad luck/consequences to descendants.
* (&quot;Chewing carefully [makes one] feel full longer, ploughing deep is good for the rice&quot;) = Careful execution brings better results than hasty actions.
* (&quot;Learning how to eat, how to speak, how to wrap, how to open&quot;) = Everything needs to be learned, even the simplest, start from &quot;how to eat&quot; politely.

Many Vietnamese idioms reflect the sex-is-eating mapping:
* (&quot;He eats meatballs, she eats springrolls&quot;) = Both husband and wife are having affairs.
* (&quot;Tired of rice, craving noodle soup&quot;) = A man gets bored of his wife and find another girl.
* (&quot;You eat snack, you pay money&quot;) = Pay before having sex with prostitutes. (Long story short, &quot;bánh&quot; is a metaphor for the prostitute)
* (&quot;Eating on the sly without cleaning your mouth&quot;) = Committing adultery but left trace

== International popularity ==
Outside of Vietnam, Vietnamese cuisine is widely available in countries with strong Vietnamese immigrant communities, such as Australia, the United States, Canada, and France. Vietnamese cuisine is also popular in Japan, Korea, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland, Philippines and Russia, and in areas with dense Asian populations.

Television shows featuring Vietnamese food have increased in popularity. Luke Nguyen from Australia currently features a television show, &quot;Luke Nguyen&#x27;s Vietnam&quot;, dedicated on showcasing and instructing how to cook Vietnamese dishes.

On &quot;The Great Food Truck Race&quot;, a Vietnamese sandwich truck called Nom Nom Truck received the most money in the first five episodes.

Anthony Bourdain wrote: You don&#x27;t have to go looking for great food in Vietnam. Great food finds you. It&#x27;s everywhere. In restaurants, cafes, little storefronts, in the streets; carried in makeshift portable kitchens on yokes borne by women vendors. Your cyclo-driver will invite you to his home; your guide will want to bring you to his favorite place. Strangers will rush up and offer you a taste of something they&#x27;re proud of and think you should know about. It&#x27;s a country filled with proud cooks—and passionate eaters.

Gordon Ramsay visited Vietnam in his reality show &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Great Escape&quot; – S02E02 (2011) and fell in love with the taste of the culinary here. Especially the dish called Hủ tiếu Mì by Mrs. Dì Hai, prepped and served on a small boat in Cái Răng floating market, Cần Thơ. He even praised it as &quot;The greatest dish I have ever eaten&quot; when he brought it up as one of the dishes for the elimination challenge for the top 5 finalists of &quot;American MasterChef&quot; season 4 episode 21.

== Vietnamese utensils ==

== Common ingredients ==
=== Vegetables ===

=== Fruits ===

=== Herbs (&quot;rau thơm&quot;) ===

== Condiments and sauces ==
=== Condiments ===

Vietnamese usually use raw vegetables, &quot;rau sống&quot;, or &quot;rau ghém&quot; (sliced vegetable) as condiments for their dishes to combine properly with each main dish in flavour. Dishes in which &quot;rau sống&quot; is indispensable are &quot;bánh xèo&quot; and hot pot. The vegetables principally are herbs and wild edible vegetables gathered from forests and family gardens. Leaves and buds are the most common parts of vegetables used. Most of the vegetables have medicinal value.

&quot;Rau sống&quot; includes lettuce, raw bean sprout, herbs, shredded banana flower, green banana, water spinach, mango bud and guava leaves.

==== Herbs and spices ====

* Coriander and green onion leaves can be found in most Vietnamese dishes.
* A basic technique of stir-frying vegetable is frying garlic or shallot with oil before putting the vegetable into the pan.
* In northern Vietnam, dishes with fish may be garnished with dill.
* In central Vietnam, the mixture of ground lemongrass and chili pepper is frequently used in dishes with beef.
* In southern Vietnam, coconut water is used in most stew dishes.
* The pair culantro (&quot;ngò gai&quot;) and rice paddy herb (&quot;ngò om&quot; or &quot;ngổ&quot;) is indispensable in all kinds of sour soups in the southern Vietnam.
* Spearmint is often used with strongly fishy dishes.
* Perilla is usually used with crab dishes.

==== Pairing ====
* Chicken dishes are combined with lime leaves.
* Crab and seashell dishes are combined with fishy-smelling herb and perilla.
* Dishes reputed as &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;fishy-smelling&quot;, such as catfish, clams, or snails, are combined with ginger or lemongrass.
* Beef dishes are combined with celeries or pineapples.

=== Sauces ===
* &quot;Nước chấm&quot;
* &quot;Mắm tôm&quot; (shrimp paste)
* &quot;Nước mắm&quot; (fish extract) can be used as it is or mixed with lemon juice, garlic, vinegar, sugar, and chili. This mixture is called &quot;nước mắm pha&quot;.
* &quot;Tương&quot; is made from fermented soybeans.
* Soy sauce mostly is used in marinades and sauces.
* Hoisin sauce is used in Southern Vietnam to mix with &quot;phở&quot; while serving.
* Hot chili sauce.

=== Food colourings ===

Traditionally, the colouring of Vietnamese food comes from natural ingredients; however, today there is an increase in the use of artificial food dye agents for food colouring, in Vietnam.
* Red – usually from beetroot or by frying annatto seeds to make oil (&quot;dầu điều&quot;)
* Orange – usually used for sticky rice, comes from &quot;gac&quot;
* Yellow – from turmeric
* Green – from the pandan leaf or &quot;katuk&quot;
* Purple – from the magenta plant (&quot;lá cẩm&quot;)
* Black – in &quot;banh gai&quot; is from the ramie leaf (&quot;lá gai&quot;)
* Dark brown – for stew dishes, uses &quot;nước màu&quot; or &quot;nước hàng&quot;, which is made by heating sugar to a temperature above that of caramel (170 °C).

Colourings can be absorbed by mixing ground colourings or colouring liquid or wrapping before boiling to get the extracts. When colouring dishes, the tastes and smells of colourings must also be considered.

== Popular dishes ==
When Vietnamese dishes are referred to in English, it is generally by the Vietnamese name without the diacritics. Some dishes have gained descriptive English names, as well.

Popular Vietnamese dishes include:

=== Noodle soups ===

Vietnamese cuisine boasts a huge variety of noodle soups, each with distinct influences, origins and flavours. A common characteristic of many of these soups is a rich broth.
=== Soup and &quot;cháo&quot; (congees) ===

=== Rice dishes ===

=== Sticky rice dishes ===

=== Bánh ===

The Vietnamese name for pastries is &quot;bánh&quot;. Many of the pastries are wrapped in various leaves (bamboo, banana, &quot;dong&quot;, &quot;gai&quot;) and boiled or steamed. One of the historic dishes, dating to the mythical founding of the Vietnamese state is &quot;bánh chưng&quot;. As it is a savory dish and thus not a true pastry, &quot;bánh chưng&quot; and the accompanying &quot;bánh dày&quot; are laden with heaven and earth symbolism. These dishes are associated with offerings around the Vietnamese New Year (&quot;Tết&quot;). Additionally, as a legacy of French colonial rule and influence, bûche de Noël is a popular dessert served during the Christmas season.


=== Wraps and rolls ===


&quot;Bánh tráng&quot; can be understood as either of the following:
* &quot;Bánh tráng cuốn&quot;
: Thin rice flour sheet dried into what is commonly called &quot;rice paper&quot;, used in making spring roll (&quot;chả giò&quot;), and summer rolls (&quot;gỏi cuốn&quot;) by applying some water to soften the texture
* &quot;Bánh tráng nướng&quot; (in the south), or &quot;bánh đa&quot; in the north
: These are large, round, flat rice crackers, which, when heated, enlarge into round, easily shattered pieces. They can be eaten separately, although they are most commonly added into the vermicelli noodle dishes like &quot;cao lầu&quot; and &quot;mì quảng&quot;. Many types of &quot;bánh tráng&quot; exist, including the clear sesame seed ones, prawn-like cracker with dried spring onions, and sweet milk.

=== Sandwiches and pastries ===


=== Meat dishes ===


=== Seafood dishes ===

=== Salads ===

&quot;Nộm&quot; (Northern dialects) or &quot;Gỏi&quot; (Southern dialects) is Vietnamese salad; of the many varieties, the most popular include:
=== Curries ===
* Vietnamese curry is also popular, especially in the center and south, owing to the cultural influence of Indian, Khmer and Malay traders.
* Another type of well-known Vietnamese curry is beef brisket curry or oxtail curry. The beef curries are often served with French bread for dipping, or with rice.
* &quot; Cà ri gà&quot; is a popular Vietnamese curry made with chicken, carrots, sweet potatoes, and peas in a coconut curry sauce. It is also served with rice or baguette.

=== Preserved dishes ===
&quot;Muối&quot; (literally means &quot;salting&quot;) and &quot;chua&quot; (literally means &quot;sour&quot; or &quot;fermenting&quot;) are Vietnamese term for preserved dishes. Monsoon tropical climate with abundant rainfall gives the Vietnamese a generous year-round supply of vegetables. Animal husbandry never occurred in large scale in Vietnamese history, therefore, preserved dishes are mainly plant-based pickled dishes. Seafood is often made into a fermented form called &quot;mắm&quot; like fish sauce. 

=== Mắm ===
&quot;Mắm&quot; is a Vietnamese term for fermented fish, shrimp or other aquatic ingredients. It is used as main course, as an ingredient or as condiment. The types of fish most commonly used to make &quot;mắm&quot; are anchovies, catfish, snakeheads, and mackerels. The fish flesh remains intact (this is how it is different from &quot;nước mắm&quot;), and can be eaten cooked or uncooked, with or without vegetables and condiments. Fish sauce is literally called &quot;mắm water&quot; in Vietnamese and is the distilled liquid from the process of fermentation of mắm.


=== Fermented meat dishes ===

&quot;Nem chua&quot;, a Vietnamese fermented meat served as is or fried, is made from pork meat, coated by fried rice (&quot;thính gạo&quot;), mixed with pork skin and then wrapped in country gooseberry leaves (&quot;lá chùm ruột&quot;) or &quot;Erythrina orientalis&quot; leaves (&quot;lá vông nem&quot;). The preservation process takes about three to five days.

=== Sausages ===

Vietnamese sausage, &quot;giò&quot;, is usually made from fresh ground pork and beef. Sausage makers may use the meat, skin or ear. Fish sauce is added before banana leaves are used to wrap the mixture. The last step is boiling. For common sausage, 1 kg of meat is boiled for an hour. For &quot;chả quế&quot;, the boiled meat mixture will then be roasted with cinnamon.

=== Vegetarian dishes ===
Vegetarian dishes in Vietnam often have the same names as their meat equivalents, e.g. &quot;phở bò&quot;, but with &quot;chay&quot; (vegetarian) sign in front, those dishes are served with tofu instead of meat. Nearly every soup, sandwich and street food has its vegetarian correspondent. Sometimes you can also see notations like &quot;phở chay&quot;, &quot;bánh mì chay&quot; (vegetarian sandwich) or &quot;cơm chay&quot; (vegetarian rice). Vegetarian food in comparison the normal dishes are almost always cheaper, often half of the normal price. Vegetarian restaurants are mostly frequented by religious Vietnamese people and are rarely found in touristic areas. Vegetarian food is also eaten to earn luck during special holiday and festival, especially during Lunar New Year where Vietnamese culture serve vegetarian food regardless of their religion.

=== Desserts ===

=== Mứt ===

Vietnamese use fruits in season. When the season is passing, they make candied fruit, called &quot;ô mai&quot;, and fruit preserves, called &quot;mứt&quot;. The original taste of &quot;ô mai&quot; is sour, sweet, salty, and spicy. The most famous kind of &quot;ô mai&quot; is &quot;ô mai mơ&quot;, made from apricots harvested from the forest around Perfume Pagoda (&quot;Chùa Hương&quot;), Hà Tây province. This &quot;ô mai&quot; consists of apricot covered by ginger, sugar, and liquorice root slivers.

=== Tofu ===

Tofu (&quot;đậu phụ&quot;) is widely used in Vietnamese cuisine. It is boiled, fried (sprinkled with ground shrimp or oil-dipped minced spring onion) or used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes.

Other soybean products range from soy sauce (&quot;nước tương&quot;; usually light soy sauce), fermented bean paste (&quot;tương&quot;), and fermented bean curd (&quot;đậu phụ nhự&quot; or &quot;chao&quot;) to douhua (soft tofu sweet soup; &quot;tàu hũ nước đường&quot; or &quot;tào phớ&quot;).

=== Bò kho ===
Bo kho is a dish made from beef with a stewing method, originating from the South of Vietnam. Originally, Southern Vietnamese people served Bo kho with many kinds of herbs to enhance the flavor of the dish. Although it is called &quot;kho&quot; (meaning &quot;to stew&quot;), the main cooking method of the dish is braising. The stewing method is used to marinate and tenderize the beef before braising.

=== Phở ===
Phở is a traditional Vietnamese dish originating from Van Cu, Nam Định province. It is traditionally served with a variety of herbs to enhance its flavor. Nowadays, there are many different ways to prepare and flavor phở. In Vietnam, there are different names to distinguish them: Northern phở (in the North), Huế phở (in the Central region), and Saigon phở (in the South). In 2016, the Japanese chose April 4 of each year as Vietnam&#x27;s Phở Day in Japan. In Vietnam, on December 12, 2017, Tuổi Trẻ newspaper cooperated with Acecook Vietnam Company to organize the first Phở Day. This will be an annual traditional activity. Since 2018, &quot;Phở Day&quot; will be organized as a community cultural and tourism activity.

== Exotic dishes ==

The use of ingredients typically uncommon or taboo in most countries is one of the quintessential attributes that make Vietnamese cuisine unique. While unusual ingredients can only be found in exotic restaurants in many countries, Vietnamese cuisine is deemed atypical in that the usage of these ingredients can play a customary role in daily family dishes regardless of social class.

A common and inexpensive breakfast dish that can be found in any wet market, balut (&quot;hột vịt lộn&quot;) is a fertilized duck egg with a nearly developed embryo inside, which is boiled and eaten in the shell. It is typically served with fresh herbs: &quot;rau răm&quot;, salt, and black pepper; lime juice is another popular additive, when available. A more unusual version of balut dish—fetus quail (&quot;trứng cút lộn&quot;) is a snack favored by many Vietnamese students. Paddy crab and paddy snail are the main ingredients in &quot;bún riêu ốc&quot;—a popular noodle dish—and in some everyday soup dishes (&quot;canh&quot;) and braised food (&quot;món bung&quot;). Family meals with silkworms (&quot;nhộng&quot;), banana flowers (&quot;hoa chuối&quot;), sparrows, doves, fermented fish and shrimp (&quot;mắm cá&quot;, &quot;mắm tôm&quot;, &quot;mắm tép&quot;) are not rare sights. Seasonal favorites include ragworms (&quot;rươi&quot;), which are made into many dishes such as fried &quot;rươi&quot; omelet (&quot;chả rươi&quot;), fermented &quot;rươi&quot; sauce (&quot;mắm rươi)&quot;, steamed &quot;rươi (rươi hấp)&quot;, stir-fried &quot;rươi&quot; with radish or bamboo shoot &quot;(&quot;rươi xào củ niễng măng tươi hay củ cải&quot;).&quot; Three-striped crab &quot;(&quot;ba khía)&quot;&quot; is popular in several southern provinces, including Cà Mau, Sóc Trăng and Bạc Liêu; it is eaten fermented, stir-fried or steamed&quot;.&quot;

Northern Vietnamese cuisine is also notable for its wide range of meat choices. Exotic meats such as dog meat, cat meat, rat meat, snake meat, soft-shell turtle, deer, and domestic goat are sold in street-side restaurants and generally paired with alcoholic beverages. A taboo in many Western countries and in southern Vietnam, consumption of dog meat and cat meat is common throughout the northern part of the country and is believed to raise the libido in men. Television chef Andrew Zimmern visited northern Vietnam in the 12th episode of his popular show &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;. Cobra beating heart and dried bones, silkworms, and bull penis are some of the dishes he sampled. He also tried porcupine.

Paddy mouse meat—barbecued, braised, stir- or deep-fried—is a delicacy dish that can be found in Southern Vietnamese rural areas or even high-end city restaurants.

Crocodiles were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese.

Shark fins are imported in massive amounts by Vietnam.

Anthony Bourdain, the host chef of Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, wrote in April 2005: &quot;...everything is used—and nothing wasted in Vietnam.&quot; Animal parts that are often disposed of in many Western countries are used fully in Vietnamese cooking. Organs, including lungs, livers, hearts, intestines and bladders of pigs, cattle, and chickens are sold at even higher prices than their meat. Chicken testicles and undeveloped eggs are stir-fried with vegetables and served as an everyday dish.

Many of the traditional northern Lunar New Year dishes such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;giò thủ&quot;, and &quot;canh măng móng giò&quot; involve the use of pig heads, tongues, throats and feet. Pig and beef tails, as well as chicken heads, necks and feet, are Vietnamese favorite beer dishes. &quot;Bóng bì&quot;, used as an ingredient in &quot;canh bóng&quot;—a kind of soup, is pig skin baked until popped. Steamed pig brains can be found almost everywhere. Also in the northern part of Vietnam, different kinds of animal blood can be made into a dish called &quot;tiết canh&quot; by whisking the blood with fish sauce and cold water in a shallow dish along with finely chopped, cooked duck innards (such as gizzards), sprinkled with crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. It is then cooled until the blood coagulates into a soft, jelly-like mixture and served raw.

Coconut worms, or &quot;đuông dừa&quot;, is a delicacy found widely in the Trà Vinh province of Vietnam. They are the larvae form of the palm weevil and are eaten live within a salty fish sauce with chili peppers.

<doc id="32549" wikidata="Q25428" url="?curid=32549" title="Voltage">
<text>Voltage, also known as (electrical) potential difference, electric pressure, or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points. In a static electric field, it corresponds to the work needed per unit of charge to move a positive test charge from the first point to the second point. In the International System of Units (SI), the derived unit for voltage is the &quot;volt (V)&quot;.

The voltage between points can be caused by the build-up of electric charge (e.g., a capacitor), and from an electromotive force (e.g., electromagnetic induction in a generator). On a macroscopic scale, a potential difference can be caused by electrochemical processes (e.g., cells and batteries), the pressure-induced piezoelectric effect, and the thermoelectric effect. Since it is the difference in electric potential, it is a physical scalar quantity.

A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage between two points in a system. Often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. In this case, voltage is often mentioned at a point without completely mentioning the other measurement point. A voltage can be associated with either a source of energy or the loss, dissipation, or storage of energy.

==Definition==
The SI unit of work per unit charge is the joule per coulomb, where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb of charge. The old SI definition for &quot;volt&quot; used power and current; starting in 1990, the quantum Hall and Josephson effect were used, and in 2019 physical constants were given defined values for the definition of all SI units.

Voltage is denoted symbolically by formula_1, simplified &quot;V&quot;, especially in English-speaking countries. Internationally, the symbol &quot;U&quot; is standardized. It is used, for instance, in the context of Ohm&#x27;s or Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws.

The electrochemical potential is the voltage that can be directly measured with a voltmeter. The Galvani potential that exists in structures with junctions of dissimilar materials is also work per charge but cannot be measured with a voltmeter in the external circuit (see ).

Voltage is defined so that negatively charged objects are pulled towards higher voltages, while positively charged objects are pulled towards lower voltages. Therefore, the conventional current in a wire or resistor always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage.

Historically, voltage has been referred to using terms like &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;pressure&quot;. Even today, the term &quot;tension&quot; is still used, for example within the phrase &quot;high tension&quot; (HT) which is commonly used in the contexts of automotive electronics and systems using thermionic valves (vacuum tubes).

=== Electrostatics ===


In electrostatics, the voltage increase from point formula_2 to some point formula_3 is given by the change in electrostatic potential formula_4 from formula_2 to formula_3. By definition, this is:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the intensity of the electric field.

In this case, the voltage increase from point A to point B is equal to the work done per unit charge, against the electric field, to move the charge from A to B without causing any acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as the line integral of the electric field along that path. In electrostatics, this line integral is independent of the path taken.

Under this definition, any circuit where there are time-varying magnetic fields, such as AC circuits, will not have a well-defined voltage between nodes in the circuit, since the electric force is not a conservative force in those cases. However, at lower frequencies when the electric and magnetic fields are not rapidly changing, this can be neglected (see electrostatic approximation).

=== Electrodynamics ===

The electric potential can be generalized to electrodynamics, so that differences in electric potential between points are well-defined even in the presence of time-varying fields. However, unlike in electrostatics, the electric field can no longer be expressed only in terms of the electric potential. Furthermore, the potential is no longer uniquely determined up to a constant, and can take significantly different forms depending on the choice of gauge.

In this general case, some authors use the word &quot;voltage&quot; to refer to the line integral of the electric field, rather than to differences in electric potential. In this case, the voltage rise along some path formula_9 from formula_2 to formula_3 is given by:
:formula_12
However, in this case the &quot;voltage&quot; between two points depends on the path taken.

=== Circuit theory ===
In circuit analysis and electrical engineering, lumped element models are used to represent and analyze circuits. These elements are idealized and self-contained circuit elements used to model physical components.

When using a lumped element model, it is assumed that the effects of changing magnetic fields produced by the circuit are suitably contained to each element. Under these assumptions, the electric field in the region exterior to each component is conservative, and voltages between nodes in the circuit are well-defined, where

:formula_13

as long as the path of integration does not pass through the inside of any component. The above is the same formula used in electrostatics. This integral, with the path of integration being along the test leads, is what a voltmeter will actually measure.

If uncontained magnetic fields throughout the circuit are not negligible, then their effects can be modelled by adding mutual inductance elements. In the case of a physical inductor though, the ideal lumped representation is often accurate. This is because the external fields of inductors are generally negligible, especially if the inductor has a closed magnetic path. If external fields are negligible, we find that

:formula_14

is path-independent, and there is a well-defined voltage across the inductor&#x27;s terminals. This is the reason that measurements with a voltmeter across an inductor are often reasonably independent of the placement of the test leads.

==Volt==

The volt (symbol: ) is the derived unit for electric potential, voltage, and electromotive force. The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery.

==Hydraulic analogy==
A simple analogy for an electric circuit is water flowing in a closed circuit of pipework, driven by a mechanical pump. This can be called a &quot;water circuit&quot;. The potential difference between two points corresponds to the pressure difference between two points. If the pump creates a pressure difference between two points, then water flowing from one point to the other will be able to do work, such as driving a turbine. Similarly, work can be done by an electric current driven by the potential difference provided by a battery. For example, the voltage provided by a sufficiently-charged automobile battery can &quot;push&quot; a large current through the windings of an automobile&#x27;s starter motor. If the pump is not working, it produces no pressure difference, and the turbine will not rotate. Likewise, if the automobile&#x27;s battery is very weak or &quot;dead&quot; (or &quot;flat&quot;), then it will not turn the starter motor.

The hydraulic analogy is a useful way of understanding many electrical concepts. In such a system, the work done to move water is equal to the &quot;pressure drop&quot; (compare p.d.) multiplied by the volume of water moved. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, the work done to move electrons or other charge carriers is equal to &quot;electrical pressure difference&quot; multiplied by the quantity of electrical charges moved. In relation to &quot;flow&quot;, the larger the &quot;pressure difference&quot; between two points (potential difference or water pressure difference), the greater the flow between them (electric current or water flow). (See &quot;electric power&quot;.)

== Applications ==
Specifying a voltage measurement requires explicit or implicit specification of the points across which the voltage is measured. When using a voltmeter to measure voltage, one electrical lead of the voltmeter must be connected to the first point, one to the second point.

A common use of the term &quot;voltage&quot; is in describing the voltage dropped across an electrical device (such as a resistor). The voltage drop across the device can be understood as the difference between measurements at each terminal of the device with respect to a common reference point (or ground). The voltage drop is the difference between the two readings. Two points in an electric circuit that are connected by an ideal conductor without resistance and not within a changing magnetic field have a voltage of zero. Any two points with the same potential may be connected by a conductor and no current will flow between them.

===Addition of voltages===
The voltage between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; is the sum of the voltage between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the voltage between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. The various voltages in a circuit can be computed using Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws.

When talking about alternating current (AC) there is a difference between instantaneous voltage and average voltage. Instantaneous voltages can be added for direct current (DC) and AC, but average voltages can be meaningfully added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase.

==Measuring instruments==
Instruments for measuring voltages include the voltmeter, the potentiometer, and the oscilloscope. Analog voltmeters, such as moving-coil instruments, work by measuring the current through a fixed resistor, which, according to Ohm&#x27;s law, is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. The potentiometer works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a bridge circuit. The cathode-ray oscilloscope works by amplifying the voltage and using it to deflect an electron beam from a straight path, so that the deflection of the beam is proportional to the voltage.

==Typical voltages==

A common voltage for flashlight batteries is 1.5 volts (DC).
A common voltage for automobile batteries is 12 volts (DC).

Common voltages supplied by power companies to consumers are 110 to 120 volts (AC) and 220 to 240 volts (AC). The voltage in electric power transmission lines used to distribute electricity from power stations can be several hundred times greater than consumer voltages, typically 110 to 1200 kV (AC).

The voltage used in overhead lines to power railway locomotives is between 12 kV and 50 kV (AC) or between 0.75 kV and 3 kV (DC).

==Galvani potential vs. electrochemical potential==

Inside a conductive material, the energy of an electron is affected not only by the average electric potential but also by the specific thermal and atomic environment that it is in.
When a voltmeter is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electrostatic potential difference, but instead something else that is affected by thermodynamics.
The quantity measured by a voltmeter is the negative of the difference of the electrochemical potential of electrons (Fermi level) divided by the electron charge and commonly referred to as the voltage difference, while the pure unadjusted electrostatic potential (not measurable with a voltmeter) is sometimes called Galvani potential.
The terms &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;electric potential&quot; are ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to &quot;either&quot; of these in different contexts.

== History ==
The term &quot;electromotive force&quot; was first used by Volta in a letter to Giovanni Aldini in 1798, and first appeared in a published paper in 1801 in &quot;Annales de chimie et de physique&quot;. Volta meant by this a force that was not an electrostatic force, specifically, an electrochemical force. The term was taken up by Michael Faraday in connection with electromagnetic induction in the 1820s. However, a clear definition of voltage and method of measuring it had not been developed at this time. Volta distinguished electromotive force (emf) from &quot;tension&quot; (potential difference): the observed potential difference at the terminals of an electrochemical cell when it was open circuit must exactly balance the emf of the cell so that no current flowed.

<text>Vincent Alsop (30 August 1630 – 8 May 1703) was an English Nonconformist clergyman. His &quot;Mischief of Separation&quot; and &quot;Melius Inquirenduni&quot; became landmarks in the history of religious nonconformity.

==Life==
Alsop was the son of the Rector of South Collingham, Nottinghamshire and was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He received deacon&#x27;s orders from a bishop, and settled as assistant-master in the free school of Oakham, Rutland. The Rev. Benjamin King took him under his wing, and he married King&#x27;s daughter. He was thus converted to King&#x27;s religious beliefs, and received ordination in the Presbyterian denomination, not being satisfied with that which he had from the bishop. He was presented to the living of Wilby, Northamptonshire, but lost it as a result of the Act of Uniformity 1662.

After this he preached privately at Oakham and Wellingborough, and suffered accordingly. He was imprisoned for six months for praying with a sick person. A book against William Sherlock, dean of St Paul&#x27;s, called &quot;Antisozzo (against Socinus)&quot;, written in the vein of Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &quot;The Rehearsal Transpros&#x27;d&quot;, made him a name as a wit. He was also invited to succeed the venerable Thomas Cawton (the younger) as independent minister in Westminster. He accepted the call and drew great crowds to his chapel.

He published other books which showed a strong vein of wit, as well as great powers of reasoning. Even with John Goodman and Edward Stillingfleet for antagonists, he more than held his own. His &quot;Mischief of Impositions&quot; (1680) in answer to Stillingfleet&#x27;s &quot;Mischief of Separation&quot;, and &quot;Melius Inquirenduni&quot; (1679) in answer to Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Compassionate Inquiry&quot;, remain historical landmarks in the history of nonconformity.

As a result of the involvement of his son in alleged treasonable practices, he had to appeal to and obtained pardon from James II of England. This seems to have given a somewhat diplomatic character to his later years, inasmuch as, while remaining a nonconformist, he had a good deal to do with proposed political-ecclesiastical compromises.

Two polemical works once thought to be his – &quot;A Reply to the Reverend Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s Reflections on the Rector of Sutton, &amp;c.&quot; (1681) and &quot;The Rector of Sutton Committed with the Dean of St. Paul&#x27;s, or, A Defence of Dr. Stillingfleet&#x27;s Irenicum&quot; (1680) – have also been attributed to the Nottingham Presbyterian John Barret.

Upon Alsop&#x27;s death, his significant personal library was sold at retail. No catalog survives.

<doc id="32551" wikidata="Q1001037" url="?curid=32551" title="Varuna">
<text>Varuna (; , ) is a Hindu god, associated with the sky, oceans, and water. In the &quot;Vedic scriptures&quot;, he is paired with the god Mitra and is the lord of Ṛta (justice) and Satya (truth). Varuna is also mentioned as an Aditya, the sons of the goddess Aditi.

In the later Hindu texts like the &quot;Puranas&quot;, Varuna is also a Dikpala or guardian of the western direction. He is depicted as a youthful man, mounted on Makara (crocodile) and holding a Pasha (noose, rope loop) and a pitcher in his hands. He has multiple wives and fathered many children, including the Vedic sage Vasishtha.

He is also mentioned in the Tamil grammar work &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;, as Kadalon the god of sea and rain. He is found in Japanese Buddhist mythology as Suiten. He is also found in Jainism.

== Etymology ==

In Hindu tradition, the theonym &quot;Váruṇa&quot; (Devanagari: ) is described as a derivation from the verbal root &quot;vṛ&quot; (&quot;to surround, to cover&quot; or &quot;to restrain, bind&quot;) by means of a suffixal &quot;-uṇa-&quot;, for an interpretation of the name as &quot;he who covers or binds&quot;, in reference to the cosmological ocean or river encircling the world, but also in reference to the &quot;binding&quot; by universal law or &quot;Ṛta&quot;.

Georges Dumézil (1934) made a cautious case for the identity of Varuna and the Greek god &quot;Ouranos&quot; at the earliest Indo-European cultural level.
The etymological identification of the name &quot;Ouranos&quot; with the Sanskrit &quot;Varuṇa&quot; is based in the derivation of both names from the PIE root &quot;*ŭer&quot; with a sense of &quot;binding&quot; – the Indic king-god &quot;Varuṇa&quot; binds the wicked, the Greek king-god &quot;Ouranos&quot; binds the Cyclopes. This derivation of the Greek name is now widely rejected in favour of derivation from the root *&quot;wers-&quot; &quot;to moisten, drip&quot; (Sanskrit vṛṣ &quot;to rain, pour&quot;).

== Hindu texts ==
=== Vedas ===
In the earliest layer of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, Varuna is the guardian of moral law, one who punishes those who sin without remorse, and who forgives those who err with remorse. He is mentioned in many Rigvedic hymns, such as 7.86–88, 1.25, 2.27–30, 8.8, 9.73 and others. His relationship with waters, rivers and oceans is mentioned in the Vedas. Rig veda 10.123 says Hiranyapaksha (golden winged bird) as the messenger of Varuna. The golden winged messenger bird of Varuna may not be a mythical one but most probably flamingos because they have colourful wings and the sukta further describes Vulture as the messenger of Yama, the beaks of both these birds have similar morphology and flamingos are seen nearby seashores and marshlands.

The &quot;Rigveda&quot; also features him as the god of the sky.

Varuna and Mitra are the gods of the societal affairs including the oath, and are often twinned &quot;Mitra-Varuna&quot;. Both Mitra and Varuna are classified as Asuras in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (e.g. RV 5.63.3), although they are also addressed as Devas as well (e.g. RV 7.60.12). Varuna, being the king of the Asuras, was adopted or made the change to a Deva after the structuring of the primordial cosmos, imposed by Indra after he defeats Vritra.
According to Doris Srinivasan, a professor of Indology focusing on religion, Varuna-Mitra pair is an ambiguous deity just like Rudra-Shiva pair. Both have wrathful-gracious aspects in Indian mythology. Both Varuna and Rudra are synonymous with &quot;all comprehensive sight, knowledge&quot;, both were the guardian deity of the north in the Vedic texts (Varuna later gets associated with west), both can be offered &quot;injured, ill offerings&quot;, all of which suggest that Varuna may have been conceptually overlapping with Rudra. Further, the Rigvedic hymn 5.70 calls Mitra-Varuna pair as &quot;rudra&quot;, states Srinivasan. According to Samuel Macey and other scholars, Varuna had been the more ancient Indo-Aryan deity in 2nd millennium BCE, who gave way to Rudra in the Hindu pantheon, and Rudra-Shiva became both &quot;timeless and the god of time&quot;.

In &quot;Vajasaneyi Samhita&quot; 21.40 (&quot;Yajurveda&quot;), Varuna is called the patron deity of physicians, one who has &quot;a hundred, a thousand remedies&quot;. His capacity and association with &quot;all comprehensive knowledge&quot; is also found in the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; (~1000 BCE). Varuna also finds a mention in the early Upanishads, where his role evolves. In verse 3.9.26 of the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; (~800 BCE), for example, he is stated to be the god of the western quarter, but one who is founded on &quot;water&quot; and dependent ultimately on &quot;the heart&quot; and the fire of soul. In the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot;, Aditi is identified to be same as the goddess earth. She is stated in the Vedic texts to be the mother of Varuna and Mitra along with other Vedic gods, and in later Hindu mythology she as mother earth is stated to be mother of all gods.

In Yajurveda it is said: &quot;In fact Varuna is Vishnu and Vishnu is Varuna and hence the auspicious offering is to be made to these deities.&quot; || 8.59 ||

=== Upanishads ===
Varuna, addressed as Varuni explained Brahman in Taittiriya Upanishad to sage Bhrigu. First six anuvakas of Bhrigu Valli are called &quot;Bhargavi Varuni Vidya&quot;, which means &quot;the knowledge Bhrigu got from (his father) Varuni&quot;. It is in these anuvakas that sage Varuni advises Bhrigu with one of the oft-cited definition of Brahman, as &quot;that from which beings originate, through which they live, and in which they re-enter after death, explore that because that is Brahman&quot;. This thematic, all encompassing, eternal nature of reality and existence develops as the basis for Bhrigu&#x27;s emphasis on introspection, to help peel off the outer husks of knowledge, in order to reach and realize the innermost kernel of spiritual Self-knowledge.

=== Ramayana ===

Rama interacts with Varuna in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. For example, faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean to Lanka, where his abducted wife Sita is held captive by the demon king Ravana, Rama (an Avatar of Vishnu) performs a &quot;pravpavesha&quot; (prayer, tapasya) to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans, for three days and three nights, states Ramesh Menon. Varuna does not respond, and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged. He states to his brother Lakshamana that &quot;even lords of the elements listen only to violence, Varuna does not respect gentleness, and peaceful prayers go unheard&quot;.

With his bow and arrow, Rama prepares to attack the oceans to dry up the waters and create a bed of sand for his army of monkeys to cross and thus confront Ravana. Lakshmana appeals to Rama, translates Menon, that he should return to &quot;peaceful paths of our fathers, you can win this war without laying waste the sea&quot;. Rama shoots his weapon sending the ocean into flames. As Rama increases the ferocity of his weapons, Varuna arises out of the oceans. He bows to Rama, stating that he himself did not know how to help Rama because the sea is deep, vast and he cannot change the nature of sea. Varuna asked Rama to remember that he is &quot;the soul of peace and love, wrath does not suit him&quot;. Varuna promised to Rama that he will not disturb him or his army as they build a bridge and cross over to Lanka. Although, most of the sources claim it was Samudra, the god of the oceans who met Rama not the water god Varuna.

=== In Tolkappiyam ===
The Tolkāppiyam, a Tamil grammar work from the 3rd century BCE divides the people of ancient Tamilakam into five Sangam landscape divisions: &quot;kurinji, mullai, paalai, marutham&quot; and &quot;neithal&quot;. Each landscape is designated with different gods. &quot;Neithal&quot; is described as a seashore landscape occupied by fishermen and seatraders, with the god of sea and rain, &quot;Varunan&quot; or &quot;Kadalōn&quot;. &quot;Varuna&quot; means water which denotes the ocean in the Tamil language.

==Festivals==
===Cheti Chand===
The Cheti Chand festival in the Hindu month of Chaitra marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi Hindu community, it also marks the mythical birth of Uderolal in the year 1007. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the saviour of the Sindhi Hindus, who according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal&#x27;s birthday.

===Chaliya saheb===
Chalio or Chaliho, also called Chaliho Sahib, is a forty-day-long festival celebrated by Sindhi Hindus to express their gratitude to Jhulelal for saving them from their impending conversion to Islam. The festival is observed every year in the months of July to August; dates vary according to the Hindu calendar. It is a thanksgiving celebration in honor of Varuna Deva for listening to their prayers.

===Narali Poornima===

Nārali Poornima is a ceremonial day observed by Hindu fishing communities in Maharashtra, India particularly around Mumbai and the Konkan coast. It is held on the full-moon day of the Hindu month of Shravan which falls around July or August. On this day offerings such as rice, flowers and coconuts are offered to Lord Varuna, the god of ocean and waters.

== Beyond Hinduism and India ==

=== Sri Lankan Tamils (Karaiyar caste) ===

Karaiyar is a Sri Lankan Tamils caste found mainly on the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka, and globally among the Tamil diaspora.
They are traditionally a seafaring community that is engaged in fishing, shipment and seaborne trade. They fish mostly in deep seas, and employ gillnet and seine fishing methods. The Karaiyars were the major maritime traders and boat owners who among other things, traded with pearls, chanks, tobacco, and shipped goods overseas to countries such as India, Myanmar and Indonesia. The community known for their maritime history, are also reputed as a warrior caste who contributed as army and navy soldiers of Tamil kings. They were noted as the army generals and navy captains of the Aryacakravarti dynasty. The Karaiyars emerged in the 1990s as strong representatives of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism. The nuclear leadership of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have background in the wealthier enterprising section of the Karaiyars.

The word &quot;Karaiyar&quot; is derived from the Tamil language words &quot;karai&quot; (&quot;coast&quot; or &quot;shore&quot;) and &quot;yar&quot; (&quot;people&quot;). The term &quot;Kareoi&quot; mentioned by 2nd century CE writer Ptolemy, is identified with the Tamil word &quot;Karaiyar&quot;. The Portuguese and Dutch sources mentions them under the term &quot;Careas&quot;, &quot;Careaz&quot;, or &quot;Carias,&quot; which are terms denoting &quot;Karaiyar&quot;.

&quot;Kurukulam&quot;, &quot;Varunakulam&quot; and &quot;Arasakulam&quot; were historically one of the significant clans of the Karaiyars. Kurukulam, meaning &quot;clan of the &quot;Kuru&quot;&quot;, may be a reference to their origin from Kurumandalam (meaning &quot;realm of Kuru&#x27;s&quot;) of Southern India. They attribute their origin myth from the Kuru Kingdom, mentioned in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Some scholars derived &quot;Kurukulam&quot; from Kuru, the Tamil name for Jupiter. Varunakulam, meaning &quot;clan of &quot;Varuna&quot;&quot;, is a reference to their maritime origin. Varuna is the god of sea and rain, mentioned in Vedic Literature, but also in Sangam literature as the principal deity of the &quot;Neithal Sangam landscape&quot; (i.e. littoral landscape). Arasakulam means &quot;clan of kings&quot;. They used the Makara as emblem, the mount of their clan deity, the sea god Varuna, which was also seen on their flags.

=== Sindhi Hindus ===

Jhulelal is believed by Sindhi Hindus to be an incarnation of Varuna. They celebrate the festival of Cheti Chand in his honor. The festival marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi community it also marks the birth of Uderolal in year 1007, after they prayed to Hindu god Varuna to save them from the persecution by tyrannical Muslim ruler named Mirkhshah. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the champion of the people in Sindh, from both religions. Among his Sufi Muslim followers, Jhulelal is known as &quot;Khwaja Khizir&quot; or &quot;Sheikh Tahit&quot;. The Hindu Sindhi, according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal&#x27;s birthday.

===Buddhism ===

====Theravada====

The Pali Canon of the Theravada school recognizes Varuṇa (Sanskrit; Pali: Varuna) as a king of the devas and companion of Sakka, Pajāpati and Isāna. In the battle against the Asuras, the devas of Tāvatiṃsa were asked to look upon the banner of Varuna in order to have all their fears dispelled (S.i.219).

The Tevijja Sutta mentions him among Indra, Soma, Isāna, Pajāpati, Yama and Mahiddhi as gods that are invoked by the brahmins.

The Ātānātiya Sutta lists him among the Yakkha chiefs.

Buddhaghosa states (SA.i.262) that Varuna is equal in age and glory (vanna) with Sakka and takes the third seat in the assembly of devas.

====Mahayana====

In East Asian Buddhism, Varuna is a dharmapāla and often classed as one of the Twelve Devas (Japanese: Jūniten, 十二天). He presides over the western direction.

In Japan, he is called &quot;Suiten&quot; (水天 lit. &quot;water deva&quot;). He is included with the other eleven devas, which include Taishakuten (Śakra/Indra), Fūten (Vāyu), Emmaten (Yama), Rasetsuten (Nirṛti/Rākṣasa), Ishanaten (Īśāna), Bishamonten (Vaiśravaṇa/Kubera), Katen (Agni), Bonten (Brahmā), Jiten (Pṛthivī), Nitten (Sūrya/Āditya), and Gatten (Chandra).

=== Shinto ===

Varuna is also worshipped in Japan&#x27;s Shinto religion. One of the Shinto shrines dedicated to him is the &quot;Suitengū&quot; (&quot;Palace of Suiten&quot;) in Tokyo. After the Japanese emperor issued the &quot;Shinbutsu bunri&quot;, the separation of Shinto and Buddhist practices as part of the Meiji Restoration, Varuna/Suiten was identified with the Japanese supreme God, Amenominakanushi.

<text>Vladimir Vasilyevich Markovnikov, also Markownikoff (; – 11 February 1904) was a Russian chemist, best known for having developed the Markovnikov&#x27;s rule, that describes addition reactions of hydrogen halides and alkenes.

==Early life and education==
Vladimir Markovnikov was born on December 22, 1837, in Chernorechye near Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire (now Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russian Federation). Soon after his birth, his father retired and settled in a family estate received as a dowry from his wife&#x27;s family at marriage, in the village of Ivanovo, Knyagininsky district of the Nizhny Novgorod province, where Markovnikov spent his early childhood.

He joined the cameral department of the law faculty of Kazan Imperial University in 1856. He moved to the natural department of the university, where he attended the lectures of A. M. Butlerov. In 1860, after completing a university course, he was left to prepare for a professorship and was appointed laboratory assistant at a chemical laboratory. In 1864 he defended his master&#x27;s thesis. In the spring of 1869, he defended his doctoral dissertation.

==Personal life==
Markovnikov married Lyubov Dmitrievna Rychkova. They had two sons, Vladimir, a politician and Nikolai, an architect.

==Career==
After a conflict with that university, Markovnikov was appointed professor at the University of Odessa in 1871 and, two years later, at the University of Moscow, where he stayed the rest of his career. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1901.

===Work===
Markovnikov is best known for Markovnikov&#x27;s rule, elucidated in 1869 to describe addition reactions of H-X (where &#x27;X&#x27; represents a halogen) to alkenes. According to this rule, the nucleophilic X- binds to the carbon (C) atom with fewer hydrogen atoms, while the proton binds to the carbon atom with more hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Thus, hydrogen chloride (HCl) reacts with propene, CH3-CH=CH2 to produce 2-chloropropane CH3CHClCH3 rather than the isomeric 1-chloropropane CH3CH2CH2Cl. The rule is useful in predicting the molecular structures of products of addition reactions. Why hydrogen bromide exhibited both Markovnikov as well as reversed-order, or anti-Markovnikov, addition, however, was not understood until Morris S. Kharasch offered an explanation in 1933. It is also called The Peroxide effect sometimes.

Hughes has discussed the reasons for Markovnikov&#x27;s lack of recognition during his lifetime. Although he published mostly in Russian which was not understood by most Western European chemists, the 1870 article in which he first stated his rule was written in German. However the rule was included in a 4-page addendum to a 26-page article on isomeric butyric acids, and based on very slight experimental evidence even by the standards of the time. Hughes concludes that the rule was an inspired guess, unjustified by the evidence of the time, but which turned out later to be correct (in most cases). A more recent assessment, based on a reading of Markovnikov&#x27;s Magistr Khimii and Doktor Khimii dissertations, contradicts this view, and points out that Markovnikov&#x27;s Rule arises logically from his dissertations.

Markovnikov also contributed to organic chemistry by finding carbon rings with more than six carbon atoms, a ring with four carbon atoms in 1879, and a ring with seven in 1889.

Markovnikov also showed that butyric and isobutyric acids have the same chemical formula (C4H8O2) but different structures; i.e., they are isomers.

<text>Valkyrie is a UK role-playing magazine that was published between 1994 and 2003.

==Publication history==
The magazine was started in 1994. Angus Abranson was one of the people involved in the creation of &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, and continued to report news for the magazine while he was working at Leisure Games. It was published by Partisan Press and edited originally by David &quot;Stig&quot; Renton (original editor of &quot;Role Player Independent&quot;) and then taken over by Jay Forster. Renton held the post from 1994 to 1998 and Forster from 1999 to 2003.

Some claimed that it was the successor to &quot;White Dwarf&quot; amongst the UK role-playing community, with numerous contributors from across the hobby, including Phil Masters and Marcus Rowland.

The magazine was resurrected as a quarterly with issue 19 and ran for several years before ceasing publication with issue 28. It folded in 2003.

On 15 September 2019, the first edition of an all new &quot;Valkyrie&quot; magazine was launched in 2019, but its ownership, contents, style and target market are completely different. In other words, apart from the name, the new magazine has nothing to do with the original.

<text>A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion. There are 23 extant species of vulture (including condors). Old World vultures include 16 living species native to Europe, Africa, and Asia; New World vultures are restricted to North and South America and consist of seven identified species, all belonging to the Cathartidae family.
A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald, unfeathered head. This bare skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding, and also plays an important role in thermoregulation.

Vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold, and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat. They also urinate on themselves as a means of cooling their bodies.

A group of vultures in flight is called a &quot;kettle&quot;, while the term &quot;committee&quot; refers to a group of vultures resting on the ground or in trees. A group of vultures that are feeding is termed a &quot;wake&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Although New World vultures and Old World vultures share many resemblances, they are not very closely related. Rather, they share resemblance because of convergent evolution.

Early naturalists placed all vultures under one single biological group. Carl Linnaeus had assigned both Old World vultures and New World vultures in a &quot;Vultur&quot; genus, even including the harpy eagle. Soon anatomists split Old and New World vultures, with New World vultures being placed in a new suborder, &quot;Cathartae&quot;, later renamed &quot;Cathartidae&quot; as per the Rules of Nomenclature (from Greek: &quot;carthartes&quot;, meaning &quot;purifier&quot;) by French ornithologist Frédéric de Lafresnaye. The suborder was later recognised as a family, rather than a suborder.

In the late 20th century, some ornithologists argued that New World vultures are more closely related to storks on the basis of karyotype, morphological, and behavioral data. Thus some authorities placed them in the Ciconiiformes family with storks and herons; Sibley and Monroe (1990) even considered them a subfamily of the storks. This was criticized, and an early DNA sequence study was based on erroneous data and subsequently retracted. There was then an attempt to raise the New World vultures to the rank of an independent order, Cathartiformes, not closely associated with either the birds of prey or the storks and herons.

== Old World ==
The Old World vultures found in Africa, Asia, and Europe belong to the family Accipitridae, which also includes eagles, kites, buzzards, and hawks. Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight.

The 16 species in 9 genera are:
* Cinereous vulture, &quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;
* Griffon vulture, &quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;
* White-rumped vulture, &quot;Gyps bengalensis&quot;
* Rüppell&#x27;s vulture, &quot;Gyps rueppelli&quot;
* Indian vulture, &quot;Gyps indicus&quot;
* Slender-billed vulture, &quot;Gyps tenuirostris&quot;
* Himalayan vulture, &quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;
* White-backed vulture, &quot;Gyps africanus&quot;
* Cape vulture, &quot;Gyps coprotheres&quot;
* Hooded vulture, &quot;Necrosyrtes monachus&quot;
* Red-headed vulture, &quot;Sarcogyps calvus&quot;
* Lappet-faced vulture, &quot;Torgos tracheliotos&quot;
* White-headed vulture, &quot;Trigonoceps occipitalis&quot;
* Bearded vulture (Lammergeier), &quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;
* Egyptian vulture, &quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;
* Palm-nut vulture, &quot;Gypohierax angolensis&quot;

== New World ==


The New World vultures and condors found in warm and temperate areas of the Americas belong to the family Cathartidae. Recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be included within order Accipitriformes along with birds of prey including hawks, eagles, and Old World vultures . Several species have a good sense of smell, unusual for raptors, and are able to smell dead animals from great heights, up to a mile away. The seven species are:

* Black vulture &quot;Coragyps atratus&quot; in South America and north to the US
* Turkey vulture &quot;Cathartes aura&quot; throughout the Americas to southern Canada
* Lesser yellow-headed vulture &quot;Cathartes burrovianus&quot; in South America and north to Mexico
* Greater yellow-headed vulture &quot;Cathartes melambrotus&quot; in the Amazon Basin of tropical South America
* California condor &quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot; in California, formerly widespread in the mountains of western North America
* Andean condor &quot;Vultur gryphus&quot; in the Andes
* King vulture &quot;Sarcoramphus papa&quot; from southern Mexico to northern Argentina

== Feeding ==

Vultures are scavengers, meaning that they eat dead animals. Outside of the oceans, vultures are the only known obligate scavengers. They rarely attack healthy animals, but may kill the wounded or sick. When a carcass has too thick a hide for its beak to open, it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first. Vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields. They gorge themselves when prey is abundant, until their crops bulge, and sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food. These birds do not carry food to their young in their talons but disgorge it from their crops. The mountain-dwelling bearded vulture is the only vertebrate to specialize in eating bones; it carries bones to the nest for the young, and hunts some live prey.

Vultures are of great value as scavengers, especially in hot regions. Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive (pH=1.0), allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with botulinum toxin, hog cholera bacteria, and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers and remove these bacteria from the environment. New World vultures often vomit when threatened or approached. Contrary to some accounts, they do not &quot;projectile vomit&quot; on their attacker in defense, but to lighten their stomach load to ease take-off. The vomited meal residue may distract a predator, allowing the bird to escape.

In various regions of Africa, the dynamic interplay of vultures and predators such as lions, cheetahs, hyenas, and jackals significantly influences the continent&#x27;s food web. These avian scavengers actively engage in competition with these predatory animals for sustenance, meticulously tracking their hunting activities.

Traditionally, vultures are known to bide their time, patiently observing from a distance or high in the sky as predators bring down their prey and commence feeding. Once these formidable predators have satiated their hunger and moved away from their kills, the vultures swoop in, making the most of the leftovers.

New research has revealed that these birds can, in addition to sight, respond to auditory cues indicative of potential foraging opportunities.

Interaction between vultures and predators is not strictly sequential or one-sided. Vultures, being opportunistic creatures, will often engage in risky behavior if a prime opportunity arises. Sometimes, when the predator numbers are low or distracted, these large birds might move in earlier, attempting to snatch morsels from the kill before the predators have fully vacated the scene. This daring strategy, while high-risk, underscores the fierce competition and survival instincts prevalent in the harsh realities of the African wild.

New World vultures also urinate straight down their legs; the uric acid kills bacteria accumulated from walking through carcasses, and also acts as evaporative cooling.

== Conservation status ==
Vultures in south Asia, mainly in India and Nepal, have declined dramatically since the early 1990s. It has been found that this decline was caused by residues of the drug diclofenac in livestock carcasses. The government of India has taken very late cognizance of this fact and has banned the drug for animals. It may take decades for vultures to come back to their earlier population level, if ever. Without them to pick corpses clean, rabid dogs have multiplied, feeding on the carrion, and age-old practices like the sky burials of the Parsees are coming to an end, permanently reducing the supply of corpses. The same problem is also seen in Nepal where the government has taken some late steps to conserve the remaining vultures.

The vulture population is threatened across Africa and Eurasia. There are many human activities that threaten vultures such as poisoning and collisions with wind turbines. In central Africa there have been efforts to conserve the remaining vultures and bring their population numbers back up. The decline is largely due to the trade in vulture meat, &quot;it is estimated that more than of wild animal meat is traded&quot; and vultures take up a large percentage of this bushmeat due to the demand in the fetish market. The substantial drop in vulture populations in the continent of Africa is also said to be the result of both intentional and unintentional poisoning, with one study finding it to be the cause of 61% of the vulture deaths recorded.

A recent study in 2016, reported that &quot;of the 22 vulture species, nine are critically endangered, three are endangered, four are near threatened, and six are least concern&quot;.

The conservation status of vultures is of particular concern to humans. For example, the decline of vulture populations can lead to increased disease transmission and resource damage, through increased populations of disease vector and pest animal populations that scavenge carcasses opportunistically. Vultures control these pests and disease vectors indirectly through competition for carcasses.

On 20 June 2019, the corpses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures, altogether 537 vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the corpses of three elephants that were poisoned by poachers, possibly to avoid detection by the birds, which help rangers to track poaching activity by circling above dead animals.

== In myth and culture ==

In Ancient Egyptian art, Nekhbet, a mythological goddess and patron of both the city of Nekheb and Upper Egypt was depicted as a vulture. Alan Gardiner identified the species that was used in divine iconography as a griffon vulture. Arielle P. Kozloff argues that the vultures in New Kingdom art, with their blue-tipped beaks and loose skin, better resemble the lappet-faced vulture. Many Great Royal Wives wore vulture crowns - a symbol of protection from the goddess Nekhbet.

Ancient Egyptians believed that all vultures were female and were spontaneously born from eggs without the intervention of a male, and therefore linked the birds to purity and motherhood, but also the eternal cycle of death and rebirth for their ability to transform the &quot;death&quot; they feed on – i.e. carrion and waste – into life.

In Pre-Columbian times, vultures were appreciated as extraordinary beings and had high iconographic status. They appear in many Mesoamerican myths, legends, and fables from civilizations such as the Maya and Aztecs, some depicting them negatively, others positively.

<doc id="32558" wikidata="Q1734" url="?curid=32558" title="Volleyball">
<text>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team&#x27;s court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the program at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.

The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a &#x27;rally&#x27; by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team&#x27;s court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:

* causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents&#x27; court or without first passing over the net;
* catching and throwing the ball;
* double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
* four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
* net foul: touching the net during play;
* foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a front row player is trying to keep the ball in play.

The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.

A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including &quot;spiking&quot; and &quot;blocking&quot; (because those plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as &quot;passing&quot;, &quot;setting&quot;, and specialized player positions. Offensive and defensive structures are also key plays.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
William G. Morgan invented the sport in 1895 while he was the YMCA physical education director in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Because he originally derived the game from badminton, he initially named the sport &quot;mintonette&quot;. He was a one-time student of basketball inventor James Naismith and invented the game for his clients at the YMCA, most of whom were middle-aged businessmen for whom the physical demands of basketball were too great.

The first rules, written down by Morgan, called for a net high, a court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents&#x27; court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.

After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as &quot;volleyball&quot; (it was originally spelled as two words: &quot;&quot;volley ball&quot;). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.

In the early 1900s Spalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company, produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.

=== Refinements and later developments ===
The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900. The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a &quot;three hits&quot; rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.

Like basketball, volleyball spread quickly due to its simplicity and promotion by the YMCA and YWCA. The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900. During and after World War I, the presence of YMCA instructors in American forces led to the spread of volleyball in Europe, where clubs were established in France as well as several Soviet nations. An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women. The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe, where especially Italy, the Netherlands, and Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s, in Russia, in other countries, including China and the rest of Asia, and in the United States.

Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by World ParaVolley.

Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s. By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist/naturist clubs. Recently a debate has arisen within the sport regarding the inclusion of transgender players. With transgender athletes including Tiffany Abreu joining professional volleyball teams alongside other non-transgender teammates, many professionals, sports analysts, and fans of volleyball either express concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players on a team or convey support for the transgender players.

=== Volleyball in the Olympics ===

Volleyball has been part of the Summer Olympics program for both men and women consistently since 1964.

== Rules of the game ==

===Court dimensions ===
A volleyball court is , divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of . The top of the net is above the center of the court for men&#x27;s competition, and for women&#x27;s competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions.

The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is , although a clearance of is recommended.

A line from and parallel to the net is considered the &quot;attack line&quot;. This &quot;3 meter&quot; (or &quot;10-foot&quot;) line divides the court into &quot;back row&quot; and &quot;front row&quot; areas and the back court and front court. These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area &quot;1&quot;, which is the position of the serving player:

After a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise direction, with the player previously in area &quot;2&quot; moving to area &quot;1&quot; and so on, with the player from area &quot;1&quot; moving to area &quot;6&quot;. Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service; the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.

The team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball. All lines denoting the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered to be &quot;in&quot;. An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.

=== The ball ===
FIVB regulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a circumference of , a weight of and an interior air pressure of 0.30–0.325 kg/cm2 (4.26 to 4.61 psi; 294.3
to 318.82 mbar or hPa). Other governing bodies have similar regulations.

=== Gameplay ===

Each team consists of six players. To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team&#x27;s court (the &quot;serve&quot;). The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent&#x27;s side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of the &quot;bump&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; so that the ball&#x27;s trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the &quot;setter&quot;; second of the &quot;set&quot; (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball&#x27;s trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an &quot;attacker&quot; can hit it, and third by the &quot;attacker&quot; who &quot;spikes&quot; (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent&#x27;s court) to return the ball over the net. The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on &quot;offence&quot;.

The team on &quot;defence&quot; attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to &quot;block&quot; the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a &quot;dig&quot; (usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offence.

The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made. The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball to land outside the court. A ball is &quot;in&quot; if any part of it touches the inside of a team&#x27;s court or a sideline or end-line, and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may instead be in. Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air. A standard competitive volleyball match is played in a best-of-five sets format and typically goes on for about 90 minutes.

Other common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player catching the ball, a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the net into the opponent&#x27;s court. There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules, although most of them are infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not being in the correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the front court and above the height of the net, using another player as a source of support to reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve, or playing the ball when it is above the opponent&#x27;s court.

=== Scoring ===

A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made: when the ball strikes one team&#x27;s side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to whether they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point. If the team which won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points. (Scoring differs between leagues, tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are played best-of-five to 25 as of the 2008 season.)

Before 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve (&quot;side-out scoring&quot;) and all sets went up to only 15 points. The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in 2000) to use the current scoring system (formerly known as &quot;rally point system&quot;), primarily to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and television-friendly. The final year of side-out scoring at the NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship was 2000. Rally point scoring debuted in 2001, and games were played to 30 points through 2007. For the 2008 season, games were renamed &quot;sets&quot; and reduced to 25 points to win. Most high schools in the U.S. changed to rally scoring in 2003, and several states implemented it the previous year on an experimental basis.

=== Libero ===
The libero player was introduced internationally in 1998, and made its debut for NCAA competition in 2002. The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills: the libero must wear a contrasting jersey color from their teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is entirely above net height. When the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player, without prior notice to the officials. This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set, although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005.

The modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the libero is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero must be standing behind (and not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3-meter line. An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court. The libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero tracking sheet, where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for.

Under FIVB rules, a libero is not allowed to serve. By contrast, a libero can serve in NCAA volleyball, but only in a specific rotation. That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not for all of the people for whom he or she goes in. That rule change was implemented in 2004 and applied to high school and junior high play soon after.

Under FIVB rules, each team can designate two liberos at the beginning of play, only one of whom can be on the court at any time, and each libero can serve in one specific rotation. This rule was implemented in NCAA women&#x27;s volleyball, effective with the fall 2024 season.

=== Recent rule changes ===
Other rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as long as it goes over the net into the opponents&#x27; court. Also, the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines. Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches, such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player (&quot;double-hits&quot;) on a team&#x27;s first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball.

In 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women&#x27;s volleyball (men&#x27;s volleyball remained at 30 for another three years, switching to 25 in 2011). If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In addition, the word &quot;game&quot; is now referred to as &quot;set&quot;.

The &quot;Official Volleyball Rules&quot; are prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB&#x27;s Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission. The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB&#x27;s website.

== Skills ==
Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of the skills consists of a number of specific techniques which have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.

=== Serve ===
A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball in an attempt to drive it into the opponent&#x27;s court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball&#x27;s direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly. A serve is called an &quot;ace&quot; when the ball either lands directly onto the opponent&#x27;s court or the first opponent to touch the ball is unable to volley it (hit it upwards enough for a teammate to continue).

In contemporary volleyball, many types of serves are employed:
* Underhand: a serve in which the player strikes the ball below the waist instead of tossing it up and striking it with an overhand throwing motion. Underhand serves are considered very easy to receive and are rarely employed in high-level competitions.
* Sky ball serve: a specific type of underhand serve occasionally used in beach volleyball, where the ball is hit so high it comes down almost in a straight line. This serve was invented and employed almost exclusively by the Brazilian team in the early 1980s and is now considered outdated. During the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, the sky ball serve was extensively played by Italian beach volleyball player Adrian Carambula. In Brazil, this serve is called &quot;Jornada nas Estrelas&quot; (&quot;Star Trek&quot;).
* Topspin: an overhand serve where the player tosses the ball high and hits it with a wrist snap, giving it topspin which causes it to drop faster than it would otherwise and helps maintain a straight flight path. Topspin serves are generally hit hard and aimed at a specific returner or part of the court. Standing topspin serves are rarely used above the high school level of play.
* Float: an overhand serve where the ball is hit with no spin so that its path becomes unpredictable, akin to a knuckleball in baseball.
* Jump serve: an overhand serve where the ball is first tossed high in the air, then the player makes a timed approach and jumps to make contact with the ball, hitting it with much pace and topspin. This is the most popular serve among college and professional teams.
* Jump float: an overhand serve where the ball is tossed high enough that the player may jump before hitting it similarly to a standing float serve. The ball is tossed lower than a topspin jump serve, but contact is still made while in the air. This serve is becoming more popular among college and professional players because it has a certain unpredictability in its flight pattern.

=== Pass ===

Also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent&#x27;s serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.

The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waistline; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head. Either are acceptable in professional and beach volleyball; however, there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball. When a player passes a ball to their setter, it is ideal that the ball has relatively little spin to make it easier for the setter.

=== Set ===

The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball. The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent&#x27;s court. The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will attack the ball.

As with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that the setter can see).

Sometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent&#x27;s court. This movement is called a &quot;dump&quot;. This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack. The most common dumps are to &#x27;throw&#x27; the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.

As with a set or an overhand pass, the setter/passer must be careful to touch the ball with both hands at the same time. If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball this could result in a less effective set, as well as the referee calling a &#x27;double hit&#x27; and giving the point to the opposing team.

=== Attack ===
The attack, also known as the &quot;spike&quot;, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball. The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent&#x27;s court and cannot be defended. A player makes a series of steps (the &quot;approach&quot;), jumps, and swings at the ball.

Ideally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter&#x27;s jump. At the moment of contact, the hitter&#x27;s arm is fully extended above their head and slightly forward, making the highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit. The hitter uses arm swing, wrist snap, and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball. A &#x27;bounce&#x27; is a slang term for a very hard/loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent&#x27;s court and bounces very high into the air. A &quot;kill&quot; is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point.

Contemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques:
* Backcourt (or back row): an attack performed by a back-row player. The player must jump from behind the 3-meter line before making contact with the ball, but may land in front of the 3-meter line. A Pipe Attack is when the center player in the back row attacks the ball.
* Line and Cross-court Shot: refers to whether the ball flies in a straight trajectory parallel to the sidelines, or crosses through the court in an angle. A cross-court shot with a very pronounced angle, resulting in the ball landing near the 3-meter line, is called a cut shot.
* Dip/Dink/Tip/Cheat/Dump: the player does not try to make a hit, but touches the ball lightly, so that it lands on an area of the opponent&#x27;s court that is not being covered by the defence.
* Tool/Wipe/Block-abuse: the player does not try to make a hard spike, but hits the ball so that it touches the opponent&#x27;s block and then bounces off-court.
* Off-speed hit: the player does not hit the ball hard, reducing its speed and thus confusing the opponent&#x27;s defence.
* Quick hit/&quot;One&quot;: an attack (usually by the middle blocker) where the approach and jump begin before the setter contacts the ball. The set (called a &quot;quick set&quot;) is placed only slightly above the net and the ball is struck by the hitter almost immediately after leaving the setter&#x27;s hands. Quick attacks are often effective because they isolate the middle blocker to be the only blocker on the hit.
* Slide: a variation of the quick hit that uses a low backset. The middle hitter steps around the setter and hits from behind him or her.
* Double quick hit/&quot;Stack&quot;/&quot;Tandem&quot;: a variation of quick hit where two hitters, one in front and one behind the setter or both in front of the setter, jump to perform a quick hit at the same time. It can be used to deceive opposite blockers and free a fourth hitter attacking from back-court, maybe without block at all.

=== Block ===

Blocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent&#x27;s attack. A block which is aimed at completely stopping an attack, thus making the ball remain in the opponent&#x27;s court, is called an offensive block. A well-executed offensive block is performed by jumping and reaching to penetrate with one&#x27;s arms and hands over the net and into the opponent&#x27;s area. It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place. It may also require calculating the best footwork to executing the &quot;perfect&quot; block.

The jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball&#x27;s trajectory prior to it crossing over the plane of the net. Palms are held deflected downward roughly 45–60 degrees toward the interior of the opponents&#x27; court. A &quot;roof&quot; is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of the attack straight down to the attacker&#x27;s floor as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside of a peaked house roof. By contrast, it is called a defensive, or &quot;soft&quot; block if the goal is to control and deflect the hard-driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes easier to defend. A well-executed soft-block is performed by jumping and placing one&#x27;s hands above the net with no penetration into the opponent&#x27;s court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backwards.

Blocking is also classified according to the number of players involved. Thus, there are single (or solo), double, and triple blocks.

Successful blocking does not always result in a &quot;roof&quot; and many times does not even touch the ball. While it is obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed, a block that consistently forces the attacker away from their &#x27;power&#x27; or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defence is also a highly successful block. At the same time, the block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking.

=== Dig ===

Digging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one&#x27;s court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground. In many aspects, this skill is similar to passing, or bumping: overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms. It varies from passing, however, in that it is a much more reflex-based skill, especially at the higher levels. It is especially important while digging for players to stay on their toes; several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they are ready to move in any direction.

Some specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing. A player may sometimes perform a &quot;dive&quot;, i.e., throw their body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball, and land on their chest. When the player also slides their hand under a ball which is almost touching the court it is called a &quot;pancake&quot;. The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball, but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court limits the chances that the ball will make good, clean contact with the hand. When used correctly, it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays.

Sometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball. In this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries.

== Team play ==

Volleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next, with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball. The team&#x27;s movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, and defensive system.

The serve-receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter. Systems can consist of 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, and in some cases 2 receivers. The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation. This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking. Offensive systems are the formations used by the offence to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court (or otherwise score points). Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization (see &quot;Player specialization&quot;, below). Popular formations include the 4–2, 6–2, and 5-1 systems (see &quot;Formations&quot;, below). There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defence off balance.

Coverage systems are the formations used by the offence to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack. Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball, players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court. Popular formations include the 2-3 system and the 1-2-2 system. In lieu of a system, some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter.

Defensive systems are the formations used by the defence to protect against the ball being grounded into their court by the opposing team. The system will outline which players are responsible for which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from. Popular systems include the 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, and 6-Back-Slide defence. There are also several different blocking schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams&#x27; offence. When one player is ready to serve, some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team. This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen, so the call is made at the referee&#x27;s discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receiving team&#x27;s ability to pass the ball. The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible.

== Strategy ==
=== Player specialization ===
There are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level: setter, outside hitter (left-side hitter), middle hitter (middle blocker), opposite hitter (right-side hitter) and libero / defensive specialist. Each of the positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match.
* Setters have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents&#x27; court for a point. They have to be able to operate with the hitters, manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need to have a swift and skillful appraisal and tactical accuracy and must be quick at moving around the court. At elite level, setters used to usually be the shortest players of a team (before liberos were introduced), not being typically required to perform jump hits, but that would imply need for short-term replacement by taller bench players when critical points required more effective blocks; in the 1990s taller setters (e.g. Fabio Vullo, Peter Blangé) began being deployed, in order to improve blocks.
* Liberos are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve. They are usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills. &quot;Libero&quot; means &#x27;free&#x27; in Italian—they receive this name as they have the ability to substitute for any other player on the court during each play (usually the middle blocker). Liberos are not permitted to block or perform attacks, meaning they never play at the net, which allows shorter players with strong passing and defensive skills to excel in the position and play an important role in the team&#x27;s success. A player designated as a libero for a match may not play other roles during that match. Liberos wear a different colour jersey than their teammates.
* Middle hitters, or middle blockers, are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter. They are specialized in blocking since they must attempt to stop equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of the court. In non-beginners play, every team will have two middle hitters. At elite levels, middle hitters are usually the tallest players, whose limited agility is countered by their height enabling more effective blocks.
* Outside hitters, or left-side hitters, attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets. Inaccurate first passes usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite. Since most sets to the outside are high, the outside hitter may take a longer approach, always starting from outside the court sideline. In non-beginners play, there are again two outside hitters on every team in every match. At elite level, outside hitters are slightly shorter than middle hitters and opposite hitters, but have the best defensive skills, therefore always re-placing to the middle while in the back row.
* Opposite hitters, or right-side hitters, carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well-formed block against the opponents&#x27; &quot;Outside hitters&quot; and serve as a backup setter. Sets to the opposite usually go to the right side of the antennae. Therefore, they are usually the most technical hitters since balls lifted to the right side are quicker and more difficult to handle (the setters having to place the ball while slightly off-set to the right, and with their back to the attacker), and also having to jump from the back row when the setter is on the front row. At elite level, until the 1990s several opposite hitters used to be able to also play as middle hitters (e.g. Andrea Zorzi, Andrea Giani), before high specialization curtailed this flexibility in the role.

At some levels where substitutions are unlimited, teams will make use of a defensive specialist in place of or in addition to a libero. This position does not have unique rules like the libero position, instead, these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules. A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side, but your team is already using a libero to take out your middles. Most often, the situation involves a team using a right-side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they are not able to effectively play backcourt defence. Similarly, teams might use a serving specialist to sub out a poor server.

=== Formations ===
The three standard volleyball formations are known as &quot;4–2&quot;, &quot;6–2&quot; and &quot;5–1&quot;, which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively. 4–2 is a basic formation used only in beginners&#x27; play, while 5–1 is by far the most common formation in high-level play.

==== 4–2 ====
The 4–2 formation has four hitters and two setters. The setters usually set from the middle front or right front position. The team will, therefore, have two front-row attackers at all times. In the international 4–2, the setters set from the right front position. The international 4–2 translates more easily into other forms of offence. The setters line up opposite each other in the rotation. The typical lineup has two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions, so that the setter is always in the middle front. Alternatively, the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an outside attacker; the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter, allowing one of the other team&#x27;s blockers to &quot;cheat in&quot; on a middle block.

The clear disadvantage with this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers, leaving a team with fewer offensive weapons.

Another aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force, albeit a weakened force, because when the setter is in the frontcourt they are able to &#x27;tip&#x27; or &#x27;dump&#x27;, so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch, the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand. This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack.

==== 6–2 ====
In the 6–2 formation, a player always comes forward from the back row to set. The three front row players are all in attacking positions. As a result all six players act as hitters at one time or another, while two can act as setters. So the 6–2 formation is now a 4–2 system, but the back-row setter penetrates to set. The 6–2 lineup thus requires two setters, who line up opposite to each other in the rotation. In addition to the setters, a typical lineup will have two middle hitters and two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions.

The advantage of the 6–2 is that there are always three front-row hitters available, maximizing the offensive possibilities. However, not only does the 6–2 require a team to possess two people capable of performing the highly specialized role of setter, it also requires both of those players to be effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position. At the international level, only the Cuban National Women&#x27;s Team employs this kind of formation. It is also used by NCAA teams in Division III men&#x27;s play and women&#x27;s play in all divisions, partially due to the variant rules used which allow more substitutions per set than the 6 allowed in the standard rules—12 in matches involving two Division III men&#x27;s teams and 15 for all women&#x27;s play.

==== 5–1 ====
The 5–1 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of their position in the rotation. The team will, therefore, have three front-row attackers when the setter is in the back row and only two when the setter is in the front row, for a total of five possible attackers.

The player opposite the setter in a 5–1 rotation is called the &quot;opposite hitter&quot;. In general, opposite hitters do not pass; they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving. The opposite hitter may be used as a third attack option (back-row attack) when the setter is in the front row: this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams. Normally the opposite hitter is the most technically skilled hitter of the team. Back-row attacks generally come from the back-right position, known as zone 1, but are increasingly performed from back-centre in high-level play.

The big advantage of the system is that the setter always has 3 hitters with which to vary sets. If the setter performs well, the opponent&#x27;s middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker, increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.

There is another advantage, the same as that of a 4–2 formation: as a front-row player the setter is allowed to jump and &quot;dump&quot; the ball onto the opponent&#x27;s side. Thus the setter can confuse the opponent&#x27;s blocking players; they have the option to jump and dump or set to one of the hitters. A good setter knows and they are able to jump to dump or to set for a quick hit as well as when setting outside, thus they are able to confuse the opponent.

The 5–1 offence is a mix of 6–2 and 4–2: when the setter is in the front row, the offense looks like a 4–2; when the setter is in the back row, the offense looks like a 6–2.

== Variations and related games ==
There are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball. By far the most popular of these is beach volleyball, which is played on sand with two people per team and rivals the main sport in popularity.

Some games related to volleyball include:
* Crossnet: a four-way volleyball game, combining volleyball and foursquare.
* 9-man: A variant invented by Chinese immigrants to the United States in the 1930s. 9-man is still played in Asian countries and North America, being recognized for its historic and cultural significance. In 2014, a documentary was produced about the sport, and a YouTube documentary was made in 2017.
* Beachball volleyball: A game of indoor volleyball played with a beach ball instead of a volleyball.
* Biribol: an aquatic variant, played in shallow swimming pools. The name comes from the Brazilian city where it was invented, Birigui. It is similar to water volleyball.
* Ecua-volley: A variant invented in Ecuador, with some significant variants, such as number of players, and a heavier ball.
* Footvolley: A sport from Brazil in which the hands and arms are not used, but it is otherwise similar to beach volleyball.
* Hooverball: Popularized by President Herbert Hoover, it is played with a volleyball net and a medicine ball; it is scored like tennis, but the ball is caught and then thrown back. The weight of the medicine ball can make the sport physically demanding for players; annual championship tournaments are held in West Branch, Iowa.
* Newcomb ball (sometimes spelled &quot;Nuke &#x27;Em&quot;): In this game, the ball is caught and thrown instead of hit; it rivaled volleyball in popularity until the 1920s.
** Prisoner Ball: Also played with volleyball court and a volleyball, prisoner ball is a variation of Newcomb ball where players are &quot;taken prisoner&quot; or released from &quot;prison&quot; instead of scoring points. This version is usually played by young children.
* Sepak Takraw: Played in Southeast Asia using a rattan ball and allowing only players&#x27; feet, knees, chests, and heads to touch the ball.
* Snow volleyball: a variant of beach volleyball that is played on snow. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball has announced its plans to make snow volleyball part of the future Winter Olympic Games programme.
* Throwball: became popular with female players at the YMCA College of Physical Education in Chennai (India) in the 1940s.
* Towel volleyball: towel volleyball is a popular form of outdoor entertainment. The game takes place in a volleyball court, and players work in pairs, holding towels in their hands and attempting to throw the ball into the opponent&#x27;s field. This version can also be played with blankets held by four people. There are several variations.
* Volley squash, a form of volleyball played within a squash court or similar sized enclosed space.
* Wallyball: A variation of volleyball played in a racquetball court with a rubber ball.

<text>In grammar, the vocative case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case which is used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object, etc.) being addressed or occasionally for the noun modifiers (determiners, adjectives, participles, and numerals) of that noun. A vocative expression is an expression of direct address by which the identity of the party spoken to is set forth expressly within a sentence. For example, in the sentence &quot;I don&#x27;t know, John,&quot; &quot;John&quot; is a vocative expression that indicates the party being addressed, as opposed to the sentence &quot;I don&#x27;t know John&quot;, in which &quot;John&quot; is the direct object of the verb &quot;know&quot;.

Historically, the vocative case was an element of the Indo-European case system and existed in Latin, Sanskrit, and Ancient Greek. In many modern Indo-European languages (English, Spanish, etc.) the vocative case has been absorbed by the nominative, but others still distinguish it, including the Baltic languages, some Celtic languages and most Slavic languages. Some linguists, such as , argue that the vocative form is not a case but a special form of nouns not belonging to any case, as vocative expressions are not related syntactically to other words in sentences. Pronouns usually lack vocative forms.

==Indo-European languages==
===Comparison===
Distinct vocative forms are assumed to have existed in all early Indo-European languages and survive in some. Here is, for example, the Indo-European word for &quot;wolf&quot; in various languages:

The elements separated with hyphens denote the stem, the so-called thematic vowel of the case and the actual suffix. In Latin, for example, the nominative case is and the vocative case is , but the accusative case is . The asterisks before the Proto-Indo-European words means that they are theoretical reconstructions and are not attested in a written source. The symbol ◌̩ (vertical line below) indicates a consonant serving as a vowel (it should appear directly below the &quot;l&quot; or &quot;r&quot; in these examples but may appear after them on some systems from issues of font display). All final consonants were lost in Proto-Slavic, so both the nominative and vocative Old Church Slavonic forms do not have true endings, only reflexes of the old thematic vowels.

The vocative ending changes the stem consonant in Old Church Slavonic because of the so-called First Palatalization. Most modern Slavic languages that retain the vocative case have altered the ending to avoid the change: Bulgarian occurs far more frequently than .

===Baltic languages===
====Lithuanian====

The vocative is distinct in singular and identical to the nominative in the plural, for all inflected nouns. Nouns with a nominative singular ending in &quot;-a&quot; have a vocative singular usually identically written but distinct in accentuation.

In Lithuanian, the form that a given noun takes depends on its declension class and, sometimes, on its gender. There have been several changes in history, the last being the &quot;-ai&quot; ending formed between the 18th and 19th centuries. The older forms are listed under &quot;other forms&quot;.

Some nouns of the e- and a- stems declensions (both proper ones and not) are stressed differently: &quot;aikštė&quot;: &quot;aikšte!&quot; (&quot;square&quot;); &quot;tauta&quot;: &quot;tauta!&quot;. In addition, nouns of e-stems have an ablaut of long vowel ė in nominative and short vowel e in vocative. In pronunciation, ė is close-mid vowel , and e is open-mid vowel .

The vocative of diminutive nouns with the suffix &quot;-(i)ukas&quot; most frequently has no ending: &quot;broliùk&quot; &quot;brother!&quot;, etc. A less frequent alternative is the ending &quot;-ai&quot;, which is also slightly dialectal: &quot;broliùkai&quot;, etc.

Colloquially, some personal names with a masculine &quot;-(i)(j)o&quot; stem and diminutives with the suffixes &quot;-elis, -ėlis&quot; have an alternative vocative singular form characterized by a zero ending (i.e. the stem alone acts as the voc. sg.): &quot;Adõm&quot; &quot;Adam!&quot; in addition to &quot;Adõmai&quot;, &quot;Mýkol&quot; &quot;Michael!&quot; in addition to &quot;Mýkolai&quot;, &quot;vaikẽl&quot; &quot;kid!&quot; in addition to &quot;vaikẽli&quot;, etc.

===Celtic languages===
====Goidelic languages====
=====Irish=====
The vocative case in Irish operates in a similar fashion to Scottish Gaelic. The principal marker is the vocative particle , which causes lenition of the following initial letter.

In the singular there is no special form, except for first declension nouns. These are masculine nouns that end in a broad (non-palatal) consonant, which is made slender (palatal) to build the singular vocative (as well as the singular genitive and plural nominative). Adjectives are also lenited. In many cases this means that (in the singular) masculine vocative expressions resemble the genitive and feminine vocative expressions resemble the nominative.

The vocative plural is usually the same as the nominative plural except, again, for first declension nouns. In the standard language first declension nouns show the vocative plural by adding . In the spoken dialects the vocative plural is often has the same form as the nominative plural (as with the nouns of other declensions) or the dative plural (e.g. = Men!)
=====Scottish Gaelic=====
The vocative case in Scottish Gaelic follows the same basic pattern as Irish. The vocative case causes lenition of the initial consonant of nouns. Lenition changes the initial sound of the word (or name).

In addition, masculine nouns are slenderized if possible (that is, in writing, an &#x27;i&#x27; is inserted before the final consonant) This also changes the pronunciation of the word.

Also, the particle is placed before the noun unless it begins with a vowel (or f followed immediately by a vowel, which becomes silent when lenited). Examples of the use of the vocative personal names (as in Irish):

The name &quot;Hamish&quot; is just the English spelling of (the vocative of and pronounced ), and thus is actually a Gaelic vocative. Likewise, the name &quot;Vairi&quot; is an English spelling of , the vocative for .

=====Manx=====
The basic pattern is similar to Irish and Scottish. The vocative is confined to personal names, in which it is common. Foreign names (not of Manx origin) are not used in the vocative. The vocative case causes lenition of the initial consonant of names. It can be used with the particle &quot;&quot;.
The name is actually the Manx vocative of (Mary).

====Brythonic languages====
=====Welsh=====

Welsh lacks case declension but marks vocative constructions by lenition of the initial consonant of the word, with no obligatory particle. Despite its use being less common, it is still used in formal address: the common phrase means &quot;gentlemen and ladies&quot;, with the initial consonant of undergoing a soft mutation; the same is true of (&quot;[dear] friends&quot;) in which has been lenited. It is often used to draw attention to at public notices orally and written – teachers will say &quot;&quot; (mutation of ) and signage such as one right show mutation of to draw attention to the importance of the notice.

===Germanic languages===
====English====

The vocative is not a grammatical case in English. Expressions for which the vocative would be used in languages which have that case, are nominative in English. In translations of languages that use the vocative case, translators have added the particle &quot;O&quot; before the noun, as is often seen in the King James Version of the Bible: for example the Greek &quot;ὀλιγόπιστοι&quot;, vocative masculine plural, (in Matthew 8:26) is translated &quot;O ye of little faith&quot;. While it is not strictly archaic, it is sometimes used to &quot;archaeise&quot; speech; it is often seen as very formal, and sees use in rhetoric and poetry, or as a comedic device to subvert modern speech. Another example is the recurrent use of the phrase &quot;O (my) Best Beloved&quot; by Rudyard Kipling in his &quot;Just So Stories&quot;. The use of &quot;O&quot; may be considered a form of clitic and should not be confused with the interjection &quot;oh&quot;. However, as the Oxford English Dictionary points out, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;oh&quot; were originally used interchangeably. With the advent of &quot;oh&quot; as a written interjection, however, &quot;O&quot; is the preferred modern spelling in vocative phrases.

Modern English commonly uses the objective case for vocative expressions but sets them off from the rest of the sentences with pauses as interjections, rendered in writing as commas (the vocative comma). Two common examples of vocative expressions in English are the phrases &quot;Mr. President&quot; and &quot;Madam Chairwoman&quot;.

Some traditional texts use &quot;Jesu&quot;, the Latin vocative form of &quot;Jesus&quot;. One of the best-known examples is &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;.

====German dialects====
In some German dialects, like the Ripuarian dialect of Cologne, it is common to use the (gender-appropriate) article before a person&#x27;s name. In the vocative phrase then the article is, as in Venetian and Catalan, omitted. Thus, the determiner precedes nouns in all cases except the vocative. Any noun not preceded by an article or other determiner is in the vocative case. It is most often used to address someone or some group of living beings, usually in conjunction with an imperative construct. It can also be used to address dead matter as if the matter could react or to tell something astonishing or just happening such as &quot;Your nose is dripping.&quot;

Colognian examples:
====Icelandic====
The vocative case generally does not appear in Icelandic, but a few words retain an archaic vocative declension from Latin, such as the word , which is in the vocative. That comes from Latin, as the Latin for Jesus in the nominative is and its vocative is .
That is also the case in traditional English (without the accent) (see above):

The native words and also sometimes appear in the shortened forms and in vocative phrases. Additionally, adjectives in vocative phrases are always weakly declined, but elsewhere with proper nouns, they would usually be declined strongly:
====Norwegian====
Nouns in Norwegian are not inflected for the vocative case, but adjectives qualifying those nouns are; adjectival adjuncts modifying vocative nouns are inflected for the definite (see: Norwegian language#Adjectives). The definite and plural inflections are in most cases identical, so it is more easily observable with adjectives that inflect for plural and definite differently, e.g. being when definite, but when plural, an instance of suppletion.
In several Norwegian dialects, north of an isogloss running from Oslo to Bergen, names in argument position are associated with proprial articles, e.g. gendered pronouns such as or , which either precede or follow the noun in question. This is not the case when in vocative constructions.

===Greek===
In Ancient Greek, the vocative case is usually identical to the nominative case, with the exception of masculine second-declension nouns (ending in -ος) and third-declension nouns.

Second-declension masculine nouns have a regular vocative ending in -ε. Third-declension nouns with one syllable ending in -ς have a vocative that is identical to the nominative (, night); otherwise, the stem (with necessary alterations, such as dropping final consonants) serves as the vocative (nom. , voc. ; nom. , gen. , voc. ). Irregular vocatives exist as well, such as nom. Σωκράτης, voc. Σώκρατες.

In Modern Greek, second-declension masculine nouns still have a vocative ending in -ε. However, the accusative case is often used as a vocative in informal speech for a limited number of nouns, and always used for certain modern Greek person names: &quot;&quot; &quot;Come here, Christos&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;. Other nominal declensions use the same form in the vocative as the accusative in formal or informal speech, with the exception of learned &quot;Katharevousa&quot; forms that are inherited from Ancient Greek (Demotic , &quot;Greek man&quot;), which have the same nominative and vocative forms instead.

===Iranian languages===
====Kurdish====
Kurdish has a vocative case. For instance, in the dialect of Kurmanji, it is created by adding the suffix at the end of masculine words and the suffix at the end of feminine ones. In the Jafi dialect of Sorani it is created by adding the suffix of at the end of names.
Instead of the vocative case, forms of address may be created by using the grammatical particles (feminine) and (masculine):

=== Indo-Aryan languages ===

==== Hindi-Urdu ====
In Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani), the vocative case has the same form as the nominative case for all singular nouns except for the singular masculine nouns that terminate in the vowel and for all nouns in their plural forms the vocative case is always distinct from the nominative case. Adjectives in &quot;Hindi-Urdu&quot; also have a vocative case form. In the absence of a noun argument, some adjectives decline like masculine nouns that do not end in . The vocative case has many similarities with the oblique case in Hindustani.

====Sanskrit====
In Sanskrit, the vocative ( ) has the same form as the nominative except in the singular. In vowel-stem nouns, if there is a in the nominative, it is omitted and the stem vowel may be altered: and become , becomes , and become short and becomes . Consonant-stem nouns have no ending in the vocative:

The vocative form is the same as the nominative except in the masculine and feminine singular.

===Slavic languages===

==== Old Church Slavonic ====
Old Church Slavonic has a distinct vocative case for many stems of singular masculine and feminine nouns, otherwise it is identical to the nominative. When different from the nominative, the vocative is simply formed from the nominative by appending either ( : ) or ( : ), but occasionally ( : , : , : ) and ( : , : , : , : ) appear. Nouns ending with have a vocative ending of ( : , : ), likewise nouns ending with assume the vocative suffix ( : ). This is similar to Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, and Sanskrit, which also employ the &quot;-e&quot; suffix in vocatives.

====Bulgarian====
Unlike most other Slavic languages, Bulgarian has lost case marking for nouns. However, Bulgarian preserves vocative forms. Traditional male names usually have a vocative ending.

More-recent names and foreign names may have a vocative form but it is rarely used (, instead of simply Richard, sounds unusual or humorous to native speakers).

Vocative phrases like (Mr. Minister) have been almost completely replaced by nominative forms, especially in official writing. Proper nouns usually also have vocative forms, but they are used less frequently. Here are some proper nouns that are frequently used in vocative:

Vocative case forms also normally exist for female given names:
Except for forms that end in -, they are considered rude and are normally avoided. For female kinship terms, the vocative is always used:
====Czech====
In Czech, the vocative (, or – ) usually differs from the nominative in masculine and feminine nouns in the singular.

In older common Czech (19th century), vocative form was sometimes replaced by nominative form in case of female names () and in case of male nouns past a title (, , ). This phenomenon was caused mainly by the German influence, and almost disappeared from the modern Czech. It can be felt as rude, discourteous or uncultivated, or as familiar, and is associated also with Slovakian influence (from the Czechoslovak Army) or Russian. In informal speech, it is common (but grammatically incorrect) to use the male surname (see also Czech name) in the nominative to address men: &quot;pane Novák!&quot; instead of &quot;pane Nováku!&quot; (Female surnames are adjectives, and their nominative and vocative have the same form: see Czech declension.) Using the vocative is strongly recommended in official and written styles.

====Polish====
In Polish, the vocative () is formed with feminine nouns usually taking except those that end in , , , and , which take , and those that end in , which take . Masculine nouns generally follow the complex pattern of the locative case, with the exception of a handful of words such as , and . Neuter nouns and all plural nouns have the same form in the nominative and the vocative:

The latter form of the vocative of {{lang|pl|człowiek}} {{gloss|human}} is now considered poetical.

The nominative is increasingly used instead of the vocative to address people with their proper names. In other contexts the vocative remains prevalent. It is used:
*To address an individual with the function, title, other attribute, family role
**{{lang|pl|Panie doktorze}} (Doctor!), {{lang|pl|Panie prezesie!}} (Chairman!)
**{{lang|pl|Przybywasz za późno, pływaku}} (You arrive too late, swimmer)
**{{lang|pl|synu}} (son), {{lang|pl|mamo}} (mum), {{lang|pl|tato}} (dad)
*After adjectives, demonstrative pronouns and possessive pronouns
**{{lang|pl|Nie rozumiesz mnie, moja droga Basiu!}} (You don&#x27;t understand me, my dear Basia!)
*To address an individual in an offensive or condescending manner:
**{{lang|pl|Zamknij się, pajacu!}} (&quot;Shut up, you buffoon!&quot;)
**{{lang|pl|Co się gapisz, idioto?}} (&quot;What are you staring at, idiot?&quot;)
**{{lang|pl|Nie znasz się, baranie, to nie pisz!}} (&quot;Stop writing, idiot, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing!&quot;)
**{{lang|pl|Spadaj, wieśniaku!}} (&quot;Get lost, hillbilly!&quot;)
*After &quot;Ty&quot; (second person singular pronoun)
**{{lang|pl|Ty kłamczuchu!}} (You liar!)
*Set expressions:
**{{lang|pl|(O) Matko!, (O) Boże!, chłopie}}

The vocative is also often employed in affectionate and endearing contexts such as {{lang|pl|Kocham Cię, Krzysiu!}} (&quot;I love you, Chris!&quot;) or {{lang|pl|Tęsknię za Tobą, moja Żono}} (&quot;I miss you, my wife.&quot;). In addition, the vocative form sometimes takes the place of the nominative in informal conversations: {{lang|pl|Józiu przyszedł}} instead of {{lang|pl|Józio przyszedł}} (&quot;Joey&#x27;s arrived&quot;). When referring to someone by their first name, the nominative commonly takes the place of the vocative as well: {{lang|pl|Ania, chodź tu!}} instead of {{lang|pl|Aniu, chodź tu!}} (&quot;Anne, come here!&quot;).

====Russian====
=====Historic vocative=====
The historic Slavic vocative has been lost in Russian and is now used only in archaic expressions. Several of them, mostly of Old Church Slavonic origin, are common in colloquial Russian: &quot;{{lang|ru|Боже!|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Bože}}, vocative of &quot;{{lang|ru|Бог|italic=no}}&quot; {{transl|ru|Bog}}, &quot;God&quot;) and &quot;{{lang|ru|Боже мой!|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Bože moj}}, &quot;My God!&quot;), and &quot;{{lang|ru|Господи!|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Gospodi}}, vocative of &quot;{{lang|ru|Господь|italic=no}}&quot; {{transl|ru|Gospodj}}, &quot;Lord&quot;), which can also be expressed as &quot;{{lang|ru|Господи Иисусе!|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Gospodi Iisuse!}}, {{transl|ru|Iisuse}} vocative of &quot;{{lang|ru|Иисус|italic=no}}&quot; {{transl|ru|Iisus}}, &quot;Jesus&quot;). The vocative is also used in prayers: &quot;{{lang|ru|Отче наш!|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Otče naš}}, &quot;Our Father!&quot;). Such expressions are used to express strong emotions (much like English &quot;O my God!&quot;), and are often combined (&quot;{{lang|ru|Господи, Боже мой|italic=no}}&quot;). More examples of the historic vocative can be found in other Biblical quotes that are sometimes used as proverbs: &quot;{{lang|ru|Врачу, исцелися сам|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|Vraču, iscelisia sam}}, &quot;Physician, heal thyself&quot;, nom. &quot;{{lang|ru|врач|italic=no}}&quot;, {{transl|ru|vrač}}). Vocative forms are also used in modern Church Slavonic. The patriarch and bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church are addressed as &quot;{{lang|ru|владыко|italic=no}}&quot; ({{transl|ru|vladyko}}, hegemon, nom. &quot;{{lang|ru|владыка|italic=no}}&quot;, {{transl|ru|vladyka}}). In the latter case, the vocative is often also incorrectly used for the nominative to refer to bishops and patriarchs.

=====New vocative=====
In modern colloquial Russian, given names and a small family of terms often take a special &quot;shortened&quot; form that some linguists consider to be a re-emerging vocative case. It is used only for given names and nouns that end in {{lang|ru|-a|italic=no}} and {{lang|ru|-я|italic=no}}, which are sometimes dropped in the vocative form: &quot;{{lang|ru|Лен, где ты?|italic=no}}&quot; (&quot;Lena, where are you?&quot;). It is basically equivalent to &quot;{{lang|ru|Лена, где ты?|italic=no}}&quot; but suggests a positive personal and emotional bond between the speaker and the person being addressed. Names that end in {{lang|ru|-я|italic=no}} then acquire a soft sign: &quot;{{lang|ru|Оль!|italic=no}}&quot; = &quot;{{lang|ru|Оля!|italic=no}}&quot; (&quot;Olga!&quot;). In addition to given names, the form is often used with words like &quot;{{lang|ru|мама|italic=no}}&quot; (mom) and &quot;{{lang|ru|папа|italic=no}}&quot; (dad), which would be respectively shortened to &quot;{{lang|ru|мам|italic=no}}&quot; and &quot;{{lang|ru|пап|italic=no}}&quot;. The plural form is used with words such as &quot;{{lang|ru|ребят|italic=no}}&quot;, &quot;{{lang|ru|девчат|italic=no}}&quot; (nom: &quot;{{lang|ru|ребята|italic=no}}&quot;, &quot;{{lang|ru|девчата|italic=no}}&quot; guys, gals).

Such usage differs from the historic vocative, which would be &quot;{{lang|ru|Лено|italic=no}}&quot; and is not related.

In Serbo-Croatian languages, distinct vocatives exist only for singular masculine and feminine nouns. Nouns of the neuter gender and all nouns in plural have a vocative equal to the nominative. All vocative suffixes known from Old Church Slavonic also exist in Serbo-Croatian.

The vocative in Serbo-Croatian is formed according to one of three types of declension, which are classes of nouns with the same declension suffixes.

===== First declension =====
The first declension comprises masculine nouns that end with a consonant. These have a vocative suffix of either {{lang|sh|-e}} ({{lang|sh|doktor : doktore}} {{gloss|doctor}}) or {{lang|sh|-u}} ({{lang|sh|gospodar : gospodaru}} {{gloss|master}}).

Nouns terminating in {{lang|sh|-or}} have the {{lang|sh|-e}} vocative suffix: {{lang|sh|doktor : doktore}} {{gloss|doctor}}, {{lang|sh|major : majore}} {{gloss|major}}, {{lang|sh|majstor : majstore}} {{gloss|artisan}}, as well as nouns possessing an unsteady {{lang|sh|a}}: {{lang|sh|vetar : vetre}} {{gloss|wind}}, {{lang|sh|svekar : svekre}} {{gloss|father-in-law}}, and the noun {{lang|sh|car : care}} {{gloss|emperor}}. All other nouns in this class form the vocative with {{lang|sh|-u}}: {{lang|sh|gospodar : gospodaru}} {{gloss|master}}, {{lang|sh|pastir : pastiru}} {{gloss|shepherd}}, {{lang|sh|inženjer : inženjeru}} {{gloss|engineer}}, {{lang|sh|pisar : pisaru}} {{gloss|scribe}}, {{lang|sh|sekretar : sekretaru}} {{gloss|secretary}}.

In particular, masculine nouns ending with a palatal or prepalatal consonant {{lang|sh|j, lj, nj, č, dž, ć, đ}} or {{lang|sh|š}} form vocatives with the {{lang|sh|-u}} suffix: {{lang|sh|heroj : heroju}} {{gloss|hero}}, {{lang|sh|prijatelj : prijatelju}} {{gloss|friend}}, {{lang|sh|konj : konju}} {{gloss|horse}}, {{lang|sh|vozač : vozaču}} {{gloss|driver}}, {{lang|sh|mladić : mladiću}} {{gloss|youngster}}, {{lang|sh|kočijaš : kočijašu}} {{gloss|coachman}}, {{lang|sh|muž : mužu}} {{gloss|husband}}.

Nouns ending with the velars {{lang|sh|-k, -g}} and {{lang|sh|-h}} are palatalized to {{lang|sh|-č, -ž, -š}} in the vocative: {{lang|cs|vojnik : vojniče}} {{gloss|soldier}}, {{lang|cs|drug : druže}} {{gloss|comrade}}, {{lang|sh|duh : duše}} {{gloss|ghost}}. A final {{lang|sh|-c}} becomes {{lang|sh|-č}} in the vocative: {{lang|sh|stric : striče}} {{gloss|uncle}}, {{lang|sh|lovac : lovče}} {{gloss|hunter}}. Likewise, a final {{lang|sh|-z}} becomes {{lang|sh|-ž}} in only two cases: {{lang|sh|knez : kneže}} {{gloss|prince}} and {{lang|sh|vitez : viteže}} {{gloss|knight}}.

The loss of the unsteady {{lang|sh|a}} can trigger a sound change by hardening consonants, as in {{lang|sh|vrabac : vrapče}} {{gloss|sparrow}} (not {{lang|sh|*vrabče}}), {{lang|sh|lisac : lišče}} {{gloss|male fox}} (not {{lang|sh|*lisče}}) and {{lang|sh|ženomrzac : ženomršče}} {{gloss|misogynist}} (not {{lang|sh|*ženomrzče}}). There may be a loss of {{lang|sh|-t}} before {{lang|sh|-c}} like in {{lang|sh|otac : oče}} {{gloss|father}} (instead of {{lang|sh|*otče}}), {{lang|sh|svetac : sveče}} {{gloss|saint}} (instead of {{lang|sh|*svetče}}). When these phonetic alterations would substantially change the base noun, the vocative remains equal to the nominative, for example {{lang|sh|tetak}} {{gloss|uncle}}, {{lang|sh|mačak}} {{gloss|male cat}}, {{lang|sh|bratac}} {{gloss|cousin}}. This also holds true for foreign names ending with {{lang|sh|-k, -g}} and {{lang|sh|-h}} like {{lang|sh|Džek}} {{gloss|Jack}}, {{lang|sh|Dag}} {{gloss|Doug}}, {{lang|sh|King, Hajnrih}}.

Male names ending with {{lang|sh|-o}} and {{lang|sh|-e}} have a vocative equal to the nominative, for example: {{lang|sh|Marko, Mihailo, Danilo, Đorđe, Pavle, Radoje}}.

===== Second declension =====
The second declension affects nouns with the ending &quot;{{lang|sh|-a}}&quot;. These are mainly of feminine but sometimes also of masculine gender. These nouns have a vocative suffix &quot;{{lang|sh|-o}}&quot;: {{lang|sh|riba : ribo}} {{gloss|fish}}, {{lang|sh|sluga : slugo}} {{gloss|servant}}, {{lang|sh|kolega : kolego}} {{gloss|colleague}}, {{lang|sh|poslovođa : poslovođo}} {{gloss|manager}}.

Exemptions to this rule are male and female given names, which have a vocative equal to the nominative, e. g. {{lang|sh|Vera, Zorka, Olga, Marija, Gordana, Nataša, Nikola, Kosta, Ilija}} etc. However, this is different for twosyllabic names with an ascending accent such as female names {{lang|sh|Nâda, Zôra, Mîca, Nêna}} and male names {{lang|sh|Pêra, Bôža, Pâja}}, etc., which form vocatives with &quot;{{lang|sh|-o}}&quot;: {{lang|sh|Nâdo, Zôro, Mîco, Pêro, Bôžo, Pâjo}}, etc.

Denominations of relatives like {{lang|sh|mama}} {{gloss|mom}}, {{lang|sh|tata}} {{gloss|dad}}, &quot;{{lang|sh|baba}}&quot; {{gloss|grandmother}}, {{lang|sh|deda}} {{gloss|grandfather}}, {{lang|sh|tetka}} {{gloss|aunt}} (parent&#x27;s sister), &quot;{{lang|sh|ujna}}&quot; {{gloss|aunt}} (mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife), &quot;{{lang|sh|strina}}&quot; {{gloss|aunt}} (father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife) have vocatives equal to the nominative. This also holds true for country names ending in &quot;{{lang|sh|-ska, -čka, -ška}}&quot;.

Nouns ending with the diminutive suffix &quot;-ica&quot; that consist of three or more syllables have a vocative with &quot;-e&quot;: &quot;učiteljica: učiteljice&quot; &quot;female teacher&quot;, &quot;drugarica: drugarice&quot; &quot;girlfriend&quot;, &quot;tatica: tatice&quot; &quot;daddy&quot;, &quot;mamica: mamice&quot; &quot;mommy&quot;. This also applies to female names &quot;Danica: Danice&quot;, &quot;Milica: Milice&quot;, &quot;Zorica: Zorice&quot;, and the male names &quot;Perica: Perice&quot;, &quot;Tomica: Tomice&quot;. Nouns of this class that can be applied to both males and females usually have a vocative ending of &quot;-ico&quot; (&quot;pijanica: pijanico&quot; &quot;drunkard&quot;, &quot;izdajica: izdajico&quot; &quot;traitor&quot;, &quot;kukavica: kukavico&quot; &quot;coward&quot;), but vocatives with &quot;-ice&quot; are also seen.

The use of vocative endings for names varies among Serbo-Croatian dialects. People in Croatia often use only nominative forms as vocatives, while others are more likely to use grammatical vocatives.

===== Third declension =====
The third declension affects feminine nouns ending with a consonant. The vocative is formed by appending the suffix &quot;{{lang|sh|-i}}&quot; to the nominative ({{lang|sh|reč : reči}} {{gloss|word}}, {{lang|sh|noć : noći}} {{gloss|night}}).

====Slovak====
Until the end of the 1980s, the existence of a distinct vocative case in Slovak was recognised and taught at schools. Today, the case is no longer considered to exist except for a few archaic examples of the original vocative remaining in religious, literary or ironic contexts:

In everyday use, the Czech vocative is sometimes retrofitted to certain words:

Another stamp of vernacular vocative is emerging, presumably under the influence of Hungarian for certain family members or proper names:
====Ukrainian====
Ukrainian has retained the vocative case mostly as it was in Proto-Slavic:

There are some exceptions:

It is used even for loanwords and foreign names:

It is obligatory for all native names:

It is used for patronymics:
===Latin===

In Latin, the form of the vocative case of a noun is often the same as the nominative. Exceptions include singular non-neuter second-declension nouns that end in {{lang|la|-us}} in the nominative case. An example would be the famous line from Shakespeare, &quot;{{lang|la|Et tu, Brute?}}&quot; (commonly translated as &quot;And you, Brutus?&quot;): {{lang|la|Brute}} is the vocative case and {{lang|la|Brutus}} would be the nominative.

Nouns that end in {{lang|la|-ius}} end with {{lang|la|-ī}} instead of the expected {{lang|la|-ie}}. Thus, {{lang|la|Julius}} becomes {{lang|la|Julī}} and {{lang|la|filius}} becomes {{lang|la|filī}}. The shortening does not shift the accent so the vocative of {{lang|la|Vergilius}} is {{lang|la|Vergilī}}, with accent on the second syllable even though it is short. Nouns that end in {{lang|la|-aius}} and {{lang|la|-eius}} have vocatives that end in {{lang|la|-aī}} or {{lang|la|-eī}} even though the {{lang|la|-i-}} in the nominative is consonantal.

First-declension and second-declension adjectives also have distinct vocative forms in the masculine singular if the nominative ends in {{lang|la|-us}}, with the ending {{lang|la|-e}}. Adjectives that end in {{lang|la|-ius}} have vocatives in {{lang|la|-ie}} so the vocative of {{lang|la|eximius}} is {{lang|la|eximie}}.

Nouns and adjectives that end in {{lang|la|-eus}} do not follow the rules above. {{lang|la|Meus}} forms the vocative irregularly as {{lang|la|mī}} or {{lang|la|meus}}, while Christian {{lang|la|Deus}} does not have a distinct vocative and retains the form {{lang|la|Deus}}. &quot;My God!&quot; in Latin is thus {{lang|la|mī Deus!}}, but Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate consistently used {{lang|la|Deus meus}} as a vocative. Classical Latin did not use a vocative of {{lang|la|deus}} either (in reference to pagan gods, the Romans used the suppletive form {{lang|la|dive}}).

===Romance languages===
====West Iberian languages====
Portuguese drops the article to form the vocative. The vocative is always between commas and, like in many other languages, a particle &quot;Ó&quot; is commonly used:

In Extremaduran and Fala, some post-tonical vowels open in vocative forms of nouns, a new development that is unrelated to the Latin vocative case.

====Catalan====
Catalan drops the article to form the vocative.

====French====
Like English, French sometimes uses (or historically used) a particle &quot;Ô&quot; to mark vocative phrases rather than by change to the form of the noun. A famous example is the title and first line of the Canadian national anthem, &quot;O Canada&quot; (French title: &quot;Ô Canada&quot;), a vocative phrase addressing Canada.

====Romanian====
The vocative case in Romanian is partly inherited, occasionally causing other morphophonemic changes (see also the article on Romanian nouns):

*singular masculine/neuter: {{lang|ro|-e}} as in
**{{lang|ro|om}}: {{lang|ro|omule!}} (man, human being),
**{{lang|ro|băiat}}: {{lang|ro|băiete!}} or {{lang|ro|băiatule!}} (boy),
**{{lang|ro|văr}}: {{lang|ro|vere!}} (cousin),
**{{lang|ro|Ion}}: {{lang|ro|Ioane!}} (John);
*singular feminine: {{lang|ro|-o}} as in
**{{lang|ro|soră}}: {{lang|ro|soro!}} (sister),
**{{lang|ro|nebună}}: {{lang|ro|nebuno!}} (mad woman), also in masculine ({{lang|ro|nebunul}}) 
**{{lang|ro|deșteaptă}}: {{lang|ro|deșteapto!}} (smart one (f), often used sarcastically),
**{{lang|ro|Ileana}}: {{lang|ro|Ileano!}} (Helen);
Since there is no &quot;-o&quot; vocative in Latin, it must have been borrowed from Slavic: compare the corresponding Bulgarian forms {{lang|bg|сестро|italic=no}} ({{lang|uk-latn|sestro}}), {{lang|bg|откачалко|italic=no}} ({{lang|bg-latn|otkachalko}}), {{lang|bg|Елено|italic=no}} ({{lang|bg-latn|Eleno}}).

*plural, all genders: {{lang|ro|-lor}} as in
**{{lang|ro|frați}}: {{lang|ro|fraților!}} (brothers),
**{{lang|ro|boi}}: {{lang|ro|boilor!}} (oxen, used toward people as an invective),
**{{lang|ro|doamne și domni}}: {{lang|ro|doamnelor și domnilor!}} (ladies and gentlemen).

In formal speech, the vocative often simply copies the nominative/accusative form even when it does have its own form. That is because the vocative is often perceived as very direct and so can seem rude.

==== Romanesco dialect ====
In Romanesco dialect the vocative case appears as a regular truncation immediately after the stress.

Compare (vocative, always truncated)

: &quot;France&#x27;, vie&#x27; qua!&quot;
:: &quot;Francesco/Francesca, come here!&quot;

with (nominative, never truncated)

: &quot;Francesco/Francesca viene qua&quot;
:: &quot;Francesco/Francesca comes here&quot;

====Venetian====
Venetian has lost all case endings, like most other Romance languages. However, with feminine proper names the role of the vocative is played by the absence of the determiner: the personal article {{lang|vec|ła / l&#x27;}} usually precedes feminine names in other situations, even in predicates. Masculine names and other nouns lack articles and so rely on prosody to mark forms of address:

Predicative constructions:

==Arabic==
{{Wiktionary|يا}}
Properly speaking, Arabic has only three cases: nominative, accusative and genitive. However, a meaning similar to that conveyed by the vocative case in other languages is indicated by the use of the particle &quot;yā&quot; ({{langx|ar|يا}}) placed before a noun inflected in the nominative case (or accusative if the noun is in construct form). In English translations, it is often translated literally as &quot;O&quot; instead of being omitted. A longer form used in Classical Arabic is {{lang|ar|أيّها}} &quot;{{transl|ar|ALA|ayyuhā}}&quot; (masculine), {{lang|ar|أيّتها}} &quot;{{transl|ar|ALA|ayyatuhā}}&quot; (feminine), sometimes combined with &quot;yā&quot;. The particle &quot;yā&quot; was also used in the old Castilian language because of Arabic influence via Mozarabic immigrations.

==Mandarin==
Mandarin uses no special inflected forms for address. However, special forms and morphemes (that are not inflections) exist for addressing.

Mandarin has several particles that can be attached to the word of address to mark certain special vocative forces, where appropriate. A common one is {{lang|cmn|啊}} &quot;a&quot;, attached to the end of the address word. For example, {{lang|cmn|日记}} &quot;rìjì&quot; &quot;diary&quot; becomes {{lang|cmn|日记啊}} &quot;rìjì&#x27;a&quot;.

Certain specialized vocative morphemes also exist, albeit with limited applicabilities. For instance, the Beijing dialect of Mandarin Chinese, to express strong feelings (especially negative ones) to someone, a neutral tone suffix &quot;-ei&quot; may be attached to certain address words. It is most commonly applied to the word {{lang|cmn|孙子}} (&quot;sūnzi&quot;, &quot;grandson&quot;), to form &quot;sūnzei&quot;, meaning approximately &quot;Hey you nasty one!&quot;. Another example is {{lang|cmn|小子}} (&quot;xiǎozi&quot;, lit. &quot;kid; young one&quot;), resulting in &quot;xiǎozei&quot; &quot;Hey kiddo!&quot;.

==Japanese==
{{See also|Japanese particles#yo}}
The vocative case is present in Japanese as the particle {{lang|ja|よ}}. This usage is often literary or poetic. For example:

In conversational Japanese, this same particle is often used at the end of a sentence to indicate assertiveness, certainty or emphasis.

==Georgian==
In Georgian, the vocative case is used to address the second-person singular and plural. For word roots that end with a consonant, the vocative case suffix is -&quot;o&quot;, and for the words that end with a vowel, it is -&quot;v&quot; like in Old Georgian, but for some words, it is considered archaic. For example, &quot;kats-&quot; is the root for the word &quot;man&quot;. If one addresses someone with the word, it becomes &quot;katso&quot;.

Adjectives are also declined in the vocative case. Just like nouns, consonant final stem adjectives take the suffix -&quot;o&quot; in the vocative case, and the vowel final stems are not changed:

:&quot;lamazi kali&quot; &quot;beautiful woman&quot; (nominative case)
:&quot;lamazo kalo!&quot; &quot;beautiful woman!&quot; (vocative case)

In the second phrase, both the adjective and the noun are declined. The personal pronouns are also used in the vocative case. &quot;Shen&quot; &quot;you&quot; (singular) and &quot;tkven&quot; &quot;you&quot; (plural) in the vocative case become &quot;she!&quot; and &quot;tkve&quot;, without the -&quot;n&quot;. Therefore, one could, for instance, say, with the declension of all of the elements:

&quot;She lamazo kalo!&quot; &quot;you beautiful woman!&quot;

==Korean==
The vocative case in Korean is commonly used with first names in casual situations by using the vocative case marker {{lang|ko|(호격 조사) 아}} ({{transl|ko|a}}) if the name ends in a consonant and {{lang|ko|야}} ({{transl|ko|ya}}) if the name ends with a vowel:

{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|number=1a.|미진이 집에 가?|Mijini jibe ga?|Is Mijin going home?}}
{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|number=1b.|미진아, 집에 가?|Mijina, jibe ga?|Mijin, are you going home?}}
{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|number=2a.|동배 뭐 해?|Dongbae mwo hae?|What is Dongbae doing?}}
{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|number=2b.|동배야, 뭐 해?|Dongbaeya, mwo hae?|Dongbae, what are you doing?}}

In formal Korean, the marker {{lang|ko|여}} ({{transl|ko|yeo}}) or {{lang|ko|이여}} ({{transl|ko|iyeo}}) is used, the latter if the root ends with a consonant. Thus, a quotation of William S. Clark would be translated as follows:

{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|indent=2|소년이여, 야망을 가져라.|sonyeoniyeo, yamangeul gajyeora.|Boys, be ambitious.}}

The honorific infix {{lang|ko|시}} ({{transl|ko|si}}) is inserted in between the {{lang|ko|이}} ({{transl|ko|i}}) and {{lang|ko|여}} ({{transl|ko|yeo}}).

{{fs interlinear|lang=ko|indent=2|신이시여, 부디 저들을 용서하소서.|sinisiyeo, budi jeodeureul yongseohasoseo.|Oh god, please forgive them.}}

In Middle Korean, there were three honorific classes of the vocative case:
==Hungarian==
Hungarian has a number of vocative-like constructions, even though it lacks an explicit vocative inflection.

Noun phrases in a vocative context always take the zero article. While noun phrases can take zero articles for other reasons, the lack of an article otherwise expected marks a vocative construction. This is especially prominent in dialects of Hungarian where personal proper names and other personal animate nouns tend to take the appropriate definite article, similarly to certain dialects of German detailed above. For example:

With certain words such as {{lang|hu|barát}} (&quot;friend&quot;), {{lang|hu|hölgy}} (&quot;lady&quot;), {{lang|hu|úr}} (&quot;gentleman, lord&quot;), vocation is, in addition to the zero article, always marked by the first person possessive:

Words like {{lang|hu|testvér}} (&quot;sibling, brother&quot;) and other words of relation do not require the first person possessive, but it is readily used in common speech, especially in familiar contexts:

The second-person pronoun can be used to emphasize a vocation when appropriate: {{lang|hu|Hát miért nem adtad oda neki, te bolond?}} (&quot;Why did you not give it to him, you fool?&quot;), {{lang|hu|Te Karcsi, nem láttad a szemüvegem?}} (&quot;Charlie, have you seen my glasses?&quot;), {{lang|hu|Lógtok ezért még, ti gazemberek.}} (&quot;You shall yet hang for this, crooks!&quot;), etc.

<text>A velodrome is an arena for track cycling. Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, consisting of two 180-degree circular bends connected by two straights. The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate easement curve.

== History ==
The first velodromes were constructed during the late 1870s, the oldest of which is the Preston Park Velodrome, Brighton, United Kingdom, built in 1877 by the British Army. Some were purpose-built just for cycling, and others were built as part of facilities for other sports; many were built around athletics tracks or other grounds and any banking was shallow. Reflecting the then-lack of international standards, sizes varied and not all were built as ovals: for example, Preston Park is long and features four straights linked by banked curves, while the Portsmouth velodrome, in Portsmouth, has a single straight linked by one long curve. The oldest surviving regular velodrome two-straight oval tracks is from 1889, located in Brno, Czech Republic. Early surfaces included cinders or shale, though concrete, asphalt and tarmac later became more common.

Indoor velodromes were also common particularly in the late 19th and early 20th century. For example, the Vélodrome d&#x27;hiver was built in Paris in 1909 and featured a indoor track with a wooden surface.

International competitions such as the Olympic Games led to more standardisation: two-straight oval tracks quickly became the norm, and gradually lap lengths reduced. The Vélodrome de Vincennes, used for the 1900 (and 1924) Games was per lap, while Antwerp&#x27;s Vélodrome d&#x27;Anvers Zuremborg, used in 1920, and Helsinki Velodrome, used in 1952, were both . By the 1960s up to 1989, tracks of length were commonly used for international competitions (e.g.: the Agustín Melgar Olympic Velodrome used for track cycling events at the 1968 Summer Olympics, and Leicester&#x27;s Saffron Lane velodrome used at the 1970 and 1982 Track Cycling World Championships). Since 1990, such events are usually held on velodromes with laps. London&#x27;s 2012 Olympic velodrome and a new velodrome in Turkmenistan&#x27;s capital city Ashgabat both have a 250 m track and a 6,000-seat spectator capacity.

== Technical aspects ==

Banking in the turns, called cant, allows riders to keep their bikes relatively perpendicular to the surface while riding at speed. When travelling through the turns at racing speed, which may exceed , the banking attempts to match the natural lean of a bicycle moving through that curve. At the ideal speed, the net force of the centrifugal force (outward) and gravity (downward) is angled down through the bicycle, perpendicular to the riding surface.

Riders are not always travelling at full speed or at a specific radius. Most events have riders all over the track. Team races (like the Madison) have some riders at speed and others riding more slowly. In match sprints riders may come to a stop by performing a track stand in which they balance the bicycle on the sloped surface while keeping their feet locked into the pedals. For these reasons, the banking tends to be 10 to 15 degrees less than physics predicts. Also, the straights are banked 10 to 15 degrees more than physics would predict. These compromises make the track ridable at a range of speeds.

From the straight, the curve of the track increases gradually into the circular turn. This section of decreasing radius is called the easement spiral or transition. It allows bicycles to follow the track around the corner at a constant radial position. Thus riders can concentrate on tactics rather than steering.

== Bicycles and track design ==

Bicycles for velodromes, better known as track bicycles, have no brakes. They employ a single fixed rear gear, or cog, that does not freewheel. This helps maximise speed, reduces weight, and avoids sudden braking while nevertheless allowing the rider to slow by pushing back against the pedals.

Modern velodromes are constructed by specialised designers. The Schuermann architects in Germany have built more than 125 tracks worldwide. Most of Schuermann&#x27;s outdoor tracks are made of wood trusswork with a surface of strips of the rare rain-forest wood Afzelia. Indoor velodromes are built with less expensive pine surfaces.

The track is measured along a line up from the bottom. Olympic and World Championship velodromes must measure . Other events on the UCI International Calendar may be held in velodromes that measure between inclusive, with a length such that a whole or half number of laps give a distance of .

The velodrome at Calshot in Hampshire, England, is only and has especially steep banking because it was built to fit inside an aircraft hangar. The Forest City Velodrome in London, Ontario, Canada, is the world&#x27;s shortest at . Built to fit a hockey arena, it too has steep banking.
The smaller the track, the steeper the banking. A track banks around 45°, while a track banks around 32°. Some older velodromes were built to imperial standards. The Dick Lane Velodrome in East Point, Georgia, United States, is .

Velodrome tracks can be surfaced with different materials, including timber, synthetics and concrete. Shorter, newer, and Olympic quality tracks tend to be timber or synthetics; longer, older, or inexpensive tracks are concrete, macadam, or even cinder.

== Track markings ==

Important cycling events are usually held on tracks which have lines laid out in a specified arrangement. Some other tracks also follow these protocols, but others have a different arrangement of lines to suit their facility and to assist riders in holding a straight line and in avoiding drifting onto the flatter section below the bankings where they risk their tyres sliding out.

Between the infield (sometimes referred to as an apron) and the actual track is the blue band (called &quot;côte d&#x27;azur&quot;) which is typically 10% of the surface. The blue band is not technically a part of the track; although it is not illegal to ride there, moving into it to shortcut another rider results in disqualification. During time trials, pursuits or other timed events, the blue band is obstructed with sponges or other objects. The blue band is a warning to cyclists that they may scrape their pedal along the infield when in a curve, which can easily result in a crash.

 above the blue band is the black measurement line. The inner edge of this line defines the length of the track. above the inside of the track is the outside of the 5 cm wide red sprinter&#x27;s line. The zone between black and red lines is sprinter&#x27;s lane, which is the optimum route around the track. A rider leading in the sprinter&#x27;s lane may not be passed on the inside; other riders must pass on the longer outside route.

Minimum (or half the track width) above the inside of the track is the blue stayer&#x27;s line. This line serves in races behind motorbikes as a separation line. Stayers below the blue line may not be overtaken on the inside. In Madison races (named after six-day races at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York, and also known as &quot;the American&quot;), the team&#x27;s relief rider rests above the stayer&#x27;s line by riding slowly until his or her teammate comes around the track and throws him or her back into the race.

The finish line is black on a wide white band and near the end of the home straight. Red lines are marked in the exact centre of each straight as start and finish line for pursuit races. A white 200 m line marks before the finish.

== Race formats ==
There are a variety of formats in velodrome races. A typical event will consist of several races of varying distances and structures. Common types of races include:
*Scratch race is the most straightforward type of race where riders compete over a specified distance and the order of finish determines the winners.
*Points race assigns value to specific laps throughout a race, e.g. every tenth lap. Generally the leading rider and sometimes the second place rider will be awarded points. The structure and timing of points races varies greatly, but the winner is determined by the accumulation of points and not necessarily the rider crossing the line first at the end of the race. Standard points races can have sprints every ten laps with the first three or four riders scoring, while Tempo races award a single point to the sprint winner, but award a point every lap, sharing the attritional quality of the Elimination race.
*Elimination race, also known as the Devil, from the phrase &quot;devil take the hindmost&quot;, or &quot;miss and out&quot;, removes the last place rider from each lap (every second lap on shorter tracks) until only a few riders, often the final two, remain. The final standings are then determined by a rolling start match sprint over the last two laps.
*Madison races team up pairs of riders in a tag-team format. Riders &quot;sling&quot; their teammate forward to facilitate alternating sprints that keep the pace very high during typically long races (, or more, compared to for most other races). The name is taken from Madison Square Garden where the format was popular in the early 1900s. Since partners can trade as often as they like, this is a very busy race format, with half of the racers racing and half circulating around the track at any time. Historically the race was decided by which team had &#x27;taken&#x27; the most laps, i.e. lapped the field, with points or finishing position only used to separate ties. In modern Madison racing, however, points scored in sprints decide the race, with a gained lap gaining a large points bonus. As a result, the Madison race is now essentially a team points race.
*Time trials include team pursuit, team sprint, individual pursuit, kilo and 500 metre time trials, and the 200m flying lap. Cyclists or teams compete alone or in pairs against the clock alone, with times deciding the winner. In team events, drafting plays an important part in the discipline. while in pursuit events, an alternative means of victory is to &#x27;catch&#x27; your opponent by making up the distance between the two start positions on opposite sides of the track. The flying lap was formally part of the Omnium event, but is now reserved for the qualification stage of match sprint events to determine seeding. 
*The Hour is a notable and unique event where a rider attempts to cover the furthest possible distance in one hour, as opposed to a set distance in the fastest time. This is not held as a championship event but as an occasional challenge event for an elite time trialist.
*Sprints, also known as &#x27;match sprints&#x27;, are short, highly tactical races involving two or three powerful track cyclists over a short course of three laps from a standing start, each trying to take advantage of drafting their opponent, or alternatively getting a gap to prevent their opponent drafting behind them, before breaking into an extremely fast final sprint for the line.
*Keirin races involve pacing 6 to 9 sprint riders with a motorcycle known as a Derny. The Derny gradually accelerates until the last lap and a half when it pulls off the track, leading to a sprint for the finish to determine the winner.
*Omnium competition assigns a point value to final standings of each race and riders accumulate points over the course of an event or series of events. This is not a specific race, but a competition that ties races and events together, and comparable to a heptathlon, decathlon in athletics, or modern pentathlon. Four endurance events comprise the current Olympic and World Championship Omnium: Scratch, Tempo, Elimination and Points race and must be completed within a day.

Team Sprint, sprint, Keirin, Kilo and flying laps are generally considered &#x27;sprinters&#x27; races, which in track cycling equate to extremely powerful, muscular riders over short distances, resulting in some historic overlap between BMX riders and track sprinters, such as Chris Hoy. The other events are considered endurance events for riders with less outright power but greater aerobic ability, and such events have historically enjoyed an overlap with elite road racers, including road sprinters such as Mark Cavendish and Elia Viviani, Grand Tour legends Eddy Merckx, Fausto Coppi and more recent Tour de France winners Bradley Wiggins and Geraint Thomas.

<text>Sildenafil, sold under the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of certain symptoms in secondary Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. It is unclear if it is effective for treating sexual dysfunction in females. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth), intravenously (injection into a vein), or through the sublingual route (dissolved under the tongue). Onset when taken orally is typically within twenty minutes and lasts for about two hours.
Common side effects include headaches, heartburn, and flushed skin. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include vision problems, hearing loss, and prolonged erection (priapism) that can lead to damage to the penis. Sildenafil should not be taken by people on nitric oxide donors such as nitroglycerin (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure.
Sildenafil acts by blocking phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that promotes breakdown of cGMP, which regulates blood flow in the penis. It requires sexual arousal to work, and does not by itself cause or increase sexual arousal. It also results in dilation of the blood vessels in the lungs.
Pfizer originally discovered the medication in 1989 while looking for a treatment for angina. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 1998. In 2022, it was the 157th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In the United Kingdom, it is available over-the-counter (OTC).
==Medical uses==
===Erectile dysfunction===
The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete sexual intercourse). Its use is now one of the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for males with diabetes mellitus.

====Antidepressant-associated erectile dysfunction====
Tentative evidence suggests that sildenafil may help males who experience antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction.

===Pulmonary hypertension===
While sildenafil improves some markers of disease in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or serious side effects.

===Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon===
Sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors are used off-label to alleviate vasospasm and treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon; these drugs have moderate efficacy for reducing the frequency and duration of vasospastic episodes. their role more generally in Raynaud&#x27;s was not clear.

=== Altitude sickness ===
Sildenafil has shown some potential for improving exercise performance at high altitudes. However, its overall efficacy is not clear. 

==== High-altitude pulmonary edema ====
Sildenafil has been studied for high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), but its use is currently not recommended for that indication.

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). This cyanopsia can be explained because sildenafil, while selective for PDE5, does have some affinity for PDE6, which is the phosphodiesterase found in the retina. Patients thus taking the drug may experience colorvision abnormalities. Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated labeling for tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and sildenafil (Viagra) to reflect a small number of post-marketing reports of sudden vision loss, while acknowledging that &quot;...it is not possible to determine whether these oral medicines for erectile dysfunction were the cause of the loss of eyesight or whether the problem is related to other factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or to a combination of these problems.&quot; A careful review of pooled data from clinical trials containing well documented information about the dose and duration of exposure to the drug for a large number of patients, yields no evidence for an increased risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or other adverse ocular events associated with PDE-5 inhibitor use.

Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include prolonged erections, severe low blood pressure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.

=== Interactions ===
Care should be exercised by people who are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.

The use of sildenafil and an α1 blocker (typically prescribed for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy) at the same time may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least 4 hours apart.

===Contraindications===
Contraindications include:
* Concomitant use of nitric oxide donors, organic nitrites and nitrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;ACC/AHA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
** nitroglycerin
** isosorbide mononitrate
** isosorbide dinitrate
** sodium nitroprusside
** alkyl nitrites (commonly known as &quot;poppers&quot;)
* Concomitant use of soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat
* Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil

Sildenafil should not be used if sexual activity is inadvisable due to underlying cardiovascular risk factors.

==Non-medical use==

===Recreational use===
Sildenafil&#x27;s popularity with young adults has increased over the years. Sildenafil&#x27;s brand name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug&#x27;s association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of sildenafil when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those who do not have erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25 mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.

Unprescribed recreational use of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors is noted as particularly high among users of illegal drugs. Sildenafil is sometimes used to counteract the effects of other substances, often illicit. Some users mix it with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), other stimulants, or opiates in an attempt to compensate for the common side effect of erectile dysfunction, a combination known as &quot;sextasy&quot;, &quot;rockin&#x27; and rollin,&#x27;&quot; &quot;hammerheading,&quot; or &quot;trail mix&quot;. Mixing it with amyl nitrite, another vasodilator, is particularly dangerous and potentially fatal.

===Jet lag research===
The 2007 Ig Nobel Prize in aviation went to Patricia V. Agostino, Santiago A. Plano, and Diego A. Golombek of Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina, for their discovery that sildenafil helps treat jet lag recovery in hamsters.

===Sports===
Professional athletes have been documented using sildenafil, believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles. In turn, they believe it will enhance their performances.

===Analogs===
Acetildenafil and other synthetic structural analogs of sildenafil which are PDE5 inhibitors have been found as adulterants in a number of &quot;herbal&quot; aphrodisiac products sold over-the-counter. These analogs have not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed, and thus have unknown side-effect profiles. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs, but progress has been slow so far, as, even in those jurisdictions that have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines. However, at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned numerous products claiming to be &quot;Eurycoma longifolia&quot; that, in fact, contain only analogs of sildenafil. Sellers of such fake herbals typically respond by just changing the names of their products.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, its major active metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose.

==Mechanism of action==

Sildenafil protects cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.

The molecular mechanism of smooth muscle relaxation involves the enzyme CGMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as PKG. This kinase is activated by cGMP and it phosphorylates multiple targets in the smooth muscle cells, namely myosin light chain phosphatase, RhoA, IP3 receptor, phospholipase C, and others. Overall, this results in a decrease in intracellular calcium and desensitizing proteins to the effects of calcium, engendering smooth muscle relaxation.

Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and increased penile response to sexual stimulation. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).

Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4 (major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil&#x27;s action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose). If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.

==Route of administration==
* When taken orally, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes).
* Sublingual use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes.
==Chemical synthesis==
The preparation steps for synthesis of sildenafil are:
# Methylation of 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester with hot dimethyl sulfate
# Hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to free acid
# Nitration with oleum/fuming nitric acid
# Carboxamide formation with refluxing thionyl chloride/NH4OH
# Reduction of nitro group to amino group
# Acylation with 2-ethoxybenzoyl chloride
# Cyclization
# Sulfonation to the chlorosulfonyl derivative
# Condensation with 1-methylpiperazine.

==History==
Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists led by Simon Campbell working at Pfizer&#x27;s Sandwich, Kent, research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease). The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina, but it could induce marked penile erections. Pfizer therefore decided to market it for erectile dysfunction, rather than for angina; this decision became an often-cited example of drug repositioning. The drug was patented in 1996, approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the FDA on 27 March 1998, becoming the first oral treatment approved to treat erectile dysfunction in the United States, and offered for sale in the United States later that year. It soon became a great success: annual sales of Viagra peaked in 2008 at US$1.934 billion.

==Counterfeits==

Counterfeit Viagra, despite generally being cheaper, can contain harmful substances or substances that affect how Viagra works, such as blue printer ink, amphetamines, metronidazole, boric acid, and rat poison.

Viagra is one of the world&#x27;s most counterfeited medicines. According to a 2012 Pfizer study, around 80% of sites claiming to sell Viagra were selling counterfeits.

An October 2023 release stated that erectile dysfunction medicines were the most seized drugs by the Interpol accounting for 22% of seizures. International networks may be active.

==Society and culture==

===Marketing and sales===

In the US, even though sildenafil is available only by prescription from a doctor, it was advertised directly to consumers on TV (famously being endorsed by former United States Senator Bob Dole and football star Pelé). Numerous sites on the Internet offer Viagra for sale after an &quot;online consultation&quot;, often a simple web questionnaire. The Viagra name has become so well known that many fake aphrodisiacs now call themselves &quot;herbal viagra&quot; or are presented as blue tablets imitating the shape and colour of Pfizer&#x27;s product. Viagra is also informally known as &quot;vitamin V&quot;, &quot;the blue pill&quot;, or &quot;blue diamond&quot;, as well as various other nicknames.

Viagra and other products for sexual dysfunction, termed &quot;sexuopharmaceuticals,&quot; proliferated new types of specialised marketing for such products. Viagra and similar prescription pharmaceuticals were promoted by images in media to the extent of becoming a cultural icon, at the time a relatively new phenomenon known to be permitted only in the United States and New Zealand and which is believed to have significantly contributed to norms regarding male sexuality. One author notes that although the effect of Viagra is only limited to penile blood vessels, advertisements routinely use imagery of couples hugging, smiling and dancing, with the author claiming that pharmaceutical companies were deceptive in the use of such advertisements.

In 2000, Viagra sales accounted for 92% of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills. By 2007, Viagra&#x27;s global share had plunged to about 50% due to several factors, including the entry of Cialis and Levitra, along with several counterfeits and clones, and reports of vision loss in people taking PDE5 inhibitors. In 2008, the FDA forced Pfizer to remove &quot;Viva Cruiser&quot;, an advergame for Viagra, from appearing on Forbes, after the game failed to disclose risk information about the drug.

In February 2007, it was announced that Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester, England. Males between the ages of 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist. In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) enacted legislation that expanded this nationwide, allowing a particular branded formulation of Sildenafil, Viagra Connect (50 mg), to be sold over the counter and without a prescription throughout the UK from early 2018. While the sale remains subject to a consultation with a pharmacist, the other restrictions from the trial have been removed, allowing customers over the age of 18 to purchase an unlimited number of pills. The decision was made, in part, to reduce online sales of counterfeit and potentially dangerous erectile dysfunction treatments.

In May 2013, Pfizer, which manufactures Viagra, told the Associated Press they will begin selling the drug directly to people on its website.

Pfizer&#x27;s patents on Viagra expired outside the US in 2012; in the US they were set to expire, but Pfizer settled litigation with each of Mylan and Teva which agreed that both companies could introduce generics in the US on 11 December 2017. In December 2017, Pfizer released its own generic version of Viagra.

, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved fifteen drug manufacturers to market generic sildenafil in the United States. Seven of these companies are based in India.

===Regional issues===

====United States====
In 1992, Pfizer filed a patent covering the substance sildenafil and its use to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of sildenafil have been available in the US from a number of manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. For a time, the generic was not available in the same dosages as branded Viagra, so using dosages typically required for treating ED required patients to take multiple pills.

In 1994, Pfizer filed a patent covering the use of sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction. This would be marketed as Viagra. This patent was published in 2002 and expired in 2019. Teva sued to have the latter patent invalidated, but Pfizer prevailed in an August 2011 federal district court case. An agreement with Pfizer allowed Teva to begin to provide the generic drug in December 2017.

In the United States, Pfizer received two patents for sildenafil: one for its indication to treat cardiovascular disease (marketed as Revatio) and another for its indication to treat erectile dysfunction (marketed as Viagra). The substance is the same under both brand names.

Sildenafil is available as a generic drug in the United States, labeled for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In the US, Revatio and Viagra are marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

====Brazil====
Pfizer&#x27;s patent on sildenafil citrate expired in Brazil in 2010.

====Canada====
In Canada, Pfizer&#x27;s patent 2,324,324 for Revatio (sildenafil used to treat pulmonary hypertension) was found invalid by the Federal Court in June 2010, on an application by Ratiopharm Inc.

On 8 November 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Pfizer&#x27;s patent 2,163,446 on Viagra was invalid from the beginning because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application. The decision, &quot;Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc.&quot;, pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information &quot;to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains&quot; to produce it. It added further: &quot;As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to &#x27;game&#x27; the system in this way. This, in my view, is the key issue in this appeal.&quot;

Teva Canada launched Novo-Sildenafil, a generic version of Viagra, on the day the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision. To remain competitive, Pfizer then reduced the price of Viagra in Canada. However, on 9 November 2012, Pfizer filed a motion for a re-hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, on the grounds that the court accidentally exceeded its jurisdiction by voiding the patent. Finally, on 22 April 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated Pfizer&#x27;s patent altogether.

====China====
Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs is common in China, where Pfizer&#x27;s patent claim is not widely enforced.

====Egypt====
Egypt approved Viagra for sale in 2002, but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug, citing the interests of poor people who would not be able to afford Pfizer&#x27;s price.

====European Union====

In June 2013 Pfizer&#x27;s patent on sildenafil citrate expired in some member countries of the European Union, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. A UK patent held by Pfizer on the use of PDE5 inhibitors (see below) as treatment of impotence was invalidated in 2000 because of obviousness; this decision was upheld on appeal in 2002.

====India====
Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs known as &quot;generic Viagra&quot; is common in India, where Pfizer&#x27;s patent claim does not apply. Brand names include Kamagra (Ajanta Pharma), Silagra (Cipla), Edegra (Sun Pharmaceutical), Penegra (Zydus Cadila), Manly (Cooper Pharma) and Zenegra (Alkem Laboratories).

====New Zealand====
Sildenafil was reclassified in New Zealand in 2014 so it could be bought over the counter from a pharmacist. It is thought that this reduced sales over the Internet and was safer as males could be referred for medical advice if appropriate.

====South Korea====
In 1999 South Korea granted two patents to Pfizer related to sildenafil. The first document guaranteed sole production and sale of the substance until 2012, while the second gave Pfizer the exclusive use to treating erectile dysfunction with sildenafil until 2014. In 2011 Hanmi Pharmaceutical and CJ CheilJedang launched a suit against the exclusive use patent. The Korean Court system made a ruling against Pfizer in June 2012, allowing for the unhindered domestic production of generic prescription sildenafil.

During 2012 Viagra lost its position as the top selling erectile dysfunction treatment in South Korea. This development was credited largely &quot;due to the introduction of generic products.&quot; Generic sildenafil became publicly available in May. Sales of PalPal by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals totalled ₩22 billion or about 86% the market share of Viagra that year. By 2017 there were over 50 generic sildenafil pills available. During that year Viagra sales slumped to 38% that of Palpal.

====United Kingdom====
There were 2,958,199 prescriptions for Sildenafil in 2016 in England, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006.

In 2018, Viagra Connect, a particular formulation of Sildenafil marketed by Pfizer, became available for sale without a prescription in the UK, in an attempt to widen availability and reduce demand for counterfeit products.
