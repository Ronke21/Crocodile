<text>The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSUSSR) was the highest body of state authority of the Soviet Union (USSR) from 1936 to 1991. Based on the principle of unified power, it was the only branch of government in the Soviet state.

Prior to 1936, the Congress of Soviets was the supreme legislative body. During 1989–1991 a similar, but not identical structure was the supreme legislative body. The Supreme Soviet appointed the Council of Ministers, the Supreme Court, and the Procurator General of the USSR as well as elected the Presidium which served as the USSR&#x27;s collective head of state under both the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitutions.

By the Soviet constitutions of 1936 and 1977, the Supreme Soviet was defined as the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union and was imbued with great lawmaking powers. In practice, however, it was a toy parliament which did nothing other than ratify decisions already made by the USSR&#x27;s executive organs and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) – always by unanimous consent – and listen to the General Secretary&#x27;s speeches. This was in accordance with the Stalinist CPSU&#x27;s principle of democratic centralism and became the norm for other Communist legislatures.

==Structure==

The Supreme Soviet was composed of two chambers, each with equal legislative powers:

*The Soviet of the Union, which represented the population of the Soviet federation as a whole, with each deputy representing the same number of voters.
*The Soviet of Nationalities, which represented the ethnic populations as units, with members elected on the basis of 32 deputies from each union republic, 11 from each autonomous republic, five from each autonomous oblast (region), and one from each autonomous okrug (district). The administrative units of the same type would send the same number of members regardless of their size or population.

Under the 1936 Constitution, the Supreme Soviet was elected for a four-year term, and the Soviet of the Union had one deputy for every 300,000 people. This was changed by the 1977 constitution; the term was extended to five years, and the number of seats in the Soviet of the Union was changed to be the same as the Soviet of Nationalities, regardless of the population size.

The Supreme Soviet convened twice a year, usually for less than a week. For the rest of the year, the Presidium performed its ordinary functions. Often, the CPSU bypassed the Supreme Soviet altogether and had major laws enacted as Presidium decrees. Nominally, if such decrees were not ratified by the Supreme Soviet at its next session, they were considered revoked. In practice, however, the principle of democratic centralism rendered the process of ratifying Presidium decrees a mere formality. In some cases, even this formality was not observed.

After 1989 it consisted of 542 deputies (divided into two 271 chambers) decreased from a previous 1,500. The meetings of the body were also more frequent, from six to eight months a year. In September 1991, after the August Coup, it was reorganised into the Soviet (council) of Republics and the Soviet of The Union, which would jointly amend the Soviet Constitution, admit new states, hear out the President of the Soviet Union on important home and foreign policy issues, approve the union budget, declare war and conclude peace. The Soviet of Republics would consist of 20 deputies from each union republic, plus one deputy to represent each autonomous region of each republic, delegated by the republics&#x27; legislatures. Russia was an exception with 52 deputies. The Soviet Union consisted of deputies apportioned by the existing quotas.

In 1989, its powers were: 
* Passing and initiating laws.
* Submitting questions to the President of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, scheduling elections of deputies. 
* Convening the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies.
* Appointing the Chairman of the Council of Ministers on the submission of the president.
* Ratifying the composition of the Council of Ministers and changes in it on the submission on the chairman. 
* Forming and disbanding ministries and state committees on the Council of Ministers proposal.
* Overriding a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority. 
* Ratifying presidential declarations of war.
* Impeaching the President.
* Hearing reports by organs of appointed officials.
* Implementing laws regulating property, management of the economy, social and cultural issues, budget and finance, salaries, prices, taxes, environmental protection, natural resource, and civil rights, 
* Laying down the principals of local and republic state power and the legal status of social organisations, 
* Submitting for ratification (and ratifying and amending) by the congress long-term national and social and economic development plans, the national budget, monitoring implantation of the state plan and budget, and ratifying reports on their performance.
* Ratifying international treaties.
* Overseeing the granting of foreign aid and negotiating foreign loans.
* Determining basic measures for national security, including declarations of war, mobilizing troops, and meeting international treaty obligations.

Acts by the Supreme Soviet entered into force after signature by the President and publication.

Between 1938 and February 1990, more than 50 years, only 80 laws were passed by the Supreme Soviet, less than 1% of total legislative acts.

==Supreme Soviets of union and autonomous republics==
Beside the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, each of its constituting union republics and each autonomous republic had a supreme soviet. These supreme soviets also had presidiums, but all consisted of only one chamber. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, some soviets of the succeeded independent republics simply changed their name to their more historic name or to emphasise their importance as a national parliament, while others changed to double-chamber assemblies.

<text>In Greek mythology, a satyr (, ), also known as a silenus or silenos ( ), and sileni (plural), is a male nature spirit with ears and a tail resembling those of a horse, as well as a permanent, exaggerated erection. Early artistic representations sometimes include horse-like legs, but, by the sixth century BC, they were more often represented with human legs. Comically hideous, they have mane-like hair, bestial faces, and snub noses and they always are shown naked. Satyrs were characterized by their ribaldry and were known as lovers of wine, music, dancing, and women. They were companions of the god Dionysus and were believed to inhabit remote locales, such as woodlands, mountains, and pastures. They often attempted to seduce or rape nymphs and mortal women alike, usually with little success. They are sometimes shown masturbating or engaging in bestiality.

In classical Athens, satyrs made up the chorus in a genre of play known as a &quot;satyr play&quot;, which was a parody of tragedy and known for its bawdy and obscene humor. The only complete surviving play of this genre is &quot;Cyclops&quot; by Euripides, although a significant portion of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Ichneutae&quot; has also survived. In mythology, the satyr Marsyas is said to have challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest and been flayed alive for his hubris. Although superficially ridiculous, satyrs were also thought to possess useful knowledge, if they could be coaxed into revealing it. The satyr Silenus was the tutor of the young Dionysus and a story from Ionia told of a &quot;silenos&quot; who gave sound advice when captured.

Over the course of Greek history, satyrs gradually became portrayed as more human and less bestial. They also began to acquire goat-like characteristics in some depictions as a result of conflation with the Pans, plural forms of the god Pan with the legs and horns of goats. The Romans identified satyrs with their native nature spirits, fauns. Eventually the distinction between the two was lost entirely. Since the Renaissance, satyrs have been most often represented with the legs and horns of goats. Representations of satyrs cavorting with nymphs have been common in western art, with many famous artists creating works on the theme. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, satyrs have generally lost much of their characteristic obscenity, becoming more tame and domestic figures. They commonly appear in works of fantasy and children&#x27;s literature, in which they are most often referred to as &quot;fauns&quot;.

==Terminology==
The etymology of the term &quot;satyr&quot; () is unclear, and several different etymologies have been proposed for it, including a possible Pre-Greek origin. Some scholars have linked the second part of name to the root of the Greek word , meaning &#x27;wild animal&#x27;. This proposal may be supported by the fact that at one point Euripides refers to satyrs as . Another proposed etymology derives the name from an ancient Peloponnesian word meaning &#x27;the full ones&#x27;, alluding to their permanent state of sexual arousal. Eric Partridge suggested that the name may be related to the root , meaning &#x27;to sow&#x27;, which has also been proposed as the root of the name of the Roman god Saturn. Satyrs are usually indistinguishable from , whose iconography is virtually identical. According to &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, the name &#x27;satyr&#x27; is sometimes derogatorily applied to a &quot;brutish or lustful man&quot;. The term satyriasis refers to a medical condition in males characterized by excessive sexual desire. It is the male equivalent of nymphomania.

==Origin hypotheses==
===Indo-European===
According to classicist Martin Litchfield West, satyrs and silenoi in Greek mythology are similar to a number of other entities appearing in other Indo-European mythologies, indicating that they probably go back, in some vague form, to Proto-Indo-European mythology. Like satyrs, these other Indo-European nature spirits are often human-animal hybrids, frequently bearing specifically equine or asinine features. Human-animal hybrids known as Kiṃpuruṣas or Kiṃnaras are mentioned in the , an Indian epic poem written in Sanskrit. According to Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) and others, the ancient Celts believed in &quot;dusii&quot;, which were hairy demons believed to occasionally take human form and seduce mortal women. Later figures in Celtic folklore, including the Irish , the Scottish and , and the Manx , are part human and part goat. The lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria (fifth or sixth century AD) records that the Illyrians believed in satyr-like creatures called &quot;Deuadai&quot;. The Slavic &quot;leshy&quot; also bears similarities to satyrs, since he is described as being covered in hair and having &quot;goat&#x27;s horns, ears, feet, and long clawlike fingernails.&quot;

Like satyrs, these similar creatures in other Indo-European mythologies are often also tricksters, mischief-makers, and dancers. The &quot;leshy&quot; was believed to trick travelers into losing their way. The Armenian Pay(n) were a group of male spirits said to dance in the woods. In Germanic mythology, elves were also said to dance in woodland clearings and leave behind fairy rings. They were also thought to play pranks, steal horses, tie knots in people&#x27;s hair, and steal children and replace them with changelings. West notes that satyrs, elves, and other nature spirits of this variety are a &quot;motley crew&quot; and that it is difficult to reconstruct a prototype behind them. Nonetheless, he concludes that &quot;we can recognize recurrent traits&quot; and that they can probably be traced back to the Proto-Indo-Europeans in some form.

===Near Eastern===
On the other hand, a number of commentators have noted that satyrs are also similar to beings in the beliefs of ancient Near Eastern cultures. Various demons of the desert are mentioned in ancient Near Eastern texts, although the iconography of these beings is poorly-attested. Beings possibly similar to satyrs called are mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. was the standard Hebrew word for &#x27;he-goat&#x27;, but it could also apparently sometimes refer to demons in the forms of goats. They were evidently subjects of veneration, because Leviticus 17:7 forbids Israelites from making sacrificial offerings to them and 2 Chronicles 11:15 mentions that a special cult was established for the of Jeroboam I. Like satyrs, they were associated with desolate places and with some variety of dancing. Isaiah 13:21 predicts, in Karen L. Edwards&#x27;s translation: &quot;But &quot;wild animals&quot; [] will lie down there, and its houses will be full of &quot;howling creatures&quot; []; there ostriches will live, and there &quot;goat-demons&quot; [] will dance.&quot; Similarly, Isaiah 34:14 declares: &quot;&quot;Wildcats&quot; [] shall meet with &quot;hyenas&quot; [], &quot;goat-demons&quot; [] shall call to each other; there too &quot;Lilith&quot; [] shall repose and find a place to rest.&quot; were understood by at least some ancient commentators to be goat-like demons of the wilderness. In the Latin Vulgate translation of the Old Testament, is translated as , which also means &#x27;hairy&#x27;. Jerome, the translator of the Vulgate, equated these figures with satyrs. Both satyrs and have also been compared to the jinn of Pre-Islamic Arabia, who were envisioned as hairy demons in the forms of animals who could sometimes change into other forms, including human-like ones.

==In archaic and classical Greece==
===Physical appearance===
In archaic and classical Greek art, satyrs are shown with the ears and tails of horses. They walk upright on two legs, like human beings. They are usually shown with bestial faces, snub noses, and manelike hair. They are often bearded and balding. Like other Greek nature spirits, satyrs are always depicted nude. Sometimes they also have the legs of horses, but, in ancient art, including both vase paintings and in sculptures, satyrs are most often represented with human legs and feet.

Satyrs&#x27; genitals are always depicted as either erect or at least extremely large. Their erect phalli represent their association with wine and women, which were the two major aspects of their god Dionysus&#x27;s domain. In some cases, satyrs are portrayed as very human-like, lacking manes or tails. As time progressed, this became the general trend, with satyrs losing aspects of their original bestial appearance over the course of Greek history and gradually becoming more and more human. In the most common depictions, satyrs are shown drinking wine, dancing, playing flutes, chasing nymphs, or consorting with Dionysus. They are also frequently shown masturbating or copulating with animals. In scenes from ceramic paintings depicting satyrs engaging in orgies, satyrs standing by and watching are often shown masturbating.

===Behavior===
One of the earliest written sources for satyrs is the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, which is attributed to the Boeotian poet Hesiod. Here satyrs are born alongside the nymphs and Kouretes and are described as &quot;good-for-nothing, prankster Satyrs&quot;. Satyrs were widely seen as mischief-makers who routinely played tricks on people and interfered with their personal property. They had insatiable sexual appetites and often sought to seduce or ravish both nymphs and mortal women alike, though these attempts were not always successful. Satyrs almost always appear in artwork alongside female companions of some variety. These female companions may be clothed or nude, but the satyrs always treat them as mere sexual objects. A single elderly satyr named Silenus was believed to have been the tutor of Dionysus on Mount Nysa. After Dionysus grew to maturity, Silenus became one of his most devout followers, remaining perpetually drunk.

This image was reflected in the classical Athenian satyr play. Satyr plays were a genre of plays defined by the fact that their choruses were invariably made up of satyrs. These satyrs are always led by Silenus, who is their &quot;father&quot;. According to Carl A. Shaw, the chorus of satyrs in a satyr play were &quot;always trying to get a laugh with their animalistic, playfully rowdy, and, above all, sexual behavior.&quot; The satyrs play an important role in driving the plot of the production, without any of them actually being the lead role, which was always reserved for a god or tragic hero. Many satyr plays are named for the activity in which the chorus of satyrs engage during the production, such as , , and . Like tragedies, but unlike comedies, satyr plays were set in the distant past and dealt with mythological subjects. The third or second-century BC philosopher Demetrius of Phalerum famously characterized the satiric genre in his treatise &quot;De Elocutione&quot; as the middle ground between tragedy and comedy: a &quot;playful tragedy&quot; ().

The only complete extant satyr play is Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Cyclops&quot;, which is a burlesque of a scene from the eighth-century BC epic poem, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which Odysseus is captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus in a cave. In the play, Polyphemus has captured a tribe of satyrs led by Silenus, who is described as their &quot;Father&quot;, and forced them to work for him as his slaves. After Polyphemus captures Odysseus, Silenus attempts to play Odysseus and Polyphemus off each other for his own benefit, primarily by tricking them into giving him wine. As in the original scene, Odysseus manages to blind Polyphemus and escape. Approximately 450 lines, most of which are fragmentary, have survived of Sophocles&#x27;s satyr play &quot;Ichneutae&quot; (&quot;Tracking Satyrs&quot;). In the surviving portion of the play, the chorus of satyrs are described as &quot;lying on the ground like hedgehogs in a bush, or like a monkey bending over to fart at someone.&quot; The character Cyllene scolds them: &quot;All you [satyrs] do you do for the sake of fun!... Cease to expand your smooth phallus with delight. You should not make silly jokes and chatter, so that the gods will make you shed tears to make me laugh.&quot;

In Dionysius I of Syracuse&#x27;s fragmentary satyr play &quot;Limos&quot; (&quot;Starvation&quot;), Silenus attempts to give the hero Heracles an enema. A number of vase paintings depict scenes from satyr plays, including the Pronomos Vase, which depicts the entire cast of a victorious satyr play, dressed in costume, wearing shaggy leggings, erect phalli, and horse tails. The genre&#x27;s reputation for crude humor is alluded to in other texts as well. In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, the tragic poet Agathon declares that a dramatist must be able to adopt the &quot;personae&quot; of his characters in order to successfully portray them on stage. In lines 157–158, Euripides&#x27;s unnamed relative retorts: &quot;Well, let me know when you&#x27;re writing satyr plays; I&#x27;ll get behind you with my hard-on and show you how.&quot; This is the only extant reference to the genre of satyr plays from a work of ancient Greek comedy and, according to Shaw, it effectively characterizes satyr plays as &quot;a genre of &#x27;hard-ons.&#x27;&quot;

In spite of their bawdy behavior, however, satyrs were still revered as semi-divine beings and companions of the god Dionysus. They were thought to possess their own kind of wisdom that was useful to humans if they could be convinced to share it. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Alcibiades praises Socrates by comparing him to the famous satyr Marsyas. He resembles him physically, since he is balding and has a snub-nose, but Alcibiades contends that he resembles him mentally as well, because he is &quot;insulting and abusive&quot;, in possession of irresistible charm, &quot;erotically inclined to beautiful people&quot;, and &quot;acts as if he knows nothing&quot;. Alcibiades concludes that Socrates&#x27;s role as a philosopher is similar to that of the paternal satyr Silenus, because, at first, his questions seem ridiculous and laughable, but, upon closer inspection, they are revealed to be filled with much wisdom. One story, mentioned by Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; and in a fragment by Aristotle, recounts that King Midas once captured a silenus, who provided him with wise philosophical advice.

===Mythology===
According to classicist William Hansen, although satyrs were popular in classical art, they rarely appear in surviving mythological accounts. Different classical sources present conflicting accounts of satyrs&#x27; origins. According to a fragment from the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, satyrs are sons of the five granddaughters of Phoroneus and therefore siblings of the Oreads and the Kouretes. The satyr Marsyas, however, is described by mythographers as the son of either Olympos or Oiagros. Hansen observes that &quot;there may be more than one way to produce a satyr, as there is to produce a Cyclops or a centaur.&quot; The classical Greeks recognized that satyrs obviously could not self-reproduce since there were no female satyrs, but they seem to have been unsure whether satyrs were mortal or immortal.

Rather than appearing &quot;en masse&quot; as in satyr-plays, when satyrs appear in myths it is usually in the form of a single, famous character. The comic playwright Melanippides of Melos ( 480–430 BC) tells the story in his lost comedy &quot;Marsyas&quot; of how, after inventing the &quot;aulos&quot;, the goddess Athena looked in the mirror while she was playing it. She saw how blowing into it puffed up her cheeks and made her look silly, so she threw the aulos away and cursed it so that whoever picked it up would meet an awful death. The aulos was picked up by the satyr Marsyas, who challenged Apollo to a musical contest. They both agreed beforehand that whoever won would be allowed to do whatever he wanted to the loser. Marsyas played the aulos and Apollo played the lyre. Apollo turned his lyre upside-down and played it. He asked Marsyas to do the same with his instrument. Since he could not, Apollo was deemed to victor. Apollo hung Marsyas from a pine tree and flayed him alive to punish him for his hubris in daring to challenge one of the gods. Later, this story became accepted as canonical and the Athenian sculptor Myron created a group of bronze sculptures based on it, which was installed before the western front of the Parthenon in around 440 BC. Surviving retellings of the legend are found in the &quot;Library&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus, Pausanias&#x27;s &quot;Guide to Greece&quot;, and the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Pseudo-Hyginus.

In a myth referenced in multiple classical texts, including the &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus and the &quot;Fabulae&quot; of Pseudo-Hyginus, a satyr from Argos once attempted to rape the nymph Amymone, but she called to the god Poseidon for help and he launched his trident at the satyr, knocking him to the ground. This myth may have originated from Aeschylus&#x27;s lost satyr play &quot;Amymone&quot;. Scenes of one or more satyrs chasing Amymone became a common trope in Greek vase paintings starting in the late fifth century BC. Among the earliest depictions of the scene come from a bell krater in the style of the Peleus Painter from Syracuse (PEM 10, pl. 155) and a bell krater in the style of the Dinos Painter from Vienna (DM 7).

According to one account, Satyrus was one of the many sons of Dionysus and the Bithynian nymph Nicaea, born after Dionysus tricked Nicaea into getting drunk and raped her as she laid unconscious.

=== List of Satyrs ===
Many names of the satyrs that appear in Nonnos&#x27; Dionysiaca are heavily assumed to have been coined by the author, and are nothing more than plot devices with no mythological significance. Four names listed in the epic, when translated, are merely adjectives associated to the character (&quot;Pastoral&quot;, &quot;Cult-association&quot;, &quot;Tall-horn&quot;, and &quot;Mountain-dweller&quot;).

The names of the satyrs according to various vase paintings were: Babacchos, Briacchos, Dithyrambos, Demon, Dromis, Echon, Hedyoinos (&quot;Sweet Wine&quot;), Hybris (&quot;Insolence&quot;), Hedymeles, (&quot;Sweet Song&quot;), Komos (&quot;Revelry&quot;), Kissos (&quot;Ivy&quot;), Molkos, Oinos, Oreimachos, Simos (&quot;Snub-nose&quot;), Terpon and Tyrbas (&quot;Rout&quot;).

==Later antiquity==
===Hellenistic Era===

The iconography of satyrs was gradually conflated with that of the Pans, plural forms of the god Pan, who were regularly depicted with the legs and horns of a goat. By the Hellenistic Period (323–31 BC), satyrs were beginning to sometimes be shown with goat-like features. Meanwhile, both satyrs and Pans also continued to be shown as more human and less bestial. Scenes of satyrs and centaurs were very popular during the Hellenistic Period. They often appear dancing or playing the aulos. The maenads that often accompany satyrs in Archaic and Classical representations are often replaced in Hellenistic portrayals with wood nymphs.

Artists also began to widely represent scenes of nymphs repelling the unwanted advances of amorous satyrs. Scenes of this variety were used to express the dark, beastly side of human sexuality at a remove by attributing that sexuality to satyrs, who were part human and part animal. In this way, satyrs became vehicles of a metaphor for a phenomenon extending far beyond the original narrative purposes in which they had served during earlier periods of Greek history. Some variants on this theme represent a satyr being rebuffed by a hermaphrodite, who, from the satyr&#x27;s perspective, appears to be a beautiful, young girl. These sculptures may have been intended as kind of sophisticated erotic joke.

The Athenian sculptor Praxiteles&#x27;s statue &quot;Pouring Satyr&quot; represented the eponymous satyr as very human-like. The satyr was shown as very young, in line with Praxiteles&#x27;s frequent agenda of representing deities and other figures as adolescents. This tendency is also attested in the descriptions of his sculptures of Dionysus and the Archer Eros written in the third or fourth century AD by the art critic Callistratus. The original statue is widely assumed to have depicted the satyr in the act of pouring an &quot;oinochoe&quot; over his head into a cup, probably a &quot;kantharos&quot;. Antonio Corso describes the satyr in this sculpture as a &quot;gentle youth&quot; and &quot;a precious and gentle being&quot; with &quot;soft and velvety&quot; skin. The only hints at his &quot;feral nature&quot; were his ears, which were slightly pointed, and his small tail.

The shape of the sculpture was an S-shape, shown in three-quarter view. The satyr had short, boyish locks, derived from those of earlier Greek athletic sculpture. Although the original statue has been lost, a representation of the pouring satyr appears in a late classical relief sculpture from Athens and twenty-nine alleged &quot;copies&quot; of the statue from the time of the Roman Empire have also survived. Olga Palagia and J. J. Pollitt argue that, although the &quot;Pouring Satyr&quot; is widely accepted as a genuine work of Praxiteles, it may not have been a single work at all and the supposed &quot;copies&quot; of it may merely be Roman sculptures repeating the traditional Greek motif of pouring wine at &quot;symposia&quot;.
===Ancient Rome===
The Romans identified satyrs with their own nature spirits, fauns. Although generally similar to satyrs, fauns differed in that they were usually seen as &quot;shy, woodland creatures&quot; rather than the drunk and boisterous satyrs of the classical Greeks. Also, fauns generally lacked the association Greek satyrs had with secret wisdom. Unlike classical Greek satyrs, fauns were unambiguously goat-like; they had the upper bodies of men, but the legs, hooves, tail, and horns of goats. The first-century BC Roman poet Lucretius mentions in his lengthy poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot; that people of his time believed in &quot;goat-legged&quot; (&quot;capripedes&quot;) satyrs, along with nymphs who lived in the mountains and fauns who played rustic music on stringed instruments and pipes.

In Roman-era depictions, satyrs and fauns are both often associated with music and depicted playing the Pan pipes or &quot;syrinx&quot;. The poet Virgil, who flourished during the early years of the Roman Empire, recounts a story in his sixth &quot;Eclogue&quot; about two boys who tied up the satyr Silenus while he was in a drunken stupor and forced him to sing them a song about the beginning of the universe. The first-century AD Roman poet Ovid makes Jupiter, the king of the gods, express worry that the viciousness of humans will leave fauns, nymphs, and satyrs without a place to live, so he gives them a home in the forests, woodlands, and mountains, where they will be safe. Ovid also retells the story of Marsyas&#x27;s hubris. He describes a musical contest between Marsyas, playing the aulos, and the god Apollo, playing the lyre. Marsyas loses and Apollo flays him as punishment.

The Roman naturalist and encyclopedist Pliny the Elder conflated satyrs with gibbons, which he describes using the word &quot;satyrus&quot;, a Latinized form of the Greek &quot;satyros&quot;. He characterizes them as &quot;a savage and wild people; distinct voice and speech they have none, but in steed thereof, they keep a horrible gnashing and hideous noise: rough they are and hairie all over their bodies, eies they have red like the houlets [owls] and toothed they be like dogs.&quot;

The second-century Greek Middle Platonist philosopher Plutarch records a legendary incident in his &quot;Life of Sulla&quot;, in which the soldiers of the Roman general Sulla are reported to have captured a satyr sleeping during a military campaign in Greece in 89 BC. Sulla&#x27;s men brought the satyr to him and he attempted to interrogate it, but it spoke only in an unintelligible sound: a cross between the neighing of a horse and the bleating of a goat. The second-century Greek travel writer Pausanias reports having seen the tombs of deceased silenoi in Judaea and at Pergamon. Based on these sites, Pausanias concludes that silenoi must be mortal.

The third-century Greek biographer Philostratus records a legend in his &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot; of how the ghost of an Aethiopian satyr was deeply enamored with the women from the local village and had killed two of them. Then, the philosopher Apollonius of Tyana set a trap for it with wine, knowing that, after drinking it, the ghost-satyr would fall asleep forever. The wine diminished from the container before the onlookers&#x27; eyes, but the ghost-satyr himself remained invisible. Once all the wine had vanished, the ghost-satyr fell asleep and never bothered the villagers again. Amira El-Zein notes similarities between this story and later Arabic accounts of jinn. The treatise &quot;Saturnalia&quot; by the fifth-century AD Roman poet Macrobius connects both the word &quot;satyr&quot; and the name &quot;Saturn&quot; to the Greek word for &quot;penis&quot;. Macrobius explains that this is on account of satyrs&#x27; sexual lewdness. Macrobius also equates Dionysus and Apollo as the same deity and states that a festival in honor of Bacchus is held every year atop Mount Parnassus, at which many satyrs are often seen.

==After antiquity==
===Middle Ages===
Starting in late antiquity, Christian writers began to portray satyrs and fauns as dark, evil, and demonic. Jerome ( 347 – 420 AD) described them as symbols of Satan on account of their lasciviousness. Despite this, however, satyrs were sometimes clearly distinguished from demons and sometimes even portrayed as noble. Because Christians believed that the distinction between humans and animals was spiritual rather than physical, it was thought that even a satyr could attain salvation. Isidore of Seville ( 560 – 636) records an anecdote later recounted in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, that Anthony the Great encountered a satyr in the desert who asked to pray with him to their common God. During the Early Middle Ages, features and characteristics of satyrs and the god Pan, who resembled a satyr, became absorbed into traditional Christian iconography of Satan.

Medieval storytellers in Western Europe also frequently conflated satyrs with wild men. Both satyrs and wild men were conceived as part human and part animal and both were believed to possess unrestrained sexual appetites. Stories of wild men during the Middle Ages often had an erotic tone and were primarily told orally by peasants, since the clergy officially disapproved of them. In this form, satyrs are sometimes described and represented in medieval bestiaries, where a satyr is often shown dressed in an animal skin, carrying a club and a serpent. In the &quot;Aberdeen Bestiary&quot;, the &quot;Ashmole Bestiary&quot;, and MS Harley 3244, a satyr is shown as a nude man holding a wand resembling a jester&#x27;s club and leaning back, crossing his legs. Satyrs are sometimes juxtaposed with apes, which are characterized as &quot;physically disgusting and akin to the Devil&quot;. In other cases, satyrs are usually shown nude, with enlarged phalli to emphasize their sexual nature. In the Second-Family Bestiary, the name &quot;satyr&quot; is used as the name of a species of ape, which is described as having a &quot;very agreeable face, restless, however, in its twitching movements.&quot;

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance, satyrs and fauns began to reappear in works of European art. During the Renaissance, no distinction was made between satyrs and fauns and both were usually given human and goat-like features in whatever proportion the artist deemed appropriate. A goat-legged satyr appears at the base of Michelangelo&#x27;s statue &quot;Bacchus&quot; (1497). Renaissance satyrs still sometimes appear in scenes of drunken revelry like those from antiquity, but they also sometimes appear in family scenes, alongside female and infant or child satyrs. This trend towards more familial, domestic satyrs may have resulted from conflation with wild men, who, especially in Renaissance depictions from Germany, were often portrayed as living relatively peaceful lives with their families in the wilderness. The most famous representation of a domestic satyr is Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s 1505 engraving &quot;The Satyr&#x27;s Family&quot;, which has been widely reproduced and imitated. This popular portrayal of satyrs and wild men may have also helped give rise to the later European concept of the noble savage.

Satyrs occupied a paradoxical, liminal space in Renaissance art, not only because they were part human and part beast, but also because they were both antique and natural. They were of classical origin, but had an iconographical canon of their own very different from the standard representations of gods and heroes. They could be used to embody what Stephen J. Campbell calls a &quot;monstrous double&quot; of the category in which human beings often placed themselves. It is in this aspect that satyrs appear in Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari&#x27;s 1495 series of prints depicting satyrs and naked men in combat and in Piero di Cosimo&#x27;s &quot;Stories of Primitive Man&quot;, inspired by Lucretius. Satyrs became seen as &quot;pre-human&quot;, embodying all the traits of savagery and barbarism associated with animals, but in human-like bodies. Satyrs also became used to question early modern humanism in ways which some scholars have seen as similar to present-day posthumanism, as in Titian&#x27;s &quot;Flaying of Marsyas&quot; ( 1570–1576). &quot;The Flaying of Marysas&quot; depicts the scene from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in which the satyr Marysas is flayed alive. According to Campbell, the people performing the flaying are shown calmly absorbed in their task, while Marsyas himself even displays &quot;an unlikely patience&quot;. The painting reflects a broad continuum between the divine and the bestial.

===Early modern period===
In the 1560 Geneva Bible, the word in both of the instances in Isaiah is translated into English as &#x27;satyr&#x27;. The 1611 King James Version follows this translation and likewise renders as &#x27;satyr&#x27;. Edwards states that the King James Version&#x27;s translation of this phrase and others like it was intended to reduce the strangeness and unfamiliarity of the creatures described in the original Hebrew text by rendering them as names of familiar entities. Edmund Spenser refers to a group of woodland creatures as Satyrs in his epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. In Canto VI, Una is wandering through the forest when she stumbles upon a &quot;troupe of Fauns and Satyrs far away Within the wood were dancing in a round.&quot; Although Satyrs are often negatively characterized in Greek and Roman mythology, the Satyrs in this poem are docile, helpful creatures. This is evident by the way they help protect Una from Sansloy. Sylvanus, the leader, and the rest of the Satyrs become enamored by Una&#x27;s beauty and begin to worship her as if she is a deity. However, the Satyrs prove to be simple-minded creatures because they begin to worship the donkey she was riding.

In the seventeenth century, satyrs became identified with great apes. In 1699, the English anatomist Edward Tyson (1651–1708) published an account of his dissection of a creature which scholars have now identified as chimpanzee. In this account, Tyson argued that stories of satyrs, wild men, and other hybrid mythological creatures had all originated from the misidentification of apes or monkeys. The French materialist philosopher Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709–1751) included a section titled &quot;On savage men, called Satyrs&quot; in his &quot;Oeuvres philosophiques&quot;, in which he describes great apes, identifying them with both satyrs and wild men. Many early accounts of the orangutan describe the males as being sexually aggressive towards human women and towards females of its own species, much like classical Greek satyrs. The first scientific name given to this ape was &quot;Simia satyrus&quot;.

Relationships between satyrs and nymphs of this period are often portrayed as consensual. This trend is exemplified by the 1623 painting &quot;Satyr and Nymph&quot; by Gerard van Honthorst, which depicts a satisfied satyr and nymph lasciviously fondling each other after engaging in obviously consensual sex. Both are smiling and the nymph is showing her teeth, a sign commonly used by painters of the era to signify that the woman in question is of loose morals. The satyr&#x27;s tongue is visible as the nymph playfully tugs on his goat beard and he strokes her chin. Even during this period, however, depictions of satyrs uncovering sleeping nymphs are still common, indicating that their traditional associations with rape and sexual violence had not been forgotten.

===Nineteenth century===
During the nineteenth century, satyrs and nymphs came to often function as a means of representing sexuality without offending Victorian moral sensibilities. In the novel &quot;The Marble Faun&quot; (1860) by the American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, the Italian count Donatello is described as bearing a remarkable resemblance to one of Praxiteles&#x27;s marble satyr statues. Like the satyrs of Greek legend, Donatello has a carefree nature. His association with satyrs is further cemented by his intense sexual attraction to the American woman Miriam.

Satyrs and nymphs provided a classical pretext which allowed sexual depictions of them to be seen as objects of high art rather than mere pornography. The French emperor Napoleon III awarded the Academic painter Alexandre Cabanel the Legion of Honour, partly on account of his painting &quot;Nymph Abducted by a Faun&quot;. In 1873, another French Academicist William-Adolphe Bouguereau painted &quot;Nymphs and Satyr&quot;, which depicts four nude nymphs dancing around &quot;an unusually submissive satyr&quot;, gently coaxing him into the water of a nearby stream. This painting was bought that same year by an American named John Wolfe, who displayed it publicly in a prominent location in the bar at the Hoffman House, a hotel he owned on Madison Square and Broadway. Despite its risqué subject, many women came to the bar to view the painting. The painting was soon mass reproduced on ceramic tiles, porcelain plates, and other luxury items in the United States.

In 1876, Stéphane Mallarmé wrote &quot;The Afternoon of a Faun&quot;, a first-person narrative poem about a faun who attempts to kiss two beautiful nymphs while they are sleeping together. He accidentally wakes them up. Startled, they transform into white water birds and fly away, leaving the faun to play his pan pipes alone. Claude Debussy composed a symphonic poem &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (&quot;Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun&quot;), which was first performed in 1894.The late nineteenth-century German Existentialist philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was either unaware of or chose to ignore the fact that, in all the earliest representations, satyrs are depicted as horse-like. He accordingly defined a satyr as a &quot;bearded&quot; creature &quot;who derived his name and attributes from the goat.&quot; Nietzsche excluded the horse-like satyrs of Greek tradition from his consideration entirely and argued that tragedy had originated from a chorus of men dressed up as satyrs or goats (&quot;tragoi&quot;). Thus, Nietzsche held that tragedy had begun as a Dionysian activity. Nietzsche&#x27;s rejection of the early evidence for horse-like satyrs was a mistake his critics severely excoriated him for. Nonetheless, he was the first modern scholar to recognize the full importance of satyrs in Greek culture and tradition, as Dionysian symbols of humanity&#x27;s close ties to the animal kingdom. Like the Greeks, Nietzsche envisioned satyrs as essentially humans stripped down to their most basic and bestial instincts.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===

In 1908, the French painter Henri Matisse produced his own &quot;Nymph and Satyr&quot; painting, in which the animal nature of the satyr is drastically minimized. The satyr is given human legs, but is exceptionally hairy. The seduction element is removed altogether; the satyr simply extends his arms towards the nymph, who lies on the ground, defeated. Penny Florence writes that the &quot;generic scene displays little sensuality&quot; and that the main factor distinguishing it is its tone, because &quot;[i]t does not seem convincing as a rape, despite the nymph&#x27;s reluctance.&quot; In 1912, Vaslav Nijinsky choreographed Debussy&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun&quot; as a ballet and danced in it as the lead role of the faun. The choreography of the ballet and Nijinsky&#x27;s performance were both highly erotic and sexually charged, causing widespread scandal among upper-class Parisians. In the 1980 biographical film &quot;Nijinsky&quot;, directed by Herbert Ross, Nijinsky, who is played by George de la Peña, is portrayed as actually masturbating on stage in front of the entire live audience during the climax of the dance.

The 1917 Italian silent film &quot;Il Fauno&quot;, directed by Febo Mari, is about a statue of a faun who comes to life and falls in love with a female model. Fauns appear in the animated dramatization of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 (1808) in the 1940 Disney animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Their goat-legs are portrayed as brightly colored, but their hooves are black. They play the Pan pipes and, like traditional satyrs and fauns, are portrayed as mischievous. One young faun plays hide-and-seek with a unicorn and imitates a statue of a faun atop a pedestal. Though the fauns are not portrayed as overtly sexual, they do assist the Cupids in pairing the centaurs into couples. A drunken Bacchus appears in the same scene.

A faun named Mr. Tumnus appears in the classic juvenile fantasy novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950) by C. S. Lewis. Mr. Tumnus has goat legs and horns, but also a tail long enough for him to carry it draped over his arm to prevent it from dragging in the snow. He is a domesticated figure who lacks the bawdiness and hypersexuality that characterized classical satyrs and fauns. Instead, Mr. Tumnus wears a scarf and carries an umbrella and lives in a cozy cave with a bookshelf with works such as &quot;The Life and Letters of Silenus&quot;, &quot;Nymphs and their Ways&quot;, and &quot;Is Man a Myth?&quot;.

The satyr has appeared in all five editions of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game, having been introduced in 1976 in the earliest edition, in Supplement IV: &quot;Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; (1976), then in the first edition of the Monster Manual (1977), where it is described as a sylvan woodland inhabitant primarily interested in sport such as frolicking, piping, and chasing wood nymphs. The life history of satyrs was further detailed in &quot;Dragon&quot; No. 155 (March 1990), in &quot;The Ecology of the Satyr&quot;. The satyr was later detailed as a playable character race in &quot;The Complete Book of Humanoids&quot; (1993), and is later presented as a playable character race again in &quot;Player&#x27;s Option: Skills &amp; Powers&quot; (1995). The satyr appears in the Monster Manual for the 3.0 edition. &quot;Savage Species&quot; (2003) presented the satyr as both a race and a playable class. The satyr appears in the revised Monster Manual for version 3.5 and also appears in the Monster Manual for the 4th edition, and as a playable character race in the &quot;Heroes of the Feywild&quot; sourcebook (2011).

Matthew Barney&#x27;s art video &quot;Drawing Restraint 7&quot; (1993) includes two satyrs wrestling in the backseat of a moving limousine. A satyr named Grover Underwood appears in the young adult fantasy novel &quot;The Lightning Thief&quot; (2005) by American author Rick Riordan, as well as in subsequent novels in the series &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot;. Though consistently referred to as a &quot;satyr&quot;, Grover is described as having goat legs, pointed ears, and horns. Grover is not portrayed with the sexually obscene traits that characterized classical Greek satyrs. Instead, he is the loyal protector to the main character Percy Jackson, who is the son of a mortal woman and the god Poseidon.

<text>The &quot;Sturgeon&quot; class (known colloquially in naval circles as the 637 class) was a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy from the 1960s until 2004. They were the &quot;workhorses&quot; of the Navy&#x27;s attack submarine fleet throughout much of the Cold War. The boats were phased out in the 1990s and early 21st century, as their successors, the , followed by the and -class boats, entered service.

==Design==

The &quot;Sturgeon&quot;s were essentially lengthened and improved variants of the &quot;Thresher/Permit&quot; class that directly preceded them. The five-compartment arrangement of the &quot;Permit&quot;s was retained, including the bow compartment, operations compartment, reactor compartment, auxiliary machinery room no. 2, and the engine room. The extra length was in the operations compartment, including longer torpedo racks to accommodate additional Mark 37 torpedoes, the most advanced in service at the time of the class&#x27;s design in the late 1950s. The class was redesigned to SUBSAFE requirements concurrently with the construction of the first units, with seawater, main ballast, and other systems modified for improved safety. The biggest difference was the much larger sail, which permitted a second periscope and additional intelligence-gathering masts, and which reduced the risk of the submarine broaching the surface in heavy seas. The fairwater planes mounted on the sail could rotate 90 degrees, allowing the submarine to surface through thin ice. Because the S5W reactor was used (the same as in the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s and &quot;Thresher/Permit&quot;s), the sail was enlarged (increasing drag), and the displacement was increased, the &quot;Sturgeon&quot;s&#x27; top speed was , 2 knots slower than the &quot;Thresher/Permit&quot;s.
The last nine &quot;Sturgeon&quot;s were lengthened to provide more space for electronic equipment and habitability. The extra space also helped facilitate the use of dry deck shelters first deployed in 1982.

The class received mid-life upgrades in the 1980s, including the BQQ-5 sonar suite with a retractable towed array, Mk 117 torpedo fire control equipment, and other electronics upgrades.
==Armament==
The &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class boats were equipped to carry the Harpoon missile, the Tomahawk cruise missile, the UUM-44 SUBROC, the Mark 67 SLMM and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines, and the MK-48 and ADCAP torpedoes. Torpedo tubes were located amidships to accommodate the bow-mounted sonar. The bow covering the sonar sphere was made from steel or glass reinforced plastic (GRP), both varieties having been produced both booted and not booted. Booted domes are covered with a half-inch layer of rubber. The GRP domes improved the bow sonar sphere performance; though for intelligence gathering missions, the towed-array sonar was normally used as it was a much more sensitive array.

==Noise reduction==
Several &quot;Sturgeon&quot; boats and related submarines were modifications of the original designs to test ways to reduce noise.
* was outfitted with Raytheon Harmonic Power Conditioners which eliminated an electrical bus noise problem that was inherent in the class. This was done by harmonic conditioning of the power system. This successful feature was later outfitted on the entire class.
* and among others were outfitted with SHT (Special Hull Treatment) during a non-refueling overhaul, which reduced noise and the submarine sonar profile.
*, a one-ship class, was completed using a turbo-electric system for main propulsion rather than a reduction gear drive from the steam turbines. The massive motor and associated generators required her to be lengthened to . The &quot;Lipscomb&quot;&#x27;s trial of turbo-electric propulsion was not considered successful due to lower speed - top speed was , 5 knots slower than the &quot;Thresher/Permit&quot;s - and a lack of reliability, and she was decommissioned in 1989.
*, the quietest submarine of her era, had a similar but distinct design to the &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class submarines. The &quot;Narwhal&quot; (SCB 245) and the &quot;Sturgeon&quot; class (SCB 188A) were developed simultaneously. Forward the &quot;Narwhal&quot; resembled the &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class submarines, but with a relocated diesel generator and slightly greater beam. Aft she had the natural circulation S5G reactor and a direct-drive turbine, along with several other quieting features. Unlike the &quot;Sturgeon&quot; class, the &quot;Narwhal&quot; did not fully comply with SUBSAFE regulations due to her unique main seawater system.

==Variants==
Beginning with , units of this class had a longer hull, giving them more living and working space than previous submarines. received an additional hull extension containing cable tapping equipment that brought her total length to . A number of the long hull &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class SSNs, including &quot;Parche&quot;, &quot;L. Mendel Rivers&quot;, and &quot;Richard B. Russell&quot; were involved in top-secret reconnaissance missions, including cable tap operations in the Barents and Okhotsk seas. &quot;Parche&quot; received nine Presidential Unit Citations for successful missions.

A total of seven boats were modified to carry the SEAL Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). The DDS is a submersible launch hangar with a lockout chamber attached to the ship&#x27;s midships weapons shipping hatch, facilitating the use of SEAL Delivery Vehicles. DDS-equipped boats were tasked with the covert insertion of special forces.

<text>The &quot;Seawolf&quot; class is a class of nuclear-powered, fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The class was the intended successor to the , and design work began in 1983. A fleet of 29 submarines was to be built over a ten-year period, but that was reduced to 12 submarines. The end of the Cold War and budget constraints led to the cancellation of any further additions to the fleet in 1995, leaving the &quot;Seawolf&quot; class limited to just three boats. This, in turn, led to the design of the smaller . The &quot;Seawolf&quot; class cost about $3 billion per unit ($3.5 billion for ), making it the most expensive United States Navy fast attack submarine and second most expensive submarine ever, after the French nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.

== Design ==
The &quot;Seawolf&quot; design was intended to combat the threat of advanced Soviet ballistic missile submarines such as the , and attack submarines such as the in a deep-ocean environment. &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class hulls are constructed from HY-100 steel, which is stronger than the HY-80 steel employed in previous classes, in order to withstand water pressure at greater depths.

&quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarines are larger, faster, and significantly quieter than previous &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines; they also carry more weapons and have twice as many torpedo tubes. The boats are able to carry up to 50 UGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles for attacking land and sea surface targets. The boats also have extensive equipment to allow shallow water operations. The class uses the more advanced ARCI Modified AN/BSY-2 combat system, which includes a larger spherical sonar array, a wide aperture array (WAA), and a new towed-array sonar. Each boat is powered by a single S6W nuclear reactor, delivering to a low-noise pump-jet.

As a result of their advanced design, however, &quot;Seawolf&quot;-class submarines were much more expensive. The projected cost for 12 submarines of this class was $33.6 billion, but construction was stopped at three boats when the Cold War ended.

== Variants ==
 is roughly longer than the other two boats of her class, due to the insertion of a section known as the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP) which allows launch and recovery of remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) and Navy SEALs. The MMP may also be used as an underwater splicing chamber for tapping of undersea fiber optic cables. This role was formerly filled by the now decommissioned . &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot; was modified for this role by General Dynamics Electric Boat at a cost of $887 million.

<text>SunOS is a Unix-branded operating system developed by Sun Microsystems for their workstation and server computer systems from 1982 until the mid-1990s. The &quot;SunOS&quot; name is usually only used to refer to versions 1.0 to 4.1.4, which were based on BSD, while versions 5.0 and later are based on UNIX System V Release 4 and are marketed under the brand name &quot;Solaris&quot;.

==History==
SunOS 1 only supported the Sun-2 series systems, including Sun-1 systems upgraded with Sun-2 (68010) CPU boards. SunOS 2 supported Sun-2 and Sun-3 (68020) series systems. SunOS 4 supported Sun-2 (until release 4.0.3), Sun-3 (until 4.1.1), Sun386i (4.0, 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 only) and Sun-4 (SPARC) architectures. Although SunOS 4 was intended to be the first release to fully support Sun&#x27;s new SPARC processor, there was also a SunOS 3.2 release with preliminary support for Sun-4 systems.

SunOS 4.1.2 introduced support for Sun&#x27;s first sun4m-architecture multiprocessor machines (the SPARCserver 600MP series); since it had only a single lock for the kernel, only one CPU at a time could execute in the kernel.

The last release of SunOS 4 was 4.1.4 (Solaris 1.1.2) in 1994. The sun4, sun4c and sun4m architectures were supported in 4.1.4; sun4d was not supported.

Sun continued to ship SunOS 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 until December 27, 1998; they were supported until September 30, 2003.
=== Version history ===
==&quot;SunOS&quot; and &quot;Solaris&quot;==

In 1987, AT&amp;T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix flavors on the market at that time: BSD (including many of the features then unique to SunOS), System V, and Xenix. This would become System V Release 4 (SVR4). 

On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that its next major OS release would switch from its BSD-derived source base to one based on SVR4. Although the internal designation of this release would be &quot;SunOS 5&quot;, from this point Sun began using the marketing name &quot;Solaris&quot;. The justification for this new &quot;overbrand&quot; was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the OpenWindows desktop environment and Open Network Computing (ONC) functionality.

Even though the new SVR4-based OS was not expected to ship in volume until the following year, Sun immediately began using the new &quot;Solaris&quot; name to refer to the currently shipping SunOS 4 release (also including OpenWindows). Thus SunOS 4.1.1 was rebranded &quot;Solaris 1.0&quot;; SunOS 5.0 would be considered a part of Solaris 2.0. SunOS 4.1.&quot;x&quot; micro versions continued to be released through 1994, and each of these was also given a &quot;Solaris 1.&quot;x equivalent name. In practice, these were often still referred to by customers and even Sun personnel by their SunOS release names. Matching the version numbers was not straightforward:

Today, SunOS 5 is universally known as &quot;Solaris&quot;, although the &quot;SunOS&quot; name is still visible within the OS itself in the startup banner, the output of the uname command, and man page footers, among other places.

Matching a SunOS 5.x release to its corresponding Solaris marketing name is simple: each Solaris release name includes its corresponding SunOS 5 minor version number. For example, Solaris 2.4 incorporated SunOS 5.4. There is one small twist: after Solaris 2.6, the &quot;2.&quot; was dropped from the Solaris name and the SunOS minor number appears by itself. The latest Solaris release is named &quot;Solaris 11&quot; and incorporates SunOS 5.11.

==User interface==
Beginning with SunOS 1.0, the Sun Window System provided a GUI called Suntools, layered on top of lower-level windowing and bitmap libraries; this was renamed SunView in SunOS 3.0. Sun then developed a novel window system called NeWS that used and extended the PostScript language and graphics model. In 1989, Sun released OpenWindows, an OPEN LOOK-compliant X11-based environment which also supported SunView and NeWS applications. This became the default SunOS GUI in SunOS 4.1.1.

<text>The SANS Institute (officially the Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies) is a private U.S. for-profit company founded in 1989 that specializes in information security, cybersecurity training, and selling certificates. Topics available for training include cyber and network defenses, penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, and auditing. The information security courses are developed through a consensus process involving administrators, security managers, and information security professionals. The courses cover security fundamentals and technical aspects of information security. The institute has been recognized for its training programs and certification programs. Per 2021, SANS is the world’s largest cybersecurity research and training organization. SANS is an acronym for SysAdmin, Audit, Network, and Security.

==Programs==
The SANS Institute sponsors the Internet Storm Center, an internet monitoring system staffed by a community of security practitioners, and the &quot;SANS Reading Room&quot;, a research archive of information security policy and research documents. SANS is one of the founding organizations of the Center for Internet Security.

SANS offers news and analysis through Twitter feeds and e-mail newsletters. Additionally, there is a weekly news and vulnerability digest available to subscribers.

==Training==
When originally organized in 1989, SANS training events functioned like traditional technical conferences showcasing technical presentations. By the mid-1990s, SANS offered events which combined training with tradeshows. Beginning in 2006, SANS offered asynchronous online training (SANS OnDemand) and a virtual, synchronous classroom format (SANS vLive). Free webcasts and email newsletters (@Risk, Newsbites, Ouch!) have been developed in conjunction with security vendors. The actual content behind SANS training courses and training events remains &quot;vendor-agnostic&quot;. Vendors cannot pay to offer their own official SANS course, although they can teach a SANS &quot;hosted&quot; event via sponsorship.

In 1999, the SANS Institute formed Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC), an independent entity that grants certifications in information security topics.

It has developed and operates &quot;NetWars&quot;, a suite of interactive learning tools for simulating scenarios such as cyberattacks. NetWars is in use by the US Air Force and the US Army.

==Faculty==
The majority of SANS faculty are not SANS employees, but industry professionals and experts in the field of information security. The faculty is organized into six different levels: Mentors, Community, Certified Instructors, Principal Instructors, Senior Instructors, and Fellows.

==SANS Technology Institute==
, SANS established the SANS Technology Institute, an accredited college based on SANS training and GIAC certifications. On November 21, 2013, SANS Technology Institute was granted regional accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

SANS Technology Institute focuses exclusively on cybersecurity, offering a Master of Science degree program in Information Security Engineering (MSISE), five post-baccalaureate certificate programs (Penetration Testing &amp; Ethical Hacking, Incident Response, Industrial Control Systems, Cyber Defense Operations, and Cybersecurity Engineering (Core), and an upper-division undergraduate certificate program (Applied Cybersecurity). SANS later launched a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in Applied Cybersecurity as well.

SANS continues to offer free security content via the SANS Technology Institute Leadership Lab and IT/Security related leadership information.

== Courses &amp; Certifications ==
SANS offers more than 85 hands-on cyber security courses and certification programs.

<text>Sun Myung Moon (; born Moon Yong-myeong; 6 January 1920 – 3 September 2012) was a Korean religious leader, also known for his business ventures and support for conservative political causes. A messiah claimant, he was the founder of the Unification Church, whose members consider him and his wife Hak Ja Han to be their &quot;True Parents&quot;, and of its widely noted &quot;Blessing&quot; or mass wedding ceremonies. The author of the Unification Church&#x27;s religious scripture, the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, was an anti-communist and an advocate for Korean reunification, for which he was recognized by the governments of both North and South Korea. Businesses he promoted included News World Communications, an international news media corporation known for its American subsidiary &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and Tongil Group, a South Korean business group (chaebol), as well as other related organizations.

Moon was born in what is now North Korea. When he was a child, his family converted to Christianity. In the 1940s and 1950s, he was imprisoned multiple times by the North and South Korean governments during his early new religious ministries, formally founding the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, simply known as the Unification Church, in Seoul, South Korea, in 1954.

The Unification Church teaches conservative, heterosexual family-oriented values from new interpretations of the Christian Bible mixed with theology from Moon&#x27;s own text, the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;. In 1971, Moon moved to the United States and became well known after giving a series of public speeches on his beliefs. In the 1982 case &quot;United States v. Sun Myung Moon&quot;, he was found guilty of willfully filing false federal income tax returns and sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. His case generated protests from clergy and civil libertarians, who said that the trial was biased against him.

Many of Moon&#x27;s followers were very dedicated and were often referred to in popular parlance as &quot;Moonies&quot;. His wedding ceremonies drew criticism, specifically after members of other churches took part, including the excommunicated Roman Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo. Moon was also criticized for his relationships with political and religious figures, including US presidents Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush; Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev; North Korean president Kim Il Sung; and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.

==Early life==

Sun Myung Moon was born Yong Myung Moon on 6 January 1920 in modern-day North P&#x27;yŏng&#x27;an Province, North Korea, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule. He was the second son in a farming family of thirteen children, eight of whom survived. Moon&#x27;s family followed Confucianist beliefs until he was around 10 years old. Then they converted to Christianity and joined the Presbyterian Church. Moon claims that he experienced a religious vision of Jesus at age 16 that laid out his life&#x27;s mission.

In 1941, Moon began studying electrical engineering at Waseda University in Japan. During this time, he cooperated with Communist Party members in the Korean independence movement against Imperial Japan. In 1943, he returned to Seoul and, in 1944, married his first wife, Sun-kil Choi (; ; &quot;Choe Seon-gil&quot;). They had a son, Sung Jin Moon (; ; &quot;Mun Seong-jin&quot;). In the 1940s, Sun Myung Moon attended a church led by Kim Baek-moon, who influentially taught that he had been given by Jesus the mission to spread the message of a &quot;new Israel&quot; throughout the world. Around this time, Moon changed his given name to Sun Myung in an effort to quell the increased resentment of other Christians against him, as he gradually began gathering his own group of followers.

Following World War II, Korea was divided (South and North) along the 38th parallel into two trusteeships: the United States and the Soviet Union. Pyongyang (the eventual capital of North Korea) was the center of Christian activity in Korea until 1945. From the late 1940s, hundreds of Korean Christian religious figures were killed or disappeared in concentration camps, including Francis Hong Yong-ho, Catholic bishop of Pyongyang, and all monks of Tokwon Abbey. When Moon started his own movement (an early version of the Unification Church) in Pyongyang in 1946, the Soviet-controlled North Korean government imprisoned and, he claims, tortured him. Sources vary on the motivation behind his arrest: religious persecution, or a charge of espionage or polygamy. His religious practices during this time may have included unorthodox sexual rituals with multiple women, a claim the Unification Church denies and some scholars have doubted.

Arrested again in 1948, he was sentenced to five years at Hungnam labor camp, though in 1950, during the Korean War, he was liberated by United Nations troops and allegedly traveled by foot to Busan, (South) Korea. Moon emerged from his years in the labor camp as a staunch anti-communist. His teachings viewed the Cold War between capitalism and communism as the final conflict between God and Satan, with divided Korea as its primary front line.

In the 1950s, after years of being separated from his wife and child before reuniting, Moon and Choi divorced. Moon moved to Seoul once again and, continuing his ministry, was arrested two more times: once on suspicion of religious orgies and once for draft evasion; both charges were overturned.

In 1954, Moon formally founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity in Seoul and fathered an illegitimate child (who died in 1969). In the 1950s, Moon quickly drew young acolytes who helped to build the foundations of Unification-affiliated business and cultural organizations. In his new church, he preached a conservative, family-oriented value system and his interpretation of the Bible. A follower whose family joined Moon&#x27;s movement in the early 1950s claims that she and Moon engaged in various religious sexual rituals, including with several other women, and that she remained Moon&#x27;s mistress (through his second marriage) until 1964, bearing Moon another son, in secret, in 1965.

==Second marriage and Blessing ceremonies==
===Marriage to Hak Ja Han===
Moon married his second wife, Hak Ja Han (who was 17 at the time) on 11 April 1960, soon after Moon turned 40 years old, in a ceremony called the Holy Marriage. Han is called &quot;Mother&quot; or &quot;True Mother&quot;. She and Moon together are referred to as the &quot;True Parents&quot; by members of the Unification Church and their family as the &quot;True Family&quot;. Jesus was divine but not God; he was supposed to be the second Adam who would create a perfect family by joining with the ideal wife and creating a pure family that would have begun humanity&#x27;s liberation from its sinful condition. When Jesus was crucified before marrying, he redeemed mankind spiritually but not physically. That task was left to the &quot;True Parents&quot;—Moon and Han—who would link married couples and their families to God.

===Blessing ceremonies===

Although they initially lived communally, his followers gradually returned to the traditional Christian family form (monogamy). Blessing ceremonies have attracted attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled &quot;mass weddings&quot;. People who have never met, from completely different countries, were married by the Messiah of the Unification Church by &quot;matching&quot;. They were informed that a certain person, specially chosen for him/her by the Messiah, would become their husband/wife. Some of them did not see their future partner until the day of the &quot;marriage&quot;. Public mass blessing ceremonies followed. Some couples are already married, and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries. Meant to highlight the church&#x27;s emphasis on traditional morality, they brought Moon both fame and controversy.

36 couples participated in the first ceremony in 1961 for members of the early church in Seoul. The ceremonies continued to grow in scale; over 2,000 couples participated in the 1982 one at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, the first outside South Korea. In 1992, about 30,000 couples took part in a ceremony and a record 360,000 couples in Seoul took part three years later.

Moon said that he matched couples from differing races and nationalities because of his belief that all of humanity should be united: &quot;International and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an ideal world of peace. People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the world of peace can come that much more quickly.&quot;

===Establishing beliefs of the Unification movement===

Moon said that when he was 16 years old, Jesus appeared to him, anointing him to carry out his unfinished work by becoming a parent to all of humanity. The , or &quot;Exposition of the Divine Principle&quot; (), is the main theological textbook of the Unification movement. It was co-written by Moon and early disciple Hyo Won Eu and first published in 1966. A translation entitled &quot;Divine Principle&quot; was published in English in 1973. The book lays out the core of Unification theology and is held to have the status of scripture by believers. Following the format of systematic theology, it includes (1) God&#x27;s purpose in creating human beings, (2) the fall of man, and (3) restoration—the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended.

God is viewed as the creator, whose nature combines both masculinity and femininity, and is the source of all truth, beauty, and goodness. Human beings and the universe reflect God&#x27;s personality, nature, and purpose. &quot;Give-and-take action&quot; (reciprocal interaction) and &quot;subject and object position&quot; (initiator and responder) are &quot;key interpretive concepts&quot;, and the self is designed to be God&#x27;s object. The purpose of human existence is to return joy to God. The &quot;four-position foundation&quot; (Origin, Subject, Object, and Union) is another important and interpretive concept and explains in part the emphasis on the family.

==Move to United States==
In 1971, Moon moved to the United States, which he had first visited in 1965, and eventually settled into a 35-room mansion on an estate in Irvington, New York. He remained a citizen of South Korea, where he maintained a residence. In 1972, Moon founded the International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences, a series of scientific conferences. The first conference had 20 participants, while the largest conference in Seoul, in 1982, had 808 participants from over 100 countries. Participants included Nobel laureates John Eccles (Physiology or Medicine 1963, who chaired the 1976 conference)
and Eugene Wigner (Physics 1963).

In 1974, Moon asked church members in the United States to support President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, when Nixon was being pressured to resign his office. Church members prayed and fasted in support of Nixon for three days in front of the United States Capitol under the motto: &quot;Forgive, Love and Unite.&quot; On 1 February 1974, Nixon publicly thanked them for their support and officially received Moon. This brought the church into widespread public and media attention.

In the 1970s, Moon, who had seldom before spoken to the general public, gave a series of public speeches to audiences in the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The largest was a rally in 1975 against North Korean aggression in Seoul and a speech at an event organized by the Unification Church in Washington, D.C.

===&quot;United States v. Sun Myung Moon&quot;===
In 1982, following an IRS investigation, Moon was convicted in the United States of conspiracy and tax evasion by filing incorrect federal income tax returns totaling less than . He refused to stay in Korea and returned to the United States. His conviction was upheld on appeal in a split decision. Moon was given an 18-month sentence and a fine. He served 13 months of the sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, before being released on good behavior to a halfway house.

The case was the center of national freedom of religion and free speech debates. Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of the Harvard University Law School argued that the trial by jury had &quot;doomed (Moon) to conviction based on religious prejudice.&quot; The American Baptist Churches in the USA, the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon. Many notable clergy, including Jerry Falwell and Joseph Lowery, signed petitions protesting the government&#x27;s case and spoke out in defense of Moon. Carlton Sherwood, in his book , stated that the conviction of Reverend Moon was viewed by Protestant pastors to be a humiliation of religious liberty.

After his prison sentence, Moon began calling himself humanity&#x27;s Messiah and officially conferred the title of &quot;Messiah&quot; on himself in 1992.

===&quot;The Washington Times&quot;===

In 1982, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was founded by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate associated with Moon, which also owned newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America, as well as the news agency United Press International. The political views of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; have often been described as conservative. The &quot;Times&quot; was read by many Washington, DC insiders, including Ronald Reagan. By 2002, Moon had invested roughly to support the &quot;Times&quot;, which he called &quot;the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.&quot;

==Twenty-first century events==

In 2000, Moon sponsored a United Nations conference that proposed the formation of &quot;a religious assembly, or council of religious representatives, within the structure of the United Nations.&quot;

In 2003, Moon sponsored the first Peace Cup international club soccer tournament. The Los Angeles Galaxy, which competes in Major League Soccer, played in South Korea in the Peace Cup. During the event, Pelé, widely regarded as the best soccer player of all time and former Brazilian Sports Minister, met with Moon.

In 2009, Moon&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen&quot; (), was published by Gimm-Young Publishers in South Korea. The book became a best-seller in Korea and Japan.

By 2010, Moon had given much of the responsibility for the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification religious and business activities to his children, who were then in their 30s and 40s. In 2012, the South Korean press reported that Moon traveled worldwide in his private jet, which cost .

==Illness and death==
On 14 August 2012, after suffering from pneumonia earlier in the month, Moon was admitted to Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital at The Catholic University of Korea in Seoul. On 15 August 2012, he was reported to be gravely ill and was put on a ventilator at the intensive care unit of St. Mary&#x27;s. On 31 August 2012, Moon was transferred to a church-owned hospital near his home in Gapyeong, northeast of Seoul, after suffering multiple organ failure. Moon died on the morning of 3 September 2012 (1:54 am KST) at the age of 92.

A two-week mourning period was conducted in honor of him. On 15 September, after a funeral service attended by tens of thousands of Unification Church followers, Moon was buried at a church-owned mansion in Gapyeong.

==Activities and interests==

===Politics===
In 1964, Moon founded the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, which promoted the interests of South Korea and sponsored Radio Free Asia. Former US Presidents Harry S Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Richard Nixon were honorary presidents or directors at various times.

In 1972, Moon offered predictions on the decline of communism, based on the teachings of the &quot;Divine Principle&quot;: &quot;After 7,000 biblical years—6,000 years of restoration history plus the millennium, the time of completion—communism will fall in its 70th year. Here is the meaning of the year 1978. Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself for approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the borderline and afterward, communism will decline; in the 70th year, it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore, now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it.&quot;

In 1980, Moon asked church members to found CAUSA International as an anti-communist educational organization, based in New York. In the 1980s, it was active in 21 countries. In the United States, it sponsored educational conferences for Christian leaders as well as seminars and conferences for Senate staffers and other activists. In 1986, it produced the anti-communist documentary film &quot;Nicaragua Was Our Home&quot;. CAUSA supported the Nicaraguan Contras.

In August 1985, the Professors World Peace Academy, an organization founded by Moon, sponsored a conference in Geneva to debate the theme &quot;The situation in the world after the fall of the communist empire.&quot; In April 1990, Moon visited the Soviet Union and met with President Mikhail Gorbachev. Moon expressed support for the political and economic transformations underway in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Unification Church was expanding into formerly communist nations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some American conservatives criticized Moon for his softening of his previous anti-communist stance.

In 1991, Moon met with Kim Il Sung, then North Korean president, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula, as well as on international relations, tourism, etc. In 1994, Moon was officially invited to the funeral of Kim Il Sung in spite of the absence of diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea. Moon and his church are known for their efforts to promote Korean unification.

In 2003, Korean Unification Church members started a political party in South Korea. It was named &quot;The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home.&quot; In its inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for Korean reunification by educating the public about God and peace. Moon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea. In 2012, Moon was posthumously awarded North Korea&#x27;s National Reunification Prize.

In 2005, Sun Myung Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han Moon, founded the Universal Peace Federation (UPF), an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). &quot;We support and promote the work of the United Nations and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.&quot;

Moon&#x27;s projects have been lobbied in the National Congress of Brazil by Brazilian MPs. Moon has held dialogues between members of the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Parliament as part of his Middle East Peace Initiatives.

===Business===
Tongil Group is a South Korean business group (chaebol &quot;Tongil&quot; is Korean for &quot;unification&quot;; the name of the Unification Church in Korean is &quot;Tongilgyo&quot;) founded in 1963 by Moon as a nonprofit organization to provide revenue for the church. Its core focus was manufacturing, but in the 1970s and 1980s, it expanded by founding or acquiring businesses in pharmaceuticals, tourism, and publishing. Among Tongil Group&#x27;s chief holdings are: The Ilwha Company, which produces ginseng and related products; Ilshin Stone, building materials; and Tongil Heavy Industries, machine parts, including hardware for the South Korean military.

News World Communications is an international news media corporation founded by Moon in 1976. It owns United Press International, &quot;World and I&quot;, &quot;Tiempos del Mundo&quot; (Latin America), &quot;The Segye Ilbo&quot; (South Korea), &quot;The Sekai Nippo&quot; (Japan), the &quot;Zambezi Times&quot; (South Africa), and &quot;The Middle East Times&quot; (Egypt). Until 2008, it published the Washington, D.C.-based newsmagazine &quot;Insight on the News&quot;. Until 2010, it owned &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. On 2 November 2010, Sun Myung Moon and a group of former &quot;Times&quot; editors purchased the &quot;Times&quot; from News World.

In 1982, Moon sponsored the film &quot;Inchon&quot;, a historical drama about the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. It was not successful critically or financially and was criticized for its unfair treatment of the North Korean government.

In 1989, Moon founded Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma, the second most successful soccer club in South Korea, having won a record 7 league titles, 2 FA Cups, 3 League Cups, and 2 AFC Champions League titles. Seongnam&#x27;s record was beaten by Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in 2020.

The church is the largest owner of US sushi restaurants, and in the Kodiak region of Alaska is the area&#x27;s largest employer. The church founded the first currently operating automobile manufacturing plant in North Korea, Pyeonghwa Motors, and is the second largest exporter of Korean goods.

In 2011, construction of the Yeosu Expo Hotel was completed; the hotel is located at the Moon-owned Ocean Resort in Yeosu, the venue of Expo 2012. The opening ceremony was attended by the governor of the province. Another one, the Ocean Hotel, was completed in February 2012. Moon-owned Yeongpyeong Resort, Ocean Resort, and Pineridge Resort were scheduled to host Expo 2012, the 2018 Winter Olympics, and Formula 1. Moon also managed the FIFA-accredited Peace Cup. The FIFA itself has funded more than for the Peace Cup since 2003.

===Race relations===

Moon took a strong stance against racism and racial discrimination. In 1974, he urged Unification Church members to support an African-American president of the United States: &quot;We have had enough of white presidents. So, let&#x27;s this time elect a president from the Negro race. What will you do if I say so? There&#x27;s no question there. We must never forget that we are brothers and sisters in a huge human family. In any level of community, we must become like a family.&quot;

In 1981, he said that he himself was a victim of racial prejudice in the United States (concerning his prosecution on tax charges in United States v. Sun Myung Moon), saying: &quot;I would not be standing here today if my skin were white or my religion was Presbyterian. I am here today only because my skin is yellow and my religion is the Unification Church. The ugliest things in this beautiful country of America are religious bigotry and racism.&quot;

Several African American organizations and individuals spoke out in defense of Moon at this time, including the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the National Conference of Black Mayors, and Joseph Lowery, who was then the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

In a later controversy over the use of the word &quot;Moonie&quot; (which was said to be offensive) by the American news media, Moon&#x27;s position was supported by civil rights activists Ralph Abernathy and James Bevel.

In 2000, Moon and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan got together to sponsor the Million Family March, a rally in Washington, D.C. to celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony as well as to address other issues, including abortion, capital punishment, health care, education, welfare, Social Security reform, substance abuse prevention, and overhaul of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. In his keynote speech, Farrakhan called for racial harmony.

===Dance===

In 1962, Moon and other church members founded the Little Angels Children&#x27;s Folk Ballet of Korea, a children&#x27;s dance troupe that presents traditional Korean folk dances. He said that this was to project a positive image of South Korea to the world. In 1984, Moon founded the Universal Ballet project, with Soviet-born Oleg Vinogradov as its art director and Moon&#x27;s daughter-in-law Julia as its prima ballerina. It was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the top ballet company in Asia. In 1989, Moon founded Universal Ballet Academy, which later changed its name to Kirov Academy of Ballet, in Washington, D.C.

=== Seafood and shipbuilding===
The Unification Church owns True World Foods, which controls a major portion of the sushi trade in the US. True World Foods&#x27; parent company is the corporate conglomerate True World Group, which operates restaurants and markets.

The Unification Church&#x27;s into the seafood industry began at the direction of Moon, who ordered an expansion into &quot;the oceanic providence.&quot; In 1976 and 1977, the Unification Church invested nearly a million dollars into the American seafood industry. Moon delivered a speech in 1980 entitled &quot;The Way of Tuna&quot;, in which he claimed that &quot;After we build the boats, we catch the fish and process them for the market, and then have a distribution network. This is not just on the drawing board; I have already done it&quot; and declared himself the &quot;king of the ocean.&quot; He also suggested that they could get around the recently imposed 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone by marrying American and Japanese members, allowing the Japanese ones to become American citizens, because once married, &quot;we are not foreigners; therefore Japanese brothers, particularly those matched to Americans, are becoming ... leaders for fishing and distribution.&quot; He also declared that &quot;Gloucester is almost a Moonie town now!&quot;

Later in 1980, Moon gave a sermon in which he said, &quot;This ocean business is really reserved for Unification Church. How much income would this business generate? Roughly speaking, enough money to buy the entire world. That&#x27;s true! It has unlimited potential.&quot; In 1986, he advised his followers to open a thousand restaurants in America.

The Unification Church owns Master Marine (a shipbuilding and fishing company in Alabama) and International Seafood of Kodiak, Alaska. In 2011, Master Marine opened a factory in Las Vegas, Nevada, to manufacture a 27-foot pleasure boat designed by Moon.

==Honorary degrees and other recognition==

Moon held honorary degrees from more than ten universities and colleges worldwide, at least one of which, the University of Bridgeport, received significant funding from his organizations. He was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of South Korea. In 1985, he and his wife received Doctor of Divinity degrees from Shaw University.

In 2004, Moon was honored as the Messiah at an event in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. This attracted much public attention and was criticized by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a possible violation of the principle of separation of church and state in the United States. Some of the political figures who had attended the event later told reporters that they had been misled as to its nature.

Several months after his death, an award named after him and his wife (the Sunhak Peace Prize) was proposed, inheriting his will to &quot;recognize and empower innovations in human development, conflict resolution, and ecological conservation.&quot; Its laureates receive a certificate, a medal, and .

Moon was posthumously awarded North Korea&#x27;s National Reunification Prize in 2012 and a meritorious award by K-League. On the first anniversary of Moon&#x27;s death, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed condolences to Han and the family, saying: &quot;Kim Jong Un prayed for the repose of Moon, who worked hard for national concord, prosperity and reunification and world peace.&quot;

In 2013, Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai stated: &quot;I remain greatly inspired by people like Reverend Dr. Sun Myung Moon, whose work and life across continents continue to impact positively on the lives of millions of others in the world.&quot;

In 2021, president Donald Trump praised Moon in an event linked to the Unification Church. Previously, such events held by Unification Church, named Rally of Hope, gathered speakers from the Trump Administration: e.g., former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and advisor Paula White.

==Criticism==

Moon&#x27;s claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars. The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; was labeled as heretical by Protestant churches in South Korea, including Moon&#x27;s own Presbyterian Church. In the United States, it was rejected by ecumenical organizations as being non-Christian. Protestant commentators have also criticized Moon&#x27;s teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone. In their influential book &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon&#x27;s belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus. Commentators have criticized the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; for saying that the First World War, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the Cold War served as indemnity conditions to prepare the world for the establishment of the Kingdom of God.

During the Cold War, Moon was criticized by both the mainstream media and the alternative press for his anti-communist activism, which many said could lead to World War III and a nuclear holocaust. Moon&#x27;s anti-communist activities received financial support from controversial Japanese millionaire and activist Ryōichi Sasakawa. In 1977, the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations of the United States House of Representatives, while investigating the Koreagate scandal, found that the South Korean National Intelligence Service (KCIA) had worked with the Unification Church to gain political influence within the United States, with some members working as volunteers in Congressional offices. Together, they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization that undertook public diplomacy for the Republic of Korea. The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on Moon&#x27;s campaign in support of Richard Nixon. 
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some American conservatives criticized Moon for his softening of his previous anti-communist stance.

In the 1990s, when Moon began to offer the Unification marriage blessing ceremony to members of other churches and religions, he was criticized for creating possible confusion. In 1998, journalist Peter Maass, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, reported that some Unification members were dismayed and also grumbled when Moon extended the Blessing to non-members, who had not gone through the same course that members had. In 2001, Moon came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church when 71-year-old Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist, married in a blessing ceremony, presided over by Moon and his wife. Following his marriage, the archbishop was called to the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, where he was asked not to see his wife anymore and to move to a Capuchin monastery. Sung went on a hunger strike to protest their separation. This attracted much media attention. Milingo is now an advocate of the removal of the requirement for celibacy by priests in the Catholic Church. He is the founder of the Married Priests Now! advocacy group.

In 1998, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; criticized Moon&#x27;s possible relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and wrote that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; editorial policy was &quot;rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.&quot;

In 2000, Moon was criticized, including by some members of his church, for his support of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s Million Family March. Moon was also criticized for his relationship with controversial Jewish scholar Richard L. Rubenstein, an advocate of the &quot;death of God theology&quot; of the 1960s. Rubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council, and on the board of directors of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, a church-owned newspaper. In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport, which was then affiliated with the church.

In 2003, George D. Chryssides of the University of Wolverhampton criticized Moon for introducing doctrines that tended to divide the Christian church rather than uniting it, which was his stated purpose in founding the Unification movement (originally named the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity). In his 2009 autobiography, Moon himself wrote that he did not originally intend on founding a separate denomination.

Moon opposed homosexuality and compared gay people to &quot;dirty dung-eating dogs&quot;. He said that &quot;gays will be eliminated&quot; in a &quot;purge on God&#x27;s orders&quot;. 

In 2009, Moon&#x27;s support for the Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel was criticized in Japan and South Korea as a possible threat to both nations&#x27; interests and national identities.

Other criticisms include Moon&#x27;s apparent neglect of his wife, Hak Ja Han, and his appointments of their children and their spouses to leadership positions in the church and related businesses, including their daughter In Jin Moon to the presidency of the Unification Church of the United States against the wishes of some church members; his support of conservatives within the government of South Korea; his assignment of movement members and resources to business projects and political activism, including &quot;The Washington Times&quot;; as well as the relationship between the Unification Church and Islam, especially following the September 11 attacks in New York City.

==Views of Moon by his followers==

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot; itself says about Moon: &quot;With the fullness of time, God has sent one person to this earth to resolve the fundamental problems of human life and the universe. His name is Sun Myung Moon. For several decades he wandered through the spirit world so vast as to be beyond imagining. He trod a bloody path of suffering in search of the truth, passing through tribulations that God alone remembers. Since he understood that no one can find the ultimate truth to save humanity without first passing through the bitterest of trials, he fought alone against millions of devils, both in the spiritual and physical worlds, and triumphed over them all. Through intimate spiritual communion with God and by meeting with Jesus and many saints in Paradise, he brought to light all the secrets of Heaven.&quot;

In 1978, Rodney Sawatsky wrote in an article in &quot;Theology Today&quot;: &quot;Why trust Rev. Moon&#x27;s dreams and visions of the new age and his role in it, we ask? Most converts actually have had minimal contact with him. Frederick Sontag (Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church, Abingdon, 1977), in his interviews with Moon, appears to have found a pleasant but not overwhelming personality. Charisma, as traditionally understood, seems hardly applicable here. Rather, Moon provides a model. He suffered valiantly, he knows confidently, he prays assuredly, and he lives lovingly, say his followers. The Divine Principle is not an unrealizable ideal; it is incarnate in a man, it lives, it is imitable. His truth is experienced to be their truth. His explanation of the universe becomes their understanding of themselves and the world in which they live.&quot;

In 1980, sociologist Irving Louis Horowitz commented: &quot;The Reverend Moon is a fundamentalist with a vengeance. He has a belief system that admits of no boundaries or limits, an all-embracing truth. His writings exhibit a holistic concern for the person, society, nature, and all things embraced by the human vision. In this sense the concept underwriting the Unification Church is apt, for its primary drive and appeal is unity, urging a paradigm of the essence in an overly complicated world of existence. It is a ready-made doctrine for impatient young people and all those for whom the pursuit of the complex has become a tiresome and fruitless venture.&quot;

In 1998, investigative journalist Peter Maass wrote in an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;There are, certainly, differing degrees of devotion among Moon&#x27;s followers; the fact that they bow at the right moment or shout &quot;Mansei!&quot; in unison doesn&#x27;t mean they believe everything Moon says, or do precisely what he commands. Even on important issues, like Moon&#x27;s claiming to be the messiah, there are church members whom I met, including a close aide to Moon, who demur. A religious leader whom they respect and whose theology they believe, yes; the messiah, perhaps not.&quot;

In his 2004 book &quot;The New Religious Movement Experience in America&quot;, Eugene V. Gallagher wrote: &quot;The &quot;Divine Principle&#x27;s&quot; analysis of the Fall sets the stage for the mission of Rev. Moon, who in the last days brings a revelation that offers humankind the chance to return to an Edenic state. The account in the &quot;Divine Principle&quot; offers Unificationists a comprehensive context for understanding human suffering.&quot;

<text>A statute of frauds is a form of statute requiring that certain kinds of contracts be memorialized in writing, signed by the party against whom they are to be enforced, with sufficient content to evidence the contract.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;statute of frauds&quot; comes from the Statute of Frauds, an act of the Parliament of England (29 Chas. 2 c. 3) passed in 1677 (authored by Lord Nottingham assisted by Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Francis North and Sir Leoline Jenkins and passed by the Cavalier Parliament), the long title of which is: An Act for Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries. 

Many common law jurisdictions have made similar statutory provisions, while a number of civil law jurisdictions have equivalent legislation incorporated into their civil codes. The original English statute itself may still be in effect in a number of Canadian provinces, depending on the constitutional or reception statute of English law, and any subsequent legislative developments.

==Application==
The statute of frauds typically requires a signed writing in the following circumstances:
:* Contracts in consideration of marriage. This provision covers prenuptial agreements.
:* Contracts that cannot be performed within one year. However, contracts of indefinite duration do not fall under the statute of frauds regardless of how long the performance actually takes.
:* Contracts for the transfer of an interest in land. This applies not only to a contract to sell land but also to any other contract in which land or an interest in it is disposed, such as the grant of a mortgage or an easement.
:* Contracts by the executor of a will to pay a debt of the estate with his own money.
:* Contracts in which one party becomes a surety (acts as guarantor) for another party&#x27;s debt or other obligation.
:* Contracts for the sale of goods totaling $500.00 or more.
In an action for specific performance of a contract to convey land, the agreement must be in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. The statute is satisfied if the contract to convey is evidenced by a writing or writings containing the essential terms of a purchase and sale agreement and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. If there is no written agreement, a court of equity can specifically enforce an oral agreement to convey only if the part performance doctrine is satisfied. In most jurisdictions, part performance is proven when the purchaser pays the purchase price, has possession of the land and makes improvements on the land, all with the permission of the seller. No jurisdiction is satisfied by payment of the purchase price alone.

Under common law, the statute of frauds also applies to contract modifications. For example, in an oral agreement for the lease of a car for nine months, immediately after taking possession, the lessor then decides that he really likes the car and makes an oral offer to the lessee to extend the term of the lease by an additional six months. Although neither agreement alone comes under the statute of frauds, the oral extension modifies the original contract to make it a fifteen-month lease (nine months plus the additional six), thereby bringing it under the statute as the contract now exceeds twelve months in duration. In theory, the same principle works in reverse as well, such that an agreement to reduce a lease from fifteen months to nine months would not require a writing. However, many jurisdictions have enacted statutes that require a writing for such situations.

===Raising the defense===
A defendant in a contract case who wants to use the statute of frauds as a defense must raise it as an affirmative defense in a timely manner. The burden of proving that a written contract exists comes into play only when a statute of frauds defense is raised by the defendant.

===Exceptions===
An agreement may be enforced even if it does not comply with the statute of frauds in the following situations:
:* A statute of frauds defense may also be affected by a showing of part performance by proving the existence of one of two different conditions. If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement, as in the case &quot;Riley v. Capital Airlines, Inc.&quot;, the court held that part performance does not take an executory portion of a contract out of the statute of frauds. Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute of Frauds and was enforceable to the extent it is executed. However, the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable. As a result, only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered, and the doctrine of part performance does not remove the contract from the statute. On the other hand, the court, in &quot;Schwedes v. Romain&quot;, held that partial performance and grounds for estoppel can make the contract effective.
:* Promissory estoppel can be applied in many but not all jurisdictions when the charging party detrimentally relies on the otherwise unenforceable contract. In England and Wales, the circumstances where promissory estoppel may be used to overcome the statute are limited, and some jurisdictions deny this possibility altogether.
:* The &quot;main purpose rule&quot; as it relates to guarantee or suretyship type contracts: where the promisor&#x27;s promise to answer for the debt of another is made mainly for the promisor&#x27;s own economic advantage, then it is a primary promise, and enforceable even without a writing.
:* Easements by implication: easements, which are agreements that permit the use of real estate by someone who has no property interest in the land, may be created by operation of law rather than by written instrument. This may happen where, for example, a piece of land is partitioned between owners and pre-existing utilities routes or access paths that would otherwise be trespassory over one of the plots is reasonably necessary for enjoyment of the other plot. In such case, the pre-existing use must be apparent and continuous at the time of the partition for an easement to be created by implication. The implied easement constitutes an interest in land that does not require a writing to be enforceable.

== By jurisdiction ==

===Canada===
The Statute of Frauds recites that it was enacted for the &quot;. . . prevention of many fraudulent practices which are commonly endeavored to be upheld by perjury . . .&quot;. The mischief arising from claimants asserting oral agreements was to be avoided by requiring that certain contracts be evidenced by &quot;some memorandum or note thereof . . . in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith . . .&quot;. Contracts respecting land &quot;created by livery and seisen only or by parole&quot; would not be enforced absent such a writing.

It quickly became apparent to the common law judges that the Statute might itself become an instrument of fraud (or at least injustice) if it was strictly enforced with respect to contracts that were wholly or partly performed.

The courts developed the concept of &quot;part performance&quot; as an exception. If a contract concerning land was partly performed, that could displace the need for a note or memorandum in writing signed by the party to be charged.

It was one thing to create an exception that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute&#x27;s operation. The thrust of the Statute was that contracts concerning land could not be proved by parol evidence alone. Thus, part performance might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven by parol evidence. In developing the &quot;part performance&quot; exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required. An important factor in the case law became that the part performance must be &quot;unequivocally&quot; related to the alleged contract.

===Ireland===
The Statute of Frauds, sub-titled &quot;An Act for Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries&quot;, was passed in 1695 in Ireland. The statute took effect &quot;from and after the feast day of the nativity of St. John Baptist [24 June], which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred ninety-six&quot;, and is one of the few pre-Independence laws that survived the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005 and the Statute Law Revision Act 2007. It remains largely in force today.

Some effects of the law have been softened by equity, for example the requirement that all contracts for sale of land be evidenced in writing can be circumvented by reliance on the doctrine of part performance.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The Statute of Frauds, dating from 1677, was largely repealed in England and Wales by the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 34). The only provision of it extant is part of Section 4 which means that contracts of guarantee (surety for another&#x27;s debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is clarified by section 3 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 97), dated 29 July 1856, which provides that the consideration for the guarantee need not appear in writing or require any necessary inference from a written document.

Section 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c .14) (commonly known as Lord Tenterden&#x27;s Act) was enacted to prevent Section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action against a verbal guarantor for the tort of deceit (the tort in &quot;Freeman v. Palsey&quot;). A common summary of the law is &quot;a verbal guarantee (for a debt) isn&#x27;t worth the paper it is written on&quot;.

Provisions in section 4 as to formalities for contracts for the sale of land were repealed by Schedule 7 to the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 20), however the requirement that contracts for the sale of land be evidenced in writing was maintained by section 40 of that Act, subsequently replaced by section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 34).

====Scotland====
Section 6 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act Scotland 1856 was derived from those parts of section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (1677) which relate to contracts of guarantee and from section 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828.

It was repealed on 1 August 1995 by the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, sections 14(2) and Schedule 5 (with ss. 9(3)(5)(7), 13, 14(3)).

===United States===

In the United States, for contracts for the sale of goods that fall under the Uniform Commercial Code, additional exceptions may apply:
:* Admission of the existence of a contract by the defendant under oath. However, the contract would only exist for the quantity of goods that were admitted. For instance, if the contract was for 100 televisions but the seller admitted in court that it was for 70 televisions, then the contract would exist only for 70 televisions and not the original 100. 
:* Merchant confirmation rule. If one merchant sends a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds to another merchant and the receiving merchant has reason to know of the contents of the sent confirmation and does not object to the confirmation within 10 days, the confirmation is good to satisfy the statute as to both parties, even if the confirmation was not signed by the party to be charged.
:* The goods were specially manufactured for the buyer and the seller either 1) began manufacturing them, or 2) entered into a third party contract for their manufacture, and the manufacturer cannot without undue burden sell the goods to another person in the seller&#x27;s ordinary course of business: for example, T-shirts with a Little League baseball team logo or wall-to-wall carpeting for an odd-sized room.

====State laws====
Every state has a statute that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. The most common requirements are for contracts that involve the sale or transfer of land, and contracts that cannot be completed within one year. When the statute of frauds applies, a typical statute requires that the writing commemorating the agreement identify the contracting parties, recite the subject matter of the contract so that it is reasonably identifiable, and include the important terms and conditions of agreement.

The statute of frauds in various states comes in three types:
# Those that follow the English statute and provide that &quot;no action shall be brought&quot; on the contract or the contract &quot;shall not be enforced&quot;, e.g. the Arizona statute in Title 44. 
# Those that declare contracts &quot;void&quot;.
# Those that make the contract &quot;voidable&quot; at the affected party&#x27;s election.

=====Colorado=====
Colorado has a number of different statutes of frauds applicable to different areas of law.

=====Texas=====
In addition to the statute of frauds as conventionally defined, the State of Texas has two rules that govern the litigation process, each of which also has the character of a statute of frauds. One is a rule of general applicability and requires agreements between counsel (or a party, if self-represented) to be in writing to be enforceable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 11.

Agreements under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 11 are called &quot;Rule 11 Agreements&quot; and may either concern settlement or any procedural aspect, such as an agreement regarding scheduling, continuances of trial settings, or discovery matters. The rule has existed since 1840 and has contained the filing requirement since 1877. The number designation can cause confusion to non-Texas attorneys because the federal rule 11 is the sanctions rule, whose state-court counterpart has the number designation 13 under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP).

The other rule that is in the nature of a statute of frauds governs fee agreements with clients when the attorney is to be compensated based on the outcome of the case. The Texas Government Code requires that &quot;[a] contingent fee contract for legal services must be in writing and signed by the attorney and client.&quot; TEX. GOV&#x27;T CODE ANN. § 82.065(a).

The classic example is a contingent fee contract in a personal injury case that provides for the claimant&#x27;s lawyer to receive a certain percentage of the settlement amount (or of the amount awarded by judgment) net of litigation costs, with the percentages typically staggered and increasing based on whether a settlement was obtained before lawsuit is filed, after a lawsuit was filed but before trial, or whether a judgment favorable to the client was obtained through trial. The other scenario is a contingency fee contract based on cost savings achieved (for a client who is a defendant sued for a money judgment) or based on other specified litigation objectives. In those cases, the client will not recover any money from his opponent in the lawsuit, and will have to pay his attorney from his or her own funds in accordance with the terms of the agreement, once the matter is concluded favorably. When the client does not pay, some attorneys then sue the client on the contingency fee contract, or in quantum meruit in the alternative. See, e.g., Shamoun &amp; Norman, LLP v. Hill, 483 S.W.3d 767 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2016), reversed on other grounds by Hill v. Shamoun &amp; Norman, LLP, No. 16-0107 (Tex. April 13, 2018). The attorney-vs-client fee-dispute issue generally does not arise in personal injury cases because the settlement funds from the settling party or judgment-debtor are disbursed through the attorney of the party entitled to them, net of costs and the contingency fee component.

====Uniform Commercial Code====
In addition to general statutes of frauds, under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), every state except Louisiana has adopted an additional statute of frauds that relates to the sale of goods. Pursuant to the UCC, contracts for the sale of goods where the price equals $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds, with the exceptions for professional merchants performing their normal business transactions, and for any custom-made items designed for one specific buyer.

The application of the statute of frauds to dealings between merchants has been modified by provisions of the UCC. There is a &quot;catch-all&quot; provision in the UCC for personal property not covered by any other specific law, stating that a contract for the sale of such property where the purchase price exceeds $500 is not enforceable unless memorialized by a signed writing. The most recent UCC revision increases the triggering point for the UCC Statute of Frauds to $5,000, but states have been slow to amend their versions of the statute to increase the trigger point.

For purposes of the UCC, a defendant who admits the existence of the contract in his pleadings, under oath in a deposition or affidavit, or at trial, may not use the statute of frauds as a defense. However, a statute of frauds defense may still be available under a state&#x27;s general statute.

With respect to securities transactions, the Uniform Commercial Code has abrogated the statute of frauds. The drafters of the most recent revision commented that &quot;with the increasing use of electronic means of communication, the statute of frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business.&quot;

<text>Sovereign immunity, or crown immunity, is a legal doctrine whereby a sovereign or state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution, strictly speaking in modern texts in its own courts. State immunity is a similar, stronger doctrine, that applies to foreign courts.

==History==
Sovereign immunity is the original forebear of state immunity based on the classical concept of sovereignty in the sense that a sovereign could not be subjected without his or her approval to the jurisdiction of another. In constitutional monarchies, the sovereign is the historical origin of the authority which creates the courts. Thus the courts had no power to compel the sovereign to be bound by them as they were created by the sovereign for the protection of his or her subjects. This rule was commonly expressed by the popular legal maxim &quot;rex non potest peccare&quot;, meaning &quot;the king can do no wrong&quot;.

==Forms==
There are two forms of sovereign immunity:

* immunity from suit (also known as immunity from jurisdiction or adjudication)
* immunity from enforcement.

Immunity from suit means that neither a sovereign/head of state in person nor any &quot;in absentia&quot; or representative form (nor to a lesser extent the state) can be a defendant or subject of court proceedings, nor in most equivalent forums such as under arbitration awards and tribunal awards/damages.

Immunity from enforcement means that even if a person succeeds in any way against their sovereign or state, they and the judgment may find themselves without means of enforcement. Separation of powers or natural justice coupled with a political status other than a totalitarian state dictates there be broad exceptions to immunity such as statutes which expressly bind the state (a prime example being constitutional laws) and judicial review.

==Waiver==
Sovereign immunity of a state entity may be waived. A state entity may waive its immunity by:

* prior written agreement 
* instituting proceedings without claiming immunity
* submitting to jurisdiction as a defendant in a suit
* intervening in or taking any steps in any suit (other than for the purpose of claiming immunity).

==By country==

===Australia===
There is no automatic Crown immunity in Australia, and the Australian Constitution does not establish a state of unfettered immunity of the Crown in respect of the states and the Commonwealth. The Constitution of Australia establishes matters on which the states and the Commonwealth legislate independently of each other; in practice this means the states legislate on some things and the Commonwealth legislates on others. In some circumstances, this can create ambiguity as to the applicability of legislation where there is no clearly established Crown immunity. The Australian Constitution does however, in s. 109, declare that, &quot;When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.&quot; Based on this, depending on the context of application and whether a particular statute infringes on the executive powers of the state or the Commonwealth the Crown may or may not be immune from any particular statute.

Many Acts passed in Australia, both at the state and at the federal level, contain a section declaring whether the Act binds the Crown, and, if so, in what respect:

* Commonwealth Acts may contain wording similar to: &quot;This Act binds the Crown in each of its capacities&quot;, or specify a more restricted application.
* State acts may contain wording similar to: &quot;This Act binds the Crown in right of [the state] and, in so far as the legislative power of the Parliament of [the state] permits, the Crown in all its other capacities.&quot;

While there is no ambiguity about the first aspect of this declaration about binding the Crown with respect to the state in question, there have been several cases about the interpretation of the second aspect extending it to the Crown in its other capacities. Rulings by the High Court of Australia on specific matters of conflict between the application of states laws on Commonwealth agencies have provided the interpretation that the Crown in all of its other capacities includes the Commonwealth, therefore if a state Act contains this text then the Act may bind the Commonwealth, subject to the s. 109 test of inconsistency.

A landmark case which set a precedent for challenging broad Crown immunity and established tests for the applicability of state laws on the Commonwealth was &quot;Henderson v Defence Housing Authority&quot; in 1997. This case involved the arbitration of a dispute between Mr. Henderson and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). Mr. Henderson owned a house which the DHA had leased to provide housing to members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Under the NSW &quot;Residential Tenancies Act 1997&quot;, Mr. Henderson sought orders from the Residential Tenancies Tribunal to enter the premises for the purposes of conducting inspections. In response, DHA claimed that as a Commonwealth agency the legislation of NSW did not apply to it and further sought writs of prohibition attempting to restrain Mr. Henderson from pursuing the matter further. Up until this point the Commonwealth and its agencies claimed an unfettered immunity from state legislation and had used s. 109 to justify this position, specifically that the NSW Act was in conflict with the Act which created the DHA and s. 109 of the constitution applied. Mr. Henderson took the case to the High Court and a panel of seven justices to arbitrate the matter. By a majority decision of six to one the court ruled that the DHA was bound by the NSW Act on the basis that the NSW Act did not limit, deny or restrict the activities of the DHA but sought to regulate them, an important distinction which was further explained in the rulings of several of the justices. It was ruled that the NSW Act was one of general application and therefore the Crown (in respect of the Commonwealth) could not be immune from it, citing other cases in which the same ruling had been made and that it was contrary to the rule of law. As a result of this case, the Commonwealth cannot claim a broad constitutional immunity from state legislation.

In practice, three tests have been developed to determine whether a state law applies to the Commonwealth and vice versa:

#Does the law seek to merely regulate the activities of the Commonwealth as opposed to deny, restrict or limit them?
#Is the state law constructed such that the act binds the Crown in respect of all of its capacities?
#Is there no inconsistency between a state law and a Commonwealth law on the same matter?

If these three tests are satisfied, then the Act binds the Crown in respect of the Commonwealth. In Australia, there is no clear automatic Crown immunity or lack of it; as such there is a rebuttable presumption that the Crown is not bound by a statute, as noted in &quot;Bropho v State of Western Australia&quot;. The Crown&#x27;s immunity may also apply to other parties in certain circumstances, as held in &quot;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare&quot;.

===Belgium===
Article 88 of the Constitution of Belgium states: &quot;The King&#x27;s person is inviolable; his ministers are accountable.&quot;

===Bhutan===
According to the constitution of Bhutan, the monarch is not answerable in a court of law for
his or her actions.

===Canada===
Canada inherited the common law version of Crown immunity from British law. However, over time, the scope of Crown immunity has been steadily reduced by statute law. As of 1994, section 14 of Alberta&#x27;s Interpretation Act states, &quot;no enactment is binding on His Majesty or affects His Majesty or His Majesty&#x27;s rights or prerogatives in any manner, unless the enactment expressly states that it binds His Majesty.&quot; However, in more recent times &quot;all Canadian provinces ... and the federal government (the Crown Liability Act) have now rectified this anomaly by passing legislation which leaves the Crown liable in tort as a normal person would be. Thus, the tort liability of the government is a relatively new development in Canada, statute-based, and is not a fruit of common law.&quot;

Since 1918, it has been held that provincial legislatures cannot bind the federal Crown, as Charles Fitzpatrick noted in &quot;Gauthier v The King&quot;: &quot;Provincial legislation cannot [i.e., of its own force] take away or abridge any privilege of the Crown in right of the Dominion.&quot;

It has also been a constitutional convention that the Crown in right of each province is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts in other provinces. However, this is now in question.

Lieutenant governors do not enjoy the same immunity as the sovereign in matters not relating to the powers of the office. In 2013, the Supreme Court refused to hear the request of former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Lise Thibault to have charges against her dropped. She was being prosecuted by the Attorney General of Quebec for misappropriation of public funds, but invoked royal immunity on the basis that &quot;the Queen can do no wrong&quot;. As per convention, the court did not disclose its reasons for not considering the matter. Thibault later petitioned the Court of Quebec for the same motives. Judge St-Cyr again rejected her demand, noting that constitutional law does not grant a lieutenant governor the same benefits as the monarch and that, in her case, royal immunity would only apply to actions involving official state functions, not personal ones. She was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 18 months in jail, but was granted conditional release after serving six months.

=== China ===

China has consistently claimed that a basic principle of international law is for states and their property to have absolute sovereign immunity. China objects to restrictive sovereign immunity. It is held that a state can waive its immunity by voluntarily stating so, but that should a government intervene in a suit (e.g. to make protests), it should not be viewed as waiver of immunity. Chinese state-owned companies considered instrumental to the state have claimed sovereign immunity in lawsuits brought against them in foreign courts before. China&#x27;s view is that sovereign immunity is a lawful right and interest that their enterprises are entitled to protect. Some examples of Chinese state-owned companies that have claimed sovereign immunity in foreign lawsuits are the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and China National Building Material.

In 2023, China&#x27;s national legislature – the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress – passed the Foreign State Immunity Law, which changed China&#x27;s sovereign immunity regime to a restrictive one.

==== Hong Kong ====
In 2011, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled that absolute sovereign immunity applies in Hong Kong, as the Court found that Hong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of China, could not have policies on state immunity that were inconsistent with China. The ruling was an outcome of the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates&quot; case in 2011. 

In 2023, China&#x27;s national legislature – the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress – passed the Foreign State Immunity Law, which changed China&#x27;s sovereign immunity regime to a restrictive one. In accordance with the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal&#x27;s decision in &quot;Congo&quot; and the NPCSC&#x27;s corresponding interpretation of the Basic Law in 2011, the new national law applies in Hong Kong, even though it has yet to be formally applied to Hong Kong through Annex III of the Basic Law. As such, restrictive immunity applies in Hong Kong.

===== &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo v FG Hemisphere Associates&quot; (2011) =====
The Democratic Republic of the Congo and its state-owned electricity company (SNEL) defaulted on payments of a debt owed to an energy company, Energoinvest. During arbitration, Energoinvest was awarded damages against the Congolese government and SNEL. This was reassigned by Energoinvest to FG Hemisphere Associates LLC.

FG Hemisphere subsequently learned that the Congolese government entered into a separate joint venture with Chinese companies later, in which the Congolese government would be paid US$221 million in mining entry fees. As a result, FG Hemisphere applied to collect these fees in order to enforce the earlier arbitral award. The Congolese government asserted sovereign immunity in the legal proceedings. This was eventually brought to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, when the Congolese government fought to overturn an earlier Court of Appeal decision which had ruled that:
* as restrictive sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong, the Congolese government had no immunity in commercial proceedings. 
* if absolute sovereign immunity had applied in Hong Kong, the Congolese government had waived their sovereign immunity rights in this case.

The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled 3:2 that the Congolese government had not waived its immunity in the Hong Kong courts, and that as a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong could not have policies on state immunity that were inconsistent with China&#x27;s. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong should be absolute, and may be invoked when jurisdiction is sought in the foreign court in relation to an application to enforce a foreign judgment or arbitral award, or when execution is sought against assets in the foreign state. This means that sovereign states are absolutely immune to the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts, including in commercial claims, unless the state waives its immunity. In order to waive immunity, there must be express, unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts &quot;in the face of the court&quot;. Claimants should establish that the state party has waived their entitlement to immunity at the relevant stage, before proceedings can occur in court.

===Denmark===
Article 13 of the Constitution of Denmark states:
Accordingly, the monarch cannot be sued in his or her personal capacity. On the other hand, this immunity from lawsuits does not extend to the state as such and article 63 explicitly authorises the courts to judge the executive authority: &quot;The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executive&#x27;s authority; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not, by taking the case to the courts of justice, avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority.&quot; Furthermore, no other member of the royal family can be prosecuted for any crime under Article 25 of the old absolutist constitution Lex Regia (The King&#x27;s Law), currently still valid, which states: &quot;They shall answer to no magistrate judges, but their first and last Judge shall be the King, or to whom He to that decrees.&quot;

===Finland===

The president of the Republic of Finland has immunity from prosecution according to Article 113 of the Constitution, which applies to his official activities. If he is suspect of treason, treason or a crime against humanity in the course of his official duties, the parliament can, with a majority, decide to bring charges to the national court. The president cannot be charged for other crimes committed in the performance of his duties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the president remains accountable in front of law for acts outside of his office in the same way as other citizens.

===Holy See===

The Holy See, of which the current pope is head (often referred to by metonymy as the Vatican or Vatican City State, a distinct entity), claims sovereign immunity for the pope, supported by many international agreements.

===Iceland===
According to article 11 of the Constitution of Iceland the president can only be held accountable and be prosecuted with the consent of parliament.

===India===
According to Article 361 of the Constitution of India no legal action in the court of law can be taken against President of India and the governors of states of India as long as that person is holding either office. However, they can be impeached and then sued for their actions.

===Ireland===
In &quot;Byrne v. Ireland&quot;, the Supreme Court of Ireland declared that sovereign immunity had not survived the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, and that accordingly the state could be sued for and held vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of its servants and agents.

===Italy===
According to the Constitution, a President of the Italian Republic is not accountable, and is not responsible for any act of their office, unless they have committed high treason or attempted to subvert the Constitution, as stated in Article 90:

The Italian Penal Code makes it a criminal offence to insult the honor and prestige of the President (Art. 278), and until 2006 it was an offence to publicly give the President responsibility for actions of the Government (Art. 279 – abrogated).

===Japan===
Article 17 of the Constitution of Japan states: &quot;Every person may sue for redress as provided by law from the State or a public entity, in case he has suffered damage through illegal act of any public official.&quot; The was made according to this article. Officials who commit torts themselves are not liable, although the State or a public entity has the right to obtain reimbursement from the officers if there is intent or gross negligence on the part of them. The Administrative Litigation Act enables the people to file lawsuits involving the government of Japan.

On November 20, 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that it does not have judicial power over the Emperor because he is &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people&quot;.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, an amendment to the constitution in 1993 made it possible to bring proceedings against the king or any ruler of a component state in the Special Court. This was previously impossible because every ruler of Malaysia was stated to be protected from being brought to court due to their royal status.

=== Netherlands ===
Since 1848, article 42 of the Dutch constitution states: &quot;The king is immune from prosecution; the ministers are responsible&quot;.

===Nigeria===

Section 308 of the Nigerian constitution of 1999 provides immunity from court proceedings, i.e., proceedings that will compel their attendance in favour of elected executive officers, namely the President and his vice and the governors of the states and the deputies. This immunity extends to acts done in their official capacities so that they are not responsible for acts done on behalf of the state. However, this immunity does not extend to acts done in abuse of the powers of their office of which they are liable upon the expiration of their tenure. It is important to note that the judiciary has absolute immunity for actions decisions taken in their official capacity.

===Norway===
Article 5 of the Constitution of Norway states: &quot;The King&#x27;s person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility
rests with his Council.&quot;
Accordingly, the monarch cannot be prosecuted or sued in his or her personal capacity, but this immunity does not extend to the state as such. Neither does immunity extend to the monarch in his capacity as an owner or stakeholder in real property, or as an employer, provided that the suit does not allege personal responsibility for the monarch.

===Philippines===
Article XVI, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution currently in force states: &quot;The State may not be sued without its consent.&quot;

===Spain===
The Spanish monarch is personally immune from prosecution for acts committed by government ministers in the King&#x27;s name, according to Title II, Section 56, Subsection 3 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978.

At the time of the June 2014 abdication of King Juan Carlos the Spanish constitution did not state whether an abdicated monarch retains his legal immunity, but the government was planning to make changes to allow this. Legislation has been passed, although unlike his previous immunity, the new legislation does not completely shield the former sovereign. Juan Carlos must answer to the supreme court, in a similar type of protection afforded to many high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. The legislation stipulates that all outstanding legal matters relating to the former king be suspended and passed &quot;immediately&quot; to the supreme court.

===Sri Lanka===
By the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the President of Sri Lanka has sovereign immunity (during the period of office).

===Sweden===

Chapter 5, Article 8 of the Swedish Constitution states: &quot;The King or Queen 
who is Head of State cannot be prosecuted for his or her actions. Nor can a Regent be prosecuted for his or her actions as Head of State.&quot; This only concerns the King as a private person, since he does not appoint the government, nor do any public officials act in his name. It does not concern other members of the Royal Family, except in such cases as they are exercising the office of Regent when the King is unable to serve. It is a disputed matter among Swedish constitutional lawyers whether the article also implies that the King is immune from lawsuits in civil cases which do not involve prosecution.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, state immunities are codified in the State Immunity Act of 1979 , which closely resembles the United Kingdom&#x27;s State Immunity Act 1978. Singapore&#x27;s State Immunity Act has phrases identical to that of Section 9 of United Kingdom&#x27;s State Immunity Act, and does not allow a foreign state, which has agreed to submit a dispute to arbitration, to claim jurisdictional immunity in judicial proceedings relating to the agreed arbitration, i.e. &quot;where a State has agreed in writing to submit a dispute which has arisen, or may arise, to arbitration, the state is not immune as respects proceedings in the courts in Singapore which relate to the arbitration&quot;.

The President of Singapore does to a certain extent have sovereign immunity subjected to clause 22K(4).

===United Kingdom===

====Immunity in proceedings====
Historically, the general rule in the United Kingdom has been that the Crown has never been liable to be prosecuted or proceeded against in either criminal or civil cases. The only means by which civil proceedings could be brought were:
*by way of petition of right, which was dependent on the grant of the royal (i.e. permission);
*by suits against the Attorney General for a declaration; or
*by actions against ministers or government departments where an Act of Parliament had specifically provided that immunity be waived.

The position was drastically altered by the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 which made the Crown (when acting as the government) liable as of right in proceedings where it was previously only liable by virtue of a grant of a fiat. With limited exceptions, this had the effect of allowing proceedings for tort and contract to be brought against the Crown. Proceedings to bring writs of mandamus and prohibition were always available against ministers, because their actions derive from the royal prerogative.

Criminal proceedings are still prohibited from being brought against His Majesty&#x27;s Government unless expressly permitted by the Crown Proceedings Act.

As the Crown Proceedings Act only affected the law in respect of acts carried on by or on behalf of the British government, the monarch remains personally immune from criminal and civil actions. However, civil proceedings can, in theory, still be brought using the two original mechanisms outlined above – by petition of right or by suit against the Attorney General for a declaration.

====Other immunities====
The monarch is immune from arrest in all cases; members of the royal household are immune from arrest in civil proceedings. No arrest can be made &quot;in the monarch&#x27;s presence&quot;, or within the &quot;verges&quot; of a royal palace. When a royal palace is used as a residence (regardless of whether the monarch is actually living there at the time), judicial processes cannot be executed within that palace.

The monarch&#x27;s goods cannot be taken under a writ of execution, nor can distress be levied on land in their possession. Chattels owned by the Crown, but present on another&#x27;s land, cannot be taken in execution or for distress. The Crown is not subject to foreclosure.

As of 2022, there were more than 160 laws granting express immunity to the monarch or their property in some respects. For instance, employees of the monarchy cannot pursue anti-discrimination complaints such as those under the Equality Act 2010. The monarchy is exempt from numerous other workers&#x27; rights, health and safety, or pensions laws. Government employees such as environmental inspectors are banned from entering the monarch&#x27;s property without their permission. The monarch is also exempt from numerous taxes, although Queen Elizabeth II did pay some taxes voluntarily. Some of the odder exceptions for the monarch are included in laws against private persons setting off nuclear explosions, or regulating the sale of alcohol after midnight.

===United States===

In United States law, state, federal, and tribal governments generally enjoy immunity from lawsuits. Local governments typically enjoy immunity from some forms of suit, particularly in tort.

In the US, sovereign immunity falls into two categories:
*Absolute immunity: pursuant to which a government actor may not be sued for the allegedly wrongful act, even if that person acted maliciously or in bad faith; and
*Qualified immunity: pursuant to which a government actor is shielded from liability only if specific conditions are met, as specified in statute or case law.
In some situations, sovereign immunity may have been waived by law.

Judicial immunity is a specific form of absolute immunity.

====Federal sovereign immunity====
The federal government of the United States has sovereign immunity and may not be sued anywhere in the United States unless it has waived its immunity or consented to suit. The United States has waived sovereign immunity to a limited extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives the immunity if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which waives the immunity over claims arising out of contracts to which the federal government is a party. The United States as a sovereign is immune from suit unless it unequivocally consents to being sued. The United States Supreme Court in &quot;Price v. United States&quot; observed: &quot;It is an axiom of our jurisprudence. The government is not liable to suit unless it consents thereto, and its liability in suit cannot be extended beyond the plain language of the statute authorizing it.&quot; &quot;Price v. United States&quot;, 174 U.S. 373, 375-76 (1899).

====State sovereign immunity====
In &quot;Hans v. Louisiana&quot; (1890), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Eleventh Amendment (1795) re-affirms that states possess sovereign immunity and are therefore generally immune from being sued in federal court without their consent. In later cases, the Supreme Court has strengthened state sovereign immunity considerably. In &quot;Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak&quot; (1991), the court explained that

In &quot;Alden v. Maine&quot; (1999), the Court explained that while it has 
Writing for the Court in &quot;Alden&quot;, Justice Anthony Kennedy argued that in view of this, and given the limited nature of congressional power delegated by the original unamended Constitution, the court could not &quot;conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers&quot;.

However, a &quot;consequence of [the] Court&#x27;s recognition of preratification sovereignty as the source of immunity from suit is that &quot;only&quot; States and &quot;arms of the State&quot; possess immunity from suits authorized by federal law&quot;. &quot;Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Chatham County&quot; (2006, emphasis added). Thus, cities and municipalities lack sovereign immunity, &quot;Jinks v. Richland County&quot; (2003), and counties are not generally considered to have sovereign immunity, even when they &quot;exercise a &#x27;slice of state power. &quot;Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency&quot; (1979). Nor are school districts, per &quot;Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle&quot; (1977).

Additionally, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity when it acts pursuant to powers delegated to it by any amendments ratified after the Eleventh Amendment. The abrogation doctrine, established by the Supreme Court in &quot;Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer&quot; (1976), is most often implicated in cases that involve Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which explicitly allows Congress to enforce its guarantees on the states.

<text>Social geography is the branch of human geography that is interested in the relationships between society and space, and is most closely related to social theory in general and sociology in particular, dealing with the relation of social phenomena and its spatial components. Though the term itself has a tradition of more than 100 years, there is no consensus on its explicit content. In 1968, Anne Buttimer noted that &quot;[w]ith some notable exceptions, (...) social geography can be considered a field created and cultivated by a number of individual scholars rather than an academic tradition built up within particular schools&quot;. Since then, despite some calls for convergence centred on the structure and agency debate, its methodological, theoretical and topical diversity has spread even more, leading to numerous definitions of social geography and, therefore, contemporary scholars of the discipline identifying a great variety of different &quot;social geographies&quot;. However, as Benno Werlen remarked, these different perceptions are nothing else than different answers to the same two (sets of) questions, which refer to the spatial constitution of society on the one hand, and to the spatial expression of social processes on the other.

The different conceptions of social geography have also been overlapping with other sub-fields of geography and, to a lesser extent, sociology. When the term emerged within the Anglo-American tradition during the 1960s, it was basically applied as a synonym for the search for patterns in the distribution of social groups, thus being closely connected to urban geography and urban sociology. In the 1970s, the focus of debate within American human geography lay on political economic processes (though there also was a considerable number of accounts for a phenomenological perspective on social geography), while in the 1990s, geographical thought was heavily influenced by the &quot;cultural turn&quot;. Both times, as Neil Smith noted, these approaches &quot;claimed authority over the &#x27;social&#x27;&quot;. In the American tradition, the concept of cultural geography has a much more distinguished history than social geography, and encompasses research areas that would be conceptualized as &quot;social&quot; elsewhere. In contrast, within some continental European traditions, social geography was and still is considered an approach to human geography rather than a sub-discipline, or even as identical to human geography in general.

== History ==
=== Before World War II ===
The term &quot;social geography&quot; (or rather &quot;géographie sociale&quot;) originates from France, where it was used both by geographer Élisée Reclus and by sociologists of the Le Play School, perhaps independently from each other. In fact, the first proven occurrence of the term derives from a review of Reclus&#x27; &quot;Nouvelle géographie universelle&quot; from 1884, written by Paul de Rousiers, a member of the Le Play School. Reclus himself used the expression in several letters, the first one dating from 1895, and in his last work &quot;L&#x27;Homme et la terre&quot; from 1905. The first person to employ the term as part of a publication&#x27;s title was Edmond Demolins, another member of the Le Play School, whose article &quot;Géographie sociale de la France&quot; was published in 1896 and 1897. After the death of Reclus as well as the main proponents of Le Play&#x27;s ideas, and with Émile Durkheim turning away from his early concept of social morphology, Paul Vidal de la Blache, who noted that geography &quot;is a science of places and not a science of men&quot;, remained the most influential figure of French geography. One of his students, Camille Vallaux, wrote the two-volume book &quot;Géographie sociale&quot;, published in 1908 and 1911. Jean Brunhes, one of Vidal&#x27;s most influential disciples, included a level of (spatial) interactions among groups into his fourfold structure of human geography. Until the Second World War, no more theoretical framework for social geography was developed, though, leading to a concentration on rather descriptive rural and regional geography. However, Vidal&#x27;s works were influential for the historical Annales School, who also shared the rural bias with the contemporary geographers, and Durkheim&#x27;s concept of social morphology was later developed and set in connection with social geography by sociologists Marcel Mauss and Maurice Halbwachs.

The first person in the Anglo-American tradition to use the term &quot;social geography&quot; was George Wilson Hoke, whose paper &quot;The Study of Social Geography&quot; was published in 1907, yet there is no indication it had any academic impact. Le Play&#x27;s work, however, was taken up in Britain by Patrick Geddes and Andrew John Herbertson. Percy M. Roxby, a former student of Herbertson, in 1930 identified social geography as one of human geography&#x27;s four main branches. By contrast, the American academic geography of that time was dominated by the Berkeley School of Cultural Geography led by Carl O. Sauer, while the spatial distribution of social groups was already studied by the Chicago School of Sociology. Harlan H. Barrows, a geographer at the University of Chicago, nevertheless regarded social geography as one of the three major divisions of geography.

Another pre-war concept that combined elements of sociology and geography was the one established by Dutch sociologist Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz and his Amsterdam School of Sociography. However, it lacked a definitive subject, being a combination of geography and ethnography created as the more concrete counterpart to the rather theoretical sociology. In contrast, the Utrecht School of Social geography, which emerged in the early 1930s, sought to study the relationship between social groups and their living spaces.

=== Post-war period ===
==== Continental Europe ====
In the German-language geography, this focus on the connection between social groups and the landscape was further developed by Hans Bobek and Wolfgang Hartke after the Second World War. For Bobek, groups of &quot;Lebensformen&quot; (patterns of life)—influenced by social factors—that formed the landscape, were at the center of his social geographical analysis. In a similar approach, Hartke considered the landscape a source for indices or traces of certain social groups&#x27; behaviour. The best-known example of this perspective was the concept of &quot;Sozialbrache&quot; (social-fallow), i.e. the abandoning of tillage as an indicator for occupational shifts away from agriculture.

Though the French &quot;Géographie Sociale&quot; had been a great influence especially on Hartke&#x27;s ideas, no such distinct school of thought formed within the French human geography. Nonetheless, Albert Demangeon paved the way for a number of more systematic conceptualizations of the field with his (posthumously published) notion that social groups ought to be within the center of human geographical analysis. That task was carried out by Pierre George and Maximilien Sorre, among others. Then a Marxist, George&#x27;s stance was dominated by a socio-economic rationale, but without the structuralist interpretations found in the works of some the French sociologists of the time. However, it was another French Marxist, the sociologist Henri Lefebvre, who introduced the concept of the (social) production of space. He had written on that and related topics since the 1930s, but fully expounded it in &quot;La Production de L&#x27;Espace&quot; as late as 1974. Sorre developed a schema of society related to the ecological idea of habitat, which was applied to an urban context by the sociologist Paul-Henry Chombart de Lauwe. For the Dutch geographer , the world consisted of socio-spatial entities of different scales formed by what he referred to as a &quot;syn-ecological complex&quot;, an idea influenced by existentialism.

A more analytical ecological approach on human geography was the one developed by Edgar Kant in his native Estonia in the 1930s and later at Lund University, which he called &quot;anthropo-ecology&quot;. His awareness of the temporal dimension of social life would lead to the formation of time geography through the works of Torsten Hägerstrand and Sven Godlund.

<text>A Segway is a two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporter device invented by Dean Kamen. The name is a registered trademark of Segway Inc. It was brought to market in 2001 as the Segway HT, and then subsequently as the Segway PT. &quot;HT&quot; is an initialism for &quot;human transporter&quot; and &quot;PT&quot; for &quot;personal transporter.&quot;

Ninebot, a Beijing-based transportation robotics startup rival, acquired Segway Inc. in April 2015, broadening the company to include other transportation devices. In June 2020, it was announced that it would no longer make the Segway PT.

==History==
===Independent company===
The Segway PT, referred to during development and initial marketing as the Segway HT, was developed from the self-balancing iBOT wheelchair which was initially developed at University of Plymouth, in conjunction with BAE Systems and Sumitomo Precision Products. The first patent of human transporter was filed in 1994 and granted in 1997, followed by others, including one submitted in June 1999 and granted in October 2001.

Prior to its introduction, a news report about a proposal for a book about the invention, development, and financing of the Segway PT led to speculation about the device and its importance. John Doerr speculated that it would be more important than the Internet. &quot;South Park&quot; devoted an episode to making fun of the hype before the product was released. Steve Jobs was quoted as saying that it was &quot;as big a deal as the PC&quot;, (he later expressed a negative opinion, saying that it &quot;sucked&quot;, presumably referring to &quot;the design&quot; – but also referred to the (presumably high) price point, asking, &quot;You&#x27;re &quot;sure&quot; your market is upscale consumers for transportation?&quot;) The device was unveiled on 3 December 2001, following months of public speculation, in Bryant Park, New York City, on the ABC News morning program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, with the first units delivered to customers in early 2002.

The original Segway PT models featured three speed settings: , with faster turning, and . Steering of early versions was controlled using a twist grip that varied the speeds of the two motors. The range of the p-Series was on a fully charged nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery with a recharge time of four to six hours. In September 2003, the Segway PT was recalled, because if users ignored repeated low-battery warnings on the PTs, it could ultimately lead them to fall.

In August 2006, Segway Inc. discontinued all previous models and introduced the i2 and x2 products, which were steered by leaning the handlebars to the right or left, had a maximum speed of from a pair of Brushless DC electric motors with regenerative braking and a range of up to , depending on terrain, riding style, and state of the batteries. Recharging took eight to ten hours. The i2 and x2 also introduced the wireless InfoKey which could show mileage and a trip odometer, and put the vehicle into security mode, which locked the wheels and set off an alarm if it was moved, and could also be used to turn on the PT from up to away.

Segway Inc. was acquired by British businessman Jimi Heselden from its U.S. inventor Dean Kamen in December 2009. A year later, Heselden died after he &quot;plunged into the River Wharfe while riding a rugged country version&quot; of Segway PT.
Versions of the product prior to 2011 included (in order of release):
* Segway i167 (2001 revealed, 2002 shipped)
* Segway e167: As i167, with addition of electric kickstand
* Segway p133: Smaller platform and wheels and less powerful motors than the i and e Series with top speed of in the p-Series
* Segway i180: With lithium-ion batteries
* Segway XT: The first Segway designed specifically for recreation
* Segway i2 (2006): The first on-road Segway PT with LeanSteer
* Segway x2 (2006): The first off-road Segway PT with LeanSteer

In March 2014, Segway Inc. announced third generation designs, including the i2 SE and x2 SE sport, new LeanSteer frame and powerbase designs, with integrated lighting.

===Subsidiary of Ninebot===
Ninebot, a Beijing-based transportation robotics startup and a rival of Segway Inc., acquired Segway Inc. in April 2015, having raised $80M from Xiaomi and Sequoia Capital. The acquisition came months after the U.S. International Trade Commission agreed to investigate Segway Inc.&#x27;s claim that Ninebot and other companies were infringing on its patents and copyrights. Segway Inc. requested the blocking of imports of competing scooters into the United States.

In June 2016, Segway Inc. launched the Segway miniPRO, a smaller self-balancing scooter.

===End of production===
Only 140,000 units were sold during the lifetime of the product, and in the later years the Segway PT only made up 1.5% of total company profit. Factors contributing to the end of production include the price (US$5,000 at launch), and the learning curve in learning to balance on a Segway PT which has led to notable accidents involving Usain Bolt, George W. Bush, Ellen DeGeneres, Ian Healy, and Segway Inc. previous owner Jimi Heselden. While the Segway has remained popular for security and tourism, electric scooters have been more popular for personal mobility.

=== UTVs ===
In February 2022, Segway entered the UTV (Utility Terrain Vehicle) market.

==Products==
At the end of production in 2020, Segway Inc. was selling these five self-balancing scooters:

;Professional
* Segway i2 SE (professional self-balancing scooter for use in warehouses and other locations)
* Segway x2 SE (ruggedised self-balancing scooter for use on most challenging terrain)
* Segway Robot (autonomous robot based on the Segway miniPro)

;Consumer
* Ninebot by Segway E+ (self-balancing scooter for general use)
* Ninebot by Segway miniPro (smaller self-balancing scooter for general use, controlled by a &#x27;knee control bar&#x27;)
* Segway GT1P/GT2 P(battery electric super kick scooter)
* GT1 (battery electric super kick scooter)
* GT2 (battery electric super kick scooter)
*ZT3Pro (battery electric kick scooter)
*Xafari (full suspension trekking ebike)
*Xyber (battery electric motorcycle)
*Dirt eBike X260 (battery electric motorcycle)
*Dirt eBike X160 (battery electric motorcycle)

;Powersports
ATV: AT5 S, AT5 L, AT6 S, AT6 L&lt;br&gt;UTV: UT10, UT10 Crew&lt;br&gt;SSV (SxS): SX10 - E, SX10 - X, SX10 - WIDE, SX20 - TURBO, SX20 - HYBRID

;Ninebot
*E300SE (battery electric motorcycle)
*E110S (battery electric motorcycle)
*E125S (battery electric motorcycle)

==Technology==
The dynamics of the Segway PT are similar to a classic control problem, the inverted pendulum. It uses brushless DC electric motors in each wheel powered by lithium-ion batteries with balance achieved using tilt sensors, and gyroscopic sensors developed by BAE Systems&#x27; Advanced Technology Centre.

==Usage==
In 2011, the Segway i2 was being marketed to the emergency medical services community.

In 2018, the police of Stockholm adopted Segway i2 as a permanent transportation method for the patrollers of the old town.

The Segway miniPro is also available to be used as the mobility section of a robot.

Disability Rights Advocates for Technology worked to supply Segway PTs to veterans who had trouble walking. (Segway Inc. cannot market its devices in the US as medical devices. Kamen sold the intellectual property rights for medical purposes to Johnson &amp; Johnson, makers of the iBOT, a self-balancing wheelchair).

The maximum speed of the Segway PT is . The product is capable of covering on a fully charged lithium-ion battery, depending on terrain, riding style, and the condition of the batteries. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have Segway-specific recommendations but does say that bicycle helmets are adequate for &quot;low-speed, motor-assisted&quot; scooters.

<doc id="29084" wikidata="Q195721" url="?curid=29084" title="Slayers">
<text>is a Japanese light novel series written by Hajime Kanzaka and illustrated by Rui Araizumi. The novels have been serialized in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; since 1989, before being published into individual volumes. They follow the adventures of teenage sorceress Lina Inverse and her companions as they journey through their world. Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits.

&quot;Slayers&quot; inspired several spin-off novel series and has been adapted into numerous manga titles, anime television series, anime films, OVA series, role-playing video games, and other media. Including the spin-off series, the novels have over 20 million copies in print. The anime series is considered to be one of the most popular of the 1990s.

==Plot==
===Setting===
In the &quot;Slayers&quot; universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares&#x27; task to regain its &quot;true form&quot;, which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (&quot;shinzoku&quot;, lit. &quot;godly race&quot;) and demons (&quot;mazoku&quot;, lit. &quot;demon race&quot;), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.

In the world where the &quot;Slayers&quot; takes place, Flare Dragon Ceifeed and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu are, respectively, the supreme god and demon. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceifeed was able to split Shabranigdu&#x27;s existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdu himself would be destroyed. However, Ceifeed was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in &quot;Slayers&quot;, one of Ruby-Eye&#x27;s fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the against one of the parts of Ceifeed, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdu won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdu&#x27;s lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only demons could pass.

There are four types of magic within the &quot;Slayers&quot; universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the demons and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Lei Wing, Fireball, or Elemekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the gods, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the demon Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, demons can only be harmed by astral shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another demon with greater might than the target.

Above all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.

===Story===

The protagonist of &quot;Slayers&quot; is Lina Inverse, a teenage wandering genius sorceress with many nicknames and much infamy attached to her that she refuses to acknowledge. Lina narrates (within the novels) the history of her various adventures, ranging from whimsical and silly to dramatic to even outright world-threatening crises, in which she becomes involved along with her traveling companions everywhere she goes.

==Production==
The first &quot;Slayers&quot; light novel was written by Hajime Kanzaka for entrance into Fujimi Fantasia Bunko&#x27;s first annual in 1989. After it won, the new author was asked to create a follow-up. Kanzaka initially thought this was an impossible task as the characters had already defeated the Dark Lord. He called the second book a turning point for him and said it was initially very difficult to write. However, as soon as he added the &quot;spike-wolves and stuff&quot;, from his love of yōkai and kaiju, the &quot;words just flew off the page&quot;. Kanzaka set the second book in a city so that Lina could not solve the story by simply casting one big spell. He said that this taught him how using circumstances and setting could change the &quot;flavor&quot; of a story. The author also said that the second book is intentionally &quot;heavier&quot; than the first.

Kanzaka described his writing process as like trying to put together puzzle pieces that have been scattered about, figuring stuff out as he goes instead of following an outline written beforehand. As a new author, he said he was not good at submitting plot summaries to his supervisor, who wanted them before he started writing. When the supervisor passively accepted the plot summary of the third &quot;Slayers&quot; novel, but was then ecstatic with the finished book, he stopped asking for plot summaries. Kanzaka assumed that he had finally realized that the finished story was always going to widely diverge from the initial summary. The first three books were written as the author thought up stories, but volume four on tell a grander epic. Because the first novel was written as a one-off before evolving into a series, there are some inconsistencies with the later installments. A few of these inconsistencies were corrected in the 2008 reprints.

Kanzaka stated the reason Zelgadis and Amelia do not appear in &quot;part 2&quot; is because of the plot point concerning a character&#x27;s death. Although he speculated he could have written around the healing spells, it would have taken a lot of extra steps to get there and dragged everything out a lot longer than necessary. In the afterward of the fifteenth novel, the original final installment of the series, Kanzaka said he wanted to end the story in an open-ended way in order to allow readers to imagine what happens next to Lina and Gourry. He also described the &quot;Slayers&quot; video games, television shows, and comics as &quot;parallel part 3 stories&quot;.

Kanzaka makes references to people and events not depicted in the novels, such as Lina&#x27;s older sister and Gourry Gabriev&#x27;s first visit to Sairaag, which he referred to as &quot;flavor&quot; to stimulate the reader&#x27;s imagination and clarified that they are not foreshadowing. He explained that the fictional world would feel smaller if everything that appears in the story is explained; something he learned from a teacher&#x27;s comment in design school. Although some of these he has not even thought about, like Gourry&#x27;s visit to Sairaag, others he has created a backstory to, such as Lina&#x27;s sister. Zuma&#x27;s backstory was omitted because the novels are told from Lina&#x27;s first-person perspective, but Kanzaka gave some of the material to the staff of &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; so it could be included in the anime.

==Media==

===Light novels===

&quot;Slayers&quot; began serialization in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; in 1989 as a short story series written by Hajime Kanzaka and with artwork by Rui Araizumi. The chapters were then published as light novels under the Fujimi Fantasia Bunko imprint across 15 volumes from January 17, 1990 to May 10, 2000. Although the original story ended with the 15th volume in 2000, Kanzaka began a new arc 18 years later in the May 2018 issue of &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot;, which was published in March 2018, to celebrate the magazine and Fujimi Fantasia Bunko&#x27;s 30th anniversary. He described it as &quot;kind of a reunion&quot; and said he had not decided to relaunch the series yet. Volume 16 was published on October 20, 2018. A third story arc began in the November 2019 issue of the magazine, released in September 2019. The author described this as &quot;Rather than an official history, the third arc is going to be more like one of the possibilities, a parallel existence to the TRY TV anime and the Water Dragon King manga, I guess.&quot; Volume 17 was published on October 19, 2019.

On September 7, 2004, Tokyopop began publishing the novels in English, ending with the release of volume 8 on January 2, 2008. On July 3, 2020, J-Novel Club announced their rescue license of the series at Anime Expo Lite. They first release the novels digitally, with the first chapter uploaded to their website that day. Their physical release of &quot;Slayers&quot; began in July 2021 and is a 3-1 hardcover omnibus edition based on Japan&#x27;s 2008 revised edition that featured new illustrations and covers.

* is a spin-off prequel series of 30 novels published from 1991 to 2008.

===Anime television series===

The self-titled first season of the anime adapts volumes 1 and 3 of the light novels. 
The second season, &quot;Slayers Next&quot;, adapts volumes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the light novels.
The third season, &quot;Slayers Try&quot;, is an original story. 
However, a fourth season, &quot;Slayers AGAIN&quot;, was rumored following the success of &quot;Try&quot;, but early scheduling conflicts caused interest in the project to dissipate.

A fourth anime series, &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot;, premiered in Japan on July 2, 2008. Megumi Hayashibara, the voice actress for main character Lina Inverse, performed both the opening and ending theme songs. The new plot is told across two 13-episode arcs and follows an original storyline that has subplots based on events in the novels, with series director Takashi Watanabe and production studio J.C.Staff reprising their duties from the three original TV series. A fifth &quot;Slayers&quot; series titled &quot;Slayers Evolution-R&quot; is the second 13-episode arc of &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; and was aired on AT-X starting on January 12, 2009 in Japan.
Central Park Media licensed and distributed the anime in North America under the Software Sculptors label on VHS and Laserdisc between 1996 and 1998, collected in eight volumes. It was a commercial success for Central Park, which led them to license &quot;Slayers Next&quot; and &quot;Slayers Try&quot;; &quot;Next&quot; was first shipped from April 1999 in a similar format; a box set of the first four volumes was released in July of that same year, and a box set of the second four volumes in October. &quot;Slayers Try&quot; was released later in 2000. The first three seasons were subsequently re-released on DVD (in season box sets). Months before Central Park&#x27;s license for the anime properties expired, Funimation Entertainment was able to obtain the license and it aired as part of the new owner&#x27;s programming block on CoLours TV, as well as the Funimation Channel. The first bilingual DVD box set after Funimation&#x27;s rescue of the license was released on August 21, 2007, retaining the Software Sculptors-produced English dub. A boxset of &quot;Slayers&quot;, &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Try&quot; was released by Funimation on August 4, 2009.

Fox Kids won the rights to broadcast &quot;Slayers&quot; but eventually did not air the anime since it would be too heavy to edit it for content. The first North American television broadcast of &quot;The Slayers&quot; was February 17, 2002 on the International Channel. In 2009, MVM Films began releasing the series in the United Kingdom on a monthly basis. The first series was released on four DVDs between January 5, and April 6, 2009. The first volume of &quot;Slayers Next&quot; was released on May 11, 2009. Episodes have also been made available on the streaming video sites Hulu, YouTube, Crackle, Anime News Network, Netflix, and Funimation&#x27;s website.

Funimation licensed both &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; and &quot;Slayers Evolution-R&quot; for American release; the episodes in Japanese with English subtitles were uploaded to YouTube, as well as Funimation&#x27;s website in July 2009. Funimation contracted NYAV Post to produce the English version of the series, with dialogue being recorded in both New York City and Los Angeles. NYAV Post was able to reunite most of the original Central Park Media main character cast for the new season. However, Michael Sinterniklaas replaced David Moo as Xellos. Other notable characters, such as Sylphiel, Prince Phil, and Naga the Serpent were also recast with new voice actors. Funimation released the first &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; boxset on March 16, 2010. Funimation released the first four English-dubbed episodes of &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; to YouTube on January 19, 2010. They have also uploaded the first two English-dubbed episodes of &quot;Evolution-R&quot; to YouTube and released &quot;Evolution-R&quot; on DVD in June 2010. Funimation released both &quot;Slayers Revolution&quot; and &quot;Evolution-R&quot; on Blu-ray on October 26, 2010. Both &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Evolution-R&quot; made their North American television debut when they began airing on the Funimation Channel on September 6, 2010.

====Role-playing games====
The series was adapted for two role-playing games (RPGs):
*&quot;Slayers&quot; became an add-on for the Japanese role-playing game system &quot;MAGIUS&quot; (&quot;Slayers MAGIUS RPG&quot;). 
*In 2003, Guardians of Order published a licensed role-playing game, &quot;The Slayers d20&quot;, using the d20 System rules. Guardians also released three guidebooks for their &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; (&quot;BESM&quot;) game system that included game statistics for the TV series&#x27; major characters, spells and weapons. 

====Collectible card game====
A collectible card game (CCG), &quot;Slayers Fight&quot; (スレイヤーズふぁいと), was developed by ORG and published by Kadokawa Shoten between 1999 and 2001.

====Video games====

A series of five &quot;Slayers&quot; role-playing video games were released exclusively in Japan between 1994 and 1998. Two different 16-bit games titled simply &quot;Slayers&quot; (including the one for the Super Famicom) were released in 1994. Three 32-bit / CD-ROM games followed in the late 1990s: &quot;Slayers Royal&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Slayers Royal 2&quot; and &quot;Slayers Wonderful&quot; in 1998. In addition, Lina and other &quot;Slayers&quot; main characters have been featured in several other video games in crossover and guest appearances, in particular in mobile games since the late 2010s.

==Reception==
Including the spin-off series, the &quot;Slayers&quot; novels had 18 million copies in print by 2015. As of 2018, this number had grown to over 20million copies. Writing in 2020, Iyane Agossah from DualShockers opined &quot;Slayers&quot; &quot;is still rarely equaled 30 years later, with an incredible mix of comedy and tragedy, an intricate amount of world-building, great story developments and iconic characters.&quot;

Of the various media which make up the &quot;Slayers&quot; franchise, the anime has by far reached the largest audience and is considered to be one of the most popular series of the 1990s, both in Japan and abroad. As it is a parody of the high fantasy genre, the series&#x27; driving force lies in comic scenarios alluding to other specific anime, or more general genre tropes and clichés. Its focus on humor and entertainment and &quot;old school&quot; anime feel make it a nostalgic classic to many. According to Anime News Network&#x27;s Daryl Surat, 1996 was the best year of &quot;Slayers&quot; anime with the releases of &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Return&quot;. &quot;Slayers Next&quot; took the third place as the overall best anime of 1996 in the Anime Grand Prix &#x27;97 awards (in addition to winning in the category best female character), while the next year&#x27;s series &quot;Slayers Try&quot; placed second but technically also third (the first place was a tie between the films &quot;Mononoke Hime&quot; and &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;) in 1998.

&quot;Slayers&quot; was sometimes compared with &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;, another hit Japanese fantasy franchise that began around the same time. In &quot;Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know&quot;, Gilles Poitras wrote: &quot;More humorous and less serious looking than the characters in the &quot;Lodoss War&quot; series, the stars of &quot;Slayers&quot; provide action and laughs.&quot; In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917&quot;, Helen McCarthy similarly called it &quot;the antidote to the deadly serious &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;, with a cynical cast modeled on argumentative role-players. (...) Ridiculing its own shortcomings, &quot;Slayers&quot; has successfully kept a strong following that watches for what some might call biting satire, and others bad workmen blaming their tools.&quot; Joseph Luster of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; called it &quot;the very definition of an all-encompassing media franchise. (...) &quot;Slayers&quot; certainly has that in its memorable lineup, and they&#x27;ll likely cast some sort of spell on you, regardless of age.&quot; Paul Thomas Chapman from the same magazine voiced a more reserved opinion on the &quot;franchise whose remarkable longevity and popularity is matched only by its remarkable averageness,&quot; especially regarding various aspects of the TV series, to which nevertheless he returned for &quot;light entertainment&quot;.

<text>In security engineering, security through obscurity is the practice of concealing the details or mechanisms of a system to enhance its security. This approach relies on the principle of hiding something in plain sight, akin to a magician&#x27;s sleight of hand or the use of camouflage. It diverges from traditional security methods, such as physical locks, and is more about obscuring information or characteristics to deter potential threats. Examples of this practice include disguising sensitive information within commonplace items, like a piece of paper in a book, or altering digital footprints, such as spoofing a web browser&#x27;s version number. While not a standalone solution, security through obscurity can complement other security measures in certain scenarios.

Obscurity in the context of security engineering is the notion that information can be protected, to a certain extent, when it is difficult to access or comprehend. This concept hinges on the principle of making the details or workings of a system less visible or understandable, thereby reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access or manipulation. 

Security by obscurity alone is discouraged and not recommended by standards bodies.

==History==
An early opponent of security through obscurity was the locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs, who in 1851 demonstrated to the public how state-of-the-art locks could be picked. In response to concerns that exposing security flaws in the design of locks could make them more vulnerable to criminals, he said: &quot;Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them.&quot;

There is scant formal literature on the issue of security through obscurity. Books on security engineering cite Kerckhoffs&#x27; doctrine from 1883 if they cite anything at all. For example, in a discussion about secrecy and openness in nuclear command and control:
[T]he benefits of reducing the likelihood of an accidental war were considered to outweigh the possible benefits of secrecy. This is a modern reincarnation of Kerckhoffs&#x27; doctrine, first put forward in the nineteenth century, that the security of a system should depend on its key, not on its design remaining obscure.

Peter Swire has written about the trade-off between the notion that &quot;security through obscurity is an illusion&quot; and the military notion that &quot;loose lips sink ships&quot;, as well as on how competition affects the incentives to disclose.

There are conflicting stories about the origin of this term. Fans of MIT&#x27;s Incompatible Timesharing System (ITS) say it was coined in opposition to Multics users down the hall, for whom security was far more an issue than on ITS. Within the ITS culture, the term referred, self-mockingly, to the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands, and to the attitude that by the time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he&#x27;d generally got over the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community. One instance of deliberate security through obscurity on ITS has been noted: the command to allow patching the running ITS system (altmode altmode control-R) echoed as codice_1. Typing Alt Alt Control-D set a flag that would prevent patching the system even if the user later got it right.

In January 2020, NPR reported that Democratic Party officials in Iowa declined to share information regarding the security of its caucus app, to &quot;make sure we are not relaying information that could be used against us.&quot; Cybersecurity experts replied that &quot;to withhold the technical details of its app doesn&#x27;t do much to protect the system.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Security by obscurity alone is discouraged and not recommended by standards bodies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States recommends against this practice: &quot;System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components.&quot; The Common Weakness Enumeration project lists &quot;Reliance on Security Through Obscurity&quot; as CWE-656.

A large number of telecommunication and digital rights management cryptosystems use security through obscurity, but have ultimately been broken. These include components of GSM, GMR encryption, GPRS encryption, a number of RFID encryption schemes, and most recently Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA).

One of the largest proponents of security through obscurity commonly seen today is anti-malware software. What typically occurs with this single point of failure, however, is an arms race of attackers finding novel ways to avoid detection and defenders coming up with increasingly contrived but secret signatures to flag on.

The technique stands in contrast with security by design and open security, although many real-world projects include elements of all strategies.

== Obscurity in architecture vs. technique ==
Knowledge of how the system is built differs from concealment and camouflage. The effectiveness of obscurity in operations security depends on whether the obscurity lives on top of other good security practices, or if it is being used alone. When used as an independent layer, obscurity is considered a valid security tool.

In recent years, more advanced versions of &quot;security through obscurity&quot; have gained support as a methodology in cybersecurity through Moving Target Defense and cyber deception. NIST&#x27;s cyber resiliency framework, 800-160 Volume 2, recommends the usage of security through obscurity as a complementary part of a resilient and secure computing environment.

<doc id="29089" wikidata="Q644437" url="?curid=29089" title="Snuff film">
<text>A snuff film, snuff movie, or snuff video is a type of film, sometimes defined as being produced for profit or financial gain, that shows, or purports to show, scenes of actual homicide.

The concept of snuff films became known to the general public during the 1970s, when a conspiracy theory alleged that a clandestine industry was producing such films for profit. The rumor was amplified in 1976 by the release of a film called &quot;Snuff&quot;, which capitalized on the legend through a disingenuous marketing campaign. However, that film, like others on the topic, relied on special effects to simulate murder. According to the fact-checking website &quot;Snopes&quot;, there has never been a verified example of a genuine commercially produced snuff film. Videos of actual murders (such as beheading videos) have been made available to the public, generally through the Internet. However, those videos have been made and broadcast by the murderers either for their own gratification or for propaganda purposes, and not for financial gain and thus do not qualify, according to one author, as a &quot;snuff film&quot;.

==Definitions==
A snuff film is a movie in a purported genre of films in which a person is actually murdered, though some variations of the definition may include films that show people dying by suicide. According to existing definitions, snuff films can be pornographic and are made for financial gain but are supposedly &quot;circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment&quot;. The &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; defines a &quot;snuff movie&quot; as &quot;a pornographic film in which an unsuspecting actress or actor is murdered at the climax of the film&quot;; the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot; defines it more broadly as &quot;a violent film that shows a real murder&quot;.

Horror film magazine &quot;Fangoria&quot; defined snuff movies as &quot;films in which a person is killed on camera. The death is premeditated, with the purpose of being filmed in order to make money. Often times, there is a sexual aspect to the murder, either on film (as in, a porn scene that ends horribly) or that the final project is used for sexual gratification.&quot; Films featuring deaths that are authentic but accidental &quot;are not considered snuff because the deaths were not planned. Other death on video, such as terrorists beheading victims, are done to fulfill an ideology, not to earn money.&quot;

==Reality==
Some filmed records of executions and deaths in war exist, but in those cases the death was not specifically staged for financial gain or entertainment. There have been a number of &quot;amateur-made&quot; snuff films available on the Internet. However, such videos are produced by the murderers to make an impact on an audience or for their own satisfaction, and not for financial profit. Some specialized websites show videos of actual killings for profit, as their shock value will attract an audience; but these websites are not operated by the perpetrators of the murders.
According to &quot;Snopes&quot;, the idea of an actual snuff film &quot;industry&quot; clandestinely producing such &quot;entertainment&quot; for monetary gain is preposterous because &quot;capturing a murder on film would be foolhardy at best. Only the most deranged would consider preserving for a jury a perfect video record of a crime they could go to the executioner for. Even if the murderer stays completely out of the camera&#x27;s way, too much of who the killer is, how the murder was carried out, and where it took place would be part of such a film, and these details would quickly lead police to the right door. Though someone whose mania has caused them to lose touch with reality might skip over this point, those who are supposedly in the business for the money would be all too aware of this. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to flirt with the electric chair for the profits derived from a video.&quot;

Furthermore, &quot;Fangoria&quot; has also described the very concept as a &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;a scare tactic, dreamt up by the media to terrify the public.&quot;

==History of the concept==

===Origins of the urban legend===
The noun &quot;snuff&quot; originally meant the part of a candle wick that has already burned; the verb &quot;snuff&quot; meant to cut this off, and by extension to extinguish or kill. The word has been used in this sense in English slang for hundreds of years. It was defined in 1874 as a &quot;term very common among the lower orders of London, meaning to die from disease or accident&quot;.

Film studies professor Boaz Hagin argues that the concept of films showing actual murders originated decades earlier than is commonly believed, at least as early as 1907. That year, Polish-French writer Guillaume Apollinaire published the short story &quot;A Good Film&quot; about newsreel photojournalists who stage and film a murder due to public fascination with crime news; in the story, the public believes the murder is real but police determine that the crime was faked. Hagin also proposes that the film &quot;Network&quot; (1976) contains an explicit (fictional) snuff film depiction when television news executives orchestrate the on-air murder of a news anchor to boost ratings.

According to film critic Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien, &quot;whether or not commercially distributed &#x27;snuff&#x27; movies actually exist, the possibility of such movies is implicit in the stock B-movie motif of the mad artist killing his models, as in &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (1959), &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot; (1965), or &quot;Decoy for Terror&quot; (1967) also known as &quot;Playgirl Killer&quot;.&quot; Likewise, the protagonist of &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) films the murders he commits, though he does so as part of his mania and not for financial gain: a 1979 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the character&#x27;s activity as making &quot;private &#x27;snuff&#x27; films&quot;.

The first known use of the term &quot;snuff movie&quot; is in a 1971 book by Ed Sanders, &quot;The Family: The Story of Charles Manson&#x27;s Dune Buggy Attack Battalion&quot;. This book included the interview of an anonymous one-time member of Charles Manson&#x27;s &quot;Family&quot;, who claimed that the group once made such a film in California, by recording the murder of a woman. However, the interviewee later added that he had not watched the film himself and had just heard rumors of its existence. In later editions of the book, Sanders clarified that no films depicting real murders or murder victims had been found.

During the first half of the 1970s, urban legends started to allege that snuff films were being produced in South America for commercial gain, and circulated clandestinely in the United States.

===&quot;Snuff&quot; controversy (1976)===

The idea of movies showing actual murders for profit became more widely known in 1976 with the release of the exploitation film &quot;Snuff&quot;. This low-budget horror film, loosely based on the Manson murders and originally titled &quot;Slaughter&quot;, was shot in Argentina by Michael and Roberta Findlay. The film&#x27;s distribution rights were bought by Allan Shackleton, who eventually found the picture unfit for release and shelved it. Several years later, Shackleton read about snuff films being imported from South America and decided to cash in on the rumor as an attempt to recoup his investment in &quot;Slaughter&quot;.

Shackleton retitled &quot;Slaughter&quot; to &quot;Snuff&quot; and released it with a new ending that purported to depict an actual murder committed on a film set. &quot;Snuff&quot;&#x27;s promotional material suggested, without stating outright, that the film featured the real murder of a woman, which amounted to false advertising. The film&#x27;s slogan read: &quot;The film that could only be made in South America... where life is CHEAP&quot;. Shackleton put out false newspaper clippings that reported a citizens group&#x27;s crusading against the film, and hired people to act as protesters to picket screenings.

Shackleton&#x27;s efforts succeeded in generating a media frenzy about the film: real feminist and citizens groups eventually started protesting the movie and picketing theaters. As a result, New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau investigated the picture, establishing that it was a hoax. The controversy nevertheless made the film financially profitable.

===Rumors related to serial killers and other controversies===
In subsequent years, more urban legends emerged about snuff movies. Notably, multiple serial killers were rumored to have produced snuff films: however, no such videos were proven to exist. Henry Lee Lucas and his accomplice Otis Toole claimed to have filmed their crimes, but both men were &quot;pathological liars&quot; and the purported films were never found. Charles Ng and Leonard Lake videotaped their interactions with some of their future victims, but not the murders. Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris made an audio recording of their encounter with one victim, though not of her death. Likewise, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka made videos of Bernardo sexually abusing two victims, but did not film the murders. In all those cases, the recordings were not intended for public consumption and were used as evidence during the murderers&#x27; trials.

Over the years, several films were suspected of being &quot;snuff movies&quot;, though none of these accusations turned out to be true. A similar controversy concerned the filming of the video for the 1989 song &quot;Down in It&quot; by Nine Inch Nails, in which Trent Reznor acted in a scene which ended with the implication that Reznor&#x27;s character had fallen off a building and died. To film the scene, a camera was tied to a balloon with ropes. Minutes after filming started, the ropes snapped and the balloons and camera flew away, eventually landing on a farmer&#x27;s field in Michigan. The farmer later handed it to the FBI, who began investigating whether the footage was a snuff film portraying a person committing suicide. The FBI identified Reznor and the investigation ended when it was confirmed that Reznor was alive and the footage was not related to crime.

===Internet age===
The advent of the Internet, by allowing anyone to broadcast self-made videos to an international audience, also changed the means of production of films that may be categorized as &quot;snuff&quot;. There have been several cases of murders being filmed by their perpetrators and later finding their way online. These include videos made by Mexican cartels or jihadist groups, at least one of the videos shot by the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs in mid-2000s Ukraine, the video shot by Luka Magnotta in 2012, the video shot by Vester Lee Flanagan II in 2015, as well as cases of livestreamed murders, including videos made by mass shooters.

Author Steve Lillebuen, who wrote a book on the Magnotta case, commented that social media had created a new trend in crime where killers who crave an audience can become &quot;online broadcasters&quot; by showing their crimes to the world.

&quot;Fangoria&quot; commented that Magnotta&#x27;s 2012 video, which showed him mutilating the corpse of his victim, was the closest thing in existence to an actual snuff movie, especially as Magnotta had done some crude editing and used a song as a soundtrack, which amounted to minimal production values. However, it did not show the murder itself and was originally published to attract attention and not for monetary gain. The charges of which Magnotta was found guilty included &quot;publishing obscene materials&quot;. In 2016, the owner of Bestgore.com, the website that originally hosted Magnotta&#x27;s video, pleaded guilty to an obscenity charge and was sentenced to a six-month conditional sentence, half of which was served under house arrest.

==In fiction==

Since the concept became familiar to the general public, snuff films being made for profit or entertainment have been used as a core plot element or at least mentioned in numerous works of fiction, including the 1979 films &quot;Hardcore&quot; and &quot;Bloodline&quot;, and Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. The making or discovery of one or several snuff films is the premise of various horror, thriller or crime films, such as &quot;Last House on Dead End Street&quot; (1977), &quot;Videodrome&quot; (1983), &quot;Tesis&quot; (1996), &quot;8mm&quot; (1999), &quot;Vacancy&quot; (2007), &quot;Snuff 102&quot; (2007), &quot;A Serbian Film&quot; (2010), &quot;Sinister&quot; (2012), &quot;The Counselor&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2023), and the episode &quot;The Devil of Christmas&quot; (2016) in the black comedy series &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;. The 2003 video game &quot;Manhunt&quot; sees the main character being forced to participate in a series of snuff films to guarantee his freedom. The 2005 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot; features a mission titled &quot;Snuff&quot;, where the main character kills a few gangsters while unknowingly being filmed for a snuff movie by a third party, which may be a reference to &quot;Manhunt&quot;. Also, pretend snuff porn is sometimes filmed as a fetish.

Several horror films such as &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; (1980) and &quot;August Underground&quot; (2001) have depicted &quot;snuff movie&quot; situations, coupled with found footage aesthetics used as a narrative device. Though some of these films have generated controversy as to their nature and content, none were, nor have officially purported to be, actual snuff movies.

===False snuff films===

====&quot;Faces of Death&quot;====

The 1978 pseudo-documentary film &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, which spawned several sequels, is one of the films most commonly associated with the &quot;snuff movie&quot; concept, even though it was not produced by murderers nor clandestinely distributed. Purporting to be an educational film about death, it mixed footage of actual deadly accidents, suicides, autopsies, or executions, with &quot;outright fake scenes&quot; obtained with the help of special effects.

====The &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films====

The first two films in the Japanese &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; series, &quot;Guinea Pig: Devil&#x27;s Experiment&quot; and &quot;Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot; (both released in 1985) are designed to look like snuff films; the video is grainy and unsteady, as if recorded by amateurs, and extensive practical and special effects are used to imitate such features as internal organs and graphic wounds. The sixth film in the series, &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; (1988), allegedly served as an inspiration for Japanese serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki, who murdered several preschool girls in the late 1980s.

In 1991, actor Charlie Sheen became convinced that &quot;Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot; depicted an actual homicide and contacted the FBI. The FBI initiated an investigation but closed it after the series&#x27; producers released a &quot;making of&quot; film demonstrating the special effects used to simulate the murders.

====&quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;====
The Italian director Ruggero Deodato was charged after rumors that the depictions of the killing of the main actors in his film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; (1980) were real. He was able to clear himself of the charges after the actors made an appearance in court and on television.

Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and the genuine deaths of six animals onscreen and one off screen, issues which find &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; in the midst of controversy to this day. It has also been claimed that &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is banned in over 50 countries, although this has never been verified. In 2006, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine named &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; as the 20th most controversial film of all time.

====&quot;August Underground&quot; trilogy====

This trilogy of horror films, which depict graphic tortures and murders, is shot as if it were amateur footage made by a serial killer and his accomplices. In 2005, director and lead actor Fred Vogel, who was traveling with copies of the first two films to attend a horror film festival in Canada, was arrested by Canadian customs pending charges of transporting obscene materials into the country. The charges were eventually dropped after Vogel had spent ten hours in custody.

<text>Software testing is the act of checking whether software satisfies expectations.

Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure to a user or sponsor.

Software testing can determine the correctness of software for specific scenarios but cannot determine correctness for all scenarios. It cannot find all bugs.

Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an oracle, software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem. Examples of oracles include specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, and applicable laws.

Software testing is often dynamic in nature; running the software to verify actual output matches expected. It can also be static in nature; reviewing code and its associated documentation.

Software testing is often used to answer the question: Does the software do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do?

Information learned from software testing may be used to improve the process by which software is developed.

Software testing should follow a &quot;pyramid&quot; approach wherein most of your tests should be unit tests, followed by integration tests and finally end-to-end (e2e) tests should have the lowest proportion.

== Economics ==

A study conducted by NIST in 2002 reported that software bugs cost the U.S. economy $59.5 billion annually. More than a third of this cost could be avoided if better software testing was performed.

Outsourcing software testing because of costs is very common, with China, the Philippines, and India being preferred destinations.

== History ==

Glenford J. Myers initially introduced the separation of debugging from testing in 1979. Although his attention was on breakage testing (&quot;A successful test case is one that detects an as-yet undiscovered error.&quot;), it illustrated the desire of the software engineering community to separate fundamental development activities, such as debugging, from that of verification.

== Goals ==

Software testing is typically goal driven.

=== Finding bugs ===

Software testing typically includes handling software bugs a defect in the code that causes an undesirable result. Bugs generally slow testing progress and involve programmer assistance to debug and fix.

Not all defects cause a failure. For example, a defect in dead code will not be considered a failure.

A defect that does not cause failure at one point in time may later occur due to environmental changes. Examples of environment change include running on new computer hardware, changes in data, and interacting with different software.

A single defect may result in multiple failure symptoms.

=== Ensuring requirements are satisfied ===

Software testing may involve a Requirements gap omission from the design for a requirement. Requirement gaps can often be non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability, maintainability, performance, and security.

=== Code coverage ===

A fundamental limitation of software testing is that testing under &quot;all&quot; combinations of inputs and preconditions (initial state) is not feasible, even with a simple product. 
Defects that manifest in unusual conditions are difficult to find in testing. Also, non-functional dimensions of quality (how it is supposed to &quot;be&quot; versus what it is supposed to &quot;do&quot;) usability, scalability, performance, compatibility, and reliability can be subjective; something that constitutes sufficient value to one person may not to another.

Although testing for every possible input is not feasible, testing can use combinatorics to maximize coverage while minimizing tests.

== Categorization ==

Testing can be categorized many ways.

=== Automated testing ===
=== Levels ===

Software testing can be categorized into levels based on how much of the software system is the focus of a test.

==== Unit testing ====
==== Integration testing ====
==== System testing ====
=== Static, dynamic, and passive testing ===

There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing.

Static testing is often implicit, like proofreading, plus when programming tools/text editors check source code structure or compilers (pre-compilers) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis. Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run. Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules. Typical techniques for these are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.

Static testing involves verification, whereas dynamic testing also involves validation.

Passive testing means verifying the system&#x27;s behavior without any interaction with the software product. Contrary to active testing, testers do not provide any test data but look at system logs and traces. They mine for patterns and specific behavior in order to make some kind of decisions. This is related to offline runtime verification and log analysis.

=== Exploratory ===
=== Preset testing vs adaptive testing ===
The type of testing strategy to be performed depends on whether the tests to be applied to the IUT should be decided before the testing plan starts to be executed (preset testing) or whether each input to be applied to the IUT can be dynamically dependent on the outputs obtained during the application of the previous tests (adaptive testing).

=== Black/white box ===

Software testing can often be divided into white-box and black-box. These two approaches are used to describe the point of view that the tester takes when designing test cases. A hybrid approach called grey-box that includes aspects of both boxes may also be applied to software testing methodology.

==== White-box testing ====


White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) verifies the internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system (the source code), as well as programming skills are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g., in-circuit testing (ICT).

While white-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration, and system levels of the software testing process, it is usually done at the unit level. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it might not detect unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.

Techniques used in white-box testing include:

* API testing – testing of the application using public and private APIs (application programming interfaces)
* Code coverage – creating tests to satisfy some criteria of code coverage (for example, the test designer can create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once)
* Fault injection methods – intentionally introducing faults to gauge the efficacy of testing strategies
* Mutation testing methods
* Static testing methods

Code coverage tools can evaluate the completeness of a test suite that was created with any method, including black-box testing. This allows the software team to examine parts of a system that are rarely tested and ensures that the most important function points have been tested. Code coverage as a software metric can be reported as a percentage for:

:* &quot;Function coverage&quot;, which reports on functions executed
:* &quot;Statement coverage&quot;, which reports on the number of lines executed to complete the test
:* &quot;Decision coverage&quot;, which reports on whether both the True and the False branch of a given test has been executed

100% statement coverage ensures that all code paths or branches (in terms of control flow) are executed at least once. This is helpful in ensuring correct functionality, but not sufficient since the same code may process different inputs correctly or incorrectly.

==== Black-box testing ====

Black-box testing (also known as functional testing) describes designing test cases without knowledge of the implementation, without reading the source code. The testers are only aware of what the software is supposed to do, not how it does it. Black-box testing methods include: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, all-pairs testing, state transition tables, decision table testing, fuzz testing, model-based testing, use case testing, exploratory testing, and specification-based testing.

Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements. This level of testing usually requires thorough test cases to be provided to the tester, who then can simply verify that for a given input, the output value (or behavior), either &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; the same as the expected value specified in the test case. Test cases are built around specifications and requirements, i.e., what the application is supposed to do. It uses external descriptions of the software, including specifications, requirements, and designs, to derive test cases. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional. Specification-based testing may be necessary to assure correct functionality, but it is insufficient to guard against complex or high-risk situations.

Black box testing can be used to any level of testing although usually not at the unit level.

Component interface testing

Component interface testing is a variation of black-box testing, with the focus on the data values beyond just the related actions of a subsystem component. The practice of component interface testing can be used to check the handling of data passed between various units, or subsystem components, beyond full integration testing between those units. The data being passed can be considered as &quot;message packets&quot; and the range or data types can be checked for data generated from one unit and tested for validity before being passed into another unit. One option for interface testing is to keep a separate log file of data items being passed, often with a timestamp logged to allow analysis of thousands of cases of data passed between units for days or weeks. Tests can include checking the handling of some extreme data values while other interface variables are passed as normal values. Unusual data values in an interface can help explain unexpected performance in the next unit.

===== Visual testing =====

The aim of visual testing is to provide developers with the ability to examine what was happening at the point of software failure by presenting the data in such a way that the developer can easily find the information he or she requires, and the information is expressed clearly.

At the core of visual testing is the idea that showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just describing it, greatly increases clarity and understanding. Visual testing, therefore, requires the recording of the entire test process – capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format. Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones.

Visual testing provides a number of advantages. The quality of communication is increased drastically because testers can show the problem (and the events leading up to it) to the developer as opposed to just describing it, and the need to replicate test failures will cease to exist in many cases. The developer will have all the evidence he or she requires of a test failure and can instead focus on the cause of the fault and how it should be fixed.

Ad hoc testing and exploratory testing are important methodologies for checking software integrity because they require less preparation time to implement, while the important bugs can be found quickly. In ad hoc testing, where testing takes place in an improvised impromptu way, the ability of the tester(s) to base testing off documented methods and then improvise variations of those tests can result in a more rigorous examination of defect fixes. However, unless strict documentation of the procedures is maintained, one of the limits of ad hoc testing is lack of repeatability.

==== Grey-box testing ====
Grey-box testing (American spelling: gray-box testing) involves using knowledge of internal data structures and algorithms for purposes of designing tests while executing those tests at the user, or black-box level. The tester will often have access to both &quot;the source code and the executable binary.&quot; Grey-box testing may also include reverse engineering (using dynamic code analysis) to determine, for instance, boundary values or error messages. Manipulating input data and formatting output do not qualify as grey-box, as the input and output are clearly outside of the &quot;black box&quot; that we are calling the system under test. This distinction is particularly important when conducting integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interfaces are exposed for the test.

By knowing the underlying concepts of how the software works, the tester makes better-informed testing choices while testing the software from outside. Typically, a grey-box tester will be permitted to set up an isolated testing environment with activities, such as seeding a database. The tester can observe the state of the product being tested after performing certain actions such as executing SQL statements against the database and then executing queries to ensure that the expected changes have been reflected. Grey-box testing implements intelligent test scenarios based on limited information. This will particularly apply to data type handling, exception handling, and so on.

With the concept of grey-box testing, this &quot;arbitrary distinction&quot; between black- and white-box testing has faded somewhat.

=== Installation testing ===
=== Compatibility testing ===
A common cause of software failure (real or perceived) is a lack of its compatibility with other application software, operating systems (or operating system versions, old or new), or target environments that differ greatly from the original (such as a terminal or GUI application intended to be run on the desktop now being required to become a Web application, which must render in a Web browser). For example, in the case of a lack of backward compatibility, this can occur because the programmers develop and test software only on the latest version of the target environment, which not all users may be running. This results in the unintended consequence that the latest work may not function on earlier versions of the target environment, or on older hardware that earlier versions of the target environment were capable of using. Sometimes such issues can be fixed by proactively abstracting operating system functionality into a separate program module or library.

=== Smoke and sanity testing ===
Sanity testing determines whether it is reasonable to proceed with further testing.

Smoke testing consists of minimal attempts to operate the software, designed to determine whether there are any basic problems that will prevent it from working at all. Such tests can be used as build verification test.

=== Regression testing ===
Regression testing focuses on finding defects after a major code change has occurred. Specifically, it seeks to uncover software regressions, as degraded or lost features, including old bugs that have come back. Such regressions occur whenever software functionality that was previously working correctly, stops working as intended. Typically, regressions occur as an unintended consequence of program changes, when the newly developed part of the software collides with the previously existing code. Regression testing is typically the largest test effort in commercial software development, due to checking numerous details in prior software features, and even new software can be developed while using some old test cases to test parts of the new design to ensure prior functionality is still supported.

Common methods of regression testing include re-running previous sets of test cases and checking whether previously fixed faults have re-emerged. The depth of testing depends on the phase in the release process and the risk of the added features. They can either be complete, for changes added late in the release or deemed to be risky, or be very shallow, consisting of positive tests on each feature, if the changes are early in the release or deemed to be of low risk.

=== Acceptance testing ===

Acceptance testing is system-level testing to ensure the software meets customer expectations.

Acceptance testing may be performed as part of the hand-off process between any two phases of development.

Tests are frequently grouped into these levels by where they are performed in the software development process, or by the level of specificity of the test.

* User acceptance testing (UAT)
* Operational acceptance testing (OAT)
* Contractual and regulatory acceptance testing
* Alpha and beta testing

Sometimes, UAT is performed by the customer, in their environment and on their own hardware.

OAT is used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service or system as part of a quality management system. OAT is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects. This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, or to become part of the production environment. Hence, it is also known as operational readiness testing (ORT) or operations readiness and assurance (OR&amp;A) testing. Functional testing within OAT is limited to those tests that are required to verify the &quot;non-functional&quot; aspects of the system.

In addition, the software testing should ensure that the portability of the system, as well as working as expected, does not also damage or partially corrupt its operating environment or cause other processes within that environment to become inoperative.

Contractual acceptance testing is performed based on the contract&#x27;s acceptance criteria defined during the agreement of the contract, while regulatory acceptance testing is performed based on the relevant regulations to the software product. Both of these two tests can be performed by users or independent testers. Regulation acceptance testing sometimes involves the regulatory agencies auditing the test results.

=== Alpha testing ===
Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or an independent test team at the developers&#x27; site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing before the software goes to beta testing.

=== Beta testing ===
Beta testing comes after alpha testing and can be considered a form of external user acceptance testing. Versions of the software, known as beta versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team known as beta testers. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or bugs. Beta versions can be made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal number of future users and to deliver value earlier, for an extended or even indefinite period of time (perpetual beta).

=== Functional vs non-functional testing ===

Functional testing refers to activities that verify a specific action or function of the code. These are usually found in the code requirements documentation, although some development methodologies work from use cases or user stories. Functional tests tend to answer the question of &quot;can the user do this&quot; or &quot;does this particular feature work.&quot;

Non-functional testing refers to aspects of the software that may not be related to a specific function or user action, such as scalability or other performance, behavior under certain constraints, or security. Testing will determine the breaking point, the point at which extremes of scalability or performance leads to unstable execution. Non-functional requirements tend to be those that reflect the quality of the product, particularly in the context of the suitability perspective of its users.

=== Continuous testing ===
Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate. Continuous testing includes the validation of both functional requirements and non-functional requirements; the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.

=== Destructive testing ===
Destructive testing attempts to cause the software or a sub-system to fail. It verifies that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected inputs, thereby establishing the robustness of input validation and error-management routines. Software fault injection, in the form of fuzzing, is an example of failure testing. Various commercial non-functional testing tools are linked from the software fault injection page; there are also numerous open-source and free software tools available that perform destructive testing.

=== Software performance testing ===
Performance testing is generally executed to determine how a system or sub-system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability and resource usage.

&quot;Load testing&quot; is primarily concerned with testing that the system can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users. This is generally referred to as software scalability. The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as &quot;endurance testing&quot;. &quot;Volume testing&quot; is a way to test software functions even when certain components (for example a file or database) increase radically in size. &quot;Stress testing&quot; is a way to test reliability under unexpected or rare workloads. &quot;Stability testing&quot; (often referred to as load or endurance testing) checks to see if the software can continuously function well in or above an acceptable period.

There is little agreement on what the specific goals of performance testing are. The terms load testing, performance testing, scalability testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably.

Real-time software systems have strict timing constraints. To test if timing constraints are met, real-time testing is used.

=== Usability testing ===

Usability testing is to check if the user interface is easy to use and understand. It is concerned mainly with the use of the application. This is not a kind of testing that can be automated; actual human users are needed, being monitored by skilled UI designers.

=== Accessibility testing ===

Accessibility testing is done to ensure that the software is accessible to persons with disabilities. Some of the common web accessibility tests are

* Ensuring that the color contrast between the font and the background color is appropriate
* Font Size
* Alternate Texts for multimedia content
* Ability to use the system using the computer keyboard in addition to the mouse.

==== Common standards for compliance ====
* Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
* Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
* Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

=== Security testing ===

Security testing is essential for software that processes confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines this as a &quot;type of testing conducted to evaluate the degree to which a test item, and associated data and information, are protected so that unauthorised persons or systems cannot use, read or modify them, and authorized persons or systems are not denied access to them.&quot;

=== Internationalization and localization ===

Testing for internationalization and localization validates that the software can be used with different languages and geographic regions. The process of pseudolocalization is used to test the ability of an application to be translated to another language, and make it easier to identify when the localization process may introduce new bugs into the product.

Globalization testing verifies that the software is adapted for a new culture, such as different currencies or time zones.

Actual translation to human languages must be tested, too. Possible localization and globalization failures include:

* Some messages may be untranslated.
* Software is often localized by translating a list of strings out of context, and the translator may choose the wrong translation for an ambiguous source string.
* Technical terminology may become inconsistent, if the project is translated by several people without proper coordination or if the translator is imprudent.
* Literal word-for-word translations may sound inappropriate, artificial or too technical in the target language.
* Untranslated messages in the original language may be hard coded in the source code, and thus untranslatable.
* Some messages may be created automatically at run time and the resulting string may be ungrammatical, functionally incorrect, misleading or confusing.
* Software may use a keyboard shortcut that has no function on the source language&#x27;s keyboard layout, but is used for typing characters in the layout of the target language.
* Software may lack support for the character encoding of the target language.
* Fonts and font sizes that are appropriate in the source language may be inappropriate in the target language; for example, CJK characters may become unreadable if the font is too small.
* A string in the target language may be longer than the software can handle. This may make the string partly invisible to the user or cause the software to crash or malfunction.
* Software may lack proper support for reading or writing bi-directional text.
* Software may display images with text that was not localized.
* Localized operating systems may have differently named system configuration files and environment variables and different formats for date and currency.

=== Development testing ===
Development testing is a software development process that involves the synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Development testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to other testing; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development process.

Depending on the organization&#x27;s expectations for software development, development testing might include static code analysis, data flow analysis, metrics analysis, peer code reviews, unit testing, code coverage analysis, traceability, and other software testing practices.

=== A/B testing ===
A/B testing is a method of running a controlled experiment to determine if a proposed change is more effective than the current approach. Customers are routed to either a current version (control) of a feature, or to a modified version (treatment) and data is collected to determine which version is better at achieving the desired outcome.

=== Concurrent testing ===
Concurrent or concurrency testing assesses the behaviour and performance of software and systems that use concurrent computing, generally under normal usage conditions. Typical problems this type of testing will expose are deadlocks, race conditions and problems with shared memory/resource handling.

=== Conformance testing or type testing ===
In software testing, conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. Compilers, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.

=== Output comparison testing ===

Creating a display expected output, whether as data comparison of text or screenshots of the UI, is sometimes called snapshot testing or Golden Master Testing unlike many other forms of testing, this cannot detect failures automatically and instead requires that a human evaluate the output for inconsistencies.

=== Property testing ===
Property testing is a testing technique where, instead of asserting that specific inputs produce specific expected outputs, the practitioner randomly generates many inputs, runs the program on all of them, and asserts the truth of some &quot;property&quot; that should be true for every pair of input and output. For example, every output from a serialization function should be accepted by the corresponding deserialization function, and every output from a sort function should be a monotonically increasing list containing exactly the same elements as its input.

Property testing libraries allow the user to control the strategy by which random inputs are constructed, to ensure coverage of degenerate cases, or inputs featuring specific patterns that are needed to fully exercise aspects of the implementation under test.

Property testing is also sometimes known as &quot;generative testing&quot; or &quot;QuickCheck testing&quot; since it was introduced and popularized by the Haskell library QuickCheck.

=== Metamorphic testing===
Metamorphic testing (MT) is a property-based software testing technique, which can be an effective approach for addressing the test oracle problem and test case generation problem. The test oracle problem is the difficulty of determining the expected outcomes of selected test cases or to determine whether the actual outputs agree with the expected outcomes.

=== VCR testing ===

VCR testing, also known as &quot;playback testing&quot; or &quot;record/replay&quot; testing, is a testing technique for increasing the reliability and speed of regression tests that involve a component that is slow or unreliable to communicate with, often a third-party API outside of the tester&#x27;s control. It involves making a recording (&quot;cassette&quot;) of the system&#x27;s interactions with the external component, and then replaying the recorded interactions as a substitute for communicating with the external system on subsequent runs of the test.

The technique was popularized in web development by the Ruby library vcr.

== Teamwork ==

=== Roles ===

In an organization, testers may be in a separate team from the rest of the software development team or they may be integrated into one team. Software testing can also be performed by non-dedicated software testers.

In the 1980s, the term &quot;software tester&quot; started to be used to denote a separate profession.

Notable software testing roles and titles include: &quot;test manager&quot;, &quot;test lead&quot;, &quot;test analyst&quot;, &quot;test designer&quot;, &quot;tester&quot;, &quot;automation developer&quot;, and &quot;test administrator&quot;.

=== Processes ===

Organizations that develop software, perform testing differently, but there are common patterns.

==== Waterfall development ====

In waterfall development, testing is generally performed after the code is completed, but before the product is shipped to the customer. This practice often results in the testing phase being used as a project buffer to compensate for project delays, thereby compromising the time devoted to testing.

Some contend that the waterfall process allows for testing to start when the development project starts and to be a continuous process until the project finishes.

==== Agile development ====

Agile software development commonly involves testing while the code is being written and organizing teams with both programmers and testers and with team members performing both programming and testing.

One agile practice, test-driven software development (TDD), is a way of unit testing such that unit-level testing is performed while writing the product code. Test code is updated as new features are added and failure conditions are discovered (bugs fixed). Commonly, the unit test code is maintained with the project code, integrated in the build process, and run on each build and as part of regression testing. Goals of this continuous integration is to support development and reduce defects.

Even in organizations that separate teams by programming and testing functions, many often have the programmers perform unit testing.

==== Sample process ====

The sample below is common for waterfall development. The same activities are commonly found in other development models, but might be described differently.

* Requirements analysis: testing should begin in the requirements phase of the software development life cycle. During the design phase, testers work to determine what aspects of a design are testable and with what parameters those tests work.
* Test planning: test strategy, test plan, testbed creation. Since many activities will be carried out during testing, a plan is needed.
* Test development: test procedures, test scenarios, test cases, test datasets, test scripts to use in testing software.
* Test execution: testers execute the software based on the plans and test documents then report any errors found to the development team. This part could be complex when running tests with a lack of programming knowledge.
* Test reporting: once testing is completed, testers generate metrics and make final reports on their test effort and whether or not the software tested is ready for release.
* Test result analysis: or &quot;defect analysis&quot;, is done by the development team usually along with the client, in order to decide what defects should be assigned, fixed, rejected (i.e. found software working properly) or deferred to be dealt with later.
* Defect retesting: once a defect has been dealt with by the development team, it is retested by the testing team.
* Regression testing: it is common to have a small test program built of a subset of tests, for each integration of new, modified, or fixed software, in order to ensure that the latest delivery has not ruined anything and that the software product as a whole is still working correctly.
* Test closure: once the test meets the exit criteria, the activities such as capturing the key outputs, lessons learned, results, logs, documents related to the project are archived and used as a reference for future projects.

== Quality ==
=== Software verification and validation ===
Software testing is used in association with verification and validation:

* Verification: Have we built the software right? (i.e., does it implement the requirements).
* Validation: Have we built the right software? (i.e., do the deliverables satisfy the customer).

The terms verification and validation are commonly used interchangeably in the industry; it is also common to see these two terms defined with contradictory definitions. According to the &quot;IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology&quot;:

: Verification is the process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
: Validation is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.

And, according to the ISO 9000 standard:

: Verification is confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled.
: Validation is confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.

The contradiction is caused by the use of the concepts of requirements and specified requirements but with different meanings.

In the case of IEEE standards, the specified requirements, mentioned in the definition of validation, are the set of problems, needs and wants of the stakeholders that the software must solve and satisfy. Such requirements are documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). And, the products mentioned in the definition of verification, are the output artifacts of every phase of the software development process. These products are, in fact, specifications such as Architectural Design Specification, Detailed Design Specification, etc. The SRS is also a specification, but it cannot be verified (at least not in the sense used here, more on this subject below).

But, for the ISO 9000, the specified requirements are the set of specifications, as just mentioned above, that must be verified. A specification, as previously explained, is the product of a software development process phase that receives another specification as input. A specification is verified successfully when it correctly implements its input specification. All the specifications can be verified except the SRS because it is the first one (it can be validated, though). Examples: The Design Specification must implement the SRS; and, the Construction phase artifacts must implement the Design Specification.

So, when these words are defined in common terms, the apparent contradiction disappears.

Both the SRS and the software must be validated. The SRS can be validated statically by consulting with the stakeholders. Nevertheless, running some partial implementation of the software or a prototype of any kind (dynamic testing) and obtaining positive feedback from them, can further increase the certainty that the SRS is correctly formulated. On the other hand, the software, as a final and running product (not its artifacts and documents, including the source code) must be validated dynamically with the stakeholders by executing the software and having them to try it.

Some might argue that, for SRS, the input is the words of stakeholders and, therefore, SRS validation is the same as SRS verification. Thinking this way is not advisable as it only causes more confusion. It is better to think of verification as a process involving a formal and technical input document.

=== Software quality assurance ===

In some organizations, software testing is part of a software quality assurance (SQA) process. In SQA, software process specialists and auditors are concerned with the software development process rather than just the artifacts such as documentation, code and systems. They examine and change the software engineering process itself to reduce the number of faults that end up in the delivered software: the so-called defect rate. What constitutes an acceptable defect rate depends on the nature of the software; a flight simulator video game would have much higher defect tolerance than software for an actual airplane. Although there are close links with SQA, testing departments often exist independently, and there may be no SQA function in some companies.

Software testing is an activity to investigate software under test in order to provide quality-related information to stakeholders. By contrast, QA (quality assurance) is the implementation of policies and procedures intended to prevent defects from reaching customers.

=== Measures ===

Quality measures include such topics as correctness, completeness, security and ISO/IEC 9126 requirements such as capability, reliability, efficiency, portability, maintainability, compatibility, and usability.

There are a number of frequently used software metrics, or measures, which are used to assist in determining the state of the software or the adequacy of the testing.

=== Artifacts ===

A software testing process can produce several artifacts. The actual artifacts produced are a factor of the software development model used, stakeholder and organisational needs.

====Test plan====

A test plan is a document detailing the approach that will be taken for intended test activities. The plan may include aspects such as objectives, scope, processes and procedures, personnel requirements, and contingency plans. The test plan could come in the form of a single plan that includes all test types (like an acceptance or system test plan) and planning considerations, or it may be issued as a master test plan that provides an overview of more than one detailed test plan (a plan of a plan). A test plan can be, in some cases, part of a wide &quot;test strategy&quot; which documents overall testing approaches, which may itself be a master test plan or even a separate artifact.

====Traceability matrix====
====Test case====
A test case normally consists of a unique identifier, requirement references from a design specification, preconditions, events, a series of steps (also known as actions) to follow, input, output, expected result, and the actual result. Clinically defined, a test case is an input and an expected result. This can be as terse as &quot;for condition x your derived result is y&quot;, although normally test cases describe in more detail the input scenario and what results might be expected. It can occasionally be a series of steps (but often steps are contained in a separate test procedure that can be exercised against multiple test cases, as a matter of economy) but with one expected result or expected outcome. The optional fields are a test case ID, test step, or order of execution number, related requirement(s), depth, test category, author, and check boxes for whether the test is automatable and has been automated. Larger test cases may also contain prerequisite states or steps, and descriptions. A test case should also contain a place for the actual result. These steps can be stored in a word processor document, spreadsheet, database, or other common repositories. In a database system, you may also be able to see past test results, who generated the results, and what system configuration was used to generate those results. These past results would usually be stored in a separate table.

====Test script====

A test script is a procedure or programming code that replicates user actions. Initially, the term was derived from the product of work created by automated regression test tools. A test case will be a baseline to create test scripts using a tool or a program.

====Test suite====
====Test fixture or test data====
In most cases, multiple sets of values or data are used to test the same functionality of a particular feature. All the test values and changeable environmental components are collected in separate files and stored as test data. It is also useful to provide this data to the client and with the product or a project. There are techniques to generate Test data.

====Test harness====
The software, tools, samples of data input and output, and configurations are all referred to collectively as a test harness.

====Test run====
A test run is a collection of test cases or test suites that the user is executing and comparing the expected with the actual results. Once complete, a report or all executed tests may be generated.

=== Certifications ===
Several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists. A few practitioners argue that the testing field is not ready for certification, as mentioned in the controversy section.

== Controversy ==

Some of the major software testing controversies include:

; Agile vs. traditional : Should testers learn to work under conditions of uncertainty and constant change or should they aim at process &quot;maturity&quot;? The agile testing movement has received growing popularity since the early 2000s mainly in commercial circles, whereas government and military software providers use this methodology but also the traditional test-last models (e.g., in the Waterfall model).
; Manual vs. automated testing: Some writers believe that test automation is so expensive relative to its value that it should be used sparingly. The test automation then can be considered as a way to capture and implement the requirements. As a general rule, the larger the system and the greater the complexity, the greater the ROI in test automation. Also, the investment in tools and expertise can be amortized over multiple projects with the right level of knowledge sharing within an organization.
; Is the existence of the ISO 29119 software testing standard justified?: Significant opposition has formed out of the ranks of the context-driven school of software testing about the ISO 29119 standard. Professional testing associations, such as the International Society for Software Testing, have attempted to have the standard withdrawn.
; Some practitioners declare that the testing field is not ready for certification: No certification now offered actually requires the applicant to show their ability to test software. No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge. Certification itself cannot measure an individual&#x27;s productivity, their skill, or practical knowledge, and cannot guarantee their competence, or professionalism as a tester.
; Studies used to show the relative expense of fixing defects: There are opposing views on the applicability of studies used to show the relative expense of fixing defects depending on their introduction and detection. For example:
It is commonly believed that the earlier a defect is found, the cheaper it is to fix it. The following table shows the cost of fixing the defect depending on the stage it was found. For example, if a problem in the requirements is found only post-release, then it would cost 10–100 times more to fix than if it had already been found by the requirements review. With the advent of modern continuous deployment practices and cloud-based services, the cost of re-deployment and maintenance may lessen over time.


The data from which this table is extrapolated is scant. Laurent Bossavit says in his analysis:

The &quot;smaller projects&quot; curve turns out to be from only two teams of first-year students, a sample size so small that extrapolating to &quot;smaller projects in general&quot; is totally indefensible. The GTE study does not explain its data, other than to say it came from two projects, one large and one small. The paper cited for the Bell Labs &quot;Safeguard&quot; project specifically disclaims having collected the fine-grained data that Boehm&#x27;s data points suggest. The IBM study (Fagan&#x27;s paper) contains claims that seem to contradict Boehm&#x27;s graph and no numerical results that clearly correspond to his data points.

Boehm doesn&#x27;t even cite a paper for the TRW data, except when writing for &quot;Making Software&quot; in 2010, and there he cited the original 1976 article. There exists a large study conducted at TRW at the right time for Boehm to cite it, but that paper doesn&#x27;t contain the sort of data that would support Boehm&#x27;s claims.

<text>The Ship-Submarine Recycling Program (SRP) is the process that the United States Navy uses to dispose of decommissioned nuclear vessels. SRP takes place only at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton, Washington, but the preparations can begin elsewhere.

==Program overview==

=== Defueling and decommissioning ===

Before SRP can begin, the vessel&#x27;s nuclear fuel must be removed, and defueling usually coincides with decommissioning. Until the fuel is removed, the vessel is referred to as &quot;USS &quot;Name&quot;,&quot; but afterward, the &quot;USS&quot; prefix is dropped and it is referred to as &quot;ex-&quot;Name&quot;.&quot; Reusable equipment is removed at the same time as the fuel.

=== Spent fuel storage ===

Spent nuclear fuel is shipped by rail to the Naval Reactor Facility in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), located northwest of Idaho Falls, Idaho, where it is stored in special canisters.

=== Hull salvage ===

At PSNS, the SRP proper begins. The salvage workers cut the submarine into three or four pieces: the aft section, the reactor compartment, the missile compartment if one exists, and the forward section. Missile compartments are dismantled according to the provisions of the Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty.

Until 1991, the forward and aft sections of the submarines were rejoined and placed in floating storage. Various proposals for disposal of those hulls were considered, including sinking them at sea, but none proved economically practical. Some submarines built prior to the 1978 banning of polychlorinated biphenyl products (PCBs) had the chemicals on board, which are considered hazardous materials by the Environmental Protection Agency and United States Coast Guard, requiring their removal. Since then, and to help reduce costs, the remaining submarine sections are recycled, returning reusable materials to production. In the process of submarine recycling, all hazardous and toxic wastes are identified and removed, and reusable equipment is removed and put into inventory. Scrap metals and all other materials are sold to private companies or reused. The overall process is not profitable, but does provide some cost relief. Disposal of submarines by the SRP costs the Navy US$25–50 million per submarine.

=== Reactor vessel disposal ===

Once the de-fueled reactor compartment is removed, it is sealed at both ends and shipped by barge and multiple-wheel high-capacity trailers to the Department of Energy&#x27;s Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, where they are currently, , kept in open dry storage and slated to be eventually buried. Russian submarine reactor compartments are stored in similar fashion at Sayda-Guba (Sayda Bay) in northwestern Russia and Chazhma Bay near Vladivostok. The burial trenches have been evaluated to be secure for at least 600 years before the first pinhole penetration of some lead containment areas of the reactor compartment packages occurs, and several thousand years before leakage becomes possible. 

=== Prior disposal methods ===

In 1959 the US Navy removed a nuclear reactor from the submarine and replaced it with a new type. The removed reactor was scuttled in the Atlantic Ocean, east of Delaware, at a depth of .
In 1972, the London Dumping Convention restricted ocean disposal of radioactive waste and in 1993, ocean disposal of radioactive waste was completely banned. The US Navy began a study on scrapping nuclear submarines; two years later shallow land burial of reactor compartments was selected as the most suitable option.

In 1990, was the first US nuclear-powered submarine to be scrapped.

=== Future salvage work ===
By the end of 2005, 195 nuclear submarines had been ordered or built in the US (including the NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft and , but none of the later ). The last of the regular attack boats, , was decommissioned in 2001, and , a highly modified &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, was decommissioned in 2004. The last of the initial &quot;41 for Freedom&quot; fleet ballistic missile (FBM) submarines, , was decommissioned in 2002. Decommissioning of the boats began in 1995 with . Additionally, a handful of nuclear-powered cruisers have entered the program, and their dismantling is ongoing. The first aircraft carrier due for decommissioning that would enter the SRP is planned to be , which was withdrawn in 2013. Unlike the disposal of other nuclear powered surface ships, all of which have been recycled at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, the Navy is looking at other, commercial or private sector options for &quot;Enterprise&quot; in an effort to reduce both the cost of the work and the time taken to dismantle such a large vessel, as well as negating the difficulty of towing the hulk all the way from Newport News, where it is stored, to Puget Sound. &quot;Enterprise&quot; will be used as the pilot project to look at the disposal of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, with the lessons learned from the ship&#x27;s eventual scrapping to be incorporated into the plans for the upcoming disposal of the first &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class ships. To this end, in 2024, the US Navy established the CVN Inactivation and Disposal Program Office, under the oversight of the Program Executive Office, Aircraft Carriers.

In December 2020, it was announced that a further nine &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class attack submarines, two guided missile submarines, and the aircraft carrier would be decommissioned and enter the recycling program by 2026. However, in November 2023, a further announcement was made that, owing to delays in both the construction of ships of the and the Refueling and Complex Overhaul work on the existing &quot;Nimitz&quot; class ships, the US Navy was looking to extend the service life of &quot;Nimitz&quot; beyond 2026, and , which was planned to decommission in 2027.

Hulls waiting or already processed by the recycling program are listed below.

== Lists of vessels by type ==
===Aircraft carriers===
In September 2023, it was announced that, once any remaining radioactive and hazardous material had been removed, ex-&quot;Enterprise&quot; would be broken up at a commercial shipyard. As of 2025, the hull remains stored at Hampton Roads.

=== Cruisers ===

† A dagger after a completion date indicates that portions of the hull were preserved as memorials. See the individual articles for details.

(note) ex-&quot;Long Beach&quot; has been partially dismantled and remains moored in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 2018.

=== Attack submarines ===

Some of these submarines (the &quot;George Washington&quot; class) were fleet ballistic missile boats for the vast majority of their careers. However, they were briefly converted to SSNs before decommissioning and arrival at PSNS, and so are listed under that designation here. The nuclear-powered research submersible &quot;NR-1&quot; is also included in this list.
† A dagger after a completion date indicates that portions of the hull were preserved as memorials. See the individual articles for details.

‡ Date given for ex-&quot;Parche&quot; is official date used to secure FY2004 funding; work did not begin until 19 October.

 (SSN-701) is currently undergoing conversion to a moored training ship at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. (SSN-711) will be converted after decommissioning.

=== Ballistic missile submarines ===
Some of these submarines (the &quot;Lafayette&quot; class) were fleet ballistic missile boats for the vast majority of their careers. However, they were converted to SSNs for use as moored training platforms and are not currently scheduled for recycling.
† A dagger after a completion date indicates that portions of the hull were preserved as memorials. See the individual articles for details.

Because the program is underway, this list is almost certainly incomplete.

Note for ships marked with refit:
&quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; (SSBN-635) was converted into a training platform – Moored Training Ship (MTS-635). &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; arrived for conversion on 1 February 1986, and on 29 July 1989 the first moored training ship achieved initial criticality. Modifications included special mooring arrangements including a mechanism to absorb power generated by the main propulsion shaft. &quot;Daniel Webster&quot; (SSBN-626) was converted to the second Moored Training Ship (MTS-2 / MTS-626) in 1993. The Moored Training Ship Site is located at Naval Weapons Station Charleston in Goose Creek, South Carolina. &quot;Sam Rayburn&quot; is scheduled to operate as an MTS until 2014 while undergoing shipyard availabilities at four-year intervals.

<text>Shaolin Monastery (), also known as Shaolin Temple, is a monastic institution recognized as the birthplace of Chan Buddhism and the cradle of Shaolin kung fu. It is located at the foot of Wuru Peak of the Songshan mountain range in Dengfeng County, Henan province, China. The name reflects its location in the ancient grove () of Mount Shaoshi, in the hinterland of the Songshan mountains. Mount Song occupied a prominent position among Chinese sacred mountains as early as the 1st century BC, when it was proclaimed one of the Five Holy Peaks (). It is located some southeast of Luoyang, the former capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534), and southwest of Zhengzhou, the modern capital of Henan Province.

As the first Shaolin abbot, Butuo Buddhabhadra devoted himself to translating Buddhist scriptures and preaching doctrines to hundreds of his followers. According to legend, Bodhidharma, the 28th patriarch of Mahayana Buddhism in India, arrived at the Shaolin Temple in 527. He spent nine years meditating in a cave of the Wuru Peak and initiated the Chinese Chan tradition at the Shaolin Temple. Thereafter, Bodhidharma was honored as the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism.

The Temple&#x27;s historical architectural complex, standing out for its great aesthetic value and its profound cultural connotations, has been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Apart from its contribution to the development of Chinese Buddhism, as well as for its historical, cultural, and artistic heritage, the temple is famous for its martial arts tradition. Shaolin monks have been devoted to research, creation, and continuous development and perfecting of Shaolin Kung Fu.

The main pillars of Shaolin culture are Chan Buddhism (), martial arts (), Buddhist art (), and traditional Chinese medicine (). This cultural heritage, still constituting the daily temple life, is representative of Chinese civilization. A large number of prominent people, eminent monks, Buddhist disciples, and many others, visit the temple for pilgrimage and cultural exchanges. In addition, owing to the work of official Shaolin overseas cultural centers and foreign disciples, Shaolin culture has spread around the world as a distinctive symbol of Chinese culture and a means of foreign cultural exchange.

==History==

===Northern Wei and Northern Zhou dynasties===
Batuo, also referred to in the Chinese sources as Fotuo and in Sanskrit as Buddhabhadra, had enjoyed the sponsorship of the Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei since arriving in Pingcheng via the Silk Road, around the year 490. Yang Xuanzhi, in the &quot;Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang&quot; (AD 547), and Li Xian, in the &quot;Ming Yitongzhi&quot; (1461), concur with Daoxuan&#x27;s location and attribution. The &quot;Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi&quot; (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the twentieth year of the &quot;Taihe&quot; era of the Northern Wei dynasty, that is, the monastery was built in AD 495.

Thanks to Batuo, Shaolin became an important center for the study and translation of original Buddhist scriptures. It also became a place of gathering for esteemed Buddhist masters. Historical sources on the early origins of Shaolin kung fu show that at this time, martial arts practice was existent in the temple. Batuo&#x27;s teaching was continued by his two disciples, Sengchou (, 480–560) and Huiguang (, 487–536).

In the first year of the Yongping era (506), Indian monks Lenamoti (, in Sanskrit: &quot;Ratnamati&quot;) and Putiliuzhi (, in Sanskrit: &quot;Bodhiruci&quot;) came to Shaolin to set up a scripture translation hall. Together with Huiguang, they translated master Shiqin&#x27;s (; in Sanskrit: &quot;Vasubandhu&quot;) commentary on the Ten Stages Sutra (Sanskrit: &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;; simplified Chinese: ), an early, influential Mahayana Buddhist scripture. After that, Huiguang promoted the Vinaya in Four Parts (; Sanskrit: &quot;Dharmagupta-Vinaya&quot;), which formed the theoretical basis of the Luzong () School of Buddhism, formed during the Tang Dynasty by Dao Xuan (596–667).

In the third year of the Xiaochang era (527) of Emperor Xiaoming of Northern Wei, Bodhidharma (), the 28th patriarch of Mahayana Buddhism in India, came to the Shaolin Temple. The Indian arrived as a Chan Buddhist missionary and traveled for decades throughout China before, settling on Mount Song in the 520s. Bodhidharma&#x27;s teachings were primarily based on Lankavatara Sutra, which contains the conversation between Gautama Buddha and Bodhisattva Mahamatti, who is considered the first patriarch of Chan tradition.

Using the teachings of Batuo and his disciples as a foundation, Bodhidharma introduced Chan Buddhism, and the Shaolin Temple community gradually grew to become the center of Chinese Chan Buddhism. Bodhidharma&#x27;s teaching was transmitted to his disciple Huike, who the legend says cut off his arm to show his determination and devotion to the teachings of his master. Huike was forced to leave the temple during the persecution of Buddhism and Daoism (574–580) by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou. In 580, Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou restored the temple and renamed it Zhi‘ao Temple ().

The idea that Bodhidharma founded martial arts at the Shaolin Temple was spread in the 20th century. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the &quot;Yijin Jing&quot;. The oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel &quot;The Travels of Lao Ts&#x27;an&quot; in &quot;Illustrated Fiction Magazine&quot;:
Other scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. The monk and his disciples are said to have lived at a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery.
In the 6th century, around AD 547, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song. In AD 645, The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks describes him as being active in the Mount Song region. Around AD 710, Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma&#x27;s Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji) and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huike&#x27;s many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo. In the 11th century (1004), a work embellishes the Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated to 728 AD reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song. Another stele from AD 798 speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated to 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe, according to the ancient legend of Da Mo. A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River. In 1125, a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.

===Sui, Tang, Wu Zhou, and Song dynasties===

Emperor Wen of Sui, who was a Buddhist himself, returned the temple&#x27;s original name and offered to its community 100 hectares of land. Shaolin thus became a large temple with hundreds of hectares of fertile land and large properties. It was once again the center of Chan Buddhism, with eminent monks from all over China visiting on a regular basis.

At the end of the Sui dynasty, the Shaolin Temple, with its huge monastery properties, became the target of thieves and bandits. The monks organized forces within their community to protect the temple and fight against the intruders. At the beginning of the Tang dynasty, thirteen Shaolin monks helped Li Shimin, the future second emperor of the Tang dynasty, in his fight against Wang Shichong. They captured Shichong&#x27;s nephew Wang Renze, whose army was stationed in the Cypress Valley. In 626, Li Shimin, later known as Emperor Taizong, sent an official letter of gratitude to the Shaolin community for the help they provided in his fight against Shichong and thus the establishment of the Tang Dynasty. According to legend, Emperor Taizong granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special &quot;imperial dispensation&quot; to consume meat and alcohol during reign of the Tang dynasty. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today. This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele, erected in AD 728. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks&#x27; assistance during the campaign against Wang Shichong; only land and a water mill are granted. The Tang dynasty also established several Shaolin branch monasteries throughout the country and formulated policies for Shaolin monks and soldiers to assist local governments and regular military troops. Shaolin Temple also became a place where emperors and high officials would come for temporary reclusion. Emperor Gaozong of Tang and Empress Wu Zetian often visited the Shaolin Temple for good luck and made large donations. Empress Wu also paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple to discuss Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. During the Tang and Song dynasties, the Shaolin Temple was extremely prosperous. It had more than 14,000 acres of land, 540 acres of temple grounds, more than 5,000 rooms, and more than 2,000 monks. The Chan Buddhist School founded by Bodhidharma flourished during the Tang dynasty and was the largest Buddhist school of that time.

Information about the first century of the Northern Song dynasty is scarce. The rulers of Song supported the development of Buddhism, and Chan established itself as dominant over other Buddhist schools. Around 1093, Chan master Baoen () promoted the Caodong School in the Shaolin Temple and achieved what is known in Buddhist history as &quot;revolutionary turn into Chan&quot;. This meant that the Shaolin Temple officially became a Chan Buddhist Temple, while up to that point it was a Lǜzōng temple specialized in Vinaya, with a Chan Hall.

===Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties===
At the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, Emperor Shizu of Yuan installed the monk Xueting Fuyu (, 1203–1275) as the abbot of Shaolin and put him in charge of all the temples in the Mount Song area. During this period, the abbot undertook important construction work, including the building of the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower. He also introduced the generational lineage system of the Shaolin disciples through a 70-character poem—each character in line corresponding to the name of the next generation of disciples. In 1260, Fuyu was honored with the title of the Divine Buddhist Master and in 1312 posthumously named Duke of Jin () by the Yuan emperor.

The fall of the Yuan dynasty and the establishment of the Ming dynasty brought much unrest, in which the temple community needed to defend itself from rebels and bandits. During the Red Turban Rebellion in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple&#x27;s patron saint Vajrapani, with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.

With the establishment of the Ming dynasty by mid-14th century, Shaolin recovered, and a large part of the monastic community that fled during the Red Turban attacks returned. At the beginning of the Ming dynasty, the government did not advocate martial arts. During the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, Japanese pirates harassed China&#x27;s coastal areas, and generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang led their troops against the pirates. During his stay in Fujian, Qi Jiguang convened martial artists from all over China, including local Shaolin monks, to develop a set of boxing and staff fighting techniques to be used against Japanese pirates. Owing to the monks&#x27; merits in fighting against the Japanese, the government renovated the temple on a large scale, and Shaolin enjoyed certain privileges, such as food tax exemption, granted by the government. Afterward, Shaolin monks were recruited by the Ming government at least six times to participate in wars. Due to their outstanding contribution to Chinese military success, the imperial court built monuments and buildings for Shaolin Temple on numerous occasions. This also contributed to the establishment of the legitimacy of Shaolin kung fu in the national martial arts community. During the Ming Dynasty (in mid-16th century), Shaolin reached its apogee and held its position as the central place of the Caodong School of Chan Buddhism.

In 1641, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng sacked the monastery due to the monks&#x27; support of the Ming dynasty and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple&#x27;s fighting force. The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the Qing dynasty patronized and restored it.

During the Qing dynasty, Shaolin Temple was favored by Qing emperors. In the 43rd year of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s reign (1704), the emperor gifted a tablet to the temple, with the characters () engraved on it in his calligraphy (originally hung in the Heavenly King Hall and later moved by the Mountain Gate). In the 13th year of the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s reign (1735), important reconstructions were financed by the court, including the rebuilding of the gate and the Thousand Buddha&#x27;s Hall. In the 15th year of his rule (1750), the Qianlong Emperor personally visited Shaolin Temple, stayed at the abbot&#x27;s room overnight, and wrote poems and tablet inscriptions.

A well-known story of the temple from this period is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the Shunzhi Emperor, in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the Kangxi Emperor, or in 1728 or 1732 under the Yongzheng Emperor, this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts throughout China by means of the five fugitive monks. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the &quot;Qing bai lei chao&quot; (1917), locates this temple in Fujian. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history and in &quot;wuxia&quot; fiction.

While these latter accounts are popular among martial artists and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives, such as the classical novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.

===Republic of China===

In the early days of the Republic of China, the Shaolin Temple was repeatedly hit by wars. In 1912, monk Yunsong Henglin from the Dengfeng County Monks Association was elected by the local government as the head of the Shaolin Militia (Shaolin Guarding Corps). He organized the guards and trained them in combat skills to maintain local order. In the autumn of 1920, famine and drought hit Henan province, which led to thieves surging throughout the area and endangering the local community. Henglin led the militia to fight the bandits on different occasions, thus enabling dozens of villages in the temple&#x27;s surroundings to live and work in peace.

In the late 1920s, Shaolin monks became embroiled in the warlords&#x27; feuds that swept the plains of northern China. They sided with General Fan Zhongxiu (1888–1930), who had studied martial arts at Shaolin Temple as a child, against Shi Yousan (1891–1940). Fan was defeated and, in the spring of 1928, Yousan&#x27;s troops entered Dengfeng and Shaolin Temple, which served as Fan Zongxiu&#x27;s headquarters. On 15 March, Feng Yuxiang&#x27;s subordinate Shi Yousan set fire to the monastery, destroying some of its ancient towers and halls. The flames partially damaged the &quot;Shaolin Monastery Stele&quot; (which recorded the politically astute choice made by other Shaolin clerics fifteen hundred years earlier), the Dharma Hall, the Heavenly King Hall, Mahavira Hall, Bell Tower, Drum Tower, Sixth Ancestor Hall, Chan Hall, and other buildings, causing the death of a number of monks. A large number of cultural relics and 5,480 volumes of Buddhist scriptures were destroyed in the fire.

Japan&#x27;s activities in Manchuria in the early 1930s made the National Government very worried. The military then launched a strong patriotic movement to defend the country and resist the enemy. The Nanjing Central Martial Arts Center and Wushu Institute, together with other martial arts institutions, were established around the country as part of this movement. The government also organized martial arts events such as &quot;Martial arts returning to Shaolin&quot;. This particular event served to encourage people to remember the importance of patriotism by celebrating the contribution of Shaolin martial arts to the country&#x27;s defense from foreign invasion at numerous occasions throughout history.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the state officially became atheist, with roughly half of the population identifying as nonreligious or atheist. Some state-monitored religions and practices were allowed, while others, like Tibetan Buddhism, were persecuted after the takeover of Tibet by the Chinese military, in 1959.

During the Cultural Revolution, the monks of Shaolin Temple were forced to return to secular life, Buddha statues were destroyed, and temple properties were invaded. After this period ended, Shaolin Temple was repaired and rebuilt. The buildings and other material heritage that was destroyed, including the Mahavira Hall and the stone portraying &quot;Bodhidharma facing the wall&quot;, were reconstructed according to their originals. Others, such as the ancient martial arts training ground, the Pagoda Forest, and some stone carvings that survived, still remain in their original state. In December 1996, Chuzu Temple and Shaolin Temple Pagoda Forest (No. 4-89) were listed as national key cultural relic protection units. Shaolin Temple leadership aimed for its historical architectural complex to become a United Nations World Heritage site in order to obtain annual funding for maintenance and development from the UN. After repeated submissions, their application was finally accepted by the 34th World Heritage Committee on 1 August 2010. UNESCO reviewed and approved eight sites and eleven architectural complexes, including Shaolin&#x27;s Resident Hall, Pagoda Forest, and Chuzu Temple as World Cultural Heritage.

In 1994, the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the world. As of January 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over forty companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.

In 2018, for the first time in its 1,500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the national flag of China as part of a &quot;patriotism drive&quot; under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the United Front Work Department, which &quot;oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora&quot;. Senior theology lecturer Sze Chi Chan of Hong Kong Baptist University interpreted this move as Xi Jinping making an example of the Shaolin Monastery to send a message to other temples and the Chinese Catholic Church.

==Governance==
The monastery was historically led by an abbot. However, Communist restrictions on religious expression and independence have changed this ancient system. The monastery is currently led by a committee composed primarily of government officials. The treasurer is appointed by the government and as such, the abbot has little control over monastery finances. The monastery splits its profits with Dengfeng: the municipality takes two thirds of the profits, and the monastery retains one third.

==Shaolin culture==

===Heritage culture===
Shaolin Temple has developed numerous complementary cultural aspects that permeate and mutually reinforce each other and are inseparable, when it comes to presenting the temple&#x27;s material and intangible cultural heritage. The most prominent aspects are those of Chan (), martial arts (), traditional medicine (), and art (). Shaolin culture is rooted in Mahayana Buddhism, while the practice of Chan is its nucleus and finally, the martial arts, traditional medicine, and art are its manifestations. Thanks to the efforts of the abbot Shi Yongxin, the monastic community, and the temple&#x27;s disciples from all over the world, Shaolin culture continues to grow. During its historical development, Shaolin culture has also integrated the essential values of Confucianism and Taoism.

The contemporary temple establishment offers to all interested individuals and groups, regardless of cultural, social, and religious values, the chance to experience Shaolin culture through the Shaolin cultural exchange program. This program offers an introduction to Chan meditation, Shaolin kung fu, Chan medicine, calligraphy, art, archery, etc. Chan practice is supposed to help the individual in attaining calm and patience necessary for living optimistically, meaningfully, wisely, and with compassion. Ways of practicing Chan are numerous, and they range from everyday activities such as eating, drinking, walking, or sleeping, to specialized practices such as meditation, martial arts, and calligraphy.

Shaolin kung fu is manifested through a system of different skills that are based on attack and defense movements with the form () as its unit. One form is a combination of different movements. The structure of movements is founded on ancient Chinese medical knowledge, which is compatible with the laws of body movement. Within the temple, the forms are taught with a focus on integration of the principles of complementarity and opposition. This means that Shaolin kung fu integrates dynamic and static components, yin and yang, hardness and softness, etc.

The Shaolin community invests great effort in safeguarding, developing, and innovating its heritage. Following the ancient Chinese principle of harmony between heaven and humans, temple masters work on the development of the most natural body movement in order to achieve the full potential of human expression.

Shaolin has developed activities related to the international promotion of its cultural heritage. In 2012, the first international Shaolin cultural festival was organized in Germany, followed by festivals in the US and England. Official Shaolin cultural centers exist in numerous countries in Europe, the US, Canada, and Russia. Every year, the temple hosts more than thirty international events with the aim to promote cultural exchange.

===International promotion of Shaolin cultural heritage===
Shaolin Temple is an important religious and cultural institution, both in China and internationally. Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and especially since the 1970s, cultural exchanges between Shaolin Temple and the rest of the world have continuously improved in terms of content, scale, frequency, and scope. The temple has been visited by European and American dancers, martial artists, NBA players, Hollywood movie stars, but also renowned monks from traditional Buddhist countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Also, a number of political leaders, such as Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf, British Queen Elizabeth II, Spanish King Juan Carlos I, Australia&#x27;s former prime minister John Howard, South Africa former president Nelson Mandela, Russian president Vladimir Putin, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, and Taiwanese politician James Soong have met with the temple&#x27;s abbot.

Currently, there are more than forty overseas cultural institutions established by the temple&#x27;s leadership and its disciples in dozens of countries around the world. Shaolin monks come to the centers to teach Buddhist classics, martial arts, meditation, etc. Another way of promoting Shaolin&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage in the world is through Shaolin Cultural Festivals, the first of which was held in North America. These festivals and similar events convey the spiritual connotation of Chinese culture and Eastern values to societies internationally.

===Myths of Shaolin===
Asian monks are typically portrayed in Western culture as being knowledgeable, at peace, as well as spiritual individuals. Additionally, they are depicted as wise mystics who offer spiritual advice. This stereotype&#x27;s beginnings can be traced to the 19th century, when Western explorers and missionaries first started to come into contact with Buddhist monks in Asia. The monks were typically romanticized as otherworldly, enigmatic individuals who had achieved a profound spiritual perception of reality. Despite being a poor oversimplification of the variety of beliefs, practices, and experiences among Buddhist monks, the stereotype has persisted. Jane Iwamura calls this phenomenon &quot;virtual Orientalism&quot; and states that it &quot;declares an independence from the real but also co-opts or colonizes the real&quot;.

==Architectural complex of Shaolin Temple==

===Protection of the site===
The original Shaolin Temple was burned to the ground in 1928 by Shi Yousan, a renegade nationalist warlord. The monks were either killed or deported. The ground lay more or less abandoned, and under Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, it suffered additional damage. However, in 1982, six years after Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, the Law on the Protection of Cultural Heritage of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was passed.

The Songshan Scenic Area, established that year, came to include the Shaolin Temple Scenic Spot. &quot;Scenic areas&quot; were created by the 1982 law as protected regions valuable to the public for their natural or cultural assets. The Songshan Scenic Area covered the mountains around Denfeng. In 1990, the Ministry of Construction and Tongji University proposed that scenic areas be divided into subregions called &quot;Scenic Spots&quot;. When this measure was passed by the state council (central government), the &quot;Songshan National Scenic Area&quot; (SNSA) acquired the &quot;Shaolin Temple Scenic Spot&quot; (STSS), consisting of the Shaosi side of the Scenic Area. Though named after the famous monastery in the south of the spot, it also included the north, where the government established a kung fu academy, the largest in China. The scenic spot consists of the entire park.

The government promptly allocated funds for the reconstruction of the monastery as a tourist site. They were to rebuild nine halls, restore ten, and construct eight new ones. However, all documentation on the temple had been destroyed. Already familiar with the type of structure, the architects interviewed elders who had been at the monastery before 1928 for details.

The task became greater than simply restoring the monastery of 1928. That monastery was the end point of a long line of development, which included reconstruction after some twenty or more previous destructions, and variations in size from twenty monks during the Tang dynasty (619–907) to more than 1,800 monks living in 5,000 rooms during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). No single configuration representative of the entire span of the monastery was apparent. Multiple possibilities existed, and deliberations about what to restore were complex and prolonged. By 1998, the government of Dengfeng had reconstructed or restored fourteen architectural items, mostly buildings.

By 2010, it was obvious that management decisions were beyond merely the government. A new management was created that year to operate a joint venture between the government, a private company from Hong Kong, and the abbot of a newly constituted body of monks. They were empowered to maintain a balance between historical authenticity and tourist sustainability.

UNESCO was not far behind this change in management technique. It took an interest and was invited to participate. In 2010, several ancient sites around Dengfeng were united into a single UNESCO World Heritage Site, with eight distinct scenic spots. The Shaolin Scenic spot contained three of the WHS components, collectively called the &quot;architectural complex&quot;. By this, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) of UNESCO designated three ancient sites: the Shaolin Temple compound, assigned the name &quot;Kernel Compound&quot;; its cemetery, the Pagoda Forest; and its subsidiary, the Chuzu Temple.

===Access to the site===
The Shaolin Temple Scenic Spot is located approximately in the middle of Mount Song, an E–W trending massif on the right bank of the Yellow River. The massif is terminated by Luoyang on the west side and Zhengzhou on the east. The straight-line distance from Luoyang to Shaolin is about ; from Zhengzhou, about . Either city is a popular starting point for a bus or automobile tour to the site.

Mount Song is divided by an extensive valley on its south-central side, where much of Dengfeng is located. The mountains around the valley, forming an upside-down U, have been defined as the Songshan Scenic Area. The pass over the U is located directly north of the valley. On the western side is the Shaolin Scenic Spot, accessed by China National Highway 207 (G207), which winds over the pass from the direction of Luoyang and runs past the scenic spot, before descending into the valley and joining other roads leading to Zhengzou. The north entrance of the scenic spot adjoins G207.

The North Gate is an entirely new complex built to facilitate the arrival and departure of visitors along the main point of entry, Highway G207. The local highway representing G207 in this case is East Ring Road, Dengfeng. The Shaolin bus stop is at the minimum of the southward-curving highway, at .

===Topography===
The temple&#x27;s inside area is , or . The buildings are arranged in three lengthwise strips. It has seven main halls on the central axis and seven other halls around, with several yards around the halls. These halls are primarily museums containing Buddhist artifacts. Memorials and monuments are scattered freely around the place, as are ancient ginkgo trees.

The architecture below follows the World Heritage Site (WHS) arrangement.

<text>Seymour Roger Cray (September 28, 1925 – October 5, 1996) was an American electrical engineer and supercomputer architect who designed a series of computers that were the fastest in the world for decades, and founded Cray Research, which built many of these machines. Called &quot;the father of supercomputing&quot;, Cray has been credited with creating the supercomputer industry. Joel S. Birnbaum, then chief technology officer of Hewlett-Packard, said of him: &quot;It seems impossible to exaggerate the effect he had on the industry; many of the things that high performance computers now do routinely were at the farthest edge of credibility when Seymour envisioned them.&quot; Larry Smarr, then director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois said that Cray is &quot;the Thomas Edison of the supercomputing industry.&quot;

==Early life==
Cray was born in 1925 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to Seymour R. and Lillian Cray. His father was a civil engineer who fostered Cray&#x27;s interest in science and engineering. As early as the age of ten he was able to build a device out of Erector Set components that converted punched paper tape into Morse code signals. The basement of the family home was given over to the young Cray as a &quot;laboratory&quot;.

Cray graduated from Chippewa Falls High School in 1943 before being drafted for World War II as a radio operator. He saw action in Europe, and then moved to the Pacific theatre where he worked on breaking Japanese naval codes. On his return to the United States he earned a B.Sc. in electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1949, followed by a M.Sc. in applied mathematics in 1951.

==Career==

===Engineering Research Associates===
In 1950, Cray joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in Saint Paul, Minnesota. ERA had formed out of a former United States Navy laboratory that had built codebreaking machines, a tradition ERA carried on when such work was available. ERA was introduced to computer technology during one such effort, but in other times had worked on a wide variety of basic engineering as well.

Cray quickly came to be regarded as an expert on digital computer technology, especially following his design work on the ERA 1103, the first commercially successful scientific computer. He remained at ERA when it was bought by Remington Rand and then Sperry Corporation in the early 1950s. At the newly formed Sperry Rand, ERA became the scientific computing arm of their UNIVAC division.

===Control Data Corporation===
Cray, along with William Norris, later became dissatisfied with ERA, then spun off as Sperry Rand. In 1957, they founded a new company, Control Data Corporation.

By 1960 he had completed the design of the CDC 1604, an improved low-cost ERA 1103 that had impressive performance for its price. Even as the CDC 1604 was starting to ship to customers in 1960, Cray had already moved on to designing other computers. He first worked on the design of an upgraded version (the CDC 3000 series), but company management wanted these machines targeted toward &quot;business and commercial&quot; data processing for average customers. Cray did not enjoy working on such &quot;mundane&quot; machines, constrained to design for low-cost construction, so CDC could sell many of them. His desire was to &quot;produce the largest [fastest] computer in the world&quot;. So after some basic design work on the CDC 3000 series, he turned that over to others and went on to work on the CDC 6600. Nonetheless, several special features of the 6600 first started to appear in the 3000 series.

Although in terms of hardware the 6600 was not on the leading edge, Cray invested considerable effort into the design of the machine in an attempt to enable it to run as fast as possible. Unlike most high-end projects, Cray realized that there was considerably more to performance than simple processor speed, that I/O bandwidth had to be maximized as well in order to avoid &quot;starving&quot; the processor of data to crunch. He later noted, &quot;Anyone can build a fast CPU. The trick is to build a fast system.&quot;

The 6600 was the first commercial supercomputer, outperforming everything then available by a wide margin. While expensive, for those that needed the fastest computer available there was nothing else on the market that could compete. When other companies (namely IBM) attempted to create machines with similar performance, they stumbled (IBM 7030 Stretch). In the 6600, Cray had solved the critical design problem of &quot;imprecise interrupts&quot;, which was largely responsible for IBM&#x27;s failure. He did this by replacing I/O interrupts with a polled request issued by one of ten so-called peripheral processors, which were built-in mini-computers that did all transfers in and out of the 6600&#x27;s central memory. The following CDC 7600 even improved the speed advantage by a factor of five.

In 1963, in a &quot;Business Week&quot; article announcing the CDC 6600, Seymour Cray clearly expressed an idea that is often misattributed to Herb Grosch as so-called Grosch&#x27;s law:

====CDC&#x27;s Chippewa Falls laboratory====
During this period Cray had become increasingly annoyed at what he saw as interference from CDC management. Cray always demanded an absolutely quiet work environment with a minimum of management overhead, but as the company grew he found himself constantly interrupted by middle managers who – according to Cray – did little but gawk and use him as a sales tool by introducing him to prospective customers.

Cray decided that in order to continue development he would have to move from St. Paul, far enough that it would be too long a drive for a &quot;quick visit&quot; and long-distance telephone charges would be just enough to deter most calls, yet close enough that real visits or board meetings could be attended without too much difficulty. After some debate, Norris backed him and set up a new laboratory on land Cray owned in his hometown of Chippewa Falls. Part of the reason for the move may also have to do with Cray&#x27;s worries about an impending nuclear war, which he felt made the Twin Cities a serious safety concern. His house, built a few hundred yards from the new CDC laboratory, included a huge bomb shelter.

The new Chippewa Lab was set up during the middle of the 6600 project, although it does not seem to have delayed the project. After the 6600 shipped, the successor CDC 7600 system was the next product to be developed in Chippewa Falls, offering peak computational speeds of ten times the 6600. The failed follow-on to the 7600, the CDC 8600, was the project that finally ended his run of successes at CDC in 1972.

Although the 6600 and 7600 had been huge successes in the end, both projects had almost bankrupted the company while they were being designed. The 8600 was running into similar difficulties and Cray eventually decided that the only solution was to start over fresh. This time Norris was not willing to take the risk, and another project within the company, the CDC STAR-100, seemed to be progressing more smoothly. Norris said he was willing to keep the project alive at a low level until the STAR was delivered, at which point full funding could be put into the 8600. Cray was unwilling to work under these conditions and left the company.

===Cray Research===

The split was fairly amicable, and when he started Cray Research in a new laboratory on the same Chippewa property a year later, Norris invested $250,000 in start-up money. Like CDC&#x27;s organization, Cray R&amp;D was based in Chippewa Falls and business headquarters were in Minneapolis. Unlike CDC, Cray&#x27;s manufacturing was also in Chippewa Falls.

At first there was some question as to what exactly the new company should do. It did not seem that there would be any way for them to afford to develop a new computer, given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one. When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed money, he was surprised to find that Cray&#x27;s reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.

After several years of development, their first product was released in 1976 as the Cray-1. As with earlier Cray designs, the Cray-1 made sure that the &quot;entire&quot; computer was fast, as opposed to just the processor. When it was released it easily beat almost every machine in terms of speed, including the STAR-100 that had beaten the 8600 for funding. The only machine able to perform on the same sort of level was the ILLIAC IV, a specialized one-off machine that rarely operated near its maximum performance, except on very specific tasks. In general, the Cray-1 beat anything on the market by a wide margin.

Serial number 001 was &quot;lent&quot; to Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976, and that summer the first full system was sold to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) for $8.8 million. The company&#x27;s early estimates had suggested that they might sell a dozen such machines, based on sales of similar machines from the CDC era, so the price was set accordingly. Eventually, well over 80 Cray-1s were sold, the company was a huge success financially, and Cray&#x27;s innovations with super computers won him the nickname &quot;The Wizard of Chippewa Falls&quot;.

Follow-up success was not as easy. While he worked on the Cray-2, other teams delivered the two-processor Cray X-MP, which was another huge success and later the four-processor X-MP. When the Cray-2 was finally released after six years of development it was only marginally faster than the X-MP, largely due to very fast and large main memory, and thus it sold in much smaller numbers. The Cray-2 ran at 250 MHz with a very deep pipeline, making it harder to write code than for the shorter-pipe X-MP.

As the Cray-3 project started, he found himself once again being &quot;bothered&quot; too much with day-to-day tasks. In order to concentrate on design, Cray left the CEO position of Cray Research in 1980 to become an independent contractor. In 1988, he moved the Cray-3 project from Chippewa Falls to a laboratory in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In 1989, Cray was faced with a repeat of history when the Cray-3 started to run into difficulties. An upgrade of the X-MP using high-speed memory from the Cray-2 was under development and seemed to be making real progress, and once again management was faced with two projects and limited budgets. They eventually decided to take the safer route, releasing the new design as the Cray Y-MP.

===Cray Computer Corporation===

Cray decided to spin off the Colorado Springs laboratory to form Cray Computer Corporation. This new entity took the Cray-3 project with them.

The 500 MHz Cray-3 proved to be Cray&#x27;s second major failure. In order to provide the tenfold increase in performance that he always demanded of his newest machines, Cray decided that the machine would have to be built using gallium arsenide semiconductors. In the past Cray had always avoided using anything even near the state of the art, preferring to use well-known solutions and designing a fast machine based on them. In this case, Cray was developing every part of the machine, even the chips inside it.

Nevertheless, the team were able to get the machine working and delivered their first example to NCAR on 24 May 1993.

The machine was still essentially a prototype, and the company was using the installation to debug the design. By this time a number of massively parallel machines were coming into the market at price/performance ratios the Cray-3 could not touch. Cray responded through &quot;brute force&quot;, starting design of the Cray-4, which would run at 1 GHz and outpower these machines, regardless of price.

In 1995 there had been no further sales of the Cray-3, and the ending of the Cold War made it unlikely anyone would buy enough Cray-4s to offer a return on the development funds. The company ran out of money and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 24 March 1995.

===SRC Computers===
Cray had always resisted the massively parallel solution to high-speed computing, offering a variety of reasons that it would never work as well as one very fast processor. He famously quipped &quot;If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use: two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?&quot; By the mid-1990s, this argument was becoming increasingly difficult to justify, and modern compiler technology made developing programs on such machines not much more difficult than their simpler counterparts.

Cray set up a new company, SRC Computers, and started the design of his own massively parallel machine. The new design concentrated on communications and memory performance, the bottleneck that hampered many parallel designs. Design had just started when Cray was killed in a car accident. SRC Computers carried on development and specialized in reconfigurable computing.

===Technical approaches===
Cray frequently cited two important aspects to his design philosophy: remove heat, and ensure that all signals that are supposed to arrive somewhere at the same time do indeed arrive at the same time.

His computers were equipped with built-in cooling systems, extending ultimately to coolant channels cast into the mainframes and thermally coupled to metal plates within the circuit boards, and to systems immersed in coolants. In a story he told about himself, he realized early in his career that he should interlock the computers with the cooling systems so that the computers would not operate unless the cooling systems were operational. It did not originally occur to him to interlock in the other direction until a customer reported that localized power outages had shut down their computer, but left the cooling system running — so they arrived in the morning to find the machine encased in ice.

Cray addressed the problem of skew by ensuring that every signal path in his later computers was the same electrical length, so that values that were to be acted upon at a particular time were indeed all valid values. When required, he would run the traces back and forth on the circuit boards until the desired length was achieved, and he employed Maxwell&#x27;s equations in design of the boards to ensure that any radio frequency effects which altered the signal velocity and hence the electrical path length were accounted for.

When asked what kind of CAD tools he used to design computers, Cray said that he liked pads of 8″ × 11″ &quot;faintly-ruled -inch quadrille&quot; paper.

==Personal life==
Cray married Verene Voll in 1947. They had known each other since childhood. She was the daughter of a Methodist minister, as was Cray&#x27;s mother, and Verene worked as a nutritionist. They had three children. Cray and Voll divorced around 1978. He later married Geri M. Harrand. Cray was the grandfather of Andrew Cray, an LGBTQ rights activist.

Cray avoided publicity. There are a number of unusual tales about his life away from work, termed &quot;Rollwagenisms&quot;, from then-CEO of Cray Research, John A. Rollwagen. Cray enjoyed skiing, windsurfing, tennis, and other sports. Another favorite pastime was digging a tunnel under his home; he attributed the secret of his success to &quot;visits by elves&quot; while he worked in the tunnel: &quot;While I&#x27;m digging in the tunnel, the elves will often come to me with solutions to my problem.&quot;

One story has it that when Cray was asked by management to provide detailed one-year and five-year plans for his next machine, he simply wrote, &quot;Five-year goal: Build the biggest computer in the world. One year goal: One-fifth of the above.&quot; And another time, when expected to write a multi-page detailed status report for the company executives, Cray&#x27;s two-sentence report read: &quot;Activity is progressing satisfactorily as outlined under the June plan. There have been no significant changes or deviations from the June plan.&quot;

Cray was mortally wounded in a rollover accident caused by a reckless driver while Cray was merging his Jeep Cherokee onto Interstate 25, near the Air Force Academy in Colorado. Cray died of his injuries on October 5, 1996, two weeks after the accident and one week after his 71st birthday.

==Posthumous==
The IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award, established in late 1997, recognizes innovative contributions to high performance computing systems exemplifying Cray&#x27;s creative spirit.

<text>A signature block (often abbreviated as signature, sig block, sig file, .sig, dot sig, siggy, or just sig) is a personalized block of text automatically appended at the bottom of an email message, Usenet article, or forum post.

==Email and Usenet==
An email signature is a block of text appended to the end of an email message often containing the sender&#x27;s name, address, phone number, disclaimer or other contact information.

&quot;Traditional&quot; internet cultural .sig practices assume the use of monospaced ASCII text because they pre-date MIME and the use of HTML in email. In this tradition, it is common practice for a signature block to consist of one or more lines containing some brief information on the author of the message such as phone number and email address, URLs for sites owned or favoured by the author—but also often a quotation (occasionally automatically generated by such tools as fortune), or an ASCII art picture. 
Among some groups of people it has been common to include self-classification codes.

 / O \ ****************************
&quot;Example of a signature block using ASCII art.&quot;

Most email clients, including Mozilla Thunderbird, Opera Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, and Eudora, can be configured to automatically append an email signature with each new message. A shortened form of a signature block (sometimes called a &quot;signature line&quot;), only including one&#x27;s name, often with some distinguishing prefix, can be used to simply indicate the end of a post or response. Most email servers can be configured to append email signatures to all outgoing mail as well.

===Email signature generator===
An email signature generator is an app or an online web app that allows users to create a designed email signature using a pre-made template (with no need for HTML coding skills).

===Signatures in Usenet postings===
Signature blocks are also used in the Usenet discussion system.

===Email signatures in business===
Businesses often automatically append signature blocks to messages—or have policies mandating a certain style. Generally they resemble standard business cards in their content—and often in their presentation—with company logos and sometimes even the exact appearance of a business card. In some cases, a vCard is automatically attached.

In addition to these standard items, email disclaimers of various sorts are often automatically appended. These are typically couched in legal jargon, but it is unclear what weight they have in law, and they are routinely lampooned.

Business emails may also use some signature block elements mandated by local laws:
* Germany requires companies to disclose their company name, registration number, place of registration etc. in email signatures, in any business-related emails.
* Ireland&#x27;s Director of Corporate Enforcement requires all limited companies operating websites to disclose such information in their emails. 
* The UK&#x27;s ECommerce Regulations (reflecting EU law) require this information in all emails from limited companies. In England and Wales the case of Mehta v J Pereira Fernandes clarified that an email address header added to an email by the email application did not count as a signature for legal purposes, but 

While criticized by some as overly bureaucratic, these regulations only extend existing laws for paper business correspondence to email.

===Standard delimiter===
The Usenet news system standards say that a signature block is conventionally delimited from the body of the message by a single line consisting of exactly two hyphens, followed by a space, followed by the end of line (i.e., in C-notation: codice_1). This latter prescription goes by many names, including “dash dash space”, &quot;sig dashes&quot;, &quot;signature cut line&quot;, &quot;sig-marker&quot;, &quot;sig separator&quot; and &quot;signature delimiter&quot;. It allows software to automatically mark or remove the sig block as the receiver desires.
Most Usenet clients (including, for example, Mozilla Thunderbird) will recognize the signature block delimiter in a news article and will cut off the signature below it when inserting a quote of the original message into the composition window for a reply. Although the Usenet standards strictly apply only to Usenet news articles, this same delimiter convention is widely used in email messages as well, and email clients (such as K-9, Opera Mail, and Gmail commonly use it for recognition and special handling of signatures in email.

==Internet forums==

On web forums, the rules are often less strict on how a signature block is formatted, as Web browsers typically are not operated within the same constraints as text interface applications. Users will typically define their signature as part of their profile. Depending on the board&#x27;s capabilities, signatures may range from a simple line or two of text to an elaborately constructed HTML piece. Images are often allowed as well, including dynamically updated images usually hosted remotely and modified by a server-side script. In some cases avatars or hackergotchis take over some of the role of signatures.

==FidoNet==
With FidoNet, echomail and netmail software would often add an origin line at the end of a message. This would indicate the FidoNet address and name of the originating system (not the user). The user posting the message would generally not have any control over the origin line. However, single-line taglines, added under user control, would often contain a humorous or witty saying. Multi-line user signature blocks were rare.

However, a tearline standard for FidoNet was included in FTS-0004 and clarified in FSC-0068 as three dashes optionally followed by a space optionally followed by text.

<text>Semantics is the study of linguistic meaning. It examines what meaning is, how words get their meaning, and how the meaning of a complex expression depends on its parts. Part of this process involves the distinction between sense and reference. Sense is given by the ideas and concepts associated with an expression while reference is the object to which an expression points. Semantics contrasts with syntax, which studies the rules that dictate how to create grammatically correct sentences, and pragmatics, which investigates how people use language in communication.

Lexical semantics is the branch of semantics that studies word meaning. It examines whether words have one or several meanings and in what lexical relations they stand to one another. Phrasal semantics studies the meaning of sentences by exploring the phenomenon of compositionality or how new meanings can be created by arranging words. Formal semantics relies on logic and mathematics to provide precise frameworks of the relation between language and meaning. Cognitive semantics examines meaning from a psychological perspective and assumes a close relation between language ability and the conceptual structures used to understand the world. Other branches of semantics include conceptual semantics, computational semantics, and cultural semantics.

Theories of meaning are general explanations of the nature of meaning and how expressions are endowed with it. According to referential theories, the meaning of an expression is the part of reality to which it points. Ideational theories identify meaning with mental states like the ideas that an expression evokes in the minds of language users. According to causal theories, meaning is determined by causes and effects, which behaviorist semantics analyzes in terms of stimulus and response. Further theories of meaning include truth-conditional semantics, verificationist theories, the use theory, and inferentialist semantics.

The study of semantic phenomena began during antiquity but was not recognized as an independent field of inquiry until the 19th century. Semantics is relevant to the fields of formal logic, computer science, and psychology.

== Definition and related fields ==
Semantics is the study of meaning in languages. It is a systematic inquiry that examines what linguistic meaning is and how it arises. It investigates how expressions are built up from different layers of constituents, like morphemes, words, clauses, sentences, and texts, and how the meanings of the constituents affect one another. Semantics can focus on a specific language, like English, but in its widest sense, it investigates meaning structures relevant to all languages. As a descriptive discipline, it aims to determine how meaning works without prescribing what meaning people should associate with particular expressions. Some of its key questions are &quot;How do the meanings of words combine to create the meanings of sentences?&quot;, &quot;How do meanings relate to the minds of language users, and to the things words refer to?&quot;, and &quot;What is the connection between what a word means, and the contexts in which it is used?&quot;. The main disciplines engaged in semantics are linguistics, semiotics, and philosophy. Besides its meaning as a field of inquiry, semantics can also refer to theories within this field, like truth-conditional semantics, and to the meaning of particular expressions, like the semantics of the word &quot;fairy&quot;.

As a field of inquiry, semantics has both an internal and an external side. The internal side is interested in the connection between words and the mental phenomena they evoke, like ideas and conceptual representations. The external side examines how words refer to objects in the world and under what conditions a sentence is true.

Many related disciplines investigate language and meaning. Semantics contrasts with other subfields of linguistics focused on distinct aspects of language. Phonology studies the different types of sounds used in languages and how sounds are connected to form words while syntax examines the rules that dictate how to arrange words to create sentences. These divisions are reflected in the fact that it is possible to master some aspects of a language while lacking others, like when a person knows how to pronounce a word without knowing its meaning. As a subfield of semiotics, semantics has a more narrow focus on meaning in language while semiotics studies both linguistic and non-linguistic signs. Semiotics investigates additional topics like the meaning of non-verbal communication, conventional symbols, and natural signs independent of human interaction. Examples include nodding to signal agreement, stripes on a uniform signifying rank, and the presence of vultures indicating a nearby animal carcass.

Semantics further contrasts with pragmatics, which is interested in how people use language in communication. An expression like &quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about&quot; can mean many things depending on who says it and in what situation. Semantics is interested in the possible meanings of expressions: what they can and cannot mean in general. In this regard, it is sometimes defined as the study of context-independent meaning. Pragmatics examines which of these possible meanings is relevant in a particular case. In contrast to semantics, it is interested in actual performance rather than in the general linguistic competence underlying this performance. This includes the topic of additional meaning that can be inferred even though it is not literally expressed, like what it means if a speaker remains silent on a certain topic. A closely related distinction by the semiotician Charles W. Morris holds that semantics studies the relation between words and the world, pragmatics examines the relation between words and users, and syntax focuses on the relation between different words.

Semantics is related to etymology, which studies how words and their meanings changed in the course of history. Another connected field is hermeneutics, which is the art or science of interpretation and is concerned with the right methodology of interpreting text in general and scripture in particular. Metasemantics examines the metaphysical foundations of meaning and aims to explain where it comes from or how it arises.

The word &quot;semantics&quot; originated from the Ancient Greek adjective &#x27;, meaning &#x27;relating to signs&#x27;, which is a derivative of &#x27;, the noun for &#x27;sign&#x27;. It was initially used for medical symptoms and only later acquired its wider meaning regarding any type of sign, including linguistic signs. The word &quot;semantics&quot; entered the English language from the French term &quot;&quot;, which the linguist Michel Bréal first introduced at the end of the 19th century.

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning ===
Semantics studies meaning in language, which is limited to the meaning of linguistic expressions. It concerns how signs are interpreted and what information they contain. An example is the meaning of words provided in dictionary definitions by giving synonymous expressions or paraphrases, like defining the meaning of the term &quot;ram&quot; as &quot;adult male sheep&quot;. There are many forms of non-linguistic meaning that are not examined by semantics. Actions and policies can have meaning in relation to the goal they serve. Fields like religion and spirituality are interested in the meaning of life, which is about finding a purpose in life or the significance of existence in general.

Linguistic meaning can be analyzed on different levels. Word meaning is studied by lexical semantics and investigates the denotation of individual words. It is often related to concepts of entities, like how the word &quot;dog&quot; is associated with the concept of the four-legged domestic animal. Sentence meaning falls into the field of phrasal semantics and concerns the denotation of full sentences. It usually expresses a concept applying to a type of situation, as in the sentence &quot;the dog has ruined my blue skirt&quot;. The meaning of a sentence is often referred to as a proposition. Different sentences can express the same proposition, like the English sentence &quot;the tree is green&quot; and the German sentence . Utterance meaning is studied by pragmatics and is about the meaning of an expression on a particular occasion. Sentence meaning and utterance meaning come apart in cases where expressions are used in a non-literal way, as is often the case with irony.

Semantics is primarily interested in the public meaning that expressions have, like the meaning found in general dictionary definitions. Speaker meaning, by contrast, is the private or subjective meaning that individuals associate with expressions. It can diverge from the literal meaning, like when a person associates the word &quot;needle&quot; with pain or drugs.

=== Sense and reference ===
Meaning is often analyzed in terms of sense and reference, also referred to as intension and extension or connotation and denotation. The referent of an expression is the object to which the expression points. The sense of an expression is the way in which it refers to that object or how the object is interpreted. For example, the expressions &quot;morning star&quot; and &quot;evening star&quot; refer to the same planet, just like the expressions &quot;2 + 2&quot; and &quot;3 + 1&quot; refer to the same number. The meanings of these expressions differ not on the level of reference but on the level of sense. Sense is sometimes understood as a mental phenomenon that helps people identify the objects to which an expression refers. Some semanticists focus primarily on sense or primarily on reference in their analysis of meaning. To grasp the full meaning of an expression, it is usually necessary to understand both to what entities in the world it refers and how it describes them.

The distinction between sense and reference can explain identity statements, which can be used to show how two expressions with a different sense have the same referent. For instance, the sentence &quot;the morning star is the evening star&quot; is informative and people can learn something from it. The sentence &quot;the morning star is the morning star&quot;, by contrast, is an uninformative tautology since the expressions are identical not only on the level of reference but also on the level of sense.

=== Compositionality ===
Compositionality is a key aspect of how languages construct meaning. It is the idea that the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its parts. It is possible to understand the meaning of the sentence &quot;Zuzana owns a dog&quot; by understanding what the words &quot;Zuzana&quot;, &quot;owns&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;dog&quot; mean and how they are combined. In this regard, the meaning of complex expressions like sentences is different from word meaning since it is normally not possible to deduce what a word means by looking at its letters and one needs to consult a dictionary instead.

Compositionality is often used to explain how people can formulate and understand an almost infinite number of meanings even though the amount of words and cognitive resources is finite. Many sentences that people read are sentences that they have never seen before and they are nonetheless able to understand them.

When interpreted in a strong sense, the principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a complex expression is not just affected by its parts and how they are combined but fully determined this way. It is controversial whether this claim is correct or whether additional aspects influence meaning. For example, context may affect the meaning of expressions; idioms like &quot;kick the bucket&quot; carry figurative or non-literal meanings that are not directly reducible to the meanings of their parts.

=== Truth and truth conditions ===
Truth is a property of statements that accurately present the world and true statements are in accord with reality. Whether a statement is true usually depends on the relation between the statement and the rest of the world. The truth conditions of a statement are the way the world needs to be for the statement to be true. For example, it belongs to the truth conditions of the sentence &quot;it is raining outside&quot; that raindrops are falling from the sky. The sentence is true if it is used in a situation in which the truth conditions are fulfilled, i.e., if there is actually rain outside.

Truth conditions play a central role in semantics and some theories rely exclusively on truth conditions to analyze meaning. To understand a statement usually implies that one has an idea about the conditions under which it would be true. This can happen even if one does not know whether the conditions are fulfilled.

=== Semiotic triangle ===
The semiotic triangle, also called the triangle of meaning, is a model used to explain the relation between language, language users, and the world, represented in the model as &quot;Symbol&quot;, &quot;Thought or Reference&quot;, and &quot;Referent&quot;. The symbol is a linguistic signifier, either in its spoken or written form. The central idea of the model is that there is no direct relation between a linguistic expression and what it refers to, as was assumed by earlier dyadic models. This is expressed in the diagram by the dotted line between symbol and referent.

The model holds instead that the relation between the two is mediated through a third component. For example, the term &quot;apple&quot; stands for a type of fruit but there is no direct connection between this string of letters and the corresponding physical object. The relation is only established indirectly through the mind of the language user. When they see the symbol, it evokes a mental image or a concept, which establishes the connection to the physical object. This process is only possible if the language user learned the meaning of the symbol before. The meaning of a specific symbol is governed by the conventions of a particular language. The same symbol may refer to one object in one language, to another object in a different language, and to no object in another language.
=== Others ===
Many other concepts are used to describe semantic phenomena. The semantic role of an expression is the function it fulfills in a sentence. In the sentence &quot;the boy kicked the ball&quot;, the boy has the role of the agent who performs an action. The ball is the theme or patient of this action as something that does not act itself but is involved in or affected by the action. The same entity can be both agent and patient, like when someone cuts themselves. An entity has the semantic role of an instrument if it is used to perform the action, for instance, when cutting something with a knife then the knife is the instrument. For some sentences, no action is described but an experience takes place, like when a girl sees a bird. In this case, the girl has the role of the experiencer. Other common semantic roles are location, source, goal, beneficiary, and stimulus.

Lexical relations describe how words stand to one another. Two words are synonyms if they share the same or a very similar meaning, like &quot;car&quot; and &quot;automobile&quot; or &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;purchase&quot;. Antonyms have opposite meanings, such as the contrast between &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;dead&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;. One term is a hyponym of another term if the meaning of the first term is included in the meaning of the second term. For example, ant is a hyponym of insect. A prototype is a hyponym that has characteristic features of the type it belongs to. A robin is a prototype of a bird but a penguin is not. Two words with the same pronunciation are homophones like &quot;flour&quot; and &quot;flower&quot;, while two words with the same spelling are homonyms, like a bank of a river in contrast to a bank as a financial institution. Hyponymy is closely related to meronymy, which describes the relation between part and whole. For instance, &quot;wheel&quot; is a meronym of &quot;car&quot;. An expression is ambiguous if it has more than one possible meaning. In some cases, it is possible to disambiguate them to discern the intended meaning. The term &quot;polysemy&quot; is used if the different meanings are closely related to one another, like the meanings of the word &quot;head&quot;, which can refer to the topmost part of the human body or the top-ranking person in an organization.

The meaning of words can often be subdivided into meaning components called semantic features. The word &quot;horse&quot; has the semantic feature &quot;animate&quot; but lacks the semantic feature &quot;human&quot;. It may not always be possible to fully reconstruct the meaning of a word by identifying all its semantic features.

A semantic or lexical field is a group of words that are all related to the same activity or subject. For instance, the semantic field of cooking includes words like &quot;bake&quot;, &quot;boil&quot;, &quot;spice&quot;, and &quot;pan&quot;.

The context of an expression refers to the situation or circumstances in which it is used and includes time, location, speaker, and audience. It also encompasses other passages in a text that come before and after it. Context affects the meaning of various expressions, like the deictic expression &quot;here&quot; and the anaphoric expression &quot;she&quot;.

A syntactic environment is extensional or transparent if it is always possible to exchange expressions with the same reference without affecting the truth value of the sentence. For example, the environment of the sentence &quot;the number 8 is even&quot; is extensional because replacing the expression &quot;the number 8&quot; with &quot;the number of planets in the solar system&quot; does not change its truth value. For intensional or opaque contexts, this type of substitution is not always possible. For instance, the embedded clause in &quot;Paco believes that the number 8 is even&quot; is intensional since Paco may not know that the number of planets in the solar system is 8.

Semanticists commonly distinguish the language they study, called object language, from the language they use to express their findings, called metalanguage. When a professor uses Japanese to teach their student how to interpret the language of first-order logic then the language of first-order logic is the object language and Japanese is the metalanguage. The same language may occupy the role of object language and metalanguage at the same time. This is the case in monolingual English dictionaries, in which both the entry term belonging to the object language and the definition text belonging to the metalanguage are taken from the English language.

== Branches ==
=== Lexical semantics ===
Lexical semantics is the sub-field of semantics that studies word meaning. It examines semantic aspects of individual words and the vocabulary as a whole. This includes the study of lexical relations between words, such as whether two terms are synonyms or antonyms. Lexical semantics categorizes words based on semantic features they share and groups them into semantic fields unified by a common subject. This information is used to create taxonomies to organize lexical knowledge, for example, by distinguishing between physical and abstract entities and subdividing physical entities into stuff and individuated entities. Further topics of interest are polysemy, ambiguity, and vagueness.

Lexical semantics is sometimes divided into two complementary approaches: semasiology and onomasiology. Semasiology starts from words and examines what their meaning is. It is interested in whether words have one or several meanings and how those meanings are related to one another. Instead of going from word to meaning, onomasiology goes from meaning to word. It starts with a concept and examines what names this concept has or how it can be expressed in a particular language.

Some semanticists also include the study of lexical units other than words in the field of lexical semantics. Compound expressions like &quot;being under the weather&quot; have a non-literal meaning that acts as a unit and is not a direct function of its parts. Another topic concerns the meaning of morphemes that make up words, for instance, how negative prefixes like &quot;in-&quot; and &quot;dis-&quot; affect the meaning of the words they are part of, as in &quot;inanimate&quot; and &quot;dishonest&quot;.

=== Phrasal semantics ===
Phrasal semantics studies the meaning of sentences. It relies on the principle of compositionality to explore how the meaning of complex expressions arises from the combination of their parts. The different parts can be analyzed as subject, predicate, or argument. The subject of a sentence usually refers to a specific entity while the predicate describes a feature of the subject or an event in which the subject participates. Arguments provide additional information to complete the predicate. For example, in the sentence &quot;Mary hit the ball&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot; is the subject, &quot;hit&quot; is the predicate, and &quot;the ball&quot; is an argument. A more fine-grained categorization distinguishes between different semantic roles of words, such as agent, patient, theme, location, source, and goal.

Verbs usually function as predicates and often help to establish connections between different expressions to form a more complex meaning structure. In the expression &quot;Beethoven likes Schubert&quot;, the verb &quot;like&quot; connects a liker to the object of their liking. Other sentence parts modify meaning rather than form new connections. For instance, the adjective &quot;red&quot; modifies the color of another entity in the expression &quot;red car&quot;. A further compositional device is variable binding, which is used to determine the reference of a term. For example, the last part of the expression &quot;the woman who likes Beethoven&quot; specifies which woman is meant. Parse trees can be used to show the underlying hierarchy employed to combine the different parts. Various grammatical devices, like the gerund form, also contribute to meaning and are studied by grammatical semantics.

=== Formal semantics ===

Formal semantics uses formal tools from logic and mathematics to analyze meaning in natural languages. It aims to develop precise logical formalisms to clarify the relation between expressions and their denotation. One of its key tasks is to provide frameworks of how language represents the world, for example, using ontological models to show how linguistic expressions map to the entities of that model. A common idea is that words refer to individual objects or groups of objects while sentences relate to events and states. Sentences are mapped to a truth value based on whether their description of the world is in correspondence with its ontological model.

Formal semantics further examines how to use formal mechanisms to represent linguistic phenomena such as quantification, intensionality, noun phrases, plurals, mass terms, tense, and modality. Montague semantics is an early and influential theory in formal semantics that provides a detailed analysis of how the English language can be represented using mathematical logic. It relies on higher-order logic, lambda calculus, and type theory to show how meaning is created through the combination of expressions belonging to different syntactic categories.

Dynamic semantics is a subfield of formal semantics that focuses on how information grows over time. According to it, &quot;meaning is context change potential&quot;: the meaning of a sentence is not given by the information it contains but by the information change it brings about relative to a context.

=== Cognitive semantics ===


Cognitive semantics studies the problem of meaning from a psychological perspective or how the mind of the language user affects meaning. As a subdiscipline of cognitive linguistics, it sees language as a wide cognitive ability that is closely related to the conceptual structures used to understand and represent the world. Cognitive semanticists do not draw a sharp distinction between linguistic knowledge and knowledge of the world and see them instead as interrelated phenomena. They study how the interaction between language and human cognition affects the conceptual organization in very general domains like space, time, causation, and action. The contrast between profile and base is sometimes used to articulate the underlying knowledge structure. The profile of a linguistic expression is the aspect of the knowledge structure that it brings to the foreground while the base is the background that provides the context of this aspect without being at the center of attention. For example, the profile of the word &quot;hypotenuse&quot; is a straight line while the base is a right-angled triangle of which the hypotenuse forms a part.

Cognitive semantics further compares the conceptual patterns and linguistic typologies across languages and considers to what extent the cognitive conceptual structures of humans are universal or relative to their linguistic background. Another research topic concerns the psychological processes involved in the application of grammar. Other investigated phenomena include categorization, which is understood as a cognitive heuristic to avoid information overload by regarding different entities in the same way, and embodiment, which concerns how the language user&#x27;s bodily experience affects the meaning of expressions.

Frame semantics is an important subfield of cognitive semantics. Its central idea is that the meaning of terms cannot be understood in isolation from each other but needs to be analyzed on the background of the conceptual structures they depend on. These structures are made explicit in terms of semantic frames. For example, words like bride, groom, and honeymoon evoke in the mind the frame of marriage.

=== Others ===
Conceptual semantics shares with cognitive semantics the idea of studying linguistic meaning from a psychological perspective by examining how humans conceptualize and experience the world. It holds that meaning is not about the objects to which expressions refer but about the cognitive structure of human concepts that connect thought, perception, and action. Conceptual semantics differs from cognitive semantics by introducing a strict distinction between meaning and syntax and by relying on various formal devices to explore the relation between meaning and cognition.

Computational semantics examines how the meaning of natural language expressions can be represented and processed on computers. It often relies on the insights of formal semantics and applies them to problems that can be computationally solved. Some of its key problems include computing the meaning of complex expressions by analyzing their parts, handling ambiguity, vagueness, and context-dependence, and using the extracted information in automatic reasoning. It forms part of computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. Its applications include machine learning and machine translation.

Cultural semantics studies the relation between linguistic meaning and culture. It compares conceptual structures in different languages and is interested in how meanings evolve and change because of cultural phenomena associated with politics, religion, and customs. For example, address practices encode cultural values and social hierarchies, as in the difference of politeness of expressions like &#x27; and &#x27; in Spanish or &#x27; and &#x27; in German in contrast to English, which lacks these distinctions and uses the pronoun &quot;you&quot; in either case. Closely related fields are intercultural semantics, cross-cultural semantics, and comparative semantics.

Pragmatic semantics studies how the meaning of an expression is shaped by the situation in which it is used. It is based on the idea that communicative meaning is usually context-sensitive and depends on who participates in the exchange, what information they share, and what their intentions and background assumptions are. It focuses on communicative actions, of which linguistic expressions only form one part. Some theorists include these topics within the scope of semantics while others consider them part of the distinct discipline of pragmatics.

== Theories of meaning ==
Theories of meaning explain what meaning is, what meaning an expression has, and how the relation between expression and meaning is established.

=== Referential ===
Referential theories state that the meaning of an expression is the entity to which it points. The meaning of singular terms like names is the individual to which they refer. For example, the meaning of the name &quot;George Washington&quot; is the person with this name. General terms refer not to a single entity but to the set of objects to which this term applies. In this regard, the meaning of the term &quot;cat&quot; is the set of all cats. Similarly, verbs usually refer to classes of actions or events and adjectives refer to properties of individuals and events.

Simple referential theories face problems for meaningful expressions that have no clear referent. Names like &quot;Pegasus&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus&quot; have meaning even though they do not point to existing entities. Other difficulties concern cases in which different expressions are about the same entity. For instance, the expressions &quot;Roger Bannister&quot; and &quot;the first man to run a four-minute mile&quot; refer to the same person but do not mean exactly the same thing. This is particularly relevant when talking about beliefs since a person may understand both expressions without knowing that they point to the same entity. A further problem is given by expressions whose meaning depends on the context, like the deictic terms &quot;here&quot; and &quot;I&quot;.

To avoid these problems, referential theories often introduce additional devices. Some identify meaning not directly with objects but with functions that point to objects. This additional level has the advantage of taking the context of an expression into account since the same expression may point to one object in one context and to another object in a different context. For example, the reference of the word &quot;here&quot; depends on the location in which it is used. A closely related approach is possible world semantics, which allows expressions to refer not only to entities in the actual world but also to entities in other possible worlds. According to this view, expressions like &quot;the first man to run a four-minute mile&quot; refer to different persons in different worlds. This view can also be used to analyze sentences that talk about what is possible or what is necessary: possibility is what is true in some possible worlds while necessity is what is true in all possible worlds.

=== Ideational ===
Ideational theories, also called mentalist theories, are not primarily interested in the reference of expressions and instead explain meaning in terms of the mental states of language users. One historically influential approach articulated by John Locke holds that expressions stand for ideas in the speaker&#x27;s mind. According to this view, the meaning of the word &quot;dog&quot; is the idea that people have of dogs. Language is seen as a medium used to transfer ideas from the speaker to the audience. After having learned the same meaning of signs, the speaker can produce a sign that corresponds to the idea in their mind and the perception of this sign evokes the same idea in the mind of the audience.

A closely related theory focuses not directly on ideas but on intentions. This view is particularly associated with Paul Grice, who observed that people usually communicate to cause some reaction in their audience. He held that the meaning of an expression is given by the intended reaction. This means that communication is not just about decoding what the speaker literally said but requires an understanding of their intention or why they said it. For example, telling someone looking for petrol that &quot;there is a garage around the corner&quot; has the meaning that petrol can be obtained there because of the speaker&#x27;s intention to help. This goes beyond the literal meaning, which has no explicit connection to petrol.

=== Causal ===
Causal theories hold that the meaning of an expression depends on the causes and effects it has. According to behaviorist semantics, also referred to as stimulus-response theory, the meaning of an expression is given by the situation that prompts the speaker to use it and the response it provokes in the audience. For instance, the meaning of yelling &quot;Fire!&quot; is given by the presence of an uncontrolled fire and attempts to control it or seek safety. Behaviorist semantics relies on the idea that learning a language consists in adopting behavioral patterns in the form of stimulus-response pairs. One of its key motivations is to avoid private mental entities and define meaning instead in terms of publicly observable language behavior.

Another causal theory focuses on the meaning of names and holds that a naming event is required to establish the link between name and named entity. This naming event acts as a form of baptism that establishes the first link of a causal chain in which all subsequent uses of the name participate. According to this view, the name &quot;Plato&quot; refers to an ancient Greek philosopher because, at some point, he was originally named this way and people kept using this name to refer to him. This view was originally formulated by Saul Kripke to apply to names only but has been extended to cover other types of speech as well.

=== Others ===
Truth-conditional semantics analyzes the meaning of sentences in terms of their truth conditions. According to this view, to understand a sentence means to know what the world needs to be like for the sentence to be true. Truth conditions can themselves be expressed through possible worlds. For example, the sentence &quot;Hillary Clinton won the 2016 American presidential election&quot; is false in the actual world but there are some possible worlds in which it is true. The extension of a sentence can be interpreted as its truth value while its intension is the set of all possible worlds in which it is true. Truth-conditional semantics is closely related to verificationist theories, which introduce the additional idea that there should be some kind of verification procedure to assess whether a sentence is true. They state that the meaning of a sentence consists in the method to verify it or in the circumstances that justify it. For instance, scientific claims often make predictions, which can be used to confirm or disconfirm them using observation. According to verificationism, sentences that can neither be verified nor falsified are meaningless.

The use theory states that the meaning of an expression is given by the way it is utilized. This view was first introduced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who understood language as a collection of language games. The meaning of expressions depends on how they are used inside a game and the same expression may have different meanings in different games. Some versions of this theory identify meaning directly with patterns of regular use. Others focus on social norms and conventions by additionally taking into account whether a certain use is considered appropriate in a given society.

Inferentialist semantics, also called conceptual role semantics, holds that the meaning of an expression is given by the role it plays in the premises and conclusions of good inferences. For example, one can infer from &quot;x is a male sibling&quot; that &quot;x is a brother&quot; and one can infer from &quot;x is a brother&quot; that &quot;x has parents&quot;. According to inferentialist semantics, the meaning of the word &quot;brother&quot; is determined by these and all similar inferences that can be drawn.

== History ==
Semantics was established as an independent field of inquiry in the 19th century but the study of semantic phenomena began as early as the ancient period as part of philosophy and logic. In ancient Greece, Plato (427–347 BCE) explored the relation between names and things in his dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;. It considers the positions of naturalism, which holds that things have their name by nature, and conventionalism, which states that names are related to their referents by customs and conventions among language users. The book &quot;On Interpretation&quot; by Aristotle (384–322 BCE) introduced various conceptual distinctions that greatly influenced subsequent works in semantics. He developed an early form of the semantic triangle by holding that spoken and written words evoke mental concepts, which refer to external things by resembling them. For him, mental concepts are the same for all humans, unlike the conventional words they associate with those concepts. The Stoics incorporated many of the insights of their predecessors to develop a complex theory of language through the perspective of logic. They discerned different kinds of words by their semantic and syntactic roles, such as the contrast between names, common nouns, and verbs. They also discussed the difference between statements, commands, and prohibitions.

In ancient India, the orthodox school of Nyaya held that all names refer to real objects. It explored how words lead to an understanding of the thing meant and what consequence this relation has to the creation of knowledge. Philosophers of the orthodox school of Mīmāṃsā discussed the relation between the meanings of individual words and full sentences while considering which one is more basic. The book &quot;Vākyapadīya&quot; by Bhartṛhari (4th–5th century CE) distinguished between different types of words and considered how they can carry different meanings depending on how they are used. In ancient China, the Mohists argued that names play a key role in making distinctions to guide moral behavior. They inspired the School of Names, which explored the relation between names and entities while examining how names are required to identify and judge entities.

In the Middle Ages, Augustine of Hippo (354–430) developed a general conception of signs as entities that stand for other entities and convey them to the intellect. He was the first to introduce the distinction between natural and linguistic signs as different types belonging to a common genus. Boethius (480–528) wrote a translation of and various comments on Aristotle&#x27;s book &quot;On Interpretation&quot;, which popularized its main ideas and inspired reflections on semantic phenomena in the scholastic tradition. An innovation in the semantics of Peter Abelard (1079–1142) was his interest in propositions or the meaning of sentences in contrast to the focus on the meaning of individual words by many of his predecessors. He further explored the nature of universals, which he understood as mere semantic phenomena of common names caused by mental abstractions that do not refer to any entities. In the Arabic tradition, Ibn Faris (920–1004) identified meaning with the intention of the speaker while Abu Mansur al-Azhari (895–980) held that meaning resides directly in speech and needs to be extracted through interpretation.

An important topic towards the end of the Middle Ages was the distinction between categorematic and syncategorematic terms. Categorematic terms have an independent meaning and refer to some part of reality, like &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;Socrates&quot;. Syncategorematic terms lack independent meaning and fulfill other semantic functions, such as modifying or quantifying the meaning of other expressions, like the words &quot;some&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, and &quot;necessarily&quot;. An early version of the causal theory of meaning was proposed by Roger Bacon (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292), who held that things get names similar to how people get names through some kind of initial baptism. His ideas inspired the tradition of the speculative grammarians, who proposed that there are certain universal structures found in all languages. They arrived at this conclusion by drawing an analogy between the modes of signification on the level of language, the modes of understanding on the level of mind, and the modes of being on the level of reality.

In the early modern period, Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) distinguished between marks, which people use privately to recall their own thoughts, and signs, which are used publicly to communicate their ideas to others. In their &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot;, Antoine Arnauld (1612–1694) and Pierre Nicole (1625–1695) developed an early precursor of the distinction between intension and extension. The &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; by John Locke (1632–1704) presented an influential version of the ideational theory of meaning, according to which words stand for ideas and help people communicate by transferring ideas from one mind to another. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) understood language as the mirror of thought and tried to conceive the outlines of a universal formal language to express scientific and philosophical truths. This attempt inspired theorists Christian Wolff (1679–1754), Georg Bernhard Bilfinger (1693–1750), and Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777) to develop the idea of a general science of sign systems. Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (1715–1780) accepted and further developed Leibniz&#x27;s idea of the linguistic nature of thought. Against Locke, he held that language is involved in the creation of ideas and is not merely a medium to communicate them.

In the 19th century, semantics emerged and solidified as an independent field of inquiry. Christian Karl Reisig (1792–1829) is sometimes credited as the father of semantics since he clarified its concept and scope while also making various contributions to its key ideas. Michel Bréal (1832–1915) followed him in providing a broad conception of the field, for which he coined the French term &quot;. John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) gave great importance to the role of names to refer to things. He distinguished between the connotation and denotation of names and held that propositions are formed by combining names. Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) conceived semiotics as a general theory of signs with several subdisciplines, which were later identified by Charles W. Morris (1901–1979) as syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics. In his pragmatist approach to semantics, Peirce held that the meaning of conceptions consists in the entirety of their practical consequences. The philosophy of Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) contributed to semantics on many different levels. Frege first introduced the distinction between sense and reference, and his development of predicate logic and the principle of compositionality formed the foundation of many subsequent developments in formal semantics. Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) explored meaning from a phenomenological perspective by considering the mental acts that endow expressions with meaning. He held that meaning always implies reference to an object and expressions that lack a referent, like &quot;green is or&quot;, are meaningless.

In the 20th century, Alfred Tarski (1901–1983) defined truth in formal languages through his semantic theory of truth, which was influential in the development of truth-conditional semantics by Donald Davidson (1917–2003). Tarski&#x27;s student Richard Montague (1930–1971) formulated a complex formal framework of the semantics of the English language, which was responsible for establishing formal semantics as a major area of research. According to structural semantics, which was inspired by the structuralist philosophy of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), language is a complex network of structural relations and the meanings of words are not fixed individually but depend on their position within this network. The theory of general semantics was developed by Alfred Korzybski (1879–1950) as an inquiry into how language represents reality and affects human thought. The contributions of George Lakoff (1941–present) and Ronald Langacker (1942–present) provided the foundation of cognitive semantics. Charles J. Fillmore (1929–2014) developed frame semantics as a major approach in this area. The closely related field of conceptual semantics was inaugurated by Ray Jackendoff (1945–present).

== In various disciplines ==
=== Logic ===
Logicians study correct reasoning and often develop formal languages to express arguments and assess their correctness. One part of this process is to provide a semantics for a formal language to precisely define what its terms mean. A semantics of a formal language is a set of rules, usually expressed as a mathematical function, that assigns meanings to formal language expressions. For example, the language of first-order logic uses lowercase letters for individual constants and uppercase letters for predicates. To express the sentence &quot;Bertie is a dog&quot;, the formula formula_1 can be used where formula_2 is an individual constant for Bertie and formula_3 is a predicate for dog. Classical model-theoretic semantics assigns meaning to these terms by defining an interpretation function that maps individual constants to specific objects and predicates to sets of objects or tuples. The function maps formula_2 to Bertie and formula_3 to the set of all dogs. This way, it is possible to calculate the truth value of the sentence: it is true if Bertie is a member of the set of dogs and false otherwise.

Formal logic aims to determine whether arguments are deductively valid, that is, whether the premises entail the conclusion. Entailment can be defined in terms of syntax or in terms of semantics. Syntactic entailment, expressed with the symbol formula_6, relies on rules of inference, which can be understood as procedures to transform premises and arrive at a conclusion. These procedures only take the logical form of the premises on the level of syntax into account and ignore what meaning they express. Semantic entailment, expressed with the symbol formula_7, looks at the meaning of the premises, in particular, at their truth value. A conclusion follows semantically from a set of premises if the truth of the premises ensures the truth of the conclusion, that is, if any semantic interpretation function that assigns the premises the value &quot;true&quot; also assigns the conclusion the value &quot;true&quot;.

=== Computer science ===
In computer science, the semantics of a program is how it behaves when a computer runs it. Semantics contrasts with syntax, which is the particular form in which instructions are expressed. The same behavior can usually be described with different forms of syntax. In JavaScript, this is the case for the commands codice_1 and codice_2, which are syntactically different expressions to increase the value of the variable &quot;i&quot; by one. This difference is also reflected in different programming languages since they rely on different syntax but can usually be employed to create programs with the same behavior on the semantic level.

Static semantics focuses on semantic aspects that affect the compilation of a program. In particular, it is concerned with detecting errors of syntactically correct programs, such as type errors, which arise when an operation receives an incompatible data type. This is the case, for instance, if a function performing a numerical calculation is given a string instead of a number as an argument. Dynamic semantics focuses on the run time behavior of programs, that is, what happens during the execution of instructions. The main approaches to dynamic semantics are denotational, axiomatic, and operational semantics. Denotational semantics relies on mathematical formalisms to describe the effects of each element of the code. Axiomatic semantics uses deductive logic to analyze which conditions must be in place before and after the execution of a program. Operational semantics interprets the execution of a program as a series of steps, each involving the transition from one state to another state.

=== Psychology ===

Psychological semantics examines psychological aspects of meaning. It is concerned with how meaning is represented on a cognitive level and what mental processes are involved in understanding and producing language. It further investigates how meaning interacts with other mental processes, such as the relation between language and perceptual experience. Other issues concern how people learn new words and relate them to familiar things and concepts, how they infer the meaning of compound expressions they have never heard before, how they resolve ambiguous expressions, and how semantic illusions lead them to misinterpret sentences.

One key topic is semantic memory, which is a form of general knowledge of meaning that includes the knowledge of language, concepts, and facts. It contrasts with episodic memory, which records events that a person experienced in their life. The comprehension of language relies on semantic memory and the information it carries about word meanings. According to a common view, word meanings are stored and processed in relation to their semantic features. The feature comparison model states that sentences like &quot;a robin is a bird&quot; are assessed on a psychological level by comparing the semantic features of the word &quot;robin&quot; with the semantic features of the word &quot;bird&quot;. The assessment process is fast if their semantic features are similar, which is the case if the example is a prototype of the general category. For atypical examples, as in the sentence &quot;a penguin is a bird&quot;, there is less overlap in the semantic features and the psychological process is significantly slower.

<text>A semantic network, or frame network is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices, which represent concepts, and edges, which represent semantic relations between concepts, mapping or connecting semantic fields. A semantic network may be instantiated as, for example, a graph database or a concept map. Typical standardized semantic networks are expressed as semantic triples.

Semantic networks are used in neurolinguistics and natural language processing applications such as semantic parsing and word-sense disambiguation. Semantic networks can also be used as a method to analyze large texts and identify the main themes and topics (e.g., of social media posts), to reveal biases (e.g., in news coverage), or even to map an entire research field.

== History ==
Examples of the use of semantic networks in logic, directed acyclic graphs as a mnemonic tool, dates back centuries, the earliest documented use being the Greek philosopher Porphyry&#x27;s commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s categories in the third century AD.

In computing history, &quot;Semantic Nets&quot; for the propositional calculus were first implemented for computers by Richard H. Richens of the Cambridge Language Research Unit in 1956 as an &quot;interlingua&quot; for machine translation of natural languages, although the importance of this work and the Cambridge Language Research Unit was only belatedly realized.

Semantic networks were also independently implemented by Robert F. Simmons and Sheldon Klein, using the first-order predicate calculus as a base, after being inspired by a demonstration of Victor Yngve. The &quot;line of research was originated by the first President of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Victor Yngve, who in 1960 had published descriptions of algorithms for using a phrase structure grammar to generate syntactically well-formed nonsense sentences. Sheldon Klein and I about 1962–1964 were fascinated by the technique and generalized it to a method for controlling the sense of what was generated by respecting the semantic dependencies of words as they occurred in text.&quot; Other researchers, most notably M. Ross Quillian and others at System Development Corporation helped contribute to their work in the early 1960s as part of the SYNTHEX project. It&#x27;s these publications at System Development Corporation that most modern derivatives of the term &quot;semantic network&quot; cite as their background. Later prominent works were done by Allan M. Collins and Quillian (e.g., Collins and Quillian; Collins and Loftus Quillian). Still later in 2006, Hermann Helbig fully described MultiNet.

In the late 1980s, two universities in the Netherlands, Groningen and Twente, jointly began a project called &quot;Knowledge Graphs&quot;, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph. In the subsequent decades, the distinction between semantic networks and knowledge graphs was blurred. In 2012, Google gave their knowledge graph the name Knowledge Graph.

The semantic link network was systematically studied as a semantic social networking method. Its basic model consists of semantic nodes, semantic links between nodes, and a semantic space that defines the semantics of nodes and links and reasoning rules on semantic links. The systematic theory and model was published in 2004. This research direction can trace to the definition of inheritance rules for efficient model retrieval in 1998 and the Active Document Framework ADF. Since 2003, research has developed toward social semantic networking. This work is a systematic innovation at the age of the World Wide Web and global social networking rather than an application or simple extension of the Semantic Net (Network). Its purpose and scope are different from that of the Semantic Net (or network). The rules for reasoning and evolution and automatic discovery of implicit links play an important role in the Semantic Link Network. Recently it has been developed to support Cyber-Physical-Social Intelligence. It was used for creating a general summarization method. The self-organised Semantic Link Network was integrated with a multi-dimensional category space to form a semantic space to support advanced applications with multi-dimensional abstractions and self-organised semantic links It has been verified that Semantic Link Network play an important role in understanding and representation through text summarisation applications. Semantic Link Network has been extended from cyberspace to cyber-physical-social space. Competition relation and symbiosis relation as well as their roles in evolving society were studied in the emerging topic: Cyber-Physical-Social Intelligence

More specialized forms of semantic networks has been created for specific use. For example, in 2008, Fawsy Bendeck&#x27;s PhD thesis formalized the Semantic Similarity Network (SSN) that contains specialized relationships and propagation algorithms to simplify the semantic similarity representation and calculations.

== Basics of semantic networks ==
A semantic network is used when one has knowledge that is best understood as a set of concepts that are related to one another.

Most semantic networks are cognitively based. They consist of arcs (spokes) and nodes (hubs) which can be organized into a taxonomic hierarchy. Different semantic networks can also be connected by bridge nodes. Semantic networks contributed to the ideas of spreading activation, inheritance, and nodes as proto-objects.

One process of constructing semantic networks, known also as co-occurrence networks, includes identifying keywords in the text, calculating the frequencies of co-occurrences, and analyzing the networks to find central words and clusters of themes in the network.

==In linguistics==
In the field of linguistics, semantic networks represent how the human mind handles associated concepts. Typically, concepts in a semantic network can have one of two different relationships: either semantic or associative. 

If semantic in relation, the two concepts are linked by any of the following semantic relationships: synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, metonymy, or polysemy. These are not the only semantic relationships, but some of the most common. 

If associative in relation, the two concepts are linked based on their frequency to occur together. These associations are accidental, meaning that nothing about their individual meanings requires them to be associated with one another, only that they typically are. Examples of this would be pig and farm, pig and trough, or pig and mud. While nothing about the meaning of pig forces it to be associated with farms, as pigs can be wild, the fact that pigs are so frequently found on farms creates an accidental associated relationship. These thematic relationships are common within semantic networks and are notable results in free association tests.

As the initial word is given, activation of the most closely related concepts begin, spreading outward to the lesser associated concepts. An example of this would be the initial word pig prompting mammal, then animal, and then breathes. This example shows that taxonomic relationships are inherent within semantic networks. The most closely related concepts typically share semantic features, which are determinants of semantic similarity scores. Words with higher similarity scores are more closely related, thus have higher probability of being a close word in the semantic network.

These relationships can be suggested into the brain through priming, where previous examples of the same relationship are shown before the target word is shown. The effect of priming on a semantic network linking can be seen through the speed of the reaction time to the word. Priming can help to reveal the structure of a semantic network and which words are most closely associated with the original word.

Disruption of a semantic network can lead to a semantic deficit (not to be confused with as semantic dementia).

===In the brain===
There exists physical manifestation of semantic relationships in the brain as well. Category-specific semantic circuits show that words belonging to different categories are processed in circuits differently located throughout the brain. For example, the semantic circuits for a word associated with the face or mouth (such as lick) is located in a different place of the brain than a word associated with the leg or foot (such as kick). This is a primary result of a 2013 study published by Friedemann Pulvermüller. These semantic circuits are directly tied to their sensorimotor areas of the brain. This is known as embodied semantics, a subtopic of embodied language processing.

If brain damage occurs, the normal processing of semantic networks could be disrupted, leading to preference into what kind of relationships dominate the semantic network in the mind.

== Examples ==

=== In Lisp ===
The following code shows an example of a semantic network in the Lisp programming language using an association list.

(setq *database*
&#x27;((canary (is-a bird)
 (color yellow)
 (size small))
 (penguin (is-a bird)
 (movement swim))
 (bird (is-a vertebrate)
 (has-part wings)
 (reproduction egg-laying))))
To extract all the information about the &quot;canary&quot; type, one would use the codice_1 function with a key of &quot;canary&quot;.

=== WordNet ===

An example of a semantic network is WordNet, a lexical database of English. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets, provides short, general definitions, and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets. Some of the most common semantic relations defined are meronymy (A is a meronym of B if A is part of B), holonymy (B is a holonym of A if B contains A), hyponymy (or troponymy) (A is subordinate of B; A is kind of B), hypernymy (A is superordinate of B), synonymy (A denotes the same as B) and antonymy (A denotes the opposite of B).

WordNet properties have been studied from a network theory perspective and compared to other semantic networks created from Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus and word association tasks. From this perspective the three of them are a small world structure.

=== Other examples ===
It is also possible to represent logical descriptions using semantic networks such as the existential graphs of Charles Sanders Peirce or the related conceptual graphs of John F. Sowa. These have expressive power equal to or exceeding standard first-order predicate logic. Unlike WordNet or other lexical or browsing networks, semantic networks using these representations can be used for reliable automated logical deduction. Some automated reasoners exploit the graph-theoretic features of the networks during processing.

Other examples of semantic networks are Gellish models. Gellish English with its Gellish English dictionary, is a formal language that is defined as a network of relations between concepts and names of concepts. Gellish English is a formal subset of natural English, just as Gellish Dutch is a formal subset of Dutch, whereas multiple languages share the same concepts. Other Gellish networks consist of knowledge models and information models that are expressed in the Gellish language. A Gellish network is a network of (binary) relations between things. Each relation in the network is an expression of a fact that is classified by a relation type. Each relation type itself is a concept that is defined in the Gellish language dictionary. Each related thing is either a concept or an individual thing that is classified by a concept. The definitions of concepts are created in the form of definition models (definition networks) that together form a Gellish Dictionary. A Gellish network can be documented in a Gellish database and is computer interpretable.

SciCrunch is a collaboratively edited knowledge base for scientific resources. It provides unambiguous identifiers (Research Resource IDentifiers or RRIDs) for software, lab tools etc. and it also provides options to create links between RRIDs and from communities.

Another example of semantic networks, based on category theory, is ologs. Here each type is an object, representing a set of things, and each arrow is a morphism, representing a function. Commutative diagrams also are prescribed to constrain the semantics.

In the social sciences people sometimes use the term semantic network to refer to co-occurrence networks. The basic idea is that words that co-occur in a unit of text, e.g. a sentence, are semantically related to one another. Ties based on co-occurrence can then be used to construct semantic networks. This process includes identifying keywords in the text, constructing co-occurrence networks, and analyzing the networks to find central words and clusters of themes in the network. It is a particularly useful method to analyze large text and big data.

== Software tools ==
There are also elaborate types of semantic networks connected with corresponding sets of software tools used for lexical knowledge engineering, like the Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS) of Stuart C. Shapiro or the MultiNet paradigm of Hermann Helbig, especially suited for the semantic representation of natural language expressions and used in several NLP applications.

Semantic networks are used in specialized information retrieval tasks, such as plagiarism detection. They provide information on hierarchical relations in order to employ semantic compression to reduce language diversity and enable the system to match word meanings, independently from sets of words used.

The Knowledge Graph proposed by Google in 2012 is actually an application of semantic network in search engine.

Modeling multi-relational data like semantic networks in low-dimensional spaces through forms of embedding has benefits in expressing entity relationships as well as extracting relations from mediums like text. There are many approaches to learning these embeddings, notably using Bayesian clustering frameworks or energy-based frameworks, and more recently, TransE (NeurIPS 2013). Applications of embedding knowledge base data include Social network analysis and Relationship extraction.

<text>The Stockholm Bloodbath () was a trial that led to a series of executions in Stockholm between 7 and 9 November 1520. The event is also known as the Stockholm massacre.

The events occurred after the coronation of Christian II as the new king of Sweden, when guests in the crowning party were invited to a meeting at Tre Kronor castle. Archbishop Gustav Trolle, demanding economic compensation for things such as the demolition of Almarestäket&#x27;s fortress, questioned whether the former Swedish regent Sten Sture the Younger and his supporters had been guilty of heresy. Supported by canon law, nearly 100 people were executed in the days following the meeting despite promises of amnesty. Among those killed were many people from the aristocracy who had been supporting the &quot;Sture Party&quot; in the previous years. Thereafter King Christian II became known in Sweden as (&quot;Christian [the] Tyrant&quot;).

==Background==

===Political factions in Sweden===
The Stockholm Bloodbath was a consequence of conflict between Swedish pro-unionists (in favour of the Kalmar Union, then dominated by Denmark) and anti-unionists (supporters of Swedish independence), and also between the anti-unionists and the Danish aristocracy, which in other aspects was opposed to King Christian. The anti-unionist party was headed by Sten Sture the Younger, and the pro-unionist party by the Archbishop Gustavus Trolle.

===Military interventions of King Christian===
King Christian, who had already taken measures to isolate Sweden politically, intervened to help Archbishop Trolle, who was under siege in his fortress at Stäket. However, he was defeated by Sture and his peasant soldiers at Vedila, and forced to return to Denmark. A second attempt to bring Sweden back under his control in 1518 was also countered by Sture&#x27;s victory at Brännkyrka. Eventually, a third attempt made in 1520 with a large army of French, German and Scottish mercenaries proved successful.

Sture was mortally wounded at the Battle of Bogesund on 19 January 1520. The Danish army, unopposed, was approaching Uppsala, where the members of the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates had already assembled. The senators agreed to render homage to Christian, on condition that he give a full amnesty for past actions and a guarantee that Sweden should be ruled according to Swedish laws and customs. A convention to this effect was confirmed by the king and the Danish Privy Council on 31 March. Sture&#x27;s widow, Lady Kristina, was still resisting in Stockholm with support from the peasants of central Sweden, and defeated the Danes at Balundsås on 19 March. Eventually, her forces were defeated at Uppsala () on Good Friday, 6 April.

In May, the Danish fleet, led by King Christian, arrived and Stockholm was attacked by land and sea. Lady Kristina resisted for four months longer, and in the beginning of autumn Kristina&#x27;s forces began winning. The inhabitants of Stockholm had a large supply of food and fared relatively well. Christian realized that his stockpile was dwindling and that it would doom his army to maintain the siege throughout the winter. With the help of Bishop Mattias, Hemming Gadh and other Swedes of high stature, Christian sent a proposal for retreat that was very advantageous for the Swedes. During a meeting on what is thought to be Beckholmen, outside of Djurgården, Christian swore that all acts against him would be forgotten, and gave pardon to several named persons (including Gustav Vasa, who had escaped from Denmark, where he had been held hostage). Lady Kristina would be given Hörningsholm and all Mörkön as a fief, and was also promised Tavastehus in Finland. When this had been written down on paper, the mayor of the city delivered the keys to the city on Södermalm and Christian held his grand entry. Shortly after, he sailed back to Denmark, to return in October for his coronation.

==Massacre==

On 4 November, Christian was anointed by Gustavus Trolle in Storkyrkan Cathedral and took the usual oath to rule the kingdom through native-born Swedes only. A banquet was held for the next three days. Lots of wine and beer was drunk and jokes were cracked between Danes and Swedes.

On the evening of 7 November, Christian summoned many Swedish leaders to a private conference at the palace. At dusk on 8 November, Danish soldiers, with lanterns and torches, entered a great hall of the royal palace and imprisoned several noble guests. Later in the evening, even more of the king&#x27;s guests were imprisoned. All these people had previously been marked down on Archbishop Trolle&#x27;s proscription list.

The following day, 9 November, a council, headed by Archbishop Trolle, sentenced the proscribed to death for being heretics; the main point of accusation was their having united in a pact to depose Trolle a few years earlier. However, many of them were also leading men of the Sture party and thus potential opponents of the Danish kings. At noon, the anti-unionist bishops of Skara and Strängnäs were led out into the great square and beheaded. Fourteen noblemen, three burgomasters, fourteen town councillors and about twenty common citizens of Stockholm were then hanged or beheaded.

The executions continued throughout the following day (10 November). According to the chief executioner, Jörgen Homuth, 82 people were executed. It has been claimed that Christian also took revenge on Sten Sture&#x27;s body, having it dug up and burnt, as well as the body of his child. Sture&#x27;s widow Lady Kristina and many other noblewomen were taken as prisoners to Denmark.

==Aftermath==
Christian justified the massacre in a proclamation to the Swedish people as a measure necessary to avoid a papal interdict, but, when apologising to the Pope for the decapitation of the bishops, he blamed his troops for performing unauthorised acts of vengeance.

Gustav Vasa was a son of Erik Johansson, one of the victims of the executions. Vasa, upon hearing of the massacre, travelled north to the province of Dalarna to seek support for a new revolt. The population, informed of what had happened, rallied to his side. They were ultimately able to defeat Christian&#x27;s forces in the Swedish War of Liberation. The massacre became the catalyst that permanently separated Sweden from Denmark.

==Later reception and propaganda==
The Stockholm Bloodbath precipitated a lengthy hostility towards Danes in Sweden, and from then on the two nations were almost continuously hostile toward each other. These hostilities, developing into a struggle for hegemony in the Scandinavian and North German area, lasted for nearly three hundred years. Memory of the Bloodbath served to let Swedes depict themselves (and often, actually regard themselves) as the wronged and aggrieved party, even when they were the ones who eventually took the political and military lead, such as the conquest and annexation of Scania until the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658.

===Christian the Tyrant and spurious &quot;Christian the Good&quot;===
The event earned Christian II the nickname of &quot;Kristian Tyrann&quot; (&quot;Christian [the] Tyrant&quot;) in Sweden, which is retained in the present day. It is a common misconception in Sweden that King Christian II is given the contrary byname (&quot;Christian the Good&quot;) in Denmark, but this is apocryphal.

According to Danish historians, no bynames have been given to Christian II in Danish historical tradition. In an interview with Gunnar Richardson in 1979, Danish historian Mikael Venge, author of the article about Christian II in &quot;Dansk Biografisk Leksikon &quot;said: &quot;I think you ought to protest the next time the Swedish radio claims anything so utterly unfounded that could be understood as if the Danes approved of the Stockholm bloodbath.&quot; Despite this, even today, tourist guides in Stockholm spice up their guiding of the Old Town (Gamla Stan) with the news about Christian II&#x27;s &quot;rehabilitation&quot; back in Denmark.

==In fiction==
The Stockholm Bloodbath has been depicted in several pieces of fiction:

* The event is depicted in the 1901 novel &quot;Kongens Fald&quot; (&quot;The Fall of the King&quot;), by Nobel Laureate Johannes V. Jensen.
* The bloodbath forms a large part of the 1948 historical novel &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (original title &quot;Mikael Karvajalka&quot;) by the Finnish writer Mika Waltari. The events are depicted as seen by Mikael Karvajalka, a young Finn in Stockholm at the time.
* A number of references to the Stockholm Bloodbath appear in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Book&quot; (1980) by American novelist John Gardner.
* A 2005 book &quot;Bruden fra Gent&quot; (translated in Nl. &quot;De Gentse Bruid&quot;, or &quot;The Bride From Ghent&quot;) by the Danish writer Dorrit Willumsen, referenced these events. It illuminates the life of Christian II as seen from his relationship with his mistress, the Dutch Dyveke, and his wife Isabella of Austria, sister of Charles the Fifth..
* The event is the subject of the 2023 film &quot;Stockholm Bloodbath&quot; directed by Mikael Håfström which depicts the events with dark comedy overtones.

<text>Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is the act and field of intelligence-gathering by interception of &quot;signals&quot;, whether communications between people (communications intelligence—abbreviated to COMINT) or from electronic signals not directly used in communication (electronic intelligence—abbreviated to ELINT). As classified and sensitive information is usually encrypted, signals intelligence may necessarily involve cryptanalysis (to decipher the messages). Traffic analysis—the study of who is signaling to whom and in what quantity—is also used to integrate information, and it may complement cryptanalysis.

==History==
===Origins===

Electronic interceptions appeared as early as 1900, during the Boer War of 1899–1902. The British Royal Navy had installed wireless sets produced by Marconi on board their ships in the late 1890s, and the British Army used some limited wireless signalling. The Boers captured some wireless sets and used them to make vital transmissions. Since the British were the only people transmitting at the time, the British did not need special interpretation of the signals that they were.

The birth of signals intelligence in a modern sense dates from the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. As the Russian fleet prepared for conflict with Japan in 1904, the British ship HMS &quot;Diana&quot; stationed in the Suez Canal intercepted Russian naval wireless signals being sent out for the mobilization of the fleet, for the first time in history.

===Development in World War I===

Over the course of the First World War, a new method of signals intelligence reached maturity. Russia’s failure to properly protect its communications fatally compromised the Russian Army’s advance early in World War I and led to their disastrous defeat by the Germans under Ludendorff and Hindenburg at the Battle of Tannenberg. In 1918, French intercept personnel captured a message written in the new ADFGVX cipher, which was cryptanalyzed by Georges Painvin. This gave the Allies advance warning of the German 1918 Spring Offensive.

The British in particular, built up great expertise in the newly emerging field of signals intelligence and codebreaking (synonymous with cryptanalysis). On the declaration of war, Britain cut all German undersea cables. This forced the Germans to communicate exclusively via either (A) a telegraph line that connected through the British network and thus could be tapped; or (B) through radio which the British could then intercept. Rear Admiral Henry Oliver appointed Sir Alfred Ewing to establish an interception and decryption service at the Admiralty; Room 40. An interception service known as &#x27;Y&#x27; service, together with the post office and Marconi stations, grew rapidly to the point where the British could intercept almost all official German messages.

The German fleet was in the habit each day of wirelessing the exact position of each ship and giving regular position reports when at sea. It was possible to build up a precise picture of the normal operation of the High Seas Fleet, to infer from the routes they chose where defensive minefields had been placed and where it was safe for ships to operate. Whenever a change to the normal pattern was seen, it immediately signalled that some operation was about to take place, and a warning could be given. Detailed information about submarine movements was also available.

The use of radio-receiving equipment to pinpoint the location of any single transmitter was also developed during the war. Captain H.J. Round, working for Marconi, began carrying out experiments with direction-finding radio equipment for the army in France in 1915. By May 1915, the Admiralty was able to track German submarines crossing the North Sea. Some of these stations also acted as &#x27;Y&#x27; stations to collect German messages, but a new section was created within Room 40 to plot the positions of ships from the directional reports.

Room 40 played an important role in several naval engagements during the war, notably in detecting major German sorties into the North Sea. The battle of Dogger Bank was won in no small part due to the intercepts that allowed the Navy to position its ships in the right place. It played a vital role in subsequent naval clashes, including at the Battle of Jutland as the British fleet was sent out to intercept them. The direction-finding capability allowed for the tracking and location of German ships, submarines, and Zeppelins. The system was so successful that by the end of the war, over 80 million words, comprising the totality of German wireless transmission over the course of the war, had been intercepted by the operators of the Y-stations and decrypted. However, its most astonishing success was in decrypting the Zimmermann Telegram, a telegram from the German Foreign Office sent via Washington to its ambassador Heinrich von Eckardt in Mexico.

With the importance of interception and decryption firmly established by the wartime experience, countries established permanent agencies dedicated to this task in the interwar period. In 1919, the British Cabinet&#x27;s Secret Service Committee, chaired by Lord Curzon, recommended that a peace-time codebreaking agency should be created. The Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) was the first peace-time codebreaking agency, with a public function &quot;to advise as to the security of codes and cyphers used by all Government departments and to assist in their provision&quot;, but also with a secret directive to &quot;study the methods of cypher communications used by foreign powers&quot;. GC&amp;CS officially formed on 1 November 1919, and produced its first decrypt on 19 October. By 1940, GC&amp;CS was working on the diplomatic codes and ciphers of 26 countries, tackling over 150 diplomatic cryptosystems.

The US Cipher Bureau was established in 1919 and achieved some success at the Washington Naval Conference in 1921, through cryptanalysis by Herbert Yardley. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson closed the US Cipher Bureau in 1929 with the words &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot;

===World War II===

The use of SIGINT had even greater implications during World War II. The combined effort of intercepts and cryptanalysis for the whole of the British forces in World War II came under the code name &quot;Ultra&quot;, managed from Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. Properly used, the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities which made Bletchley&#x27;s attacks feasible.

Bletchley&#x27;s work was essential to defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the North African desert campaign against German forces under General Erwin Rommel. General Sir Claude Auchinleck wrote that were it not for Ultra, &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;. Ultra decrypts featured prominently in the story of Operation SALAM, László Almásy&#x27;s mission across the desert behind Allied lines in 1942. Prior to the Normandy landings on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany&#x27;s fifty-eight Western Front divisions.

Winston Churchill was reported to have told King George VI: &quot;It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!&quot; Supreme Allied Commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, at the end of the war, described Ultra as having been &quot;decisive&quot; to Allied victory. Official historian of British Intelligence in World War II Sir Harry Hinsley argued that Ultra shortened the war &quot;by not less than two years and probably by four years&quot;; and that, in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.

At a lower level, German cryptanalysis, direction finding, and traffic analysis were vital to Rommel&#x27;s early successes in the Western Desert Campaign until British forces tightened their communications discipline and Australian raiders destroyed his principle SIGINT Company.
==Technical definitions==


The United States Department of Defense has defined the term &quot;signals intelligence&quot; as:
# A category of intelligence comprising either individually or in combination all communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), and foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT), however transmitted.
# Intelligence derived from communications, electronic, and foreign instrumentation signals.

Being a broad field, SIGINT has many sub-disciplines. The two main ones are communications intelligence (COMINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT).

==Disciplines shared across the branches==

===Targeting===
A collection system has to know to look for a particular signal. &quot;System&quot;, in this context, has several nuances. Targeting is the process of developing &quot;collection requirements&quot;:
:&quot;1. An intelligence need considered in the allocation of intelligence resources. Within the Department of Defense, these collection requirements fulfill the essential elements of information and other intelligence needs of a commander, or an agency.
:&quot;2. An established intelligence need, validated against the appropriate allocation of intelligence resources (as a requirement) to fulfill the essential elements of information and other intelligence needs of an intelligence consumer.&quot;

===Need for multiple, coordinated receivers===
First, atmospheric conditions, sunspots, the target&#x27;s transmission schedule and antenna characteristics, and other factors create uncertainty that a given signal intercept sensor will be able to &quot;hear&quot; the signal of interest, even with a geographically fixed target and an opponent making no attempt to evade interception. Basic countermeasures against interception include frequent changing of radio frequency, polarization, and other transmission characteristics. An intercept aircraft could not get off the ground if it had to carry antennas and receivers for every possible frequency and signal type to deal with such countermeasures.

Second, locating the transmitter&#x27;s position is usually part of SIGINT. Triangulation and more sophisticated radio location techniques, such as time of arrival methods, require multiple receiving points at different locations. These receivers send location-relevant information to a central point, or perhaps to a distributed system in which all participate, such that the information can be correlated and a location computed.

===Intercept management===
Modern SIGINT systems, therefore, have substantial communications among intercept platforms. Even if some platforms are clandestine, there is still a broadcast of information telling them where and how to look for signals. A United States targeting system under development in the late 1990s, PSTS, constantly sends out information that helps the interceptors properly aim their antennas and tune their receivers. Larger intercept aircraft, such as the EP-3 or RC-135, have the on-board capability to do some target analysis and planning, but others, such as the RC-12 GUARDRAIL, are completely under ground direction. GUARDRAIL aircraft are fairly small and usually work in units of three to cover a tactical SIGINT requirement, whereas the larger aircraft tend to be assigned strategic/national missions.

Before the detailed process of targeting begins, someone has to decide there is a value in collecting information about something. While it would be possible to direct signals intelligence collection at a major sports event, the systems would capture a great deal of noise, news signals, and perhaps announcements in the stadium. If, however, an anti-terrorist organization believed that a small group would be trying to coordinate their efforts using short-range unlicensed radios at the event, SIGINT targeting of radios of that type would be reasonable. Targeting would not know where in the stadium the radios might be located or the exact frequency they are using; those are the functions of subsequent steps such as signal detection and direction finding.

Once the decision to target is made, the various interception points need to cooperate, since resources are limited.

Knowing what interception equipment to use becomes easier when a target country buys its radars and radios from known manufacturers, or is given them as military aid. National intelligence services keep libraries of devices manufactured by their own country and others, and then use a variety of techniques to learn what equipment is acquired by a given country.

Knowledge of physics and electronic engineering further narrows the problem of what types of equipment might be in use. An intelligence aircraft flying well outside the borders of another country will listen for long-range search radars, not short-range fire control radars that would be used by a mobile air defense. Soldiers scouting the front lines of another army know that the other side will be using radios that must be portable and not have huge antennas.

===Signal detection===
Even if a signal is human communications (e.g., a radio), the intelligence collection specialists have to know it exists. If the targeting function described above learns that a country has a radar that operates in a certain frequency range, the first step is to use a sensitive receiver, with one or more antennas that listen in every direction, to find an area where such a radar is operating. Once the radar is known to be in the area, the next step is to find its location.

If operators know the probable frequencies of transmissions of interest, they may use a set of receivers, preset to the frequencies of interest. These are the frequency (horizontal axis) versus power (vertical axis) produced at the transmitter, before any filtering of signals that do not add to the information being transmitted. Received energy on a particular frequency may start a recorder, and alert a human to listen to the signals if they are intelligible (i.e., COMINT). If the frequency is not known, the operators may look for power on primary or sideband frequencies using a spectrum analyzer. Information from the spectrum analyzer is then used to tune receivers to signals of interest. For example, in this simplified spectrum, the actual information is at 800 kHz and 1.2 MHz.

Real-world transmitters and receivers usually are directional. In the figure to the left, assume that each display is connected to a spectrum analyzer connected to a directional antenna aimed in the indicated direction.

====Countermeasures to interception====
Spread-spectrum communications is an electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) technique to defeat looking for particular frequencies. Spectrum analysis can be used in a different ECCM way to identify frequencies not being jammed or not in use.

===Direction-finding===

The earliest, and still common, means of direction finding is to use directional antennas as goniometers, so that a line can be drawn from the receiver through the position of the signal of interest. (See HF/DF.) Knowing the compass bearing, from a single point, to the transmitter does not locate it. Where the bearings from multiple points, using goniometry, are plotted on a map, the transmitter will be located at the point where the bearings intersect. This is the simplest case; a target may try to confuse listeners by having multiple transmitters, giving the same signal from different locations, switching on and off in a pattern known to their user but apparently random to the listener.

Individual directional antennas have to be manually or automatically turned to find the signal direction, which may be too slow when the signal is of short duration. One alternative is the Wullenweber array technique. In this method, several concentric rings of antenna elements simultaneously receive the signal, so that the best bearing will ideally be clearly on a single antenna or a small set. Wullenweber arrays for high-frequency signals are enormous, referred to as &quot;elephant cages&quot; by their users.

A more advance approach is Amplitude comparison. An alternative to tunable directional antennas or large omnidirectional arrays such as the Wullenweber is to measure the time of arrival of the signal at multiple points, using GPS or a similar method to have precise time synchronization. Receivers can be on ground stations, ships, aircraft, or satellites, giving great flexibility. 

A more accurate approach is Interferometer. 

Modern anti-radiation missiles can home in on and attack transmitters; military antennas are rarely a safe distance from the user of the transmitter.

===Traffic analysis===

When locations are known, usage patterns may emerge, from which inferences may be drawn. Traffic analysis is the discipline of drawing patterns from information flow among a set of senders and receivers, whether those senders and receivers are designated by location determined through direction finding, by addressee and sender identifications in the message, or even MASINT techniques for &quot;fingerprinting&quot; transmitters or operators. Message content other than the sender and receiver is not necessary to do traffic analysis, although more information can be helpful.

For example, if a certain type of radio is known to be used only by tank units, even if the position is not precisely determined by direction finding, it may be assumed that a tank unit is in the general area of the signal. The owner of the transmitter can assume someone is listening, so might set up tank radios in an area where he wants the other side to believe he has actual tanks. As part of Operation Quicksilver, part of the deception plan for the invasion of Europe at the Battle of Normandy, radio transmissions simulated the headquarters and subordinate units of the fictitious First United States Army Group (FUSAG), commanded by George S. Patton, to make the German defense think that the main invasion was to come at another location. In like manner, fake radio transmissions from Japanese aircraft carriers, before the Battle of Pearl Harbor, were made from Japanese local waters, while the attacking ships moved under strict radio silence.

Traffic analysis need not focus on human communications. For example, a sequence of a radar signal, followed by an exchange of targeting data and a confirmation, followed by observation of artillery fire, may identify an automated counterbattery fire system. A radio signal that triggers navigational beacons could be a radio landing aid for an airstrip or helicopter pad that is intended to be low-profile.

Patterns do emerge. A radio signal with certain characteristics, originating from a fixed headquarters, may strongly suggest that a particular unit will soon move out of its regular base. The contents of the message need not be known to infer the movement.

There is an art as well as science of traffic analysis. Expert analysts develop a sense for what is real and what is deceptive. Harry Kidder, for example, was one of the star cryptanalysts of World War II, a star hidden behind the secret curtain of SIGINT.

===Electronic order of battle===
Generating an electronic order of battle (EOB) requires identifying SIGINT emitters in an area of interest, determining their geographic location or range of mobility, characterizing their signals, and, where possible, determining their role in the broader organizational order of battle. EOB covers both COMINT and ELINT. The Defense Intelligence Agency maintains an EOB by location. The Joint Spectrum Center (JSC) of the Defense Information Systems Agency supplements this location database with five more technical databases:
:# FRRS: Frequency Resource Record System
:# BEI: Background Environment Information
:# SCS: Spectrum Certification System
:# EC/S: Equipment Characteristics/Space
:# TACDB: platform lists, sorted by nomenclature, which contain links to the C-E equipment complement of each platform, with links to the parametric data for each piece of equipment, military unit lists and their subordinate units with equipment used by each unit.
For example, several voice transmitters might be identified as the command net (i.e., top commander and direct reports) in a tank battalion or tank-heavy task force. Another set of transmitters might identify the logistic net for that same unit. An inventory of ELINT sources might identify the medium- and long-range counter-artillery radars in a given area.

Signals intelligence units will identify changes in the EOB, which might indicate enemy unit movement, changes in command relationships, and increases or decreases in capability.

Using the COMINT gathering method enables the intelligence officer to produce an electronic order of battle by traffic analysis and content analysis among several enemy units. For example, if the following messages were intercepted:
:# U1 to U2, requesting permission to proceed to checkpoint X.
:# U2 to U1, approved. please report at arrival.
:# (20 minutes later) U1 to U2, all vehicles have arrived to checkpoint X.

This sequence shows that there are two units in the battlefield, unit 1 is mobile, while unit 2 is in a higher hierarchical level, perhaps a command post. One can also understand that unit 1 moved from one point to another which are distant from each 20 minutes with a vehicle. If these are regular reports over a period of time, they might reveal a patrol pattern. Direction-finding and radio frequency MASINT could help confirm that the traffic is not deception.

The EOB buildup process is divided as following:
:* Signal separation
:* Measurements optimization
:* Data fusion
:* Networks build-up

Separation of the intercepted spectrum and the signals intercepted from each sensor must take place in an extremely small period of time, in order to separate the different signals to different transmitters in the battlefield. The complexity of the separation process depends on the complexity of the transmission methods (e.g., hopping or time-division multiple access (TDMA)).

By gathering and clustering data from each sensor, the measurements of the direction of signals can be optimized and get much more accurate than the basic measurements of a standard direction finding sensor. By calculating larger samples of the sensor&#x27;s output data in near real-time, together with historical information of signals, better results are achieved.

Data fusion correlates data samples from different frequencies from the same sensor, &quot;same&quot; being confirmed by direction finding or radiofrequency MASINT. If an emitter is mobile, direction finding, other than discovering a repetitive pattern of movement, is of limited value in determining if a sensor is unique. MASINT then becomes more informative, as individual transmitters and antennas may have unique side lobes, unintentional radiation, pulse timing, etc.

Network build-up, or analysis of emitters (communication transmitters) in a target region over a sufficient period of time, enables creation of the communications flows of a battlefield.

==Communications intelligence==
COMINT (communications intelligence) is a sub-category of signals intelligence that engages in dealing with messages or voice information derived from the interception of foreign communications. COMINT is commonly referred to as SIGINT, which can cause confusion when talking about the broader intelligence disciplines. The US Joint Chiefs of Staff defines it as &quot;Technical information and intelligence derived from foreign communications by other than the intended recipients&quot;.

COMINT, which is defined to be communications among people, will reveal some or all of the following:

# Who is transmitting
# Where they are located, and, if the transmitter is moving, the report may give a plot of the signal against location
# If known, the organizational function of the transmitter
# The time and duration of transmission, and the schedule if it is a periodic transmission
# The frequencies and other technical characteristics of their transmission
# If the transmission is encrypted or not, and if it can be decrypted. If it is possible to intercept either an originally transmitted cleartext or obtain it through cryptanalysis, the language of the communication and a translation (when needed).
# The addresses, if the signal is not a general broadcast and if addresses are retrievable from the message. These stations may also be COMINT (e.g., a confirmation of the message or a response message), ELINT (e.g., a navigation beacon being activated) or both. Rather than, or in addition to, an address or other identifier, there may be information on the location and signal characteristics of the responder.

===Voice interception===
A basic COMINT technique is to listen for voice communications, usually over radio but possibly &quot;leaking&quot; from telephones or from wiretaps. If the voice communications are encrypted, traffic analysis may still give information.

In the Second World War, for security the United States used Native American volunteer communicators known as code talkers, who used languages such as Navajo, Comanche and Choctaw, which would be understood by few people, even in the U.S. Even within these uncommon languages, the code talkers used specialized codes, so a &quot;butterfly&quot; might be a specific Japanese aircraft. British forces made limited use of Welsh speakers for the same reason.

While modern electronic encryption does away with the need for armies to use obscure languages, it is likely that some groups might use rare dialects that few outside their ethnic group would understand.

===Text interception===
Morse code interception was once very important, but Morse code telegraphy is now obsolete in the western world, although possibly used by special operations forces. Such forces, however, now have portable cryptographic equipment.

Specialists scan radio frequencies for character sequences (e.g., electronic mail) and fax.

===Signaling channel interception===
A given digital communications link can carry thousands or millions of voice communications, especially in developed countries. Without addressing the legality of such actions, the problem of identifying which channel contains which conversation becomes much simpler when the first thing intercepted is the &quot;signaling channel&quot; that carries information to set up telephone calls. In civilian and many military use, this channel will carry messages in Signaling System 7 protocols.

Retrospective analysis of telephone calls can be made from Call detail record (CDR) used for billing the calls.

===Monitoring friendly communications===
More a part of communications security than true intelligence collection, SIGINT units still may have the responsibility of monitoring one&#x27;s own communications or other electronic emissions, to avoid providing intelligence to the enemy. For example, a security monitor may hear an individual transmitting inappropriate information over an unencrypted radio network, or simply one that is not authorized for the type of information being given. If immediately calling attention to the violation would not create an even greater security risk, the monitor will call out one of the BEADWINDOW codes used by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other nations working under their procedures. Standard BEADWINDOW codes (e.g., &quot;BEADWINDOW 2&quot;) include:

# Position: (e.g., disclosing, in an insecure or inappropriate way), &quot;Friendly or enemy position, movement or intended movement, position, course, speed, altitude or destination or any air, sea or ground element, unit or force.&quot;
# Capabilities: &quot;Friendly or enemy capabilities or limitations. Force compositions or significant casualties to special equipment, weapons systems, sensors, units or personnel. Percentages of fuel or ammunition remaining.&quot;
# Operations: &quot;Friendly or enemy operation – intentions progress, or results. Operational or logistic intentions; mission participants flying programmes; mission situation reports; results of friendly or enemy operations; assault objectives.&quot;
# Electronic warfare (EW): &quot;Friendly or enemy electronic warfare (EW) or emanations control (EMCON) intentions, progress, or results. Intention to employ electronic countermeasures (ECM); results of friendly or enemy ECM; ECM objectives; results of friendly or enemy electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM); results of electronic support measures/tactical SIGINT (ESM); present or intended EMCON policy; equipment affected by EMCON policy.&quot;
# Friendly or enemy key personnel: &quot;Movement or identity of friendly or enemy officers, visitors, commanders; movement of key maintenance personnel indicating equipment limitations.&quot;
# Communications security (COMSEC): &quot;Friendly or enemy COMSEC breaches. Linkage of codes or codewords with plain language; compromise of changing frequencies or linkage with line number/circuit designators; linkage of changing call signs with previous call signs or units; compromise of encrypted/classified call signs; incorrect authentication procedure.&quot;
# Wrong circuit: &quot;Inappropriate transmission. Information requested, transmitted or about to be transmitted which should not be passed on the subject circuit because it either requires greater security protection or it is not appropriate to the purpose for which the circuit is provided.&quot;
# Other codes as appropriate for the situation may be defined by the commander.

In WWII, for example, the Japanese Navy, by poor practice, identified a key person&#x27;s movement over a low-security cryptosystem. This made possible Operation Vengeance, the interception and death of the Combined Fleet commander, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.

==Electronic signals intelligence==
Electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) refers to intelligence-gathering by use of electronic sensors. Its primary focus lies on non-communications signals intelligence. The Joint Chiefs of Staff define it as &quot;Technical and geolocation intelligence derived from foreign noncommunications electromagnetic radiations emanating from sources other than nuclear detonations or radioactive sources.&quot;

Signal identification is performed by analyzing the collected parameters of a specific signal, and either matching it to known criteria, or recording it as a possible new emitter. ELINT data are usually highly classified, and are protected as such.

The data gathered are typically pertinent to the electronics of an opponent&#x27;s defense network, especially the electronic parts such as radars, surface-to-air missile systems, aircraft, etc. ELINT can be used to detect ships and aircraft by their radar and other electromagnetic radiation; commanders have to make choices between not using radar (EMCON), intermittently using it, or using it and expecting to avoid defenses. ELINT can be collected from ground stations near the opponent&#x27;s territory, ships off their coast, aircraft near or in their airspace, or by satellite.

===Complementary relationship to COMINT===
Combining other sources of information and ELINT allows traffic analysis to be performed on electronic emissions which contain human encoded messages. The method of analysis differs from SIGINT in that any human encoded message which is in the electronic transmission is not analyzed during ELINT. What is of interest is the type of electronic transmission and its location. For example, during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II, Ultra COMINT was not always available because Bletchley Park was not always able to read the U-boat Enigma traffic. But high-frequency direction finding (&quot;huff-duff&quot;) was still able to detect U-boats by analysis of radio transmissions and the positions through triangulation from the direction located by two or more huff-duff systems. The Admiralty was able to use this information to plot courses which took convoys away from high concentrations of U-boats.

Other ELINT disciplines include intercepting and analyzing enemy weapons control signals, or the identification, friend or foe responses from transponders in aircraft used to distinguish enemy craft from friendly ones.

===Role in air warfare===
A very common area of ELINT is intercepting radars and learning their locations and operating procedures. Attacking forces may be able to avoid the coverage of certain radars, or, knowing their characteristics, electronic warfare units may jam radars or send them deceptive signals. Confusing a radar electronically is called a &quot;soft kill&quot;, but military units will also send specialized missiles at radars, or bomb them, to get a &quot;hard kill&quot;. Some modern air-to-air missiles also have radar homing guidance systems, particularly for use against large airborne radars.

Knowing where each surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery system is and its type means that air raids can be plotted to avoid the most heavily defended areas and to fly on a flight profile which will give the aircraft the best chance of evading ground fire and fighter patrols. It also allows for the jamming or spoofing of the enemy&#x27;s defense network (see electronic warfare). Good electronic intelligence can be very important to stealth operations; stealth aircraft are not totally undetectable and need to know which areas to avoid. Similarly, conventional aircraft need to know where fixed or semi-mobile air defense systems are so that they can shut them down or fly around them.

===ELINT and ESM===
Electronic support measures (ESM) or electronic surveillance measures are ELINT techniques using various &quot;electronic surveillance systems&quot;, but the term is used in the specific context of tactical warfare. ESM give the information needed for electronic attack (EA) such as jamming, or directional bearings (compass angle) to a target in &quot;signals intercept&quot; such as in the huff-duff radio direction finding (RDF) systems so critically important during the World War II Battle of the Atlantic. After WWII, the RDF, originally applied only in communications, was broadened into systems to also take in ELINT from radar bandwidths and lower frequency communications systems, giving birth to a family of NATO ESM systems, such as the shipboard US AN/WLR-1—AN/WLR-6 systems and comparable airborne units. EA is also called electronic counter-measures (ECM). ESM provides information needed for electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM), such as understanding a spoofing or jamming mode so one can change one&#x27;s radar characteristics to avoid them.

===ELINT for meaconing===
Meaconing is the combined intelligence and electronic warfare of learning the characteristics of enemy navigation aids, such as radio beacons, and retransmitting them with incorrect information.

===Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence===

FISINT (Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence) is a sub-category of SIGINT, monitoring primarily non-human communication. Foreign instrumentation signals include (but not limited to) telemetry (TELINT), tracking systems, and video data links. TELINT is an important part of national means of technical verification for arms control.

===Counter-ELINT===
Still at the research level are techniques that can only be described as counter-ELINT, which would be part of a SEAD campaign. It may be informative to compare and contrast counter-ELINT with ECCM.

==SIGINT and MASINT comparison==

Signals intelligence and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) are closely, and sometimes confusingly, related.
The signals intelligence disciplines of communications and electronic intelligence focus on the information in those signals themselves, as with COMINT detecting the speech in a voice communication or ELINT measuring the frequency, pulse repetition rate, and other characteristics of a radar.

MASINT also works with collected signals, but is more of an analysis discipline. There are, however, unique MASINT sensors, typically working in different regions or domains of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared or magnetic fields. While NSA and other agencies have MASINT groups, the Central MASINT Office is in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).

Where COMINT and ELINT focus on the intentionally transmitted part of the signal, MASINT focuses on unintentionally transmitted information. For example, a given radar antenna will have sidelobes emanating from a direction other than that in which the main antenna is aimed. The RADINT (radar intelligence) discipline involves learning to recognize a radar both by its primary signal, captured by ELINT, and its sidelobes, perhaps captured by the main ELINT sensor, or, more likely, a sensor aimed at the sides of the radio antenna.

MASINT associated with COMINT might involve the detection of common background sounds expected with human voice communications. For example, if a given radio signal comes from a radio used in a tank, if the interceptor does not hear engine noise or higher voice frequency than the voice modulation usually uses, even though the voice conversation is meaningful, MASINT might suggest it is a deception, not coming from a real tank.

See HF/DF for a discussion of SIGINT-captured information with a MASINT flavor, such as determining the frequency to which a &quot;receiver&quot; is tuned, from detecting the frequency of the beat frequency oscillator of the superheterodyne receiver.

==Legality==
Since the invention of the radio, the international consensus has been that the radio-waves are no one&#x27;s property, and thus the interception itself is not illegal. There can, however, be national laws on who is allowed to collect, store, and process radio traffic, and for what purposes. Monitoring traffic in cables (i.e. telephone and Internet) is far more controversial, since it most of the time requires physical access to the cable and thereby violating ownership and expected privacy.

<text>The Semantic Web, sometimes known as Web 3.0 (not to be confused with Web3), is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.

To enable the encoding of semantics with the data, technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are used. These technologies are used to formally represent metadata. For example, ontology can describe concepts, relationships between entities, and categories of things. These embedded semantics offer significant advantages such as reasoning over data and operating with heterogeneous data sources.
These standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, fundamentally the RDF. According to the W3C, &quot;The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.&quot; The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content and information applications and systems.

==History==
The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data (or data web) that can be processed by machines—that is, one in which much of the meaning is machine-readable. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in library and information science, industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.

Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web in 1999 as follows:
The 2001 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article by Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web. In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: &quot;This simple idea…remains largely unrealized&quot;.
In 2013, more than four million Web domains (out of roughly 250 million total) contained Semantic Web markup.

== Example ==
In the following example, the text &quot;Paul Schuster was born in Dresden&quot; on a website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following HTML fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in RDFa-syntax using a schema.org vocabulary and a Wikidata ID:

&lt;div vocab=&quot;https://schema.org/&quot; typeof=&quot;Person&quot;&gt;
 &lt;span property=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Paul Schuster&lt;/span&gt; was born in
 &lt;span property=&quot;birthPlace&quot; typeof=&quot;Place&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&quot;&gt;
 &lt;span property=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Dresden&lt;/span&gt;.
 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The example defines the following five triples (shown in Turtle syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the &quot;subject&quot;) is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the &quot;predicate&quot;) the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the &quot;object&quot;) either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).

 _:a &lt;https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;https://schema.org/Person&gt; .
 _:a &lt;https://schema.org/name&gt; &quot;Paul Schuster&quot; .
 _:a &lt;https://schema.org/birthPlace&gt; &lt;https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; .
 &lt;https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; &lt;https://schema.org/itemtype&gt; &lt;https://schema.org/Place&gt; .
 &lt;https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; &lt;https://schema.org/name&gt; &quot;Dresden&quot; .
The triples result in the graph shown in the given figure.

One of the advantages of using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) is that they can be dereferenced using the HTTP protocol. According to the so-called Linked Open Data principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. , , ) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.

The second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing (green edge) and (blue edges).

Additionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly, edges can be automatically inferred: the triple

 _:a &lt;https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/Person&gt; .
from the original RDFa fragment and the triple

 &lt;https://schema.org/Person&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt; .
from the document at (green edge in the figure) allow to infer the following triple, given OWL semantics (red dashed line in the second Figure):

 _:a &lt;https://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt; .
== Background ==

The concept of the semantic network model was formed in the early 1960s by researchers such as the cognitive scientist Allan M. Collins, linguist Ross Quillian and psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages by inserting machine-readable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other. This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. The term &quot;Semantic Web&quot; was coined by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (&quot;W3C&quot;), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as &quot;a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines&quot;.

Many of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella. These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as microformats.

=== Limitations of HTML ===
Many files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into human-readable documents and machine-readable data. Documents like mail messages, reports, and brochures are read by humans. Data, such as calendars, address books, playlists, and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed, searched, and combined.

Currently, the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms. Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorize the content of web pages. In the examples below, the field names &quot;keywords&quot;, &quot;description&quot; and &quot;author&quot; are assigned values such as &quot;computing&quot;, and &quot;cheap widgets for sale&quot; and &quot;John Doe&quot;.
&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;computing, computer studies, computer&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Cheap widgets for sale&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;John Doe&quot; /&gt;
Because of this metadata tagging and categorization, other computer systems that want to access and share this data can easily identify the relevant values.

With HTML and a tool to render it (perhaps web browser software, perhaps another user agent), one can create and present a page that lists items for sale. The HTML of this catalog page can make simple, document-level assertions such as &quot;this document&#x27;s title is &#x27;Widget Superstore, but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that, for example, item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of €199, or that it is a consumer product. Rather, HTML can only say that the span of text &quot;X586172&quot; is something that should be positioned near &quot;Acme Gizmo&quot; and &quot;€199&quot;, etc. There is no way to say &quot;this is a catalog&quot; or even to establish that &quot;Acme Gizmo&quot; is a kind of title or that &quot;€199&quot; is a price. There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item, distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page.

Semantic HTML refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention, rather than specifying layout details directly. For example, the use of denoting &quot;emphasis&quot; rather than , which specifies italics. Layout details are left up to the browser, in combination with Cascading Style Sheets. But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices.

Microformats extend HTML syntax to create machine-readable semantic markup about objects including people, organizations, events and products. Similar initiatives include RDFa, Microdata and Schema.org.

=== Semantic Web solutions ===
The Semantic Web takes the solution further. It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data: Resource Description Framework (RDF), Web Ontology Language (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, can describe arbitrary things such as people, meetings, or airplane parts.

These technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents. Thus, content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Web-accessible databases, or as markup within documents (particularly, in Extensible HTML (XHTML) interspersed with XML, or, more often, purely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine-readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content, i.e., to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content. In this way, a machine can process knowledge itself, instead of text, using processes similar to human deductive reasoning and inference, thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.

An example of a tag that would be used in a non-semantic web page:

&lt;item&gt;blog&lt;/item&gt;
Encoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this:

&lt;item rdf:about=&quot;https://example.org/semantic-web/&quot;&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/item&gt;
Tim Berners-Lee calls the resulting network of Linked Data the Giant Global Graph, in contrast to the HTML-based World Wide Web. Berners-Lee posits that if the past was document sharing, the future is data sharing. His answer to the question of &quot;how&quot; provides three points of instruction. One, a URL should point to the data. Two, anyone accessing the URL should get data back. Three, relationships in the data should point to additional URLs with data.

==== Tags and identifiers ====
Tags, including hierarchical categories and tags that are collaboratively added and maintained (e.g. with folksonomies) can be considered part of, of potential use to or a step towards the semantic Web vision.

Unique identifiers, including hierarchical categories and collaboratively added ones, analysis tools and metadata, including tags, can be used to create forms of semantic webs – webs that are to a certain degree semantic. In particular, such has been used for structuring scientific research i.a. by research topics and scientific fields by the projects OpenAlex, Wikidata and Scholia which are under development and provide APIs, Web-pages, feeds and graphs for various semantic queries.

=== Web 3.0 ===
Tim Berners-Lee has described the Semantic Web as a component of Web 3.0.

&quot;Semantic Web&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;Web 3.0&quot;, though the definition of each term varies.

===Beyond Web 3.0===
The next generation of the Web is often termed Web 4.0, but its definition is not clear. According to some sources, it is a Web that involves artificial intelligence, the internet of things, pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing and the Web of Things among other concepts. According to the European Union, Web 4.0 is &quot;the expected fourth generation of the World Wide Web. Using advanced artificial and ambient intelligence, the internet of things, trusted blockchain transactions, virtual worlds and XR capabilities, digital and real objects and environments are fully integrated and communicate with each other, enabling truly intuitive, immersive experiences, seamlessly blending the physical and digital worlds&quot;.

== Challenges ==
Some of the challenges for the Semantic Web include vastness, vagueness, uncertainty, inconsistency, and deceit. Automated reasoning systems will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web.
* Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. The SNOMED CT medical terminology ontology alone contains 370,000 class names, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms. Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs.
* Vagueness: These are imprecise concepts like &quot;young&quot; or &quot;tall&quot;. This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts. Fuzzy logic is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness.
* Uncertainty: These are precise concepts with uncertain values. For example, a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability. Probabilistic reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty.
* Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined. Deductive reasoning fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency, because &quot;anything follows from a contradiction&quot;. Defeasible reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency.
* Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information. Cryptography techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat. By providing a means to determine the information&#x27;s integrity, including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information, however credibility issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit.

This list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive, and it focuses on the challenges to the &quot;unifying logic&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; layers of the Semantic Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web (URW3-XG) final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of &quot;uncertainty&quot;. Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for example to annotate conditional probabilities. This is an area of active research.

== Standards ==
Standardization for Semantic Web in the context of Web 3.0 is under the care of W3C.

=== Components ===
The term &quot;Semantic Web&quot; is often used more specifically to refer to the formats and technologies that enable it. The collection, structuring and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a formal description of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given knowledge domain. These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:
* Resource Description Framework (RDF), a general method for describing information
* RDF Schema (RDFS)
* Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)
* SPARQL, an RDF query language
* Notation3 (N3), designed with human readability in mind
* N-Triples, a format for storing and transmitting data
* Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)
* Web Ontology Language (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages
* Rule Interchange Format (RIF), a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web
* JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD), a JSON-based method to describe data
* ActivityPub, a generic way for client and server to communicate with each other. This is used by the popular decentralized social network Mastodon.

The Semantic Web Stack illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows:
* XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents, yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within. XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases, as alternative syntaxes exist, such as Turtle. Turtle is a de facto standard, but has not been through a formal standardization process.
* XML Schema is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents.
* RDF is a simple language for expressing data models, which refer to objects (&quot;web resources&quot;) and their relationships. An RDF-based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes, e.g., RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and RDFa. RDF is a fundamental standard of the Semantic Web.
* RDF Schema extends RDF and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF-based resources, with semantics for generalized-hierarchies of such properties and classes.
* OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality (e.g. &quot;exactly one&quot;), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes.
* SPARQL is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources.
* RIF is the W3C Rule Interchange Format. It is an XML language for expressing Web rules that computers can execute. RIF provides multiple versions, called dialects. It includes a RIF Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) and RIF Production Rules Dialect (RIF PRD).

=== Current state of standardization ===
Well-established standards:
* RDF - Resource Description Framework
* RDFS - Resource Description Framework Schema
* RIF - Rule Interchange Format
* SPARQL - &#x27;SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language&#x27;
* Unicode
* URI - Uniform Resource Identifier
* OWL - Web Ontology Language
* XML - Extensible Markup Language

Not yet fully realized:
* Unifying Logic and Proof layers
* SWRL - Semantic Web Rule Language

==Applications==
The intent is to enhance the usability and usefulness of the Web and its interconnected resources by creating semantic web services, such as:
* Servers that expose existing data systems using the RDF and SPARQL standards. Many converters to RDF exist from different applications. Relational databases are an important source. The semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation.
* Documents &quot;marked up&quot; with semantic information (an extension of the HTML tags used in today&#x27;s Web pages to supply information for Web search engines using web crawlers). This could be machine-understandable information about the human-understandable content of the document (such as the creator, title, description, etc.) or it could be purely metadata representing a set of facts (such as resources and services elsewhere on the site). Note that &quot;anything&quot; that can be identified with a &quot;Uniform Resource Identifier&quot; (URI) can be described, so the semantic web can reason about animals, people, places, ideas, etc. There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents; Microformat, RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. Semantic markup is often generated automatically, rather than manually.

* Common metadata vocabularies (ontologies) and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata (so that &quot;Author&quot; in the sense of &#x27;the Author of the page&#x27; will not be confused with &quot;Author&quot; in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review).
* Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data.
* Semantic translation. An alternative or complementary approach are improvements to contextual and semantic understanding of texts – these could be aided via Semantic Web methods so that only increasingly small numbers of mistranslations need to be corrected in manual or semi-automated post-editing.
* Web-based services (often with agents of their own) to supply information specifically to agents, for example, a Trust service that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or spamming.
* Semantic Web ideas are implemented in collaborative structured argument mapping sites where their relations are organized semantically, arguments can be mirrored (linked) to multiple places, reused (copied), rated, and changed as semantic distinct units. Ideas for such, or a more widely adopted &quot;World Wide Argument Web&quot;, go back to at least 2007 and have been implemented to some degree in Argüman and Kialo. Further steps towards semantic web services may include enabling &quot;Querying&quot;, argument search engines, and &quot;summarizing the contentious and agreed-upon points of a discussion&quot;.

Such services could be useful to public search engines, or could be used for knowledge management within an organization. Business applications include:
* Facilitating the integration of information from mixed sources 
* Dissolving ambiguities in corporate terminology
* Improving information retrieval thereby reducing information overload and increasing the refinement and precision of the data retrieved
* Identifying relevant information with respect to a given domain
* Providing decision making support

In a corporation, there is a closed group of users and the management is able to enforce company guidelines like the adoption of specific ontologies and use of semantic annotation. Compared to the public Semantic Web there are lesser requirements on scalability and the information circulating within a company can be more trusted in general; privacy is less of an issue outside of handling of customer data.

== Skeptical reactions ==
=== Practical feasibility ===
Critics question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the Semantic Web, pointing out both difficulties in setting it up and a lack of general-purpose usefulness that prevents the required effort from being invested. In a 2003 paper, Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge, compared to the authoring of traditional web hypertext:

According to Marshall and Shipman, the tacit and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the knowledge engineering problem, and limits the Semantic Web&#x27;s applicability to specific domains. A further issue that they point out are domain- or organization-specific ways to express knowledge, which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means. As it turns out, specialized communities and organizations for intra-company projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and less-specialized communities. The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the World-Wide Web.

Finally, Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of (Knowledge Navigator-style) intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web:

Cory Doctorow&#x27;s critique (&quot;metacrap&quot;) is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences. For example, people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadata&#x27;s veracity. This phenomenon was well known with metatags that fooled the Altavista ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages: the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation. Peter Gärdenfors and Timo Honkela point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics.

=== Censorship and privacy ===
Enthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding censorship and privacy. For instance, text-analyzing techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words, metaphors for instance, or by using images in place of words. An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information, as this information would be much easier for an automated content-blocking machine to understand. In addition, the issue has also been raised that, with the use of FOAF files and geolocation meta-data, there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog. Some of these concerns were addressed in the &quot;Policy Aware Web&quot; project and is an active research and development topic.

=== Doubling output formats ===
Another criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time-consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data: one for human viewing and one for machines. However, many web applications in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine-readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data. The development of microformats has been one reaction to this kind of criticism. Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets, such as Amazon&#x27;s Mechanical Turk.

Specifications such as eRDF and RDFa allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages. The GRDDL (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language) mechanism allows existing material (including microformats) to be automatically interpreted as RDF, so publishers only need to use a single format, such as HTML.

== Research activities on corporate applications ==
The first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis, founded in 2002. Results of their work include the RDF(S) based Corese search engine, and the application of semantic web technology in the realm of distributed artificial intelligence for knowledge management (e.g. ontologies and multi-agent systems for corporate semantic Web) and E-learning.

Since 2008, the Corporate Semantic Web research group, located at the Free University of Berlin, focuses on building blocks: Corporate Semantic Search, Corporate Semantic Collaboration, and Corporate Ontology Engineering.

Ontology engineering research includes the question of how to involve non-expert users in creating ontologies and semantically annotated content and for extracting explicit knowledge from the interaction of users within enterprises.

===Future of applications===
Tim O&#x27;Reilly, who coined the term Web 2.0, proposed a long-term vision of the Semantic Web as a web of data, where sophisticated applications are navigating and manipulating it. The data web transforms the World Wide Web from a distributed file system into a distributed database.

<doc id="29124" wikidata="Q1718019" url="?curid=29124" title="Soviet submarine K-219">
<text>K-219 was a Project 667A &quot;Navaga&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine (NATO reporting name Yankee I) of the Soviet Navy. It carried 16 R-27U liquid-fuel missiles powered by UDMH with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO). &quot;K-219&quot; was involved in what has become one of the most controversial submarine incidents during the Cold War on Friday 3 October 1986. The 15-year-old vessel, which was on an otherwise routine Cold War nuclear deterrence patrol in the North Atlantic northeast of Bermuda, suffered an explosion and fire in a missile tube. While underway, a submerged seal in a missile hatch cover failed, allowing high-pressure seawater to enter the missile tube and owing to the pressure differential ruptured the missile fuel tanks, allowing the missile&#x27;s liquid fuel to mix and ultimately combust. Though there was no official announcement, the Soviet Union claimed the leak was caused by a collision with the submarine .
Although &quot;Augusta&quot; was operating within the area, both the United States Navy and the commander of &quot;K-219&quot;, Captain Second Rank Igor Britanov, deny that a collision took place.

The incident was novelized in the book &quot;Hostile Waters&quot;, which reconstructed the incident from descriptions by the survivors, ships&#x27; logs, the official investigations, and participants both ashore and afloat from the Soviet and the American sides.

==Explosion==

Shortly after 0530 Moscow time, seawater leaking into silo six of &quot;K-219&quot; reacted with missile fuel, producing chlorine and nitrogen dioxide gases and sufficient heat to explosively decompose additional fuming nitric acid to produce more nitrogen dioxide gas. &quot;K-219&quot; weapons officer Alexander Petrachkov attempted to deal with this by disengaging the hatch cover and venting the missile tube to the sea. Shortly after 0532, an explosion occurred in the silo. &quot;K-219&quot; had previously experienced a similar event; one of her missile tubes was already disabled and welded shut, having been permanently sealed after an explosion caused by reaction between seawater leaking into the silo and missile fuel residue.

An article in &quot;Undersea Warfare&quot; by Captain First Rank, Igor Kurdin, Russian Navy – &quot;K-219&quot;″s previous XO (executive officer) – and Lieutenant Commander Wayne Grasdock, USN described the explosion occurrence as follows:

Two sailors were killed outright in the explosion, and a third died soon afterward from toxic gas poisoning. Through a breach in the hull, the vessel immediately started taking on seawater, quickly sinking from its original depth of 40 meters (130 ft) to eventually reaching a depth of over 300 meters (980 ft). Sealing all of the compartments and full engagement of the seawater pumps in the stricken compartments enabled the depth to be stabilized.

Up to 25 sailors were trapped in a sealed section, and it was only after a conference with his incident specialists that the Captain allowed the Chief Engineer to open the hatch and save the 25 lives. It could be seen from instruments that although the nuclear reactor should have automatically been shut down, it was not. Lt. Nikolai Belikov, one of the reactor control officers, entered the reactor compartment but ran out of oxygen after turning just one of the four rod assemblies on the first reactor. Twenty-year-old enlisted seaman Sergei Preminin then volunteered to shut down the reactor by following the instructions of the Chief Engineer. Working with a full-face gas mask, he successfully shut down the reactor. A large fire had developed within the compartment, raising the pressure. When Preminin tried to reach his comrades on the other side of a door, the pressure difference prevented him from opening it, and he died of asphyxiation in the reactor compartment. For his actions, Sergei Preminin was posthumously awarded the title &quot;Hero of the Russian Federation.&quot;

In a nuclear safe condition, and with sufficient stability to allow it to surface, Captain Britanov surfaced &quot;K-219&quot; on battery power alone. He was then ordered to have the ship towed by a Soviet freighter back to her home port of Gadzhiyevo, away. Although a towline was attached, towing attempts were unsuccessful, and after subsequent poison gas leaks into the final aft compartments and against orders, Britanov ordered the crew to evacuate onto the towing ship, but remained aboard &quot;K-219&quot; himself.

Displeased with Britanov&#x27;s inability to repair his submarine and continue his patrol, Moscow ordered Valery Pshenichny, &quot;K-219&quot; security officer, to assume command, transfer the surviving crew back to the submarine, and return to duty. Before those orders could be carried out the flooding reached a point beyond recovery and on 6 October 1986 the &quot;K-219&quot; sank to the bottom of the Hatteras Abyssal Plain at a depth of about 6,000 m (18,000 ft). Britanov abandoned ship shortly before the sinking. &quot;K-219&quot; full complement of nuclear weapons was lost along with the vessel.

=== Aftermath ===
Preminin was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Star for his bravery in securing the reactors. Britanov was charged with negligence, sabotage, and treason. He was never imprisoned, but waited for his trial in Sverdlovsk. On 30 May 1987, Defense Minister Sergey Sokolov was dismissed as a result of the Mathias Rust incident two days earlier, and replaced by Dmitry Yazov; the charges against Britanov were subsequently dismissed.

==In popular culture==
In 1997, the British BBC television film &quot;Hostile Waters&quot;, co-produced with HBO and starring Rutger Hauer, Martin Sheen, and Max von Sydow, was released in the United States by Warner Bros. It was based on the book by the same name, which claimed to describe the loss of &quot;K-219&quot;. In 2001, Captain Britanov filed suit, claiming Warner Bros. did not seek or get his permission to use his story or his character, and that the film did not portray the events accurately and made him look incompetent. After three years of hearing, the court ruled in Britanov&#x27;s favor. Russian media reported that the filmmaker paid a settlement totaling under $100,000.

After the release of the movie, the U.S. Navy issued the following statement regarding both the book and the movie:

An article on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s website posted by Captain 1st Rank (Ret.) Igor Kurdin (former XO of &quot;K-219&quot;) and Lieutenant Commander Wayne Grasdock denied any collision between &quot;K-219&quot; and &quot;Augusta&quot;. Captain Britanov also denies a collision, and he has stated that he was not asked to be a guest speaker at Russian functions, because he refuses to follow the Russian government&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;K-219&quot; incident.

In a BBC interview recorded in February 2013, Admiral of the Fleet Vladimir Chernavin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy at the time of the &quot;K-219&quot; incident, says the accident was caused by a malfunction in a missile tube, and makes no mention of a collision with an American submarine. The interview was conducted for the BBC2 series &quot;The Silent War&quot;.

<text>K-8 was a of the Soviet Northern Fleet that sank in the Bay of Biscay with her nuclear weapons on board on April 12, 1970. A fire on April 8 had disabled the submarine and it was being towed in rough seas. Fifty-two crewmen were killed attempting the salvage of the boat when it sank.

==Accidents==

===1960 loss of coolant===
On 13 October 1960, while operating in the Barents Sea, &quot;K-8&quot; suffered a ruptured steam generator tube, causing a loss-of-coolant accident. While the crew jury-rigged a system to supply emergency cooling water to the reactor, preventing a reactor core meltdown, large amounts of radioactive gas leaked out which contaminated the entire vessel. The gas radiation levels could not be determined because instrumentation could not measure such large scales. Three of the crew suffered visible radiation injuries, and many crewmen were exposed to doses of up to 1.8–2 Sv (180–200 rem).

===1970 Bay of Biscay fire===
During the large-scale &quot;Ocean-70&quot; naval exercise, &quot;K-8&quot; suffered fires in two compartments simultaneously on 8 April 1970. Due to short circuits that took place in III and VII compartments simultaneously at a depth of , a fire spread through the air-conditioning system. Both nuclear reactors were shut down.

The captain ordered his entire crew to abandon ship but was countermanded once a towing vessel arrived. Fifty-two crewmen, including the commander, Captain 2nd Rank Vsevolod Bessonov, re-boarded the surfaced submarine that was to be towed. This was the first loss of a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine, which sank in rough seas as it was being towed in the Bay of Biscay of the North Atlantic Ocean. Eight sailors had already died due to certain compartments being locked to prevent further flooding as well as the spread of the fire as soon as it was detected. All hands on board died due to carbon monoxide poisoning and the flooding of the surfaced submarine during 80 hours of damage control in stormy conditions. Seventy-three crewmen survived. &quot;K-8&quot; sank with four nuclear torpedoes out of total 24 on board to a depth of approximately northwest of Spain.

<text>K-19 was the first submarine of the Project 658 (Russian: проект-658, &quot;Projekt-658&quot;) class (NATO reporting name ), the first generation of Soviet nuclear submarines equipped with nuclear ballistic missiles, specifically the R-13 SLBM. The boat was hastily built by the Soviets in response to United States&#x27; developments in nuclear submarines as part of the arms race. Before she was launched, 10 civilian workers and a sailor died due to accidents and fires. After &quot;K-19&quot; was commissioned, the boat had multiple breakdowns and accidents, several of which threatened to sink the submarine.

On its initial voyage on 4 July 1961, &quot;K-19&quot; suffered a complete loss of coolant to one of its two reactors. A backup system included in the design was not installed, so the captain ordered members of the engineering crew to find a solution to avoid a nuclear meltdown. Sacrificing their own lives, the engineering crew jury-rigged a secondary coolant system and kept the reactor from a meltdown. Twenty-two crew members died during the following two years. The submarine experienced several other accidents, including two fires and a collision. The series of accidents inspired crew members to nickname the submarine &quot;Hiroshima&quot;.

== History ==

=== Background ===

In the late 1950s, the leaders of the Soviet Union were determined to catch up with the United States and began to build a nuclear submarine fleet. In practice, this meant that speed was prioritized over safety in the construction of vessels, which were then rushed through sea trials so they could be put into service. &quot;K-19&quot; suffered from poor workmanship and was accident-prone from the beginning. Many Soviet naval officers felt that the ships were not fit for combat, but no action was taken to prevent them from sailing. The crews aboard the first nuclear submarines of the Soviet fleet were provided with a very high quality standard of food including smoked fish, sausages, fine chocolates, and cheeses, unlike the standard fare given to the crews of other naval vessels.

==== Construction deaths ====

&quot;K-19&quot; was ordered by the Soviet Navy on 16 October 1957. Her keel was laid on 17 October 1958 at the naval yard in Severodvinsk. Several workers died building the submarine: two workers were killed when a fire broke out, and later six women gluing rubber lining to a water cistern were fatally poisoned by inhaling fumes. While missiles were being loaded, an electrician was crushed to death by a missile-tube cover, and an engineer fell between two compartments and died.

==== Gains unlucky reputation ====

The boat was launched and named on 8 April 1959. Breaking with tradition, a man (Captain 3rd Rank V. V. Panov of the 5th Urgent Unit) instead of a woman was chosen to smash the ceremonial champagne bottle across the ship&#x27;s stern. The bottle failed to break, instead sliding along the propellers and bouncing off the rubber-coated hull. This is traditionally viewed among sea crews as a sign that the ship is unlucky. Captain 1st Rank Nikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev was the first commander of the submarine. Vasily Arkhipov, who would later prevent the Cuban Missile Crisis from turning into nuclear war, was appointed as executive officer.

==== Early problems ====

In January 1960, confusion among the crew during a watch change led to improper operation of the reactor and a reactor-control rod was bent. The damage required the reactor to be dismantled for repairs. The officers on duty were removed and Captain Panov was demoted.

The submarine&#x27;s ensign was hoisted for the first time on 12 July 1960. The vessel underwent sea trials from 13 through 17 July 1960 and again from 12 August through 8 November 1960, travelling . The ship was considered completed on 12 November 1960. After surfacing from a full-power run, the crew discovered that most of the hull&#x27;s rubber coating had detached, and the entire surface of the boat had to be re-coated.

During a test dive to the maximum depth of , flooding was reported in the reactor compartment, and Captain Zateyev ordered the submarine to immediately surface, where the boat heeled over on her port side due to the water she had taken on. It was later determined that during construction the workers had failed to replace a gasket. In October 1960, the galley crew disposed of wood from equipment crates through the galley&#x27;s waste system, clogging it. This led to flooding of the ninth compartment, which filled one third full of water. In December 1960, a loss of coolant was caused by failure of the main circuit pump. Specialists called from Severodvinsk managed to complete repairs at sea within a week.

The boat was commissioned on 30 April 1961. The submarine had a total of 139 men aboard, including missile men, reactor officers, torpedo men, doctors, cooks, stewards, and several observing officers who were not part of the standard crew.

===Nuclear accident===

On 4 July 1961, under the command of Captain First Rank Nikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev, &quot;K-19&quot; was conducting exercises in the North Atlantic off the south-east coast of Greenland. At 04:15 local time the pressure in the starboard nuclear reactor&#x27;s cooling system dropped to zero. The reactor department crew found a major leak in the reactor coolant system, causing the coolant pumps to fail. The boat could not contact Moscow and request assistance because a separate accident had damaged the long-range radio system. The control rods were automatically inserted by the emergency SCRAM system, but the reactor temperature rose uncontrollably. Decay heat from fission products produced during normal operation eventually heated the reactor to .

Making a drastic decision, Zateyev ordered the engineering section to fabricate a new coolant system by cutting off an air vent valve and welding a water-supply pipe to it. This required men to work in high radiation for extended periods. The jury-rigged cooling water system successfully reduced the temperature in the reactor.

The accident released radioactive steam containing fission products that were drawn into the ship&#x27;s ventilation system and spread to other compartments of the ship. The entire crew was irradiated as was most of the ship and some of the ballistic missiles on board. All seven members of the engineering crew and their divisional officer died of radiation exposure within the next month. Fifteen more sailors died within the next two years.

Instead of continuing on the mission&#x27;s planned route, the captain decided to head south to meet diesel-powered submarines expected to be there. Worries about a potential crew mutiny prompted Zateyev to have all small arms thrown overboard except for five pistols distributed to his most trusted officers. A diesel submarine, , picked up &quot;K-19&quot;″s low-power distress transmissions and joined up with it.

American warships nearby had also heard the transmission and offered to help, but Zateyev, afraid of giving away Soviet military secrets to the West, refused and sailed to meet &quot;S-270&quot;. He evacuated the crew and had the boat towed to its home base.

Over the next two years, repair crews removed and replaced the damaged reactors. The repair process contaminated the nearby environment, in a zone within , and the repair crew. The Soviet Navy dumped the original radioactive compartment into the Kara Sea. &quot;K-19&quot; returned to the fleet with the nickname &quot;Hiroshima&quot;.

According to the government&#x27;s official explanation of the disaster, the repair crews found that the catastrophe had been caused by a faulty welding incident during initial construction. They discovered that during installation of the primary cooling system piping, a welder had failed to cover exposed pipe surfaces with asbestos drop cloths (required to protect piping systems from accidental exposure to welding sparks), due to the cramped working space. A drop from a welding electrode fell on an unprotected surface, producing an invisible crack. This crack was subject to prolonged and intensive pressure (over ), compromising the pipe&#x27;s integrity and finally causing it to fail.

Others disputed this conclusion. Retired Rear-Admiral Nikolai Mormul asserted that when the reactor was first started ashore, the construction crew had not attached a pressure gauge to the primary cooling circuit. Before anyone realized there was a problem, the cooling pipes were subjected to a pressure of 400 atmospheres, double the acceptable limit.

On 1 February 2006, former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev proposed in a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee that the crew of &quot;&quot; be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for their actions on 4 July 1961.

==== Deceased crew members ====
Several crew members received fatal doses of radiation during repairs on the reserve coolant system of Reactor #8. Eight died between one and three weeks after the accident from severe radiation sickness. A person who receives a dose of 4 to 5 Sv (about 400–500 rem) over a short period has a 50% chance of dying within 30 days.

Fourteen other crew members died within two years. Many other crew members also received radiation doses exceeding permissible levels. They underwent medical treatment during the following year. Many others experienced chest pains, numbness, cancer, and kidney failure. Their treatment was devised by Professor Z. Volynskiy and included bone marrow transplantation and blood transfusion. It saved, among others, Chief Lieutenant Mikhail Krasichkov and Captain 3rd class Vladimir Yenin, who had received doses of radiation that were otherwise considered deadly. For reasons of secrecy, the official diagnosis was not &quot;radiation sickness&quot; but &quot;astheno-vegetative syndrome&quot;, a mental disorder.

==== Crew members decorated ====
On 6 August 1961, 26 members of the crew were decorated for courage and valor shown during the accident.

=== Later operational history ===

On 14 December 1961, the boat was fully upgraded to the Hotel II (&quot;658м&quot;) variant, which included upgrading to R-21 missiles, which had twice the effective range of the earlier missiles.

==== Collision ====
At 07:13 on 15 November 1969, &quot;K-19&quot; collided with the attack submarine in the Barents Sea at a depth of . She was able to surface using an emergency main ballast tank blow. The impact completely destroyed the bow sonar systems and mangled the covers of the forward torpedo tubes. &quot;K-19&quot; was able to return to port where the boat was repaired and returned to the fleet. &quot;Gato&quot; was relatively undamaged and continued her patrol.

==== Fires ====
On 24 February 1972, a fire broke out while the submarine was at a depth of , some from Newfoundland, Canada. The boat surfaced and the crew was evacuated to surface warships except for 12 men trapped in the aft torpedo room. Towing was delayed by a gale, and rescuers could not reach the aft torpedo room because of conditions in the engine room. The fire killed 28 sailors aboard &quot;K-19&quot; and two others who died after they were transferred to rescue ships. Investigators determined that the fire was caused by a hydraulic fluid leak onto a hot filter.

The rescue operation lasted more than 40 days and involved over 30 ships. From 15 June through 5 November 1972, &quot;K-19&quot; was repaired and put back into service.

On 15 November 1972, another fire broke out in compartment 6, but it was put out by the chemical fire-extinguisher system and there were no casualties.

====Reclassification====
On 25 July 1977, &quot;K-19&quot; was reclassified in the large submarine class, and on 26 July 1979, she was reclassified as a communications submarine and given the symbol KS-19 (КС-19). 

On 15 August 1982, an electrical short circuit resulted in severe burns to two sailors; one, V. A. Kravchuk, died five days later.

On 28 November 1985, the ship was upgraded to the 658s (658с) variant.

=== Decommissioning and fate ===
On 19 April 1990 the submarine was decommissioned, and was transferred in 1994 to the naval repair yard at Polyarny. In March 2002, she was towed to the Nerpa Shipyard, Snezhnogorsk, Murmansk, to be scrapped.

In 2006, a section of &quot;K-19&quot; was purchased by Vladimir Romanov, who once served on the submarine as a conscript, with the intention of &quot;Turning it into a Moscow-based meeting place to build links between submarine veterans from Russia and other countries.&quot; Many of &quot;K-19&quot;″s survivors objected to the plans. In 2023, &quot;The Athletic&quot; reported that Romanov had refurbished the submarine to serve as his place of residence in Nikul&#x27;skaya, described as a village in northwestern Russia.

== Theatre and film ==
In 1969 writer Vasily Aksyonov wrote a play about the nuclear incident.

The movie &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot; (2002), starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, is based on the story of the &quot;K-19&quot;″s first disaster. The original crew of the submarine were allowed to read the script and had complaints, which led to several changes in the script. The production company attempted in March 2002 to secure access to the boat as a set for its production, but the Russian Navy declined. The nickname &quot;The Widowmaker&quot; in the film&#x27;s title is fictional; the submarine did not gain a nickname until the nuclear accident on 4 July 1961, when she was called &quot;Hiroshima&quot;.

<text>The Seleucid dynasty or the Seleucidae (; , &quot;&quot;, &quot;descendants of Seleucus&quot;) was a Macedonian Greek royal family, which ruled the Seleucid Empire based in West Asia during the Hellenistic period. It was founded by Seleucus I Nicator, a general and successor of Alexander the Great, after the division of the Macedonian Empire as a result of the Wars of the Successors (&quot;Diadochi&quot;). 

Through its history, the Seleucid dominion included large parts of the Near East, as well as of the Asian territory of the earlier Achaemenid Persian Empire. A major center of Hellenistic culture, it attracted a large number of immigrants from Greece who, encouraged by the Seleucids, formed a dominant political elite under the ruling dynasty. After the death of Seleucus I, his successors maintained the empire&#x27;s strength establishing it as a Greek power in West Asia; the empire reached its height under emperor Antiochus III. From the mid-second century BC, after its defeat at the hands of the resurgent Parthian Empire, the polity entered a state of instability with slow territorial losses and internecine civil wars. The Seleucids, now reduced to a rump state occupying a small part of Syria succumbed to the Rome&#x27;s annexation of their territory in 64 BC under Pompey the Great.

==History==
===Background===
Seleucus ( 358 – 281 BC) served as an officer of Alexander the Great, commanding the elite infantry corps in the Macedonian army: the &quot;Shield-bearers&quot; (, &quot;Hypaspistai&quot;), later known as the &quot;Silvershields&quot; (, &quot;Argyraspides&quot;). After the death of Alexander in 323 BC, the Partition of Triparadisus assigned Seleucus as satrap of Babylon in 321 BC. Antigonus, the satrap of much of Asia Minor, forced Seleucus to flee from Babylon, but, supported by Ptolemy, the Satrap of Egypt, Seleucus returned in 312 BC. Seleucus&#x27; later conquests included Persia and Media. He agreed to a peace treaty with the Indian King Chandragupta Maurya (reigned 324-297 BC). Seleucus defeated Antigonus in the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and Lysimachus (King of Thrace, Macedon and Asia Minor) in the battle of Corupedium (near Sardis) in 281 BC. Ptolemy Ceraunus assassinated Seleucus later in the same year. Seleucus&#x27; eldest son Antiochus I succeeded him as ruler of the Seleucid territories in 281 BC.

<doc id="29128" wikidata="Q847827" url="?curid=29128" title="Super Bowl I">
<text>The first AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super BowlI and referred to in contemporaneous reports, including the game&#x27;s radio broadcast, as the Super Bowl) was an American football game played on January 15, 1967, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35–10.

Coming into the game, billed by some as the &quot;supergame&quot;, considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL, thus the teams representing the two rival leagues (Kansas City and Green Bay, respectively) felt additional pressure to win. The Chiefs posted an 11–2–1 record during the regular season, and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31–7 in the AFL Championship Game. The Packers finished the regular season at 12–2 and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34–27 in the NFL Championship Game. Many sportswriters and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL, and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City.

The first half of Super Bowl I was competitive, as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards, and kept pace with Green Bay by posting a score at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line. The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half. Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr, who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, was named MVP.

As NBC and CBS had held the rights to nationally televise AFL and NFL games, respectively, it was decided that both networks were allowed to televise the game. The game remains the only Super Bowl to have been simulcast in the United States by two of the then-&quot;Big Three&quot; broadcast companies. Several recent Super Bowls have been simultaneously broadcast on Network TV as well as cable and streaming platforms.

==Background==
===Origins===
When the NFL began its 41st season in , it had a new and unwanted rival: the American Football League. The NFL had successfully fended off several other rival leagues in the past, and so the older league initially ignored the new upstart and its eight teams, figuring it would be made up of nothing but NFL rejects, and that fans were unlikely to prefer it to the NFL. But unlike the NFL&#x27;s prior rivals, the AFL survived and prospered, in part by signing &quot;NFL rejects&quot; who turned out to be highly talented players the older league had badly misjudged. Soon the NFL and AFL found themselves locked in a massive bidding war for the top free agents and prospects coming out of college. Originally, there was a tacit agreement between the two not to raid each other by signing players who were already under contract with a team from an opposing league. This policy broke down in early 1966 when the NFL&#x27;s New York Giants signed Pete Gogolak, a placekicker who was under contract with the AFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills. The AFL owners considered this an &quot;act of war&quot; and immediately struck back, signing several contracted NFL players, including eight of their top quarterbacks.

Eventually, the NFL had enough and started negotiations with the AFL in an attempt to resolve the issue. As a result of the negotiations, the leagues signed a merger agreement on June 9, 1966. Among the details, both leagues agreed to share a common draft to end the bidding war for the top college players, as well as merge into a single league after the season. In addition, an &quot;AFL–NFL World Championship Game&quot; was established, in which the AFL and NFL champions would play against each other in a game at the end of the season to determine which league had the best team.

Los Angeles wasn&#x27;t awarded the game until December 1, less than seven weeks before the kickoff; likewise, the date of the game was not set until December 13. Since the AFL Championship Game originally was scheduled for Monday, December 26, and the NFL Championship Game for Sunday, January1, the &quot;new&quot; championship game was suggested to be played Sunday, January 8. An unprecedented TV doubleheader was held on January 1, with the AFL Championship Game telecast from Buffalo on NBC and the NFL Championship Game telecast from Dallas on CBS three hours later.

Coming into this &quot;first&quot; game, considerable animosity still existed between the two rival leagues, with both of them putting pressure on their respective champions to trounce the other and prove each league&#x27;s dominance in professional football. Still, many sportswriters and fans believed the game was a mismatch, and any team from the long-established NFL was far superior to the best team from the upstart AFL.

The players&#x27; shares were $15,000 each for the winning team and $7,500 each for the losing team. This was in addition to the league championship money earned two weeks earlier: the Packers&#x27; shares were $8,600 each and the Chiefs&#x27; were $5,308 each.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
The Chiefs entered the game after an 11–2–1 regular season and a decisive 31–7 road win over the defending AFL champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL championship game on New Year&#x27;s Day.

Kansas City&#x27;s high-powered offense led the AFL in points scored (448) and total rushing yards (2,274). Their trio of running backs, Mike Garrett (801 yards), Bert Coan (521 yards), and Curtis McClinton (540 yards) all ranked among the top-ten rushers in the AFL. Quarterback Len Dawson was the top-rated passer in the AFL, completing 159 of 284 (56%) of his passes for 2,527 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Otis Taylor provided the team with a great deep threat by recording 58 receptions for 1,297 yards and eight touchdowns. Receiver Chris Burford added 58 receptions for 758 yards and eight touchdowns, and tight end Fred Arbanas, who had 22 catches for 305 yards and four touchdowns, was one of six Chiefs offensive players who were named to the All-AFL team. Kansas City&#x27;s offensive line was led by tackle Jim Tyrer, who had been selected to the AFL Pro Bowl for the 5th time in his career.

The Chiefs also had a strong defense, with All-AFL players Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan anchoring their line. Linebacker Bobby Bell, who was also named to the All-AFL team, was great at run stopping and pass coverage. The strongest part of their defense, though, was their secondary, led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, who each recorded 10 interceptions, and Fred Williamson, who recorded four. Their head coach was Hank Stram.

===Green Bay Packers===
The Packers were an NFL dynasty, turning around what had been a losing team just eight years earlier. The team had posted an NFL-worst 1–10–1 record in 1958 before head coach Vince Lombardi was hired in January 1959. &quot;Their offense was like a conga dance&quot;, one sportswriter quipped. &quot;1, 2, 3and kick.&quot;

Lombardi was determined to build a winning team. During the preseason, he signed Fred &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Thurston, who had been cut from three other teams, but ended up becoming an All-Pro left guard for Green Bay. Lombardi also made a big trade with the Cleveland Browns that brought three players to the team who would become cornerstones of the defense: linemen Henry Jordan, Willie Davis, and Bill Quinlan.

Lombardi&#x27;s hard work paid off, and the Packers improved to a 7–5 regular-season record in 1959. They surprised the league during the following year by making it to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. Although the Packers lost, 17–13, to the Philadelphia Eagles, they had sent a clear message that they were no longer losers. Green Bay went on to win NFL Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, and 1966.

Packers veteran quarterback Bart Starr was the top-rated quarterback in the NFL for 1966, and won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, completing 156 of 251 (62.2%) passes for 2,257 yards (9.0 per attempt), 14 touchdowns, and only three interceptions. His top targets were wide receivers Boyd Dowler and Carroll Dale, who combined for 63 receptions for 1,336 yards. Fullback Jim Taylor was the team&#x27;s top rusher with 705 yards, adding four touchdowns, and caught 41 passes for 331 yards and two touchdowns. (Before the season, Taylor had informed the team that instead of returning to the Packers in 1967, he would play out his option and sign with the expansion New Orleans Saints. Lombardi, infuriated at what he considered to be Taylor&#x27;s disloyalty, refused to speak to Taylor the entire season.) The team&#x27;s starting halfback, Paul Hornung, was injured early in the season and replaced by running back Elijah Pitts, who gained 857 all-purpose yards. The Packers&#x27; offensive line was also a big reason for the team&#x27;s success, led by All-Pro guards Jerry Kramer, and Fuzzy Thurston, and tackle Forrest Gregg.

Green Bay also had an excellent defense that displayed their talent in the NFL championship game, stopping the Dallas Cowboys on four consecutive plays starting from the Packers 2-yard line on the final drive to win the game. Lionel Aldridge had replaced Quinlan, but Jordan and Davis still anchored the defensive line; linebacker Ray Nitschke excelled at run stopping and pass coverage, while the secondary was led by Herb Adderley and Willie Wood. Wood was another example of how Lombardi found talent nobody else could see. Wood had been a quarterback in college and was not drafted by an NFL team. When Wood joined the Packers in 1960, he was converted to a free safety and went on to make the All-Pro team nine times in his 12-year career.

===Pregame news and notes===
Many people considered it fitting that the Chiefs and the Packers would be the teams to play in the first-ever AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt had founded the AFL, while Green Bay was widely considered one of the best teams in NFL history (even if they could not claim to be founding members of their league, as the Packers joined the NFL in 1921, a year after the league&#x27;s formation). Lombardi was under intense pressure from the entire NFL to make sure the Packers not only won the game but preferably won big to demonstrate the superiority of the NFL. CBS announcer Frank Gifford, who interviewed Lombardi before the game, said Lombardi was so nervous, &quot;he held onto my arm and he was shaking like a leaf. It was incredible.&quot; The Chiefs saw this game as an opportunity to show they were good enough to play against any NFL team. One player who was looking forward to competing in this game was Len Dawson, who had spent three years as a backup in the NFL before joining the Chiefs. However, the Chiefs were also nervous. Linebacker E. J. Holub said, &quot;the Chiefs were scared to death. Guys in the tunnel were throwing up.&quot;

In the week before the game, Chiefs cornerback Fred &quot;The Hammer&quot; Williamson garnered considerable publicity by boasting he would use his &quot;hammer&quot; – forearm blows to the head – to destroy the Packers&#x27; receivers, stating, &quot;Two hammers to (Boyd) Dowler, one to (Carroll) Dale should be enough.&quot;

The Packers practiced at UC Santa Barbara, and the Chiefs at Veterans Field in Long Beach.

The temperature was mild with clear skies. 

The two teams played with their respective footballs from each league; the Chiefs&#x27; offense used the AFL ball, the slightly narrower and longer J5V by Spalding, and the Packers played with the NFL ball, &quot;The Duke&quot; by Wilson.

The AFL&#x27;s two-point conversion rule was not in force; the NFL added the two-point conversion in and it was first used in the Super Bowl (XXIX) that season, in January 1995.

This was the only Super Bowl where the numeric yard markers were five yards apart, rather than ten as is customary today. In , marking yard lines ending in &quot;5&quot; was disallowed in the NFL in order to standardize field markings. It was also the last professional gridiron game ever played with double-support goalposts. The &quot;slingshot&quot; goalpost, with a single support, had made its debut a few weeks before Super Bowl I in the 1966 CFL playoffs. It became standard across all three professional leagues then operating in .
Justin Peters of &quot;Slate&quot; watched all the Super Bowls over a two-month period in 2015 before Super Bowl 50. He mentioned the first Super Bowl&#x27;s having &quot;two dudes in rocket packs who flew around the stadium. I can forgive a lot of bad football as long as the game features two dudes in honest-to-God rocket packs.&quot;

Tickets for this game were priced at twelve, ten, and six dollars, which was equivalent to $109, $90, and $55 in 2023 when adjusted for inflation.

==Broadcasting==
At the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, each using its own announcers. Ray Scott (doing play-by-play for the first half), Jack Whitaker (doing play-by-play for the second half) and Frank Gifford provided commentary on CBS, while Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC. This is the only Super Bowl that Curt Gowdy called for NBC where the NFL or NFC team won (the AFL/AFC teams won the others, even though the Baltimore Colts and Pittsburgh Steelers were part of the old NFL before moving to the AFC following the AFL–NFL merger).

However, during the week preceding the game, tensions flared between the staff of the two networks (longtime arch-rivals in American broadcasting), who each wanted to win the rating war, to the point where a fence was built between the CBS and NBC trucks. In addition, Rozelle decreed that NBC would not be able to use its cameramen and technical personnel, instead forcing it to use the feed provided by CBS, since the Coliseum was home to the NFL&#x27;s Rams.

This game remains the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two of the &quot;Big Three&quot; broadcast companies. It was the only NFL game to be carried nationally on more than one broadcaster until the same two networks (as well as NFL Network and various local ABC and MyNetworkTV affiliates) carried a game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants on December 29, 2007, and it was the only Super Bowl to simulcast on multiple American networks until Super Bowl LVIII was broadcast on CBS and its sister network Nickelodeon in February 2024.

Super BowlI was the only Super Bowl that was not a sellout, despite the TV blackout in Los Angeles (at the time, the local blackout was required even at a neutral site and even if the stadium did sell out), shutting out the vast Los Angeles market and network-owned stations KNXT (Channel 2, CBS; now KCBS-TV) and KNBC (Channel 4, NBC). Of the 94,000-seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold. Days before the game, local newspapers printed editorials about what they viewed as an exorbitant ticket price of , and wrote stories about how viewers could pull in the game from stations in surrounding markets such as Bakersfield, Santa Barbara and San Diego.

===Ratings===
CBS received a 22.6 rating and a market share of 43 for its broadcast, which was seen by 26.75 million people. NBC received an 18.5 rating and a market share of 36 for its broadcast, which was seen by 24.43 million people. Combined, the game received a market share of 79 and reached 51.18 million viewers.

===Lost recording===
All known broadcast tapes of the game in its entirety were subsequently wiped by both NBC and CBS to save costs, a common practice in the TV industry at the time, as videotapes were very expensive (one half-hour tape cost around $300 at the time, equivalent to $ in dollars), plus it was not foreseen how big the game was going to become. This has prevented studies comparing each network&#x27;s respective telecast.

For many years, only two small samples of the telecasts were known to have survived, showing Max McGee&#x27;s opening touchdown and Jim Taylor&#x27;s touchdown run. Both were shown in 1991 on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Play by Play: A History of Sports Television&quot; and on the Super Bowl XXV pregame show. In January 2011, a partial recording of the CBS telecast was reported to have been found in a Pennsylvania attic and restored by the Paley Center for Media in New York. The two-inch color videotape is the most complete version of the broadcast yet discovered, missing only the halftime show and most of the third quarter. The NFL owns the broadcast copyright and has blocked its sale or distribution. After remaining anonymous and communicating with the media only through his lawyer since the recording&#x27;s discovery, the owner of the recording, Troy Haupt, came forward to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2016 to tell his side of the story. The Paley Center has restored and digitized the footage and showed the recording to the public for the first time on February 10, 2024, as part of an exhibit, being staged in partnership with the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame, on the history of the Super Bowl called &quot;Beyond the Big Game&quot;.

NFL Films had a camera crew present, and retains a substantial amount of film footage in its archives, some of which have been released in its film productions. One such presentation was the &quot;NFL&#x27;s Greatest Games&quot; episode about this Super Bowl, entitled &quot;The Spectacle of a Sport&quot; (also the title of the Super BowlI highlight film).

On January 11, 2016, the NFL announced that &quot;in an exhaustive process that took months to complete, NFL Films searched its enormous archives of footage and were able to locate all 145 plays from Super BowlI from more than a couple of dozen disparate sources. Once all the plays were located, NFL Films was able to put the plays in order and stitch them together while fully restoring, re-mastering, and color-correcting the footage. Finally, audio from the NBC Sports radio broadcast featuring announcers Jim Simpson and George Ratterman was layered on top of the footage to complete the broadcast. The final result represents the only known video footage of the entire action from Super BowlI.&quot; It then announced that NFL Network would broadcast the newly pieced together footage in its entirety on January 15, 2016—the 49th anniversary of the contest. This footage was nearly all on film with the exception of several player introductions and a post-game locker room chat between Pat Summerall and Pete Rozelle.

==Ceremonies and entertainment==
The Los Angeles Ramettes, majorettes who had performed at all Rams home games, entertained during pregame festivities and after each quarter. Also during the pregame, the University of Arizona marching band created a physical outline of the continental United States at the center of the field, with the famed Anaheim High School drill team placing banners of each NFL and AFL team at each team&#x27;s geographical location.

The postgame trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS&#x27; Pat Summerall and NBC&#x27;s George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman were forced to share a single microphone.

===Halftime show===
The halftime show was produced by Tommy Walker, and featured trumpeter Al Hirt, the marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling College, the Ana-Hi-Steppers (more information below), 300 pigeons, 10,000 balloons and a flying demonstration by the hydrogen-peroxide-propelled Bell Rocket Air Men. In addition, the halftime featured a local high school drill team, the Ana-Hi-Steppers from Anaheim High School. The team joined the two university marching bands to form an outline of a United States map. Their transportation to and from the game was by school bus. This team was chosen due to their connection to Tommy Walker, whose children attended Anaheim High School. He had seen the Ana-Hi-Steppers perform and chose them over nationally famous drill teams since he only had three weeks to cast and produce the show.

==Game summary==
Balls from both leagues were used – when the Chiefs were on offense, the official AFL football (Spalding J5V) was used, and when the Packers were on offense, the official NFL ball (Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Duke&quot;) was used. Even the officiating crew was a combination of AFL and NFL referees, with the NFL&#x27;s Norm Schachter as the head referee.

===First quarter===
After the teams traded punts on their first possessions, the Packers drove 80 yards in six plays. The drive was highlighted by quarterback Bart Starr&#x27;s passes to tight end Marv Fleming for 11 yards, to running back Elijah Pitts for 22 yards on a scramble, and to wide receiver Carroll Dale for 12 yards. The drive ended with Starr&#x27;s 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Max McGee, who had replaced re-injured starter Boyd Dowler earlier in the drive, giving Green Bay an early 7–0 lead. (Dowler had injured his shoulder two weeks prior after scoring a third-quarter touchdown; Cowboys safety Mike Gaechter had upended him several steps after scoring and he landed awkwardly.) McGee slipped past Chiefs cornerback Willie Mitchell, made a one-handed catch at the 23-yard line, and then went the distance for the touchdown. (McGee had also caught a touchdown pass after replacing an injured Dowler in the NFL championship game). On their ensuing drive, Kansas City moved the ball to Green Bay&#x27;s 33-yard line, during which quarterback Len Dawson completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Fred Arbanas and running back Mike Garrett rushed for 9 yards, but kicker Mike Mercer missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide left. The Packers picked up 3 yards on the next play to end the first quarter.

===Second quarter===

Kansas City forced a three-and-out to start the second quarter, then got on the board with a six-play, 66-yard scoring drive, featuring passes by Dawson to Garrett for 15 yards, and to wide receiver Otis Taylor for 31 yards, which set up 1st-and-goal for the Chiefs at the Packers&#x27; 7-yard line. Dawson then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to fullback Curtis McClinton to tie the game, 7–7. But the Packers responded with a 73-yard scoring drive on their next possession, which was again highlighted by Starr&#x27;s key passes. On the third play of the drive, Starr appeared to complete a 64-yard touchdown pass to Dale, but this was nullified by a false start penalty against Green Bay. As the drive continued, however, Starr converted four straight third downs; he hit McGee for 10 yards on 3rd-and-6, then Dale for 15 on 3rd-and-10, then Fleming for 11 on 3rd-and-5, and then Pitts for 10 on 3rd-and-7 to set up fullback Jim Taylor&#x27;s 14-yard touchdown run with the team&#x27;s famed Packers sweep play. Taylor&#x27;s rushing touchdown was the first in Super Bowl history.

On the first play of the Chiefs&#x27; next drive, defensive end Lionel Aldridge and defensive tackle Henry Jordan shared a sack on Dawson for an 8-yard loss, but he followed it up with four consecutive completions for 58 yards, including a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Chris Burford. This set up Mercer&#x27;s 31-yard field goal to cut the Chiefs&#x27; deficit to 14–10 at the end of the half.

At halftime, the Chiefs appeared to have a chance to win. Many people watching the game were surprised at how close the score was and how well the AFL&#x27;s champions were playing. Kansas City outgained Green Bay in total yards, 181–164, and had 11 first downs compared to the Packers&#x27; nine. The Chiefs were exuberant at halftime. Hank Stram said later, &quot;I honestly thought we would come back and win it.&quot; The Packers were disappointed with the quality of their play in the first half. &quot;The coach was &quot;concerned&quot;&quot;, said defensive end Willie Davis later. Lombardi told them the game plan was sound, but that they had to tweak some things and execute better.

===Third quarter===
On their first drive of the second half, the Chiefs advanced to their 49-yard line with a chance to take their first lead of the game. But on a third-down pass play, a heavy blitz by linebackers Dave Robinson and Lee Roy Caffey collapsed the Chief&#x27;s pocket. Robinson, Jordan, and Aldridge converged on Dawson, who threw weakly toward Arbanas. The wobbly pass was intercepted by safety Willie Wood, who raced 50 yards to Kansas City&#x27;s 5-yard line before being dragged down from behind by Garrett. This was &quot;the biggest play of the game,&quot; wrote Starr later. The Packers capitalized on the turnover on the next play with a 5-yard touchdown run by Pitts to increase their lead to 21–10. Stram agreed that it was the critical point of the game. The Packers&#x27; defense then held the Chief scoreless for the rest of the game, allowing them to cross midfield only once, and for just one play. The Chiefs were forced to deviate from their game plan, and that hurt them. The Kansas City offense totaled only 12 yards in the third quarter, and Dawson was held to five of 12 second-half pass completions for 59 yards.

Meanwhile, Green Bay forced Kansas City to punt from their two-yard line after sacking Dawson twice and got the ball back with good field position on their own 44-yard line (despite a clipping penalty on the punt return). McGee subsequently caught three passes for 40 yards on a 56-yard drive. Taylor ran for one first down, Starr hit McGee for 16 yards on 3rd-and-11, and a third-down sweep with Taylor carrying gained 8 yards and a first down at the Kansas City 13. The drive ended with Starr&#x27;s 13-yard touchdown pass to McGee on a post pattern, giving Green Bay a 28–10 lead.

===Fourth quarter===
After two punts by Kansas City and an interception at their own 11-yard line by Chiefs cornerback Willie Mitchell, midway through the fourth quarter, Starr completed a 25-yard pass to Dale and a 37-yard strike to McGee, moving the ball to the Chiefs&#x27; 18-yard line. Six plays later, Pitts scored his second touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run to close out the scoring, giving the Packers the 35–10 win. Also, in the fourth quarter, Chiefs defensive back Fred Williamson, who had boasted about his &quot;hammer&quot; before the game, was knocked out when his head collided with Packers running back Donny Anderson&#x27;s knee, and then suffered a broken arm when Chiefs linebacker Sherrill Headrick fell on him. Williamson had three tackles for the game.

Packers halfback Paul Hornung was the only Packer to not see any action. Lombardi had asked him in the fourth quarter if he wanted to go in, but Hornung declined, not wanting to aggravate a pinched nerve in his neck. McGee, who caught only four passes for 91 yards and one touchdown during the season, finished Super BowlI with seven receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns. After the game was over, a reporter asked Vince Lombardi if he thought Kansas City was a good team. Lombardi responded that though the Chiefs were an excellent, well-coached club, he thought several NFL teams such as Dallas were better.

===Statistical comparison===
Note: According to NBC Radio announcer Jim Simpson&#x27;s report at halftime of the game, Kansas City led 11–9 in first downs at halftime, 181–164 in total yards, and 142–113 in passing yards (Green Bay led 51–39 in rushing yards). Bart Starr completed eight of 13 with no interceptions, while Len Dawson was 11 of 15 with no interceptions. Green Bay led 14–10 at halftime. Green Bay had the ball five times, although only for a minute or so on the last possession; they punted on their first possession, scored a touchdown on their second, punted on their third, scored a touchdown on their fourth, and had the ball when the half ended on their fifth. Kansas City had the ball four times – punting on their first possession, driving to a missed field goal on their second possession, scoring a touchdown on their third, and kicking a field goal on their fourth.

This means, in the second half, Green Bay led 12–6 in first downs, 197–58 in total yards, 115–25 in passing yards, and 82–33 in rushing yards (the Packers won the second half, 21–0). Starr and his late-game replacement, Zeke Bratkowski, were eight for 11 with one interception; Dawson and his late-game replacement, Pete Beathard, were just six for 17, also with one interception. Each team had the ball seven times in the second half, although Green Bay&#x27;s first possession was just one play and their seventh possession was abbreviated because the game ended. Green Bay scored a touchdown on their first (one play) possession, punted on their second, scored a touchdown on their third, was intercepted at Kansas City&#x27;s 15-yard line on their fourth (just Starr&#x27;s fourth interception of the year), scored a touchdown on their fifth, punted on their sixth, and had the ball when the game ended on their seventh possession. Kansas City was intercepted on their first possession – Wood&#x27;s return to the five set up Pitts&#x27; touchdown which made the score 21–10 – and then punted on each of their next six possessions.

Note: A six-official system was used by the NFL from through the season.

Since officials from the NFL and AFL wore different uniform designs, a &quot;neutral&quot; uniform was designed for this game. These uniforms had the familiar black and white stripes, but the sleeves were all black with the official&#x27;s uniform number. This design was also worn in Super Bowl II, but was discontinued after that game when AFL officials began wearing uniforms identical to those of the NFL during the 1968 season, in anticipation of the AFL–NFL merger in .

<text>The second AFL–NFL World Championship Game (known retroactively as Super Bowl II) was an American football game played on January 14, 1968, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. The National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s defending champion Green Bay Packers defeated American Football League (AFL) champion Oakland Raiders by the score of 33–14. This game and the following year&#x27;s are the only two Super Bowls played in the same stadium in consecutive seasons.

Coming into the game, much like during the first Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL. The Packers, the defending champions, posted a 9–4–1 record during the NFL season before defeating the Los Angeles Rams 28–7 in the first round of the playoffs, then outlasted the Dallas Cowboys 21–17 in the frigid NFL Championship Game (popularly known as the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot;). The Raiders finished the regular season at 13–1, then defeated the Houston Oilers 40–7 in the AFL Championship Game.

As expected, Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout the majority of Super Bowl II. The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback Daryle Lamonica. Meanwhile, Packers kicker Don Chandler made four field goals, including three in the first half, while cornerback Herb Adderley had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown that put the game away. Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was named the MVP for the second straight time, becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown.

The Packers won their third consecutive World Championship, the second such occasion in NFL history (the 1929–31 Green Bay Packers did it first). The 1965–67 Packers became the first and only team to win three consecutive championship games, as there were no NFL playoff games from 1920 to 1932. No NFL team has accomplished this feat since.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
The NFL awarded Super Bowl II to Miami on May 25, 1967, at the owners meetings in New York City. It marked the first of eleven Super Bowls in the Miami area (as of 2022), and the first of two consecutive (II and III). A total of five cities were considered to host the second edition: Miami, Los Angeles (Coliseum), Houston (Astrodome), Dallas (Cotton Bowl), and New Orleans (Tulane Stadium). After lackluster attendance for Super Bowl I at the Coliseum, Los Angeles was eliminated by the owners. The Miami Orange Bowl was selected for the game, based on weather, hotel accommodations, capacity, and the stadium&#x27;s previous experience in hosting the Playoff Bowl. The local Orange Bowl committee had even once (unsuccessfully) lobbied to host the NFL Championship Game, which was not normally a neutral field contest. Furthermore, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle opined that it was &quot;helpful to move the game around a little&quot;, and not play it in the same city every year. Playing the game in an AFL town also established a precedent for maintaining competitive balance between the two leagues. The city&#x27;s contingent, led by mayor Robert King High, Joe Robbie, and others, would have just under eight months to prepare for the event.

===Green Bay Packers===

The Packers advanced to their second straight AFL–NFL World Championship Game, but had a much more difficult time than in the previous season. Both of their starting running backs from the previous year, future Pro Football Hall of Famers Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor, had left the team. Their replacements, Elijah Pitts and Jim Grabowski, both went down with season-ending injuries, forcing Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi to use second-year reserve running back Donny Anderson and rookie Travis Williams. Fullbacks Chuck Mercein and Ben Wilson, who were signed as free agents after being discarded by many other teams, were also used to help compensate for the loss of Hornung and Taylor. Meanwhile, the team&#x27;s 33-year-old veteran quarterback Bart Starr had missed 4 games during the season with injuries, and finished the season with nearly twice as many interceptions (17) as touchdown passes (9).

The team&#x27;s deep threat was provided by veteran receivers Carroll Dale, who recorded 35 receptions for 738 yards (a 21.1 average), and 5 touchdowns; and Pro Bowler Boyd Dowler, who had 54 catches for 846 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Packers still had the superb blocking of guard Jerry Kramer, Fred Thurston and Forrest Gregg. Grabowski was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with 466 yards, while Wilson had 453. Anderson had 733 yards from scrimmage and 9 total touchdowns, while also gaining another 324 yards returning kicks. On special teams, Williams returned 18 kickoffs for 749 yards and an NFL record 4 touchdowns, giving him a whopping 41.1 yards per return average. The team ranked just 9th out of 16 NFL teams in scoring with 332 points.

The Packers defense, however, allowed only 209 points, the 3rd best in the NFL. Even this figure was misleading, since Green Bay had yielded only 131 points in the first 11 games (when they clinched their division), the lowest total in professional football. Three members of Green Bay&#x27;s secondary, the strongest aspect of their defense, were named to the Pro Bowl: Willie Wood, Herb Adderley, and Bob Jeter. The Packers also had a superb defensive line led by Henry Jordan and Willie Davis. Behind them, the Packers linebacking corps was led by Ray Nitschke.

The Packers won the NFL&#x27;s Central Division with a 9–4–1 regular season record, clinching the division in the 11th week of the season. During the last three weeks, the Packers gave up an uncharacteristic total of 78 points, after having yielded only about a dozen points per game in their first 11 contests. In the playoffs, Green Bay returned to its dominant form, blowing away their first playoff opponent, the Los Angeles Rams, in the Western Conference Championship Game, 28–7. The next week, Green Bay then came from behind to defeat the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL championship game for the second year in a row, in one of the most famous games in NFL lore: The Ice Bowl.

===Oakland Raiders===

The Raiders, led by head coach John Rauch, had stormed to the top of the AFL with a 13–1 regular season record, the best record in AFL history (their only defeat was an October 7 loss to the New York Jets, 27–14), and went on to crush the Houston Oilers, 40–7, in the AFL Championship game. They had led all AFL and NFL teams in scoring with 468 points. Starting quarterback Daryle Lamonica had thrown for 3,228 yards and an AFL-best 30 touchdown passes.

The offensive line was anchored by center Jim Otto and rookie guard Gene Upshaw, along with AFL All-Stars Harry Schuh and Wayne Hawkins. Wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff led the team with 40 receptions for 876 yards, an average of 21.3 yards per catch. On the other side of the field, tight end Billy Cannon caught 32 passes for 629 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. In the backfield, the Raiders had three running backs, Clem Daniels, Hewritt Dixon, and Pete Banaszak, who carried the ball equally and combined for 1,510 yards and 10 touchdowns. On special teams, defensive back Rodger Bird led the AFL with 612 punt return yards and added another 148 yards returning kickoffs.

The main strength of the Raiders was their defense, nicknamed &quot;The 11 Angry Men&quot;. The defensive line was anchored by AFL All-Stars Tom Keating and Ben Davidson, a former Packer who played on Green Bay&#x27;s 1961 championship team. Davidson was an extremely effective pass rusher who had demonstrated his aggressiveness in a regular season game against the New York Jets by breaking the jaw of Jets quarterback Joe Namath while sacking him. Behind them, All AFL linebacker Dan Conners excelled at blitzing and pass coverage, recording 3 interceptions. The Raiders also had two All AFL defensive backs: Willie Brown, who led the team with 7 interceptions, and Kent McCloughan, who had 2 interceptions. Safety Warren Powers recorded 6 interceptions, returning them for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns.

===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===
Despite Oakland&#x27;s accomplishments, and expert consensus that this was the weakest of all the Packer NFL championship teams, Green Bay was a 14-point favorite to win the Super Bowl. Like the previous year, most fans and sports writers believed that the top NFL teams were superior to the best AFL teams.

Thus, most of the drama and discussions surrounding the game focused not on which team would win, but on the rumors that Lombardi might retire from coaching after the game. The game also proved to be the final one for Packers wide receiver Max McGee, one of the heroes of Super Bowl I, and place kicker Don Chandler.

This was the first Super Bowl to use the &quot;tuning fork&quot; or &quot;slingshot&quot; goalposts (with one supporting post instead of two) invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman; they had made their debut at the start of the season for both the AFL and NFL, and first appeared at the pro level in Canada.

==Broadcasting==
The game was televised in the United States by CBS. This was the first of seventeen Super Bowls in which the game was rotated annually between CBS and NBC. Ray Scott handled the play-by-play duties, and was joined by color commentators Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp in the broadcast booth. Kemp was the first Super Bowl commentator who was still an active player (with Buffalo of the AFL) at the time of the broadcast. The CBS telecast of this game is considered lost; all that survives are in-game photos, most of which were shown in the January 8, 1969, edition of Sports Illustrated. Not even NFL Films, the league&#x27;s official filmmaker, has a copy of the full game available; however, they do have game footage that they used for their game highlight film. Super Bowl II was aired exclusively by CBS and was long believed to have been erased, but it was later found that the entire telecast fully exists and rests in the vaults of NFL Films.

While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the NFL&#x27;s unconditional blackout rules in place then prevented the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area.

During the latter part of the second quarter, and again for three minutes of halftime, almost 80 percent of the country (with the exceptions of New York City, Cleveland, Philadelphia and much of the Northeast) lost the video feed of the CBS broadcast. CBS, who had paid $2.5 million for broadcast rights, blamed the glitch on a breakdown in AT&amp;T cable lines.

39.12 million people in the US watched the game on television, resulting in a rating of 36.8 and a market share of 68. The overnight Arbitron rating was 43.

==Ceremonies and entertainment==
The pregame ceremonies featured two giant figures, one dressed as a Packers player and the other dressed as a Raiders player. They appeared on opposite ends of the field and then faced each other near the 50-yard line.

The Grambling College Tiger Marching Band performed the national anthem as well as during the halftime show. The band was part of the halftime show of Super Bowl I the previous year.

==Game summary==
===First quarter===
The game kicked off at 3:05 p.m. EST. On Oakland&#x27;s first offensive play, Green Bay linebacker Ray Nitschke shot through a gap and upended fullback Hewritt Dixon in what was one of Nitschke&#x27;s signature plays of his entire career. The hit was so vicious, it prompted Jerry Green, a &quot;Detroit News&quot; columnist sitting in the press box with fellow journalists, to say in a deadpan, that the game was &quot;over&quot;. After forcing the Raiders to punt on their first possession, the Packers opened up the scoring with kicker Don Chandler&#x27;s 39-yard field goal after marching 34 yards on their first drive of the game, giving Green Bay an early 3–0 lead. The Raiders picked up four first downs on their second drive, which included a pass interference penalty called on Nitschke, but they could not reach field goal range and were forced to punt back to the Packers. Green Bay started their next drive from their own 3-yard line, but picked up 84 yards, during which quarterback Bart Starr completed a 17-yard pass to wide receiver Carroll Dale and then rushed for 14 yards while escaping a sack by defensive end Ben Davidson and defensive tackle Tom Keating. The Packers also elected to convert 4th-and-inches at the Raiders&#x27; 35-yard line, and fullback Ben Wilson picked up 3 yards and the first down to end the quarter.

===Second quarter===
Despite Green Bay&#x27;s excellent field position, their drive stalled at the 13-yard line, forcing them to settle for a 20-yard field goal by Chandler to take a 6–0 lead. Less than two minutes later after forcing an Oakland three-and-out, the Packers took the ball on their own 38-yard line. Raiders cornerback Kent McCloughan jammed Packers wide receiver Boyd Dowler at the line of scrimmage, but then allowed him to head downfield, thinking that a safety would pick him up. However, McCloughan and safety Howie Williams were both influenced by the Packer running backs who were executing a &quot;flood&quot; pattern, with halfback Travis Williams and Wilson running pass routes to the same side as Dowler. Dowler ran a quick post and was wide open down the middle. He grabbed Starr&#x27;s pass well behind linebacker Dan Conners, and safety Rodger Bird could not get over quickly enough. Dowler outran the defense to score on a 62-yard touchdown reception, increasing the Packers&#x27; lead to 13–0. Green Bay became the first team in a Super Bowl to score on its first three possessions on offense.
After being completely dominated until this point, the Raiders offense finally struck back on their next possession, advancing 79 yards in 9 plays, and scoring on a 23-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Daryle Lamonica to wide receiver Bill Miller, cutting the Raiders&#x27; deficit to 13–7. The score seemed to fire up the Raiders&#x27; defense, and they forced the Packers to punt on their next drive. Bird gave the Raiders great field position with a 12-yard return to Green Bay&#x27;s 40-yard line, but Oakland could only gain 1 yard with their next three plays and came up empty when kicker/backup quarterback George Blanda&#x27;s 46-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. Oakland&#x27;s defense again forced Green Bay to punt after three plays on the ensuing drive, but this time after calling for a fair catch, Bird fumbled punter/running back Donny Anderson&#x27;s twisting, left-footed kick, and Packers tight end Dick Capp recovered the ball. After two incomplete passes, Starr threw a 9-yard completion to Dowler (despite a heavy rush from defensive end Ike Lassiter) to set up Chandler&#x27;s third field goal from the 43 as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 16–7 lead.

At halftime, Packers guard Jerry Kramer said to his teammates (referring to Lombardi), &quot;Let&#x27;s play the last 30 minutes for the old man.&quot;

===Third quarter===
Any chance the Raiders might have had to make a comeback seemed to completely vanish in the second half. The Packers had the ball three times in the third quarter, and held it for all but two and a half minutes. On the Packers&#x27; second drive of the half starting at their own 17, Wilson ripped up the middle for 14 yards on a draw play. Anderson picked up 8 yards on a sweep, and Wilson carried to within inches of the first down. Starr then pulled one of his favorite plays on third down and short yardage, faking to Wilson and completing a 35-yard pass to wide receiver Max McGee who had slipped past three Raiders at the line of scrimmage. This was McGee&#x27;s only reception of the game, and the final one of his career. Starr then hit Dale on a sideline route at the Oakland 13. Starr overthrew Anderson wide open in the end zone, but on the next play he rolled out to the right and threw back to Anderson who was tackled at the 2-yard line by linebacker Gus Otto. The next play was a broken play, as Anderson thought he saw daylight to the right but ran into Starr. The Packers were not rattled, and Anderson&#x27;s 2-yard touchdown run increased Green Bay&#x27;s lead to 23–7.

Packers guard Jerry Kramer must have taken to heart his plea to play the second half for Coach Lombardi. On this drive, game films show him blowing Conners out of Wilson&#x27;s path on the draw play, then flattening Conners again on Anderson&#x27;s scoring run.

Again the Green Bay defense forced Oakland to go three-and-out, and the Raiders punted. The Packers drove from their own 39-yard line to the Raiders&#x27; 24 and increased their lead to 26–7 as Chandler kicked his fourth field goal of the game (which hit the crossbar from 31 yards out and bounced over).

===Fourth quarter===
On the Raiders&#x27; first play of the fourth quarter, Lamonica completed a pass to running back Pete Banaszak, but safety Tom Brown forced a fumble on Banaszak, which was recovered and returned to the Raiders&#x27; 37-yard line by linebacker Dave Robinson. On the next play, however, Starr was knocked out of the game when he jammed the thumb on his throwing hand after getting sacked for an 11-yard loss by Davidson. Starr was replaced by Zeke Bratkowski, who was then sacked on his only pass attempt. The Packers could not get back to the original line of scrimmage after the sack, forcing them to punt it back to the Raiders. However, the Packers cemented the game when cornerback Herb Adderley intercepted a pass intended for wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33–7 in favor of Green Bay. Adderley laid back as Biletnikoff ran a curl route, then dashed in front of him to snare the ball and scored with the help of a crushing downfield block by defensive tackle Ron Kostelnik.

Oakland did manage to score on their next drive after the turnover with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Miller, set up by Banaszak&#x27;s 41-yard reception on the previous play. But all the Raiders&#x27; second touchdown did was make the final score look remotely more respectable, 33–14.

At the end of the game, coach Lombardi was carried off the field by his victorious Packers in one of the more memorable images of early Super Bowl history. It was in fact Lombardi&#x27;s last game as Packer coach and his ninth consecutive playoff victory.

Oakland&#x27;s Bill Miller was the top receiver of the game with 5 receptions for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns. Green Bay fullback Ben Wilson was the leading rusher of the game with 62 yards despite missing most of the fourth quarter while looking for a lost contact lens on the sidelines. Don Chandler ended his Packer career in style with 4 field goals. Lamonica, the game&#x27;s leading passer, finished with 15 out of 34 pass completions for 208 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Bart Starr completed 13 of 24 (with a couple of dropped passes) for 202 yards and one touchdown; his passer rating for the game was 96.2 to Lamonica&#x27;s 71.7. The Packers outgained the Raiders in rushing yardage 160 to 107, led in time of possession by 35:54 to 24:06, had no turnovers, and only one penalty. Packer guard Jerry Kramer later recalled the mental mistakes his team made in the game, which only highlights the impossibly high standards held by Lombardi&#x27;s team. As previously mentioned, this was Lombardi&#x27;s last game as Green Bay head coach and this was also the final game for Green Bay Packer players Max McGee, Fuzzy Thurston, and Don Chandler.

<doc id="29130" wikidata="Q376026" url="?curid=29130" title="Super Bowl IV">
<text>Super Bowl IV was an American football game played on January 11, 1970, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the fourth and final AFL–NFL World Championship Game in professional football prior to the AFL–NFL merger taking effect the following season. The American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Minnesota Vikings by the score of 23–7. This victory by the AFL squared the Super Bowl series with the NFL at two games apiece as the two leagues merged after the game.

Despite the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets winning the previous season&#x27;s Super Bowl, many sports writers and fans thought it was a fluke and continued to believe that the NFL was still superior to the AFL, and thus fully expected the Vikings to defeat the Chiefs; the Vikings entered the Super Bowl as 13½ point favorites. Minnesota posted a 12–2 record in , then defeated the Los Angeles Rams 23–20 for the Western Conference title, and the Cleveland Browns 27–7 in the NFL Championship Game. The Chiefs, who previously appeared in the first Super Bowl, finished the regular season at 11–3; they continued with two road wins in the AFL playoffs, dethroning the New York Jets 13–6, and then taking down division rival Oakland Raiders 17–7 in the final AFL title game.

Under wet conditions, the Chiefs defense dominated Super Bowl IV by limiting the Minnesota offense to only 67 rushing yards, forcing three interceptions, and recovering two fumbles. Kansas City&#x27;s Len Dawson became the fourth consecutive winning quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP. He completed 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, with one interception. Dawson also recorded three rushing attempts for 11 yards.

Super Bowl IV is also notable for NFL Films miking up the Chiefs&#x27; Hank Stram during the game, the first time that a head coach had worn a microphone during a Super Bowl.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
The NFL awarded Super Bowl IV to New Orleans on March 19, 1969, at the owners&#x27; meetings held in Palm Springs, California. It marked the first of eleven (as of 2024) Super Bowls to be held in New Orleans. Two cites were in consideration for the game, Miami being the other. After two consecutive Super Bowls played at the Miami Orange Bowl (II and III), owners by a roughly three-quarters vote, opted out of giving Miami the game for a third straight year. Some owners felt that since an AFL town had hosted the game two years in a row, that an NFL town should get another turn to balance out the hosting duties. New Orleans mayor Victor H. Schiro was joined by George W. Healy Jr. (editor of the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot;) and Al Hirt. They highlighted the superior seating capacity (80,982) of Tulane Stadium, as well as the local accommodations. Healy and Miami mayor Stephen P. Clark became locked in a debate during a press conference while the deliberation and voting was going on behind closed doors.

===Minnesota Vikings===
The Minnesota Vikings, led by head coach Bud Grant, entered the game with an NFL best 12–2 regular season record, leading the older league in total points scored (379) and fewest points allowed (133). They had scored 50 or greater points in three different games. They lost their first and last games of the season, but in between had 12 straight victories, the longest single-season winning streak in 35 years. The Vikings broke the previous record of 11 consecutive wins set by the 1964 Colts. Their defense, considered the most intimidating in the NFL, was anchored by a defensive line nicknamed the &quot;Purple People Eaters&quot;, consisting of defensive tackles Gary Larsen and Alan Page, and defensive ends Carl Eller and Jim Marshall. The secondary was led by Bobby Bryant (8 interceptions, 97 return yards), Earsell Mackbee (6 interceptions, 100 return yards), and Paul Krause (5 interceptions, 82 return yards, 1 touchdown).

On offense, quarterback Joe Kapp was known for his superb leadership and his running ability, both throwing on the run and running for extra yards. And when Kapp did take off and run, instead of sliding when he was about to be tackled like most quarterbacks, he lowered his shoulder and went right at the tackler. This style of play earned him the nickname &quot;Indestructible&quot;. In the NFL Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns, he collided with linebacker Jim Houston while running for a first down, and Houston had to be helped off the field after the play ended. Also, Kapp was known for being an extremely unselfish leader: when he was voted the Vikings Most Valuable Player, he turned the award down and said that every player on the team was equally valuable: &quot;There is no one most valuable Viking. There are 40 most valuable Vikings.&quot;

Running back Dave Osborn was the team&#x27;s top rusher with 643 yards and seven touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 236 yards and another touchdown. In the passing game, Pro Bowl wide receiver Gene Washington averaged 21.1 yards per catch by recording 821 yards and nine touchdowns from 39 receptions. Wide receiver John Henderson caught 34 passes for 553 yards and 5 touchdowns. The Vikings&#x27; offensive line was anchored by Pro Bowlers Grady Alderman and Mick Tingelhoff.

By winning the 1969 NFL Championship, the Vikings became the last possessors of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy.

===Kansas City Chiefs===

Meanwhile, it seemed that the Chiefs, led by head coach Hank Stram, and especially quarterback Len Dawson, were jinxed throughout the year. In the second game of the regular season, Dawson suffered a knee injury that kept him from playing the next six games. Then in the following week, second string quarterback Jacky Lee went down for the season with a broken ankle in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. However, third string quarterback Mike Livingston engineered five wins of the next six starts, with Dawson coming off the bench in the second half of the sixth to clinch the win. The Chiefs (11–3) managed to finish in second place behind the Oakland Raiders (12–1–1) in the AFL&#x27;s Western Division, after suffering a tough 10–6 loss to Oakland in the final game of the regular season. After that game, many sports writers and fans heavily criticized the team and Dawson for the poor play calling (Dawson called between 80 and 90 percent of the plays during the season).

After a 34–16 road win over the New York Jets on November 16, the Chiefs clinched a playoff spot at 9–1 with four games remaining. Wanting to set itself up more like the NFL right before the merger, the AFL expanded its 1969 playoffs to four teams, with the second place teams from each division traveling to play the first place teams from the other division (Western champion vs. Eastern runner-up, and vice versa). As a result of the new playoff format, many critics thought the Chiefs entered the playoffs through a &quot;back-door&quot; as the runner-up in the Western division. However, Dawson silenced the critics and led Kansas City to a strong finish with two road wins in the playoffs, defeating the defending champion Jets 13–6, and the Raiders (who had beaten them 41–6 in the previous year&#x27;s postseason and twice in the 1969 season) 17–7 in the AFL Championship Game. This essentially made the Chiefs the first wild card team to play in the Super Bowl. (Dawson says he thinks both the Jets and the Raiders could have beaten the Vikings.)

Still, many people felt that Dawson&#x27;s level of play in the AFL was not comparable to the NFL. Dawson himself had spent five seasons in the NFL as a backup before going to the AFL and becoming one of its top quarterbacks. &quot;The AFL saved my career,&quot; said Dawson. In his 8 AFL seasons, he had thrown more touchdown passes (182) than any other professional football quarterback during that time. But because many still viewed the AFL as being inferior to the NFL, his records were not considered significant. Dawson&#x27;s first chance to prove himself against an NFL team ended in failure, with his Chiefs losing 35–10 to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl I, reinforcing the notion that his success was only due to playing in the &quot;inferior league&quot;.

Offensively, the Chiefs employed innovative formations and strategies designed by Stram to disrupt the timing and positioning of the defense. Besides Dawson, the Chiefs main offensive weapon was running back Mike Garrett (1965 Heisman Trophy winner), who rushed for 732 yards and 6 touchdowns. He also recorded 43 receptions for 432 yards and another 2 touchdowns. Running back Robert Holmes had 612 rushing yards, 266 receiving yards, and 5 touchdowns. Running back Warren McVea rushed for 500 yards and 7 touchdowns, while adding another 318 yards returning kickoffs. In the passing game, wide receiver Otis Taylor caught 41 passes for 696 yards and 7 touchdowns. The offensive line was anchored by AFL All-Stars Ed Budde and Jim Tyrer. According to Len Dawson, placekicker Jan Stenerud and punter Jerrel Wilson were the best kickers in football. The offensive line was led by tackle Jim Tyrer, who was selected to his 6th AFL pro bowl.

The Chiefs defense led the AFL in fewest points allowed (177). Like the Vikings, the Chiefs also had an outstanding defensive line, which was led by defensive tackles Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp, and defensive ends Jerry Mays and Aaron Brown. The Chiefs also had AFL All-Star linebacker Willie Lanier, who recorded 4 interceptions and 1 fumble recovery during the season. The Kansas City secondary was led by defensive backs Emmitt Thomas (9 interceptions for 146 return yards and a touchdown), Jim Kearney (5 interceptions for 154 return yards and a touchdown) and Johnny Robinson (8 interceptions for 158 return yards). Six members of the Chiefs&#x27; defense have been inducted into the Hall of Fame: Culp, Buchanan, Lanier, Thomas, Bobby Bell, and Johnny Robinson.

Kansas City&#x27;s defense had shown their talent in the AFL title game when they defeated the Raiders. Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica had completed 13 of 17 passes for 276 yards and a record setting 6 touchdowns in a 56–7 divisional rout of the Houston Oilers in their previous game, and had shredded the Chiefs with 347 yards and 5 touchdowns in their 41–6 win in the previous season&#x27;s playoffs. But in the 1969 AFL Championship Game, the Chiefs defense held him to just 15 of 39 completions and intercepted him 3 times in the fourth quarter.

===Playoffs===


Kansas City advanced to the Super Bowl with wins over the two previous AFL champions. First they defeated the New York Jets in a defensive struggle 13–6, with Dawson&#x27;s 61-yard completion to Taylor setting up the game winning score on his 19-yard touchdown pass to Gloster Richardson. Kansas City held New York to just 234 yards and forced 4 turnovers.
The Chiefs then faced the Raiders, who took a 7–0 lead over them in the first quarter, but that was their only score of the game. Meanwhile, Dawson&#x27;s 41-yard completion to Frank Pitts in the second quarter set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Wendell Hayes. Then in the third quarter, Emmitt Thomas&#x27; clutch interception in the end zone and Dawson&#x27;s long completion to Taylor sparked a 95-yard drive that ended with a touchdown run by Robert Holmes. Kansas City went into the fourth quarter with a 14–7 lead, and held on for the win by forcing four turnovers (3 interceptions and a turnover on downs) in the final period.

Meanwhile, the ninth-year Vikings recorded their first postseason win in franchise history by defeating the Los Angeles Rams 23–20. Though the Rams held the lead for most of the time in regulation, Kapp led a touchdown drive to give the team a 21–20 fourth quarter lead. Eller made a key play to preserve the lead, sacking Rams quarterback (and 1969 NFL MVP) Roman Gabriel in the end zone for a safety and Alan Page intercepted a pass with thirty seconds remaining.

Then Minnesota quickly demolished the Cleveland Browns in the NFL championship game, jumping to a 24–0 halftime lead and going on to win 27–7. The Vikings offense gained 381 yards without turning the ball over, with Kapp passing for 169 yards and a touchdown, while Osborn rushed for 108 yards and Washington gained 125 yards on just 3 receptions.

===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===
Many sportswriters and fans expected that the Vikings would easily defeat the Chiefs. Although the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets won Super Bowl III at the end of the previous season, many were convinced that it was a fluke. They continued to believe that all of the NFL teams were far and away superior to all of the AFL teams. And regardless of the differences among the leagues, the Vikings simply appeared to be a superior team. Minnesota had the NFL&#x27;s best record and outscored their opponents by 246 points, while Kansas City had not even won their own division. The Chiefs also had played only five games in the regular season against teams who finished with winning records, and eight against teams who finished with losing records, while the Vikings played seven against teams with winning records and seven against teams with losing records. Including playoffs, Minnesota had not lost a game against a winning team.

Super Bowl IV provided another chance to show that Dawson belonged at the same level with all of the great NFL quarterbacks. But five days before the Super Bowl, news leaked that his name had been linked to a Detroit federal gambling investigation. Although Dawson was eventually cleared of any charges, the controversy added to the pressure he was already under while preparing for the game, causing him to lose sleep and concentration. &quot;It was, beyond a doubt, the toughest week of my life,&quot; said Dawson.

Bud Grant became the first Super Bowl coach not to wear a tie. His counterpart, Hank Stram, wore a three-piece suit, with a red vest and a blazer with the Chiefs&#x27; helmet logo emblazoned on the breast pocket.

All seats for the game were priced at $15; the previous year&#x27;s prices were $12, $8 and $6. The attendance mark of 80,562 is the highest of the first four pre-merger Super Bowl games played.

==Broadcasting==
===American television===
Super Bowl IV was broadcast in the United States by CBS with play-by-play announcer Jack Buck (his only Super Bowl on television) and color commentator Pat Summerall, with Frank Gifford and Jack Whitaker reporting from the winning and losing locker rooms, respectively. After the season, Summerall was transferred to work alongside Ray Scott, whose broadcast partner Paul Christman died on March 2, 1970. This was the last Super Bowl that Gifford worked for CBS, as he left following the 1970 season to become the play-by-play announcer for Monday Night Football. Gifford did not work another Super Bowl until Super Bowl XIX, the first Super Bowl to air on ABC. 

While the game was a sellout, the NFL&#x27;s unconditional blackout rules prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the New Orleans area. 

CBS erased the videotape a few days after the game, as the network had done following the broadcasts of Super Bowl I and II. Videotape was expensive and television networks did not believe that old games were worth saving. For many years, the only known extant recording of the broadcast was one sourced from the CBC archives. The network and its French-language counterpart Télévision de Radio-Canada carried the broadcast, and it was saved because of Vikings coach Bud Grant&#x27;s history in the CFL and the close proximity of Minnesota to Canada. CBC transferred the footage to black-and-white film using the kinescope process soon after the original broadcast, enabling reuse of the videotape. However, a color videotape of the first three quarters and a portion of the fourth quarter, including the pregame show and original commercials, was discovered in 2023 and is publicly available.

44.27 million people in the U.S. watched the game on television, resulting in a rating of 39.4 and a market share of 69.

===Hank Stram and NFL Films===
The night before the game, Ed Sabol of NFL Films met with Hank Stram and convinced him to wear a hidden microphone during the game so that Stram&#x27;s comments could be recorded for the NFL Films Super Bowl IV film. This was the first time that a head coach had worn a microphone during a Super Bowl, although Stram had done so during the regular season in a home game against the Boston Patriots. Sabol and Stram agreed that the microphone would be kept secret. Sabol had his top sound man Jack Newman, who had also wired Vince Lombardi in a previous playoff game, conceal the microphone on Stram and monitor the sound throughout. However, some Chiefs players noticed that Stram&#x27;s demeanor deviated from his normal form during the game, ostensibly because he was aware of the microphone. Linebacker Willie Lanier commented that &quot;Hank seemed somewhat more animated&quot;, quarterback Len Dawson &quot;wondered why he was being so joyous and chattering all the time&quot; and halfback Mike Garrett recalled that Stram &quot;was in rare form and pretty glib&quot;.

Stram&#x27;s awareness of the microphone likely resulted in a direct impact on the game itself. Dawson later recalled that &quot;I thought there was something wrong with Hank&quot; because Stram selected the Chiefs&#x27; offensive play calls during the game and communicated them directly to Dawson, while Dawson had routinely called his own plays during the season.

Because of Stram&#x27;s colorful soundbites throughout the film, it ranks among the most popular and well-known of all official Super Bowl highlight films, despite the fact that the game was a mostly one-sided affair. Notable excerpts include the following:
* To Len Dawson: &quot;C&#x27;mon Lenny! Pump it in there, baby! Just keep matriculating the ball down the field, boys!&quot;
* Observing the confusion in the Vikings&#x27; defense: &quot;Kassulke (Vikings strong safety Karl Kassulke) was running around there like it was a Chinese fire drill. They didn&#x27;t know where Mike (Garrett) was. Didn&#x27;t know where he was! They look like they&#x27;re flat as hell.&quot;
* Before the Chiefs&#x27; first touchdown, Stram called the play known as 65 Toss Power Trap. When the Chiefs scored on the play, Stram laughed while yelling to his players on the bench, &quot;Was it there, boys? Was that there, rats? Nice going, baby! Haaa-haaa-haaa-ha-ha-ha! Haaa! The mentor! 65 Toss Power Trap! Yaaa-haaa-haaa-ha-ha! Yaaa-ha-ha! I tell ya that baby was there, yes sir boys! Haa-ha-ha-ha-ha! Wooo!!&quot;
* As the referees were spotting the ball to determine whether the Vikings had gained a first down, Stram yelled to the officials, &quot;Make sure you mark it right! Oh, you lost your place! Measure it, take the chains out there! Oh, they didn&#x27;t make it! My God, they made that by an inch! He definitely gave them an extra foot. Bad! Very bad!&quot;
* When the officials overruled what looked like a Minnesota fumble, Stram said: &quot;Mr. Official, let me ask you something. How can six of you miss a play like that? Huh? All six of you! When the ball jumped out of there as soon as we made contact?... No. What??&quot;
* After a reverse play in the third quarter that resulted in a first down, Stram said to the officials, &quot;Ya did good, you marked it good. You did a helluva job, nice going!&quot;
* On Otis Taylor&#x27;s touchdown reception that clinched the game, Stram was heard yelling and laughing.
* In the fourth quarter, Stram congratulated Johnny Robinson and Willie Lanier following interceptions, as well as special teamer and reserve linebacker Bob Stein.
* When reserve quarterback Mike Livingston entered the game to relieve Dawson with the game in hand, Stram told Dawson, &quot;Nice going, Leonard. Nice going, baby. Nice going, baby.&quot;
* As the clock counted down the final seconds, Stram exclaimed, &quot;How sweet it is!&quot;.

==Game summary==
Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, who was also the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator, devised an effective game plan against the Vikings. He knew Minnesota&#x27;s secondary was able to play very far off receivers because Viking defensive ends Carl Eller and Jim Marshall knocked down short passes or put pressure on the quarterback. Stram decided to double-team Marshall and Eller; most of quarterback Len Dawson&#x27;s completions were short passes, and neither Marshall nor Eller knocked down any passes. Stram also concluded that the Vikings&#x27; aggressiveness on defense also made them susceptible to trap plays; Mike Garrett&#x27;s rushing touchdown came on a trap play. On offense, the Vikings&#x27; inside running game depended on center Mick Tingelhoff blocking linebackers. Stram put 285-pound Buck Buchanan or 295-pound Curley Culp nose to nose in front of Tingelhoff, who weighed only 235 pounds. To Minnesota&#x27;s credit, the NFL used the so-called light &quot;greyhound&quot; centers while the AFL used big centers. It was a mismatch that disrupted the Vikings&#x27; running game; it also kept quarterback Joe Kapp from moving outside the pocket. Left defensive end Jerry Mays said of the odd line formation, &quot;...we never played it that much before. Minnesota&#x27;s recognition was destroyed.&quot; Wrote Dawson, &quot;It was obvious that their offense had never seen a defense like ours.&quot; Minnesota rushed for only two first downs.

===First quarter===
The Vikings began the game by receiving the opening kickoff and marching from their own 20-yard line to the Kansas City 39-yard line with quarterback Joe Kapp completing his first two passes for 36 yards. Kapp&#x27;s next pass was also a completion, but running back Bill Brown was slowed by linebacker Bobby Bell, then brought down by defensive end Jerry Mays for a 1-yard loss to make it third down, on which Kapp failed to connect with tight end John Beasley. Minnesota rushed for only 6 yards on the drive and chose to punt. The Chiefs then drove 42 yards in eight plays. Included was a 20-yard reception by wide receiver Frank Pitts after Vikings cornerback Ed Sharockman gambled trying to make an interception. Kansas City then scored on placekicker Jan Stenerud&#x27;s Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal. This record stood for 24 years until broken by Steve Christie in Super Bowl XXVIII. (According to Dawson, the Vikings were shocked that the Chiefs attempted a 48-yard field goal. Stenerud was among the first soccer-style placekickers in professional football. The others included brothers Charlie and Pete Gogolak. The soccer-style placekickers used the instep of the foot while the conventional professional football placekickers kicked straight on with their toes. &quot;Stenerud was a major factor,&quot; Dawson said.) Minnesota then managed to reach midfield on their next drive, which was even aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on Chiefs linebacker Bob Stein during a punt from their own 25-yard line, but could not get in scoring position and were forced to punt again.

On the first play of the Chiefs&#x27; ensuing drive, Dawson threw a 20-yard completion to Pitts, followed by a 9-yard pass to wide receiver Otis Taylor, to get to midfield before the end of the quarter.

===Second quarter===
Four plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, a pass interference penalty on Sharockman nullified Dawson&#x27;s third down incompletion and gave Kansas City a new set of downs at the Minnesota 31-yard line. However, on 3rd-and-4 at the 25-yard line, Vikings cornerback Earsell Mackbee broke up a deep pass intended for Taylor, forcing the Chiefs to settle for a 32-yard field goal by Stenerud, increasing their lead to 6–0.

On the second play of Minnesota&#x27;s next drive, Chiefs cornerback Jim Marsalis forced a fumble on wide receiver John Henderson, who caught a 16-yard reception, and safety Johnny Robinson recovered the ball at the Vikings&#x27; 46-yard line. But defensive tackle Alan Page tackled running back Mike Garrett for a 1-yard loss, and then safety Paul Krause intercepted Dawson&#x27;s pass to Taylor at the 7-yard line on the next play, turning the ball back over to the Vikings.

However, the Vikings also could not take advantage of the turnover. Kapp&#x27;s two incompletions and a delay of game penalty forced Minnesota to punt from their own 5-yard line. The Chiefs then took over at the Viking 44-yard line after punter/backup quarterback Bob Lee&#x27;s kick traveled 39 yards. A 19-yard run by Pitts on an end around play fooled the overaggressive, over-pursuing Viking defense to set up Stenerud&#x27;s 25-yard field goal, increasing Kansas City&#x27;s lead to 9–0.

On the ensuing kickoff, Vikings safety/kick returner Charlie West fumbled the ball, and Chiefs center Remi Prudhomme recovered it at the Minnesota 19-yard line. (&quot;That was a key, key play,&quot; said Dawson.) Defensive end Jim Marshall sacked Dawson for an 8-yard loss on the first play of the drive; however, a 13-yard run on a draw play by running back Wendell Hayes and a 10-yard reception by Taylor gave the Chiefs a first down at the Vikings&#x27; 4-yard line. Three plays later, Garrett&#x27;s 5-yard touchdown run on a trap draw play named 65 Toss Power Trap (although the play did not involve a toss), aided by pulling guard Mo Moorman&#x27;s block on Page that cleared a huge hole, gave Kansas City a 16–0 lead.

West returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to the 32-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Kapp completed a 27-yard pass to Henderson to advance the ball to the Kansas City 41-yard line. However, on the next three plays, Kapp threw two incompletions and was sacked by Chief defensive tackle Buck Buchanan for an 8-yard loss. On fourth down, Vikings kicker Fred Cox&#x27;s 56-yard field goal attempt fell way short of the goal posts and was caught and returned to the Chiefs&#x27; 24-yard line by kick returner Warren McVea. Kansas City could not get the ball past midfield, so they punted it back to Minnesota to end the half. For the first half, Minnesota rushed for only 24 yards and failed to convert any of five third downs. On nine first down plays, the Vikings rushed six times and gained only 12 yards.

To this point in the combined history of NFL and AFL championship games, including the first three Super Bowls, no team had lost a game when holding a lead of more than 10 points, no matter what time of the game it was. The Chiefs, when they were the Dallas Texans in their last game before they became the Chiefs, lost a 17–0 lead in the 1962 AFL Championship Game, but managed to defeat the Houston Oilers 20–17 in the second overtime. No team would lose such a lead and also lose the game until Super Bowl LI.
===Third quarter===
In the third quarter, the Vikings managed to build momentum. After the Chiefs punted on their opening possession, Minnesota drove 69 yards in 10 plays, during which they made their first third down conversion of the game. Kapp completed four consecutive passes for 47 yards, including a 15-yard pass to tight end John Beasley. Kapp also rushed for 7 yards. The Vikings&#x27; drive ended with fullback Dave Osborn&#x27;s 4-yard touchdown run, reducing their deficit to 16–7. However, the Chiefs responded on their next possession with a six-play, 82-yard drive. Pitts picked up a key first down with a 7-yard left-to-right run on a reverse play. Then right after a 15-yard personal foul penalty against the Vikings, Dawson threw a short pass to Taylor, who caught the ball at the Minnesota 41-yard line, broke tackles by Mackbee and safety Karl Kassulke, took off down the sideline and scored the clinching touchdown on a 46-yard play, making the score 23–7. The Vikings reached their own 47 on their next possession to end the quarter.

===Fourth quarter===
The Vikings were demoralized after the game-breaking touchdown and the Chiefs&#x27; defense continued to shut them down in the fourth quarter, forcing three interceptions on three Minnesota possessions to clinch the 23–7 victory. The defeat was total for the Vikings, as even Kapp had to be helped off the field in the fourth quarter after getting strip-sacked by Chiefs defensive end Aaron Brown. Gary Cuozzo filled in for Kapp for the rest of the game. Fittingly, the Vikings&#x27; final play was an interception Cuozzo threw to cornerback Emmitt Thomas.

Kansas City running back and future University of Southern California Athletic Director Mike Garrett, the 1965 Heisman Trophy recipient, was the top rusher of the game, recording 11 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown. He also caught two passes for 25 yards and returned a kickoff for 18 yards. Taylor was the Chiefs&#x27; leading receiver with six catches for 81 yards and a touchdown. Kapp finished the game with 16 of 25 completions for 183 yards, with two costly interceptions. Henderson was the top receiver of the game with seven catches for 111 yards. The Chiefs defense completely shut down Minnesota&#x27;s vaunted rushing attack. In the NFL championship game, Osborn had rushed for 108 yards while Kapp rushed for 57. In Super Bowl IV, however, the two rushed for a combined total of 24 yards. In addition, Kansas City&#x27;s secondary held Minnesota All Pro receiver Gene Washington to one reception for 9 yards.

Referring to the Vikings&#x27; three interceptions, three fumbles, and six penalties, Kassulke said, &quot;We made more mental mistakes in one game than we did in one season.&quot; Kapp never played again for the Vikings, as he played out the option of his contract and signed with the Boston Patriots for the 1970 season.

Kansas City is, , the only team in the Super Bowl era to win the title without allowing as much as 10 points in any postseason game.

<doc id="29131" wikidata="Q168380" url="?curid=29131" title="Super Bowl V">
<text>Super Bowl V was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Dallas Cowboys to determine the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1970 season. It was the fifth edition of the Super Bowl and the first modern-era NFL championship game. The Colts defeated the Cowboys by the score of 16–13 on a field goal with 5 seconds left in the game. The game was played on January 17, 1971, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, and was the first Super Bowl game played on artificial turf; specifically, the game was played on a Poly-Turf surface.

The game was the first Super Bowl played after the completion of the AFL–NFL merger. Beginning with this game and continuing to the present day, the Super Bowl has served as the NFL&#x27;s championship game, with the winner of the AFC Championship Game and the winner of the NFC Championship Game facing off in the culmination of the NFL playoffs. As per the merger agreement, all 26 AFL and NFL teams were divided into two conferences with 13 teams in each. Along with the Colts, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to join the ten AFL teams to form the AFC; the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC. This explains why the Colts represented the NFL in Super Bowl III, but the AFC for Super Bowl V. Baltimore advanced to Super Bowl V after posting an regular season record. Meanwhile, the Cowboys were making their first Super Bowl appearance after posting a regular season record.

The game is often referred to as the &quot;Blunder Bowl,&quot; &quot;Blooper Bowl,&quot; or &quot;Stupor Bowl&quot; due to it being marred with poor play, a blocked PAT, missed opportunities, penalties, turnovers, and officiating miscues. The two teams combined for a Super Bowl record 11 turnovers, with five solely in the fourth quarter. The Colts&#x27; seven turnovers remain the most committed by a Super Bowl champion. Dallas also set a Super Bowl record with 10 penalties, costing them 133 yards. It was finally settled when Colts rookie kicker Jim O&#x27;Brien made a 32-yard field goal with five seconds left in regulation time, then a Super Bowl record for least time in the lead for a champion. Baltimore overcame a 13–6 deficit after three quarters and the loss of its starting quarterback Johnny Unitas to an injury in the second quarter. To date, the game is the only Super Bowl in which the Most Valuable Player Award was given to a member of the losing team: Cowboys&#x27; linebacker Chuck Howley, the first non-quarterback to win the award, after making two interceptions (sacks and tackles were not yet recorded).

Due to its blunders, the game is often regarded among the worst Super Bowls played, but is also recognized as the title the Colts needed after losing Super Bowl III.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
The NFL awarded Super Bowl V to Miami on March 17, 1970, at the owners&#x27; meeting held in Honolulu. It marked the third Super Bowl to be played in the Orange Bowl. Three cities submitted bids: Miami, New Orleans, and Los Angeles (Coliseum). A potential bid by Pasadena (Rose Bowl) failed to materialize, and Houston (Astrodome) dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with conventions.

===Baltimore Colts===

The Colts were an unspectacular but well-balanced veteran team, led by 37-year-old star quarterback Johnny Unitas. He had regained his starting spot on the team in 1969 upon recovering from an injury that led him to miss the majority of the 1968 season. Unitas played inconsistently during the 1970 regular season; he threw for 2,213 yards, but recorded more interceptions than touchdowns. He also had injury problems, missing two regular season games and giving Earl Morrall more significant playing time. Morrall put up better statistics (792 yards, 9 touchdowns, 4 interceptions, and a 97.6 passer rating), but head coach Don McCafferty decided to start Unitas for the playoffs. (According to Jim O&#x27;Brien, Morrall was just as good as Unitas in the players&#x27; opinion.)

In addition, Baltimore had three solid weapons in the passing game: wide receivers Eddie Hinton and Roy Jefferson, and future Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey combined for 119 receptions, 1,917 yards, and 15 touchdowns. In the backfield, running back Norm Bulaich was the team&#x27;s top rusher with 426 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also catching 11 passes for another 123 yards.

The Colts&#x27; main strength was their defense. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Bubba Smith anchored the line. Behind him, the Colts had two outstanding linebackers: Pro Bowler Mike Curtis, who recorded 5 interceptions, and Ted Hendricks. In the secondary, Pro Bowl safety Jerry Logan recorded 6 interceptions for 92 return yards and 2 touchdowns, while safety Rick Volk had 4 interceptions for 61 return yards.

Don Klosterman, formerly with San Diego, Kansas City, and Houston in the AFL, became the Colts&#x27; general manager in 1970. Future Colts GM Ernie Accorsi was the public relations director.

Baltimore finished the regular season winning the AFC East with an record, the best in the AFC. Only the Minnesota Vikings had a better record among all NFL teams at 

===Dallas Cowboys===
The Cowboys overcame many obstacles during the regular season. Running back Calvin Hill, the team&#x27;s second leading rusher with 577 yards and four touchdowns, was lost for the year after suffering a leg injury late in the regular season. And wide receiver Bob Hayes was benched by head coach Tom Landry for poor performances on several occasions.

Most significantly, the Cowboys had a quarterback controversy between Craig Morton and Roger Staubach; the two alternated as starters during the regular season. Landry eventually settled on Morton for most of the latter half of the season, because he felt less confident that Staubach would follow his game plan (Landry called all of Morton&#x27;s plays). Also, Morton had done extremely well in the regular season, throwing for 1,819 yards and 15 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions, earning him a passer rating of 89.8. In contrast, Staubach, although a noted scrambler and able to salvage broken plays effectively, threw for 542 yards, and only two touchdowns with eight interceptions, giving him a 42.9 rating.

Hayes was the main deep threat on the team, catching 34 passes for 889 yards (a 26.1 yards per catch average) and ten touchdowns, while also rushing four times for 34 yards and another touchdown, and adding another 116 yards returning punts. On the other side of the field, wide receiver Lance Rentzel (who would be deactivated for the last few weeks of the season and postseason following an indecent exposure charge; being replaced in the starting lineup by Reggie Rucker) recorded 28 receptions for 556 yards and 5 touchdowns.
However, the main strength on the Cowboys offense was their running game. Rookie running back Duane Thomas rushed 151 times for 803 yards (a 5.1 yards per carry average) and five touchdowns, while adding another 416 yards returning kickoffs. Fullback Walt Garrison, who replaced the injured Hill, provided Thomas with excellent blocking and rushed for 507 yards and three touchdowns. Garrison was also a good receiver out of the backfield, catching 21 passes for 205 yards and 2 touchdowns. Up front, Pro Bowl guard John Niland and Rayfield Wright anchored the offensive line.

Like the Colts, the Cowboys&#x27; main strength was their defense. Nicknamed the &quot;Doomsday Defense&quot;, they allowed just one touchdown in their last six games prior to the Super Bowl. Their line was anchored by future Hall of Fame defensive tackle Bob Lilly. Behind him, linebackers Lee Roy Jordan, Dave Edwards, and Chuck Howley excelled at stopping the run and pass coverage. The Cowboys had an outstanding secondary, led by Mel Renfro and Herb Adderley, who combined for seven interceptions. Dallas also had two rookie safeties: Future Hall of Famer Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters, who led the team with five interceptions, while Harris recorded two.

Dallas finished the regular season winning the NFC East with a record, winning their final five regular season games to overcome the St. Louis Cardinals (who lost their final three games and fell to third place in the final standings) and New York Giants (who lost their finale to the Los Angeles Rams; a Giants victory would have given New York the NFC East title based upon a better division record and forced a coin toss between the Cowboys and Detroit Lions for the wild card playoff spot).

===Playoffs===

In the playoffs, Dallas defeated Detroit in sunny weather at the Cotton Bowl, with a field goal and a safety. Later, the Cowboys overcame the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC championship game, aided by Thomas&#x27; 143 rushing yards, along with interceptions by Renfro and Jordan late in the third quarter that were both converted into touchdowns.

Meanwhile, the Colts advanced to the Super Bowl by beating the Cincinnati Bengals and the Oakland Raiders in the playoffs at Memorial Stadium.

===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===
For the Colts, Super Bowl V represented a chance to redeem themselves for their humiliating loss to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III. Volk commented, &quot;Going to the game a second time took away some of the awe. I think we were able to focus better. There was no way we were going to let ourselves get beat again.&quot;
Meanwhile, the game was a chance for the Cowboys to lose their nickname of &quot;next year&#x27;s champions&quot; and their reputation of &quot;not being able to win the big games&quot;. In the past five seasons, Dallas had won more games, 52 of 68, than any other professional football team, but they had yet to win a league title. The Cowboys had chances to go to the first two Super Bowls, but narrowly lost to the Green Bay Packers in both the 1966 and 1967 NFL Championship games. In the 1966 title game, the Cowboys failed to score a potential tying touchdown on four attempts starting from the Packers two-yard line on the game&#x27;s final drive. Then in the 1967 title game (the &quot;Ice Bowl&quot;), the Cowboys lost because they allowed the Packers to score a touchdown with sixteen seconds left in the game.

As the designated home team, Dallas was forced to wear its blue jerseys for the Super Bowl under rules in place at the time, which did not allow the home team its choice of jersey color, unlike the regular season and playoff games leading up to the Super Bowl. Dallas had not worn its blue jerseys at home since 1963, as Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm opted to have the team wear white at home in order to present fans with a consistent look. The Cowboys wore their blue jerseys twice during the 1970 season, losing 20–7 at St. Louis in week three and winning 6–2 at Cleveland in week 13. The designated home team was first allowed its choice of jersey color for Super Bowl XIII, allowing the Cowboys to wear white vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Gambling establishments had the Colts as 2 ½ point favorites and projected 36 total points scored.

Vice President Spiro Agnew, a Colts fan since the team began playing in Baltimore in 1953, attended the game. Agnew was Governor of Maryland prior to his election as Richard Nixon&#x27;s running mate in 1968. Nixon himself was a huge football fan and had a vacation home in Key Biscayne, approximately ten miles from the Orange Bowl.
Also in attendance was boxing great Muhammad Ali, who signed autographs for many young fans. Ali was in south Florida training for his March 8 heavyweight championship fight vs. Joe Frazier in New York City.

Kickoff for this game was at 2:00 pm, making it the earliest starting time in the Eastern Time Zone in Super Bowl history, and one of only three Super Bowls to start in the morning for viewers in the Pacific Time Zone (the others were Super Bowl VI in New Orleans and Super Bowl X in Miami).

==Broadcasting==
The game was broadcast in the United States by NBC with play-by-play announcer Curt Gowdy, color commentator Kyle Rote, and sideline reporter Bill Enis.

Although the Orange Bowl was sold out for the event, unconditional blackout rules in the NFL in the era prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area. The blackout was challenged in Miami-Dade District Court by attorney Ellis Rubin, and although the judge denied Rubin&#x27;s request since he felt he did not have the power to overrule the NFL, he agreed with Rubin&#x27;s argument that the blackout rule was unnecessary for the Super Bowl. The game was also the first Super Bowl to be carried live in the state of Alaska, thanks to NBC&#x27;s then-parent company RCA acquiring the Alaska Communications System from the United States Air Force.

The video of the complete original broadcast, up until Chuck Howley&#x27;s second interception, the first play of the fourth quarter, exists; however, the rest of the fourth quarter is missing from network vaults. The complete audio, including the post-game, does exist. Broadcast excerpts of the crucial fourth-quarter plays, recovered from the Canadian feed of NBC&#x27;s original, also exist and circulate among collectors. (Two different NFL Films game compilations also cover the fourth-quarter plays, in part.)

46.04 million people in the US watched the game on television, resulting in a rating of 39.9 and a market share of 75.

==Entertainment==
The bands from Southern University and Southeast Missouri State College performed before the game, while trumpeter Tommy Loy played the national anthem. Loy also played the anthem before every Cowboys&#x27; home game from the mid-1960s until the late-1980s. The Southeast Missouri State Golden Eagle Band was featured during the halftime show along with singer Anita Bryant.

The game had one of the first planned jet fly-bys. The fly-by, which was supposed to happen right at the end of the national anthem, ended up coming 5 minutes after the anthem had ended.

This was the third consecutive (and final) Super Bowl to feature the Vince Lombardi Trophy on the 50-yard line. Originally the trophy was supposed to be painted gray, but the league changed it to silver which led to problems washing it out of the poly turf surface.

===Halftime show===
The Super Bowl V halftime show was headlined by the Southeast Missouri State Marching Band, with Anita Bryant as a guest. Up with People were also included as performers.

This was the third time that the Southeast Missouri State Marching Band had performed at the Miami Orange Bowl (venue of Super Bowl V), having previously performed during the halftime of the 1965 and 1969 Orange Bowl games. The band was directed by LeRoy Mason. During their stay in Miami for the game, the band was accommodated at the McAllister Hotel.

During the roughly 13-minute performance, floats representing each of the league&#x27;s 26 teams were utilized. Members of two high school bands were utilized to form a geographic outline of the United States.

In the performance, Bryant, standing on a float, sang, &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. The arrangement of this song was created by her musical director Charles Bird, and had been created for the band to accompany her. It had been adapted from a previous recording Bryant had done of the tune.
==Game summary==

===First quarter===
The first three possessions of Super Bowl V ended quietly with each team punting after a three-and-out. Then, after a facemask penalty on Dallas during a punt back to Baltimore for the second time, the Colts started their second drive on their own 47-yard line, but on the first play, Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley intercepted a pass from Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas and returned it 22 yards to the Colts&#x27; 46-yard line, the first of 11 combined turnovers committed by both teams. The Cowboys failed to take advantage of the turnover, with a 15-yard holding penalty 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage pushing them back to a 3rd-and-33 situation. Fullback Walt Garrison could only gain 11 yards on the next play, forcing Dallas to punt. However, Colts punt returner/cornerback Ron Gardin fumbled the return, and the loose ball was recovered by Cowboys safety Cliff Harris at the Colts&#x27; 9-yard line. Baltimore managed to keep Dallas out of the end zone, forcing them to settle for kicker Mike Clark&#x27;s 14-yard field goal to establish a 3–0 lead.

After a Colts punt, which they failed to keep from reaching the end zone, Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton completed a 14-yard pass to running back Dan Reeves, followed by a 41-yard pass to wide receiver Bob Hayes (Morton&#x27;s longest pass of the game) to reach the Colts&#x27; 12-yard line, with a roughing the passer penalty on Colts defensive tackle Fred Miller adding 6 yards (half the distance to the goal), but Dallas was denied the end zone by the Baltimore defense for a second time. Linebacker Ted Hendricks deflected Morton&#x27;s pass on first down, and running back Duane Thomas was tackled for a 1-yard loss on second down by cornerback Jim Duncan.

===Second quarter===
At the start of the second quarter, Morton was flagged for intentional grounding on third down while trying to avoid a sack by defensive tackle Billy Ray Smith, pushing the Cowboys back to the 22-yard line and forcing them to settle for Clark&#x27;s 30-yard field goal, stretching the score to 6–0.

On their next possession, the Colts offense got a break. After two straight incompletions to open the drive, Unitas uncorked a pass to wide receiver Eddie Hinton that was both high and behind the receiver. The ball ricocheted off Hinton&#x27;s hands, was tipped by Cowboys cornerback Mel Renfro, then landed in the arms of tight end John Mackey, who sprinted 75 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys subsequently blocked kicker Jim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s extra point attempt to keep the score tied at 6–6, with O&#x27;Brien later saying that he was &quot;awfully nervous&quot; and hesitated a second too long before kicking it.

After the next three possessions ended in punts, Cowboys linebacker Lee Roy Jordan forced a fumble on Unitas, and defensive tackle Jethro Pugh recovered the loose ball at the Baltimore 28. Dallas capitalized on the turnover in three plays; Thomas rushed for 4 yards, then Morton completed a 17-yard pass to Reeves, followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass to Thomas to establish a 13–6 lead. The Colts reached the Cowboys&#x27; 37 on their next drive, but turned the ball over yet again, with Unitas unleashing a fluttering interception to Renfro while taking a fierce hit by defensive end George Andrie. Unitas was knocked out of the game permanently on the play with a rib injury and was replaced by Earl Morrall, who was widely blamed for the Colts&#x27; loss to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III. The Cowboys, starting from their own 15, were unable to score any points off the turnover. An offensive pass interference penalty on Hayes forced Dallas to punt. Starting from their own 48-yard line, the Colts offense, now led by Morrall, began to gain momentum. Morrall completed a 26-yard pass to Hinton, followed by a 21-yard pass to wide receiver Roy Jefferson. A personal foul penalty on Jordan put the ball on the Dallas 2-yard line with less than two minutes remaining in the half and giving Baltimore a chance to tie the game. However, the Cowboys defense stiffened. Colts running back Norm Bulaich was stuffed on three consecutive rushing attempts from inside the 2-yard line. The Colts elected to convert fourth down, but Morrall threw a pass intended for tight end Tom Mitchell that fell incomplete, turning the ball over on downs and maintaining Dallas&#x27; 13–6 lead to end the half.

===Third quarter===
The second half was a parade of turnovers, sloppy plays, penalties, and missed opportunities. Baltimore&#x27;s defense also held Dallas&#x27; offense scoreless for the rest of the game.

Duncan fumbled the opening kickoff while running into Cowboys running back Claxton Welch, and Dallas recovered the ball at Baltimore&#x27;s 31. Then the Cowboys drove to the Colts&#x27; 2-yard line with the chance to take a two-score lead, but linebacker Mike Curtis punched the ball loose from Thomas before he could cross the goal line, and the Colts took over at their own 1 as Duncan was credited with the recovery–-a controversial call because when the resulting pile-up was sorted out, Dallas center Dave Manders was seen holding the ball. The energized Colts then drove to the Cowboys&#x27; 44-yard line, with Morrall completing a 26-yard pass to wide receiver Sam Havrilak, but came up empty when O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s 52-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. However, instead of attempting to return the missed field goal, Renfro allowed it to bounce inside the Cowboys&#x27; own 1-yard line where it was downed by Colts center Tom Goode (NFL rules prior to 1974 allowed a field goal that fell short of the goal posts to be downed just like a punt; that rule is still in effect in high school football). &quot;I thought it would carry into the end zone&quot;, Renfro explained after the game.

Dallas, backed up to their own end zone, punted after a three-and-out. The Colts would have received the ball inside Dallas territory following the punt, but a clipping penalty on Baltimore running back Jack Maitland pushed the Colts back to their own 39 to begin the drive. Two plays later, however, Morrall completed a 45-yard pass to running back Tom Nowatzke to reach the Cowboys&#x27; 15-yard line.

===Fourth quarter===
However, three plays later, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Morrall threw an interception to Howley in the end zone to preserve the Cowboys&#x27; 13–6 lead.

After forcing the Cowboys to punt, the Colts regained the ball on their own 18-yard line, still trailing 13–6. Aided by a pass interference penalty on Dallas safety Charlie Waters and a 23-yard pass from Morrall to Jefferson, the Colts advanced into Dallas territory. A second pass interference penalty, which was called on defensive back Cornell Green, gave the Colts a first down at the Dallas 39-yard-line. An 8-yard run by Nowatzke moved the ball to the 31-yard line. The Colts then attempted to fool the Cowboys with a flea-flicker, resulting in one of the oddest plays in Super Bowl history. Havrilak took a handoff and ran right, intending to lateral the ball back to Morrall, but Pugh stormed into the backfield and prevented him from doing so. Havrilak (who played quarterback at Bucknell University) then threw a pass intended for Mackey, but it was caught instead by Hinton, who promptly took off for the end zone. However, Green stripped Hinton from behind at the 11, and the loose ball bounced wildly into the end zone, evading recovery attempts by six different players until it was eventually pushed through the back of the end zone for a touchback, thus returning the ball to the Cowboys at their 20.

Three plays after the turnover, Morton threw a pass that was deflected by Garrison and intercepted by Colts safety Rick Volk, who returned the ball 30 yards to the Cowboys&#x27; 3-yard line before being tackled by wide receiver Reggie Rucker (Morrall later referred to that play as the play of the game). Two plays later, Nowatzke scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, tying the game at 13–13. (O&#x27;Brien says he was much calmer and more confident on this extra point than on the first one, which was blocked.)

The next two possessions ended in traded punts, with the Cowboys eventually taking over in excellent field position at the Colts 48-yard line with less than two minutes left in the game.

On the second play of this potential game-winning drive, a 15-yard holding penalty on Cowboys offensive tackle Ralph Neely on the Dallas 42-yard line, which was a spot foul, pushed the Cowboys all the way back to their own 27-yard line (the NFL did not reduce the penalty for offensive holding to 10 yards until 1974). Then, on 2nd-and-35, Morton threw a pass that slipped through the hands of Reeves and bounced for an interception into the arms of Mike Curtis, who then returned the ball 13 yards to the Cowboys&#x27; 28-yard line.

Two plays later, with nine seconds left in the game, O&#x27;Brien kicked the go ahead 32-yard field goal, giving Baltimore their first lead of the game, 16–13. O&#x27;Brien says he was &quot;on automatic&quot; and was so calm and concentrating so hard that he didn&#x27;t hear anything and saw only the ball. After the field goal, in an enduring image, Cowboys defensive tackle Bob Lilly took off his helmet and hurled it through the air in disgust.

The Cowboys received the ball again on their own 40 with one second remaining after O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ensuing squib kick, but Morton&#x27;s pass to Hayes was intercepted by safety Jerry Logan at the Baltimore 29, and the Colts were victorious.

===Postscript===
Morrall was the top passer of the game, with 7 out of 15 completions for 147 yards, with 1 interception. Before being knocked out of the game, Unitas completed 3 out of 9 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown, with 2 interceptions. Morton completed more passes than Morrall and Unitas combined (12), but finished the game with 118 fewer passing yards (127), and was intercepted 3 times (all in the fourth quarter). Mackey was the top receiver of the game with 2 receptions for 80 yards and a touchdown. Nowatzke was the Colts&#x27; leading rusher with 33 yards and a touchdown, while also catching a pass for 47 yards. Dallas running back Walt Garrison was the leading rusher of the game with 65 rushing yards, and added 19 yards on 2 pass receptions.

Referencing the numerous turnovers, Morrall said, &quot;It really was a physical game. I mean, people were flying into one another out there.&quot; &quot;It was really a hard-hitting game,&quot; wrote O&#x27;Brien. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just guys dropping the ball. They fumbled because they got the snot knocked out of them.&quot; Said Tom Landry:

I haven&#x27;t been around many games where the players hit harder. Sometimes people watch a game and see turnovers and they talk about how sloppy the play was. The mistakes in that game weren&#x27;t invented, at least not by the people who made them. Most were forced.

&quot;We figured we could win if our offense didn&#x27;t put us into too many holes&quot;, said 35-year-old Colts lineman Billy Ray Smith, who was playing in his last NFL game, &quot;Let me put it this way, they didn&#x27;t put us into any holes we couldn&#x27;t get out of&quot;.

Colts defensive end Bubba Smith would later refuse to wear his Super Bowl V ring because of the &quot;sloppy&quot; play. In a similar action, Cowboys linebacker Chuck Howley was named the Super Bowl MVP, despite being on the losing team, but Howley initially refused to accept the award because he stated that it was meaningless to him since his team lost. He reluctantly accepted the honor since it included the awarding of a brand-new station wagon that he decided to use as a gift for his wife. During the game, Howley recorded two tackles and two interceptions, one of which he returned for 22 yards.

Don McCafferty became the first rookie head coach to win a Super Bowl. The feat was not repeated until George Seifert led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in Super Bowl XXIV. McCafferty was also the first Super Bowl-winning coach who did not wear coat and tie, opting for a short-sleeved T-shirt with a mock turtleneck.

This Super Bowl would also start a trend with the team that lost the game would come back the next year and win it. Dallas lost this game but they would come back and win it all the next year in Super Bowl VI while their opponents, the Miami Dolphins, lost that game, and would go on to win Super Bowl VII the following season.

Two rule changes that were adopted before the 1974 season were: 
* When the defensive team commits an illegal use of hands, arms, or body foul from behind the line of scrimmage, the penalty will be assessed from the previous spot instead of the spot of the foul.
* The penalties for offensive holding, illegal use of hands, and tripping were reduced from 15-yards to 10-yards.
These would have reduced the severity of the two Dallas offensive holding penalties in Super Bowl V.

This was the first and only Super Bowl where the Trophy presentation was done by somebody other than the commissioner, in this case, Marie Lombardi the wife of recently deceased coach Vince Lombardi. Super Bowl V also marked the debut of the newly renamed Vince Lombardi Trophy.
