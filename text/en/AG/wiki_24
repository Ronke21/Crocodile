<text>Telepathy () is the purported vicarious transmission of information from one person&#x27;s mind to another&#x27;s without using any known human sensory channels or physical interaction. The term was first coined in 1882 by the classical scholar Frederic W. H. Myers, a founder of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), and has remained more popular than the earlier expression &quot;thought-transference&quot;.

Telepathy experiments have historically been criticized for a lack of proper controls and repeatability. There is no good evidence that telepathy exists, and the topic is generally considered by the scientific community to be pseudoscience. Telepathy is a common theme in science fiction.

==Origins of the concept==
According to historians such as Roger Luckhurst and Janet Oppenheim the origin of the concept of telepathy in Western civilization can be traced to the late 19th century and the formation of the Society for Psychical Research. As the physical sciences made significant advances, scientific concepts were applied to mental phenomena (e.g., animal magnetism), with the hope that this would help to understand paranormal phenomena. The modern concept of telepathy emerged in this context.

Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall criticized SPR founding members Frederic W. H. Myers and William F. Barrett for trying to &quot;prove&quot; telepathy rather than objectively analyze whether or not it existed.

==Thought reading==
In the late 19th century, the magician and mentalist Washington Irving Bishop would perform &quot;thought reading&quot; demonstrations. Bishop claimed no supernatural powers and ascribed his powers to muscular sensitivity (reading thoughts from unconscious bodily cues). Bishop was investigated by a group of scientists including the editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; and the psychologist Francis Galton. Bishop performed several feats successfully, such as correctly identifying a selected spot on a table and locating a hidden object. During the experiment, Bishop required physical contact with a subject who knew the correct answer. He would hold the hand or wrist of the helper. The scientists concluded that Bishop was not a genuine telepath but was instead using a highly trained skill to detect ideomotor movements.

Another famous thought reader was the magician Stuart Cumberland. He was famous for performing blindfolded feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject&#x27;s thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought-reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the minds of people cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading.

==Case studies==
In the late 19th century the Creery Sisters (Mary, Alice, Maud, Kathleen, and Emily) were tested by the Society for Psychical Research and believed to have genuine psychic ability. However, during a later experiment they were caught utilizing signal codes and they confessed to fraud. George Albert Smith and Douglas Blackburn were claimed to be genuine psychics by the Society for Psychical Research but Blackburn confessed to fraud:

For nearly thirty years the telepathic experiments conducted by Mr. G. A. Smith and myself have been accepted and cited as the basic evidence of the truth of thought transference...

...the whole of those alleged experiments were bogus, and originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishful to establish.

Between 1916 and 1924, Gilbert Murray conducted 236 experiments into telepathy and reported 36% as successful. However, it was suggested that the results could be explained by hyperaesthesia as he could hear what was being said by the sender. Psychologist Leonard T. Troland had carried out experiments in telepathy at Harvard University which were reported in 1917. The subjects produced below chance expectations.

Arthur Conan Doyle and W. T. Stead were duped into believing Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Both Doyle and Stead wrote that the Zancigs performed telepathy. In 1924, Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that their mind reading act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used under the title of &quot;Our Secrets!!&quot; in a London newspaper.

In 1924, Robert H. Gault of Northwestern University with Gardner Murphy conducted the first American radio test for telepathy. The results were entirely negative. One of their experiments involved the attempted thought transmission of a chosen number between one and one-thousand. Out of 2,010 replies, none was correct. This is below the theoretical chance figure of two correct replies in such a situation.

In February 1927, with the co-operation of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), V. J. Woolley, who was at the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved &#x27;agents&#x27; thinking about five selected objects in an office at Tavistock Square, whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at Savoy Hill. 24,659 answers were received. The results revealed no evidence of telepathy.

A famous experiment in telepathy was recorded by the American author Upton Sinclair in his book &quot;Mental Radio&quot; which documents Sinclair&#x27;s test of psychic abilities of Mary Craig Sinclair, his second wife. She attempted to duplicate 290 pictures which were drawn by her husband. Sinclair claimed Mary successfully duplicated 65 of them, with 155 &quot;partial successes&quot; and 70 failures. However, these experiments were not conducted in a controlled scientific laboratory environment. Science writer Martin Gardner suggested that the possibility of sensory leakage during the experiment had not been ruled out:

The Turner-Ownbey long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.

Another example is the experiment carried out by the author Harold Sherman with the explorer Hubert Wilkins who carried out their own experiment in telepathy for five and a half months starting in October 1937. This took place when Sherman was in New York and Wilkins was in the Arctic. The experiment consisted of Sherman and Wilkins at the end of each day to relax and visualise a mental image or &quot;thought impression&quot; of the events or thoughts they had experienced in the day and then to record those images and thoughts on paper in a diary. The results at the end when comparing Sherman&#x27;s and Wilkins&#x27; diaries were claimed to be more than 60 percent.

The full results of the experiments were published in 1942 in a book by Sherman and Wilkins titled &quot;Thoughts Through Space&quot;. In the book, both Sherman and Wilkins had written they believed they had demonstrated that it was possible to send and receive thought impressions from the mind of one person to another. The magician John Booth wrote that the experiment was not an example of telepathy as a high percentage of misses had occurred. Booth wrote it was more likely that the &quot;hits&quot; were the result of &quot;coincidence, law of averages, subconscious expectancy, logical inference or a plain lucky guess&quot;. A review of their book in the &quot;American Journal of Orthopsychiatry&quot; cast doubt on their experiment, noting &quot;the study was published five years after it was conducted, arouses suspicion on the validity of the conclusions.

In 1948, on the BBC radio Maurice Fogel made the claim that he could demonstrate telepathy. This intrigued the journalist Arthur Helliwell who wanted to discover his methods. He found that Fogel&#x27;s mind reading acts were all based on trickery as he relied on information about members of his audience before the show started. Helliwell exposed Fogel&#x27;s methods in a newspaper article. Although Fogel managed to fool some people into believing he could perform genuine telepathy, the majority of his audience knew he was a showman.

In a series of experiments Samuel Soal and his assistant K. M. Goldney examined 160 subjects over 128,000 trials and obtained no evidence for the existence of telepathy. Soal tested Basil Shackleton and Gloria Stewart between 1941 and 1943 in over five hundred sittings and over twenty thousand guesses. Shackleton scored 2890 compared with a chance expectation of 2308 and Gloria scored 9410 compared with a chance level of 7420. It was later discovered the results had been tampered with. Gretl Albert who was present during many of the experiments said she had witnessed Soal altering the records during the sessions. Betty Marwick discovered Soal had not used the method of random selection of numbers as he had claimed. Marwick showed that there had been manipulation of the score sheets and all experiments reported by Soal had thereby become discredited.

In 1979 the physicists John G. Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski wrote the only scientifically feasible explanation for telepathy could be electromagnetism (EM) involving EM fields. In a series of experiments the EM levels were many orders of magnitude lower than calculated and no paranormal effects were observed. Both Taylor and Balanovski wrote their results were a strong argument against the validity of telepathy.

Research in anomalistic psychology has discovered that in some cases telepathy can be explained by a covariation bias. In an experiment (Schienle &quot;et al&quot;. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments. The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by hindsight and confirmation biases. 

In 1995, Rupert Sheldrake published his book on alleged telepathic phenomena &quot;Seven Experiments That Could Change the World&quot;, claiming among other things that dogs have the telepathic ability to know when their owners are coming home. In 1998, Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith and Julie Milton published a paper putting forward other explanations for the behavior Sheldrake observed in animals while saying the results from their own experiments did not support Sheldrake&#x27;s thesis.

==In parapsychology==
Within parapsychology, telepathy, often along with precognition and clairvoyance, is described as an aspect of extrasensory perception (ESP) or &quot;anomalous cognition&quot; that parapsychologists believe is transferred through a hypothetical psychic mechanism they call &quot;psi&quot;. Parapsychologists have reported experiments they use to test for telepathic abilities. Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the Ganzfeld experiment.

===Types===
Several forms of telepathy have been suggested:
* Latent telepathy, formerly known as &quot;deferred telepathy&quot;, describes a transfer of information with an observable time-lag between transmission and reception.
* Retrocognitive, precognitive, and intuitive telepathy describes the transfer of information about the past, future or present state of an individual&#x27;s mind to another individual.
* Emotive telepathy, also known as remote influence or emotional transfer, describes the transfer of kinesthetic sensations through altered states.
* Superconscious telepathy describes use of the supposed superconscious to access the collective wisdom of the human species for knowledge.

===Zener cards===
Zener cards are marked with five distinctive symbols. When using them, one individual is designated the &quot;sender&quot; and another the &quot;receiver&quot;. The sender selects a random card and visualizes the symbol on it, while the receiver attempts to determine that symbol telepathically. Statistically, the receiver has a 20% chance of randomly guessing the correct symbol, so to demonstrate telepathy, they must repeatedly score a success rate that is significantly higher than 20%. If not conducted properly, this method is vulnerable to sensory leakage and card counting.

J. B. Rhine&#x27;s experiments with Zener cards were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.

===Dream telepathy===

Parapsychological studies into dream telepathy were carried out at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York led by Stanley Krippner and Montague Ullman. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy. However, the results have not been independently replicated. The psychologist James Alcock has written the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and &quot;lack of replication is rampant.&quot;

The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by C. E. M. Hansel. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed, however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.

An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level. Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.

===Ganzfeld experiment===
When using the Ganzfeld experiment to test for telepathy, one individual is designated as the receiver and is placed inside a controlled environment where they are deprived of sensory input, and another person is designated as the sender and is placed in a separate location. The receiver is then required to receive information from the sender. The nature of the information may vary between experiments.

The Ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 Ganzfeld experiments and to access each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 Ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.

Possibilities of sensory leakage in the Ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender&#x27;s room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender&#x27;s fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.

Hyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place:

Hyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage. In 2010, Lance Storm, Patrizio Tressoldi, and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed 29 ganzfeld studies from 1997 to 2008. Of the 1,498 trials, 483 produced hits, corresponding to a hit rate of 32.2%. This hit rate is statistically significant with p &lt; .001. Participants selected for personality traits and personal characteristics thought to be psi-conducive were found to perform significantly better than unselected participants in the ganzfeld condition. Hyman (2010) published a rebuttal to Storm &quot;et al&quot;. According to Hyman &quot;reliance on meta-analysis as the sole basis for justifying the claim that an anomaly exists and that the evidence for it is consistent and replicable is fallacious. It distorts what scientists mean by confirmatory evidence.&quot; Hyman wrote the ganzfeld studies have not been independently replicated and have failed to produce evidence for telepathy. Storm &quot;et al&quot;. published a response to Hyman claiming the ganzfeld experimental design has proved to be consistent and reliable but parapsychology is a struggling discipline that has not received much attention so further research on the subject is necessary. Rouder &quot;et al&quot;. 2013 wrote that critical evaluation of Storm &quot;et al&quot;.&#x27;s meta-analysis reveals no evidence for telepathy, no plausible mechanism and omitted replication failures. A 2016 paper examined questionable research practices in the ganzfeld experiments.

===Twin telepathy===

Twin telepathy is a belief that has been described as a myth in psychological literature. Psychologists Stephen Hupp and Jeremy Jewell have noted that all experiments on the subject have failed to provide any scientific evidence for telepathy between twins. According to Hupp and Jewell there are various behavioral and genetic factors that contribute to the twin telepathy myth &quot;identical twins typically spend a lot of time together and are usually exposed to very similar environments. Thus, it&#x27;s not at all surprising that they act in similar ways and are adept at anticipating and forecasting each other&#x27;s reactions to events.&quot;

A 1993 study by Susan Blackmore investigated the claims of twin telepathy. In an experiment with six sets of twins one subject would act as the sender and the other the receiver. The sender was given selected objects, photographs or numbers and would attempt to psychically send the information to the receiver. The results from the experiment were negative, no evidence of telepathy was observed.

The skeptical investigator Benjamin Radford has noted that &quot;Despite decades of research trying to prove telepathy, there is no credible scientific evidence that psychic powers exist, either in the general population or among twins specifically. The idea that two people who shared their mother&#x27;s womb—or even who share the same DNA—have a mysterious mental connection is an intriguing one not borne out in science.&quot;

=== Autism Telepathy ===
There are multiple anecdotes in &quot;The Telepathy Tapes&quot; podcast of people on the autistic spectrum transferring information telepathically.

==Scientific reception==

A variety of tests have been performed to demonstrate telepathy, but there is no scientific evidence that the power exists. A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that &quot;despite a 130-year record of scientific research on such matters, our committee could find no scientific justification for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or &#x27;mind over matter&#x27; exercises... Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.&quot; The scientific community considers parapsychology a pseudoscience. There is no known mechanism for telepathy. Philosopher and physicist Mario Bunge has written that telepathy would contradict laws of science and the claim that &quot;signals can be transmitted across space without fading with distance is inconsistent with physics&quot;.

Physicist John Taylor has written that the experiments that have been claimed by parapsychologists to support evidence for the existence of telepathy are based on the use of shaky statistical analysis and poor design, and attempts to duplicate such experiments by the scientific community have failed. Taylor also wrote the arguments used by parapsychologists for the feasibility of such phenomena are based on distortions of theoretical physics as well as &quot;complete ignorance&quot; of relevant areas of physics.

Psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote that cases of telepathy can be explained by people underestimating the probability of coincidences. According to Sutherland, &quot;most stories about this phenomenon concern people who are close to one another—husband and wife or brother and sister. Since such people have much in common, it is highly probable that they will sometimes think the same thought at the same time.&quot; Graham Reed, a specialist in anomalistic psychology, noted that experiments into telepathy often involve the subject relaxing and reporting the &#x27;messages&#x27; to consist of colored geometric shapes. Reed wrote that these are a common type of hypnagogic image and not evidence for telepathic communication.

Outside of parapsychology, telepathy is generally explained as the result of fraud, self-delusion and/or self-deception and not as a paranormal power. Psychological research has also revealed other explanations such as confirmation bias, expectancy bias, sensory leakage, subjective validation, and wishful thinking. Virtually all of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena, such as mediumship, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading. Magicians such as Ian Rowland and Derren Brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, albeit without claiming paranormal skills. They have identified, described, and developed psychological techniques of cold reading and hot reading.

==Psychiatry==

The notion of telepathy is not dissimilar to three clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal and thought broadcasting. This similarity might explain how an individual might come to the conclusion that he or she were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies, or artificial intelligences) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Schizophrenic patients suffering from the form of alleged telepathy known as thought broadcasting believe that their private thoughts are being broadcast to other people against their informed consent. Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.

<text>Texas A&amp;M University (Texas A&amp;M, A&amp;M, TA&amp;M, or TAMU) is a public, land-grant, research university in College Station, Texas, United States. It was founded in 1876 and became the flagship institution of the Texas A&amp;M University System in 1948. Since 2021, Texas A&amp;M has enrolled the largest student body in the United States, and is the only university in Texas to hold simultaneous designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant institution. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is a member of the Association of American Universities.

The university was the first public higher education institution in Texas; it opened for classes on October 4, 1876, as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (A.M.C.) under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Act. In the following decades, the college grew in size and scope, expanding to its largest enrollment during WWII before its first significant stagnation in enrollment post-war. Enrollment grew again in the 1960s under the leadership of President James Earl Rudder, during whose tenure, the college desegregated, became coeducational, and ended the requirement for participation in the Corps of Cadets. In 1963, to reflect the institution&#x27;s expanded roles and academic offerings, the Texas Legislature renamed the college Texas A&amp;M University; the letters &quot;A&amp;M&quot; were retained as a tribute to the university&#x27;s former designation.

The university&#x27;s main campus spans over , and includes the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum. The university offers degrees in more than 130 courses of study through 18 colleges, and houses 21 research institutes. As a senior military college, Texas A&amp;M is one of six American universities classed as a senior military college and has a full-time, volunteer Cadet Corps whose members study alongside civilian undergraduate students. About one-fifth of the student body lives on campus. Texas A&amp;M has more than 1,000 officially recognized student organizations. Many students observe university traditions that govern conduct in daily life and sporting events. The university&#x27;s students, alumni, and sports teams are known as Aggies, and its athletes compete in eighteen varsity sports as a member of the Southeastern Conference.

==History==

===Early years===

In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the Morrill Act, which auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges at which the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts ... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;. In 1871, the Texas Legislature used these funds to establish the state&#x27;s first public institution of higher education, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, (Texas A.M.C.). Brazos County donated near Bryan, Texas, for the college&#x27;s campus. From its beginning until the late 1920s, students were officially nicknamed &quot;Farmers&quot; but the moniker &quot;Aggies&quot;—a common nickname for students at schools focused heavily on agriculture—gained favor and became the official student-body nickname in 1949.

The first day of classes was set for October 2, 1876, but only six students enrolled on the first day. Classes were delayed and officially began on October 4 with six faculty members and forty students at the military school. During the first semester, enrollment increased to 48 students and by the end of the 1877 spring semester, 106 students had enrolled. Admission was limited to white males, who were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. Originally, the college taught no classes in agriculture or engineering, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After initial resistance from faculty, the college began to focus on degrees in scientific agriculture, and civil and mechanical engineering. In 1881, enrollment grew to 258 but declined to 108 in 1883, the same year the University of Texas opened in Austin. Although originally envisioned and annotated in the Texas Constitution as a branch of the soon-to-begin University of Texas, Texas A.M.C. had a separate Board of Directors from the University of Texas and was never incorporated into the University of Texas System.

In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and advocated for the elimination of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, the college was saved from closure by its new president Lawrence Sullivan Ross, former Governor of Texas and former Confederate Brigadier General, by demonstrating the college could function and excel in its established form under proper leadership. Ross made many improvements to the campus, installing running water and permanent dormitories. Enrollment doubled under his tenure to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A.M.C. to emulate the traits of Ross. Many college traditions began under Ross&#x27;s presidency, including the creation of the first Aggie Ring, the senior class ring. Ross served until his death in 1898; to honor his contributions to the college, a statue of him was erected in 1918 in front of modern-day Academic Plaza.

Initially, women were permitted to attend classes only as &quot;special students&quot; but were not permitted to seek degrees. In 1893, Ethel Hudson, a daughter of one of the faculty, became the first woman to take classes; in 1899, her sisters Sophie and Mary Hudson did the same. Though not explicitly envisioned as such, over time it became a &quot;de facto&quot; all-male institution and led to a decades-long debate about the role of women at the college. In 1911, under pressure from the Texas Legislature, the college allowed women to attend classes during the summer semester. A.M.C. expanded its academic offerings with the establishment of the School of Veterinary Medicine in 1915.

===World Wars era===

Many Texas A&amp;M alumni served during World War I and by 1918, 49% of all Aggies were in military service, a higher proportion than that of any other American college or university. In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, and there were plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later. More than 1,200 alumni served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&amp;M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science. The first graduate school was organized in 1924 and the school awarded its first PhD in 1940. In 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female student to receive a diploma from Texas A&amp;M but she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. The following month, the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.

Many Texas A&amp;M alumni served in the military during World War II; the college&#x27;s educational and technical training resulted in 20,229 trained combat troops for U.S. military efforts. Of those, 14,123 alumni served as officers, more than any other school, and more than the combined total of the United States Naval Academy and the United States Military Academy. At the start of World War II, Texas A&amp;M was selected as one of six engineering colleges to participate in the Electronics Training Program, which would train Navy personnel to maintain new radar systems. During the war, 29 Texas A&amp;M graduates reached the rank of general.

After the end of World War II, enrollment rapidly grew as many former soldiers used the G.I. Bill to fund their education; however, enrollment stagnated in the following decade.

===University era===
In 1948, the state legislature established the Texas A&amp;M College Station campus as the flagship of a new system of universities, the Texas A&amp;M University System. Its goal was to serve as the lead institution to foster the evolution of a statewide educational, research and service system.

On July 1, 1959, Major General James Earl Rudder, class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college. In 1963, with the backing of State Senator William T. &quot;Bill&quot; Moore, the 58th Legislature of Texas approved Rudder&#x27;s proposal for a substantial expansion of the college. Over the coming years, Texas A&amp;M augmented and upgraded its physical plant and facilities, and diversified and expanded its student body by admitting women and minorities. Membership in the Corps of Cadets also became voluntary from the start of the fall semester of 1963. Initially, the decision to admit women made the student body very unhappy. The change was initially resisted and some minor efforts to reverse it persisted for several decades. The positive impact of these changes was rapid. By 1972, on-campus housing was dedicated for women and in 1976, the student body elected its first Black student-body president. In the same series of actions, the Texas legislature officially renamed the school &quot;Texas A&amp;M University&quot;, specifying the symbolic nature of the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, which reflect the institution&#x27;s past, and no longer denote &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical&quot;.

By the time of his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the college from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 U.S. states and from 75 other nations. In the 35 years following his death, Texas A&amp;M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000 students to more than 45,000. Texas A&amp;M became one of the first four universities given the designation sea-grant for its achievements in oceanography and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title space-grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium. In 1997, the university opened the Bush School of Government and Public Service and the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum—one of fifteen American presidential libraries operated by the National Archives and Records Administration. Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush remained actively involved with the university, frequently visiting the campus and participating in special events until his death in 2018. He was buried on campus.

With strong support from Rice University and the University of Texas, in May 2001, the Association of American Universities inducted Texas A&amp;M on the basis of the depth of its research and academic programs. As the student population increased, so did the university&#x27;s diverse academic offerings. On July 12, 2013, Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center was formally merged into the university. On August 12, 2013, the university acquired the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law and renamed it the Texas A&amp;M University School of Law.

In 2017, the retention of the statue of Lawrence Sullivan &quot;Sul&quot; Ross was in question after other institutions removed statues of former Confederate officers. The Texas A&amp;M University System Chancellor, John Sharp, and President, Michael Young, announced the statue would remain on campus because it is not based upon his service in the Confederate Army. Amid the nationwide Black Lives Matter riots, attempts in 2020 by a group of students and activists to secure its removal were rebuffed by the university&#x27;s administration, other students and alumni, and counter-protestors. The university also confirmed that the removal of the statue would require approval from the Texas Legislature.

In 2022, university president M. Katherine Banks implemented university-wide administrative restructuring that involved several changes to academic unit names and branding. The College of Science, the College of Geosciences, and the College of Liberal Arts, were merged to form the Texas A&amp;M University College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Several academic units underwent a change in name changes including the Texas A&amp;M University Irma Lerma Rangel School of Pharmacy. The following year, Banks abruptly resigned in July after her role in the failed attempt to hire Kathleen McElroy via unauthorized means and subsequent coverup. McElroy&#x27;s potential hiring was heavily criticized by conservative groups and alumni as she and openly advocated politically leftist policies in newsrooms and the classroom. After Banks resigned, Mark A. Welsh III, the dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service, was appointed interim president and became the University President later that year .

==Campus==

Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s College Station campus spans and Research Park covers an additional . The university is part of the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area of Brazos County, which is located in the Brazos Valley (Southeast Central Texas) region, an area often referred to as &quot;Aggieland&quot;. Brazos Valley is centrally located within of three of the ten largest cities in the U.S. and 75% of the population of Texas and Louisiana—approximately 13 million people. The area&#x27;s major roadway is State Highway 6, and several smaller state highways and Farm to Market Roads connect the area to larger highways such as Interstate 45.

The College Station campus is bisected by a railroad track operated by Union Pacific. The area east of the tracks, known as main campus, includes buildings for the colleges of engineering, architecture, geosciences, science, education, and liberal arts. Dormitories, the main dining centers, and many campus support facilities are also on the main campus. Notable buildings on main campus include Kyle Field, Sterling C. Evans Library, the Academic Building, Harrington Hall, the Memorial Student Center, the Administration Building, Rudder Tower, Albritton Bell Tower, and the Bonfire Memorial. To the west of the railroad tracks lies West Campus, which includes most of the sports facilities, the business school, agricultural programs, life sciences, the veterinary college, the political science and economics school, George Bush School of Government &amp; Public Service, George Bush Presidential Library, and two schools within the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center.

Outside the main campus, the institution formally includes three branch campuses: Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston is dedicated to marine research and hosts the Texas A&amp;M Maritime Academy; Texas A&amp;M University Higher Education Center at McAllen is dedicated to engineering, biomedical science, public health, and food systems industry management; and Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) in Education City, Al Rayyan, Qatar, is dedicated to engineering disciplines.

Texas A&amp;M Health maintains several other Health Science Centers and campuses away from the Bryan-College Station campus. The School of Engineering Medicine (EnMed), at the Houston Methodist Hospital, and the Texas A&amp;M Institute of Biosciences and Technology, are both located in the Texas Medical Center in Houston. The School of Dentistry is located in Dallas, and the institution has a presence in Corpus Christi, Kingsville, Lufkin, McAllen, Round Rock, and Temple. Texas A&amp;M School of Law, formerly Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, is located in Fort Worth. Texas A&amp;M maintains the RELLIS Campus, formerly the Texas A&amp;M University-Riverside Campus and Bryan Air Force Base, which was transferred from the university to become a separate entity within the Texas A&amp;M University System in September 2015.

==Academics==
===Administration and organization===

Texas A&amp;M is part of the Texas A&amp;M University System, which consists of eleven universities, eight state agencies, and the RELLIS Campus. The system is governed by a ten-member Board of Regents, nine of whom are appointed by the Governor of Texas to six-year terms, and one non-voting Student Regent who is appointed to a one-year term. The Chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University System is responsible for day-to-day operations and is answerable to the Board of Regents.

The university is led by the university president, who has executive responsibility, and is selected by and reports to the chancellor. The provost is responsible for all educational and service activities of the university, and reports to the president. The cabinet, as the institution&#x27;s administrative arm, and the deans of the respective colleges, also report to the president. The university and colleges are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and associated professional organizations offering degrees in 130 courses of study, over 260 professional and graduate degrees via its 17 colleges, and further opportunities in 21 research centers and institutes.

===Endowment===
The Texas A&amp;M University System has an endowment valued at more than $19.2 billion; the second highest among U.S. public universities and seventh overall. Apart from revenue received from tuition and research grants, as part of the university system, Texas A&amp;M is partially funded from two endowments. The smaller endowment and investment assets, totaling $2.6 billion as of 2021, is run by the private Texas A&amp;M Foundation. A larger sum is distributed from the Texas Permanent University Fund (PUF), in which the system holds a one-third stake. , the PUF ending net-asset value was approximately $30 billion.

===Research===
The National Science Foundation ranked Texas A&amp;M 16th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2021 with $1.14 billion. Concentrated in two primary areas, Research Valley and Research Park, the institution has over , which includes of dedicated research space. The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classifies Texas A&amp;M among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; as of 2021. Its research entities include the Hagler Institute for Advanced Study, the Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine, the Texas Transportation Institute, the Cyclotron Institute, the Institute of Biosciences and Technology, and the Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology. Texas A&amp;M University is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium.

Texas A&amp;M works with state and university agencies on local and international research projects to develop innovations in science and technology that can have commercial applications. In 2006, the Texas A&amp;M University System was the first to explicitly state in its policy technology commercialization could be used for tenure. Passage of this policy was intended to give faculty more academic freedom and strengthen the university&#x27;s industry partnerships. The efforts of system-wide faculty and research departments have yielded millions of dollars for Texas A&amp;M in royalty-bearing license agreements through more than 900 patents and 1,500 patent applications relating to a portfolio of over 2,600 inventions. On average, Texas A&amp;M files over 50 patents and closes 25 license agreements per year.

Texas A&amp;M has led the world in several fields of cloning research. Scientists at the university&#x27;s College of Veterinary Medicine created the first cloned pet, a cat named &quot;cc&quot;, on December 22, 2001. Texas A&amp;M was also the first academic institution to clone six species; cattle, a Boer goat, pigs, a cat, a deer, and a horse. In 2016, the animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) targeted the university and alleged abusive experiments on dogs. According to Texas A&amp;M, the dogs in question were given several experimental treatments to improve or cure a genetic condition that also affects humans. During this period, the dogs were under the care of board-certified veterinarians and other highly trained staff with oversight from multiple agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

The university is also engaged in significant scientific exploration projects. In 2004, as part of its responsibilities under the space grant program, it joined a consortium of universities and countries to build the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. Construction began in November 2015; on its completion—which is scheduled for 2025—it will be the largest optical telescope ever constructed with seven mirrors, each with a diameter of , the equivalent of a mirror across and ten times more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope. As part of a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s National Nuclear Security Administration, Texas A&amp;M completed the first conversion of a nuclear research reactor from using highly enriched uranium fuel (70%) to use low-enriched uranium (20%). The eighteen-month project ended on October 13, 2006, after the first-ever refueling of the reactor, thus fulfilling a portion of the United States&#x27; Global Nuclear Threat Reduction Initiative. In 2013, geography researchers named the largest volcano on Earth, Tamu Massif, after the university in honor of their research contributions.

===Worldwide===
Of the university&#x27;s numerous agreements and joint facilities of international cooperation, Texas A&amp;M owns a multipurpose center in Mexico City, Soltis Research and Education Center near San Isidro, Costa Rica, and Santa Chiara Study Abroad Center in Castiglion Fiorentino, Italy. During the 2018 academic year, over 5,600 Texas A&amp;M students—primarily undergraduates—studied in 110 countries. Marine research occurs on the university&#x27;s branch campus, Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston. It also has collaborations with international facilities such as Hacienda Santa Clara in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico.

The university is one of two American universities in partnership with CONACyT, Mexico&#x27;s equivalent of the National Science Foundation, to support research in areas including biotechnology, telecommunications, energy, and urban development. The university also hosts Las Americas Digital Research Network, an online architecture network for 26 universities in 12 nations, primarily in Central and South America.

Founded in 1995 by then-emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife, who is the mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar was set up through an agreement between Texas A&amp;M and the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science, and Community Development and continues its part of Qatar&#x27;s efforts to expand higher education with the assistance of elite institutions from the United States. All degrees at the Qatar campus are granted by the university&#x27;s TAMU College of Engineering. TAMUQ was opened in 2003, and the current contract extends through 2023. The campus offers undergraduate degrees in chemical, electrical, mechanical and petroleum engineering, and a graduate degree in chemical engineering. TAMUQ has received awards for its research. Texas A&amp;M receives $76.2 million per year from the Qatar Foundation for the campus. In the agreement with the Qatar Foundation, TAMU agreed 70% of its undergraduates at its Qatar campus would be Qatari citizens. The curriculum is designed to emulate the academic rigors of the facility at College Station but critics question whether this is possible due to Qatar&#x27;s strict stance on some of the freedoms granted to U.S. students. TAMU has also been criticized over its Qatari campus due to Qatar&#x27;s alleged ties to Islamic terrorism and the country&#x27;s human rights record. In 2016, Texas A&amp;M Aggie Conservatives, a campus activism group, criticized the campus and called for its immediate closure on the grounds it violated a commitment to educating Texans and diminished the credibility of engineering degrees of students at College Station. On 7 January 2024, Mark A. Welsh III, President of TAMU, addressed inaccuracies and misconceptions circulating on various websites and social media platforms regarding the University and its branch campus in Qatar and shared accurate information.

In 2013, Texas A&amp;M signed an agreement to open a $200 million campus in Nazareth, Israel, as a &quot;peace campus&quot; for Arabs and Israelis. The agreement led to protests from students at the Qatari campus, who called it &quot;an insult to [their] people&quot;. The planned campus in Nazareth was never opened; instead, Texas A&amp;M opened a $6 million marine biology center in Haifa, Israel, in 2016.

==Student life==
===Residential life===
 approximately 20% of the Texas A&amp;M student body lived on campus, primarily in one of two distinct housing sections located on opposite ends of the campus. Both the Northside and Southside areas contain student residence halls. Some halls are single-sex. Several halls include a &quot;substance-free&quot; floor whose residents pledge to refrain from bringing alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, or tobacco products into the hall.

Northside consists of seventeen student residence halls, including two dedicated to honors students. Approximately half of the residence halls on campus are reserved for members of the Corps of Cadets. The university also has four major apartment complexes for both staff and students, which are located both on and adjacent to the campus.

Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle, known as &quot;The Quad&quot;, an area consisting of dormitories, Duncan Dining Hall, and the Corps training fields. The Corps Arches, a series of twelve arches that allude to the spirit of the 12th Man, mark the entrance to the Quadrangle. All cadets, except those who are married or who have had previous military service, must live in the Quad with assigned roommates from the same unit and graduating class. The Aggie mascot Reveille, a Rough Collie, lives with her handlers in the Corps in the Quad.

===Corps of Cadets===


Texas A&amp;M is one of six United States senior military colleges. As of 2019, the university&#x27;s Corps of Cadets (or the Corps), with more than 2,500 members, is the largest uniformed student body outside the service academies. Many members participate in Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) programs and earn commissions in the United States Armed Forces upon graduation. Members of the Corps have served in every armed conflict fought by the United States since 1876, and over 285 alumni have served as generals or flag officers as of 2021. Until 1965, Corps membership was mandatory. The Corps began accepting female members in the fall semester of 1974.

The Corps of Cadets is composed of four major units, the Air Force Wing, the Army Brigade, the Navy/Marine Regiment, and the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, whose members may be affiliated with any military branch. Parson&#x27;s Mounted Cavalry is the only mounted ROTC unit in the United States. The Ross Volunteer Company, one of the oldest student-run organizations in the state, is the official honor guard for the Governor of Texas. The Fish Drill Team, a precision, close-order rifle drill team composed entirely of Corps freshmen, represents Texas A&amp;M in local and national competitions. The team have won the national championship almost every year since their creation in 1946, and have appeared in several Hollywood films, including &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, in which they had prominent roles.

The Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, the nation&#x27;s largest precision military marching band, provides music for university functions and presents halftime performances at football games. Some band drills are so complicated they require band members to step between each other&#x27;s feet to complete the maneuvers. Membership of the Corps of Cadets is a requirement for joining the Aggie Band, whose members live by the same standards, schedules, and regimens as the rest of the Corps.

===Activities===
Texas A&amp;M has over 1,000 student organizations, including academic, service, religious, social, and common interest organizations, and hosts 58 nationally or internationally recognized Greek Letter Organizations (GLOs). About 10% of the undergraduate population is affiliated with a GLO fraternity or sorority.

One of the oldest student organizations is the Singing Cadets, an all-male choral group not affiliated with the Corps of Cadets with about 70 members that was founded in 1893. Texas A&amp;M Hillel, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920 at the original college. Since 1955, the MSC Student Conference on National Affairs has held conferences, lectures, and other programs to discuss national and international issues with speakers. The Department of Recreational Sports provides athletic activities to the university community; sports facilities include the Student Recreation Center, a natatorium; the Penberthy Rec Sports Complex; and the Omar Smith Instructional Tennis Center. The Student Government Association (SGA), one of A&amp;M&#x27;s largest organizations, has over 1,300 student members in three branches, fifteen committees, and four commissions. The Graduate Student Council, which was founded in 1995, serves as the student government for Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s graduate and professional students.

Student organizations have had a nationwide impact. Texas A&amp;M students founded the largest one-day, student-run service project in America known as The Big Event. The annual service project allows students to serve the community by assisting local residents. Such events are now also held at other universities. The organization CARPOOL, a student-run safe ride program, has provided over 250,000 free rides () to students who are unable to transport themselves home. Its organizers help other universities establish similar programs. In 2009, GLBT Aggies, formerly Gay Student Services (GSS), successfully sued the university for official recognition and the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the U.S. Constitution requires public universities to allow such student organizations under the First Amendment&#x27;s &quot;freedom to assemble&quot; clause.

===Media===
The university newspaper &quot;The Battalion&quot; has been in production since 1893. The &quot;Aggieland&quot;, formerly known as &quot;The Olio&quot; and &quot;The Longhorn&quot;, is one of America&#x27;s largest college yearbooks in number of pages and copies sold.

As of 2007, the university houses three public broadcasting stations: KAMU-TV, a PBS member station since 1970; KAMU-FM, a National Public Radio affiliate since 1977, and the student-run station KANM, which bills itself &quot;the college station of College Station&quot;. W5AC, a student-run amateur radio club, broadcast the first live, play-by-play broadcast of a college football game at Kyle Field in November 1921.

==Traditions==


Texas A&amp;M culture is a product of the university&#x27;s founding as a rural military and agricultural school. Although the school and surrounding community have grown and military training is no longer mandated, the university&#x27;s history has instilled in students, according to Paul Burka, &quot;the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality&quot;. &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; posits that Texas A&amp;M students&#x27; respect for school traditions and values is the university&#x27;s greatest strength. These traditions enable and encourage students and alumni to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a strong sense of loyalty and respect for the university. They dictate many aspects of student life, including greeting others using the official school greeting of &quot;Howdy!&quot;, personal conduct at university sporting events, and students&#x27; word choices in conversation.

A visible designation tradition among senior undergraduates, graduate students nearing the end of their programs, and former students is wearing an Aggie Ring, whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894. Although not sanctioned by the university, many students &quot;dunk&quot; their newly acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and drink the entire pitcher in seconds.

Texas A&amp;M students have created two major traditions to honor deceased former students. The Aggie Muster is a ceremony of remembrance held annually on April 21, the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto, to honor current and former students who died the previous year. Alumni also typically socialize and remember their time at the university. Over 300 Musters are held around the world, the largest taking place at Reed Arena on the university&#x27;s main campus. All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent, in which names of deceased alumni are called. A family member or friend answers &quot;here&quot; and lights a candle to symbolize that although their loved one is not physically present, his or her spirit will shine forever. This is traditionally followed by a three-volley salute. The event received nationwide attention during World War II, when 25 Texas A&amp;M alumni held a brief Aggie Muster during the Battle of Corregidor.

Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&amp;M are honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony that is held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month. This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&amp;M president Lawrence Sullivan Ross. On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 pm, lights around campus are extinguished and hymns are chimed from Albritton Tower while students and faculty gather in the Academic Plaza. Following a three-volley salute by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six buglers play &quot;Silver Taps&quot;, a choral version of the bugle call &quot;Taps&quot;, from the dome of the university&#x27;s Academic Building. The song is played three times towards the north, the south, and the west. The song is not played to the east, symbolizing that the sun will never again rise on the deceased student.

===Sports===
At university sporting events, Texas A&amp;M students collectively are called the 12th Man; in the context of football games, students support the eleven players on the field and would be willing to enter the game if necessary. To symbolize their zeal and motivation, it is traditional for students to stand throughout the sports game. The tradition of standing for games began on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, in which Texas A&amp;M played Centre College. Texas A&amp;M had so many injuries Coach Dana X. Bible feared he would not have enough men to finish the game. He called into the stands for E. King Gill, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball, to prepare to play in the game. Texas A&amp;M won 22–14 but E. King Gill was the only player left available on the sidelines for the team. In recent decades, the 12th Man is represented on the field by a walk-on player who wears a number-twelve jersey and participates in kick-offs.

The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams. Each year, the student body elects five students to serve as Yell Leaders. At midnight before each home football game at Kyle Field, or at a designated location at away games, fans gather to practice yells for the next day&#x27;s game at an event called Midnight Yell Practice. Led by the Yell Leaders and the Fightin&#x27; Texas Aggie Band, the 12th Man practice yells, sing the , joke about their opponents, and practice celebrating. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Midnight Yell as one of the &quot;100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate&quot;. At home football games, the 12th Man consists of more than 36,000 Texas A&amp;M students and forms the largest student section in college football. When singing the war hymn, A&amp;M students cause the stands to sway; visiting press are warned prior to the game.

Almost every year since 1909, Texas A&amp;M students have built a large bonfire to celebrate their rivalry with the University of Texas. Aggie Bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with the festivities surrounding the annual college football game between the universities. Although it began as a trash pile, Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive, six-tiered structure, achieving a then-world-record height for a bonfire of . On November 18, 1999, the Aggie Bonfire collapsed during construction. Eleven enrolled students and one former student died and twenty-seven others were injured. The accident was later attributed to improper design and poor construction practices. The victims&#x27; family members filed six lawsuits against Texas A&amp;M officials, Aggie Bonfire officials, and the university. Half of the defendants settled their portion of the case in 2005, and a federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against the university in 2007. Following the collapse, the university suspended the official sanction of the bonfire, but the tradition continues off-campus.

==Athletics==

Texas A&amp;M University has been a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the NCAA for all sports since 2012. It was previously a charter member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996 and competed in the Big 12 Conference until June 30, 2012. The university has twenty sports teams, which are known as the Aggies, whose team colors are maroon and white. , Aggies had won 178 conference titles and 21 national championships.

A&amp;M&#x27;s archrival is the University of Texas Longhorns. The rivalry was renewed in 2024 when the Longhorns joined the SEC, ending the hiatus that began in 2011. In 2004, sporting events between the Aggies and the Longhorns became known as the Lone Star Showdown; the most-watched event in the rivalry was the annual football game held on Thanksgiving. Other current rivalries include the University of Arkansas and Louisiana State University, with the latter rivalry becoming particularly strong since Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s 74-72 victory in 2018. Historic rivals who were played during the Big 12 and Southwest Conference days, now dormant, include Texas Tech University and Baylor University.

The Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Fame was established in 1964 to &quot;acknowledge athletes whose accomplishments on the field have brought credit to Texas A&amp;M&quot;. As of 2018, it has 297 inductees. The Hall of Fame also hosts the Hall of Honor and Lettermen&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. The Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Honor was established in 1977 to &quot;recognizes individuals who have gone above and beyond in contributions and support of the athletic programs at Texas A&amp;M&quot;. The Lettermen&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award was established in 2011 to recognize &quot;lettermen, who after graduation, have gone on to gain prominence through his or her efforts in industry, commerce, technology, athletics, the professions, or other worthy endeavors&quot;.

The Aggies men&#x27;s basketball team, which was founded in 1912, has won eleven Southwest Conference championships and two Southwest Conference Tournament championships. The team has played in the National Invitation Tournament six times and in the NCAA Tournament eleven times, of which three resulted in the team progressing to the regional semifinals round, dubbed Sweet Sixteen—the highest round to which the Aggies have advanced—most recently in the 2015–16 season. As of 2021, the men&#x27;s basketball team is led by Buzz Williams in his tenth season as head coach.

The women&#x27;s basketball team has won one Southwest Conference Tournament championship, one regular season Big 12 Conference championship, two Big 12 Tournament championships, and two SEC Tournament championships—most recently in 2021. , the Aggies women&#x27;s team has advanced to sixteen NCAA Tournament appearances, including fourteen consecutive seasons, and won the National Championship in 2011. They have also twice competed in the Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament, which they won in 1995. The women&#x27;s team was coached by Gary Blair from 2003 to his retirement in 2022. Blair&#x27;s replacement Joni Taylor began coaching the team in March 2022.

Both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams play in the 12,889-seat Reed Arena, which opened in 1998.

<text>On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life) is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin that is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. It was published on 24 November 1859. Darwin&#x27;s book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection, although Lamarckism was also included as a mechanism of lesser importance. The book presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had collected on the &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.

Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.

The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. Darwin was already highly regarded as a scientist, so his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T. H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism. Within two decades, there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism&quot; from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin&#x27;s concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, and it has now become the unifying concept of the life sciences.

==Summary of Darwin&#x27;s theory==
Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution is based on key facts and the inferences drawn from them, which biologist Ernst Mayr summarised as follows:

:* Every species is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow (fact).
:* Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size (fact).
:* Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time (fact).
:* A struggle for survival ensues (inference).
:* Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another (fact).
:* Much of this variation is heritable (fact).
:* Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection (fact).
:* This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species (inference).

==Background==
===Developments before Darwin&#x27;s theory===
In later editions of the book, Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.

The Protestant Reformation inspired a literal interpretation of the Bible, with concepts of creation that conflicted with the findings of an emerging science seeking explanations congruent with the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and the empiricism of the Baconian method. After the turmoil of the English Civil War, the Royal Society wanted to show that science did not threaten religious and political stability. John Ray developed an influential natural theology of rational order; in his taxonomy, species were static and fixed, their adaptation and complexity designed by God, and varieties showed minor differences caused by local conditions. In God&#x27;s benevolent design, carnivores caused mercifully swift death, but the suffering caused by parasitism was a puzzling problem. The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 also viewed species as fixed according to the divine plan, but did recognize the hierarchical nature of different taxa. In 1766, Georges Buffon suggested that some similar species, such as horses and asses, or lions, tigers, and leopards, might be varieties descended from a common ancestor. The Ussher chronology of the 1650s had calculated creation at 4004 BC, but by the 1780s geologists assumed a much older world. Wernerians thought strata were deposits from shrinking seas, but James Hutton proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle, anticipating uniformitarianism.

Charles Darwin&#x27;s grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s, and French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809. Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity, adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse. This process was later called Lamarckism. Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no perceptible extinction. Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos, and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies. Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas, holding that unrelated, fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs. His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction, which he explained by local catastrophes, followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species.

In Britain, William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology&quot; saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial &quot;design&quot; by the Creator acting through natural laws. All naturalists in the two English universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were Church of England clergymen, and science became a search for these laws. Geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment, initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood. Some anatomists such as Robert Grant were influenced by Lamarck and Geoffroy, but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order.

===Inception of Darwin&#x27;s theory===

Darwin went to Edinburgh University in 1825 to study medicine. In his second year he neglected his medical studies for natural history and spent four months helping Robert Grant&#x27;s research into marine invertebrates. Grant revealed his enthusiasm for the transmutation of species, but Darwin rejected it. Starting in 1827, at Cambridge University, Darwin learnt science as natural theology from botanist John Stevens Henslow, and read Paley, John Herschel and Alexander von Humboldt. Filled with zeal for science, he studied catastrophist geology with Adam Sedgwick.

In December 1831, he joined the &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition as a gentleman naturalist and geologist. He read Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; and from the first stop ashore, at St. Jago, found Lyell&#x27;s uniformitarianism a key to the geological history of landscapes. Darwin discovered fossils resembling huge armadillos, and noted the geographical distribution of modern species in hope of finding their &quot;centre of creation&quot;. The three Fuegian missionaries the expedition returned to Tierra del Fuego were friendly and civilised, yet to Darwin their relatives on the island seemed &quot;miserable, degraded savages&quot;, and he no longer saw an unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. As the &quot;Beagle&quot; neared England in 1836, he noted that species might not be fixed.

Richard Owen showed that fossils of extinct species Darwin found in South America were allied to living species on the same continent. In March 1837, ornithologist John Gould announced that Darwin&#x27;s rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea (though their territories overlapped), that mockingbirds collected on the Galápagos Islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island, and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches. Darwin began speculating, in a series of notebooks, on the possibility that &quot;one species does change into another&quot; to explain these findings, and around July sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, discarding Lamarck&#x27;s independent lineages progressing to higher forms. Unconventionally, Darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists. At the zoo he had his first sight of an ape, and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed.

In late September 1838, he started reading Thomas Malthus&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; with its statistical argument that human populations, if unrestrained, breed beyond their means and struggle to survive. Darwin related this to the struggle for existence among wildlife and botanist de Candolle&#x27;s &quot;warring of the species&quot; in plants; he immediately envisioned &quot;a force like a hundred thousand wedges&quot; pushing well-adapted variations into &quot;gaps in the economy of nature&quot;, so that the survivors would pass on their form and abilities, and unfavourable variations would be destroyed. By December 1838, he had noted a similarity between the act of breeders selecting traits and a Malthusian Nature selecting among variants thrown up by &quot;chance&quot; so that &quot;every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected&quot;.

Darwin now had the basic framework of his theory of natural selection, but he was fully occupied with his career as a geologist and held back from compiling it until his book on &quot;The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs&quot; was completed. As he recalled in his autobiography, he had &quot;at last got a theory by which to work&quot;, but it was only in June 1842 that he allowed himself &quot;the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil&quot;.

===Further development===

Darwin continued to research and extensively revise his theory while focusing on his main work of publishing the scientific results of the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage. He tentatively wrote of his ideas to Lyell in January 1842; then in June he roughed out a 35-page &quot;Pencil Sketch&quot; of his theory. Darwin began correspondence about his theorising with the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in January 1844, and by July had rounded out his &quot;sketch&quot; into a 230-page &quot;Essay&quot;, to be expanded with his research results and published if he died prematurely.

In November 1844, the anonymously published popular science book &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, written by Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened public interest in the concept of transmutation of species. &quot;Vestiges&quot; used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin&#x27;s work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. &quot;Vestiges&quot; had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped to pave the way for the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated &quot;Origin&quot; by moving evolutionary speculation into the mainstream. While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.

Hooker was persuaded to take away a copy of the &quot;Essay&quot; in January 1847, and eventually sent a page of notes giving Darwin much-needed feedback. Reminded of his lack of expertise in taxonomy, Darwin began an eight-year study of barnacles, becoming the leading expert on their classification. Using his theory, he discovered homologies showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and he found an intermediate stage in the evolution of distinct sexes.

Darwin&#x27;s barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his &quot;Beagle&quot;-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his young son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.

==Publication==
===Time taken to publish===
In his autobiography, Darwin said he had &quot;gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it&quot;. On the first page of his 1859 book he noted that, having begun work on the topic in 1837, he had drawn up &quot;some short notes&quot; after five years, had enlarged these into a sketch in 1844, and &quot;from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.&quot;

Various biographers have proposed that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin&#x27;s illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, and he may have wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin&#x27;s large output of books and busy family life during that time.

A more recent study by science historian John van Wyhe has determined that the idea that Darwin delayed publication only dates back to the 1940s, and Darwin&#x27;s contemporaries thought the time he took was reasonable. Darwin always finished one book before starting another. While he was researching, he told many people about his interest in transmutation without causing outrage. He firmly intended to publish, but it was not until September 1854 that he could work on it full-time. His 1846 estimate that writing his &quot;big book&quot; would take five years proved optimistic.

===Events leading to publication: &quot;big book&quot; manuscript===

An 1855 paper on the &quot;introduction&quot; of species, written by Alfred Russel Wallace, claimed that patterns in the geographical distribution of living and fossil species could be explained if every new species always came into existence near an already existing, closely related species. Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace&#x27;s paper and its possible connection to Darwin&#x27;s work, although Darwin did not, and in a letter written on 1–2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority. Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper. He met Lyell, and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal. He began a &quot;sketch&quot; account on 14 May 1856, and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species as his &quot;big book&quot; on &quot;Natural Selection&quot;. His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas.

===Joint publication of papers by Wallace and Darwin===
Darwin was hard at work on the manuscript for his &quot;big book&quot; on &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin&#x27;s recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin&#x27;s own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that &quot;your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled&quot; and he would &quot;of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal&quot; that Wallace chose, adding that &quot;all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed&quot;. Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace&#x27;s pages with extracts from Darwin&#x27;s 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled &quot;On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection&quot;, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace&#x27;s idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.

===Abstract of Species book===
Soon after the meeting, Darwin decided to write &quot;an abstract of my whole work&quot; in the form of one or more papers to be published by the Linnean Society, but was concerned about &quot;how it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which would be impossible.&quot; He asked Hooker how many pages would be available, but &quot;If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific I would, perhaps publish it as pamphlet.&quot; He began his &quot;abstract of Species book&quot; on 20 July 1858, while on holiday at Sandown, and wrote parts of it from memory, while sending the manuscripts to his friends for checking.

By early October, he began to &quot;expect my abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be published separately.&quot; Over the same period, he continued to collect information and write large fully detailed sections of the manuscript for his &quot;big book&quot; on Species, &quot;Natural Selection&quot;.

===Murray as publisher; choice of title===

By mid-March 1859 Darwin&#x27;s abstract had reached the stage where he was thinking of early publication; Lyell suggested the publisher John Murray, and met with him to find if he would be willing to publish. On 28 March Darwin wrote to Lyell asking about progress, and offering to give Murray assurances &quot;that my Book is not more &quot;un&quot;-orthodox, than the subject makes inevitable.&quot; He enclosed a draft title sheet proposing &quot;An abstract of an Essay on the Origin of Species and Varieties Through natural selection&quot;, with the year shown as &quot;1859&quot;.

Murray&#x27;s response was favourable, and a very pleased Darwin told Lyell on 30 March that he would &quot;send shortly a large bundle of M.S. but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the three first chapters are in three copyists&#x27; hands&quot;. He bowed to Murray&#x27;s objection to &quot;abstract&quot; in the title, though he felt it excused the lack of references, but wanted to keep &quot;natural selection&quot; which was &quot;constantly used in all works on Breeding&quot;, and hoped &quot;to retain it with Explanation, somewhat as thus&quot;,— &quot;Through Natural Selection or the preservation of favoured races&quot;.
On 31 March Darwin wrote to Murray in confirmation, and listed headings of the 12 chapters in progress: he had drafted all except &quot;XII. Recapitulation &amp; Conclusion&quot;. Murray responded immediately with an agreement to publish the book on the same terms as he published Lyell, without even seeing the manuscript: he offered Darwin ⅔ of the profits. Darwin promptly accepted with pleasure, insisting that Murray would be free to withdraw the offer if, having read the chapter manuscripts, he felt the book would not sell well (eventually Murray paid £180 to Darwin for the first edition and by Darwin&#x27;s death in 1882 the book was in its sixth edition, earning Darwin nearly £3000).

On 5 April, Darwin sent Murray the first three chapters, and a proposal for the book&#x27;s title. An early draft title page suggests &quot;On the Mutability of Species&quot;. Murray cautiously asked Whitwell Elwin to review the chapters. At Lyell&#x27;s suggestion, Elwin recommended that, rather than &quot;put forth the theory without the evidence&quot;, the book should focus on observations upon pigeons, briefly stating how these illustrated Darwin&#x27;s general principles and preparing the way for the larger work expected shortly: &quot;Every body is interested in pigeons.&quot; Darwin responded that this was impractical: he had only the last chapter still to write. In September the main title still included &quot;An essay on the origin of species and varieties&quot;, but Darwin now proposed dropping &quot;varieties&quot;.

With Murray&#x27;s persuasion, the title was eventually agreed as &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, with the title page adding &quot;by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&quot;. In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term &quot;races&quot; interchangeably with &quot;varieties&quot;, meaning varieties within a species. He used the term broadly, and as well as discussions of &quot;the several races, for instance, of the cabbage&quot; and &quot;the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants&quot;, there are three instances in the book where the phrase &quot;races of man&quot; is used, referring to races of humans.

===Publication and subsequent editions===
&quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was first published on Thursday 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray&#x27;s autumn sale on Tuesday 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers&#x27; Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie&#x27;s Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library. The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; added to the closing sentence. During Darwin&#x27;s lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, &quot;An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species&quot;. In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton&#x27;s law even though the cause of gravity was unknown, and Leibnitz had accused Newton of introducing &quot;occult qualities &amp; miracles&quot;. The fourth edition in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; (1864).

In January 1871, George Jackson Mivart&#x27;s &quot;On the Genesis of Species&quot; listed detailed arguments against natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics. Darwin made extensive revisions to the sixth edition of the &quot;Origin&quot; (this was the first edition in which he used the word &quot;evolution&quot; which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word &quot;evolved&quot;), and added a new chapter VII, &quot;Miscellaneous objections&quot;, to address Mivart&#x27;s arguments.

The sixth edition was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 as &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, with &quot;On&quot; dropped from the title. Darwin had told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the fifth edition at 15 shillings and wanted it made more widely available; the price was halved to 7s 6d by printing in a smaller font. It includes a glossary compiled by W.S. Dallas. Book sales increased from 60 to 250 per month.

===Publication outside Great Britain===

In the United States, botanist Asa Gray, an American colleague of Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international copyright to print &quot;Origin&quot;. Darwin was delighted by the popularity of the book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton&#x27;s of New York, who got their edition out in mid-January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this referred to the first printing only, as there were four that year.

The book was widely translated in Darwin&#x27;s lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator&#x27;s own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn&#x27;s own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated &quot;favoured races&quot; as &quot;perfected races&quot;, and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn&#x27;s adherence to &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin&#x27;s suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin&#x27;s attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin&#x27;s ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;Origin&quot; was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. As of 1977, &quot;Origin&quot; had appeared in an additional 18 languages, including Chinese by Ma Chün-wu who added non-Darwinian ideas; he published the preliminaries and chapters 1–5 in 1902–1904, and his complete translation in 1920.

==Content==

===Title pages and introduction===
Page ii contains quotations by William Whewell and Francis Bacon on the theology of natural laws, harmonising science and religion in accordance with Isaac Newton&#x27;s belief in a rational God who established a law-abiding cosmos. In the second edition, Darwin added an epigraph from Joseph Butler affirming that God could work through scientific laws as much as through miracles, in a nod to the religious concerns of his oldest friends. The &quot;Introduction&quot; establishes Darwin&#x27;s credentials as a naturalist and author, then refers to John Herschel&#x27;s letter suggesting that the origin of species &quot;would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process&quot;:

WHEN on board HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.

Darwin refers specifically to the distribution of the species rheas, and to that of the Galápagos tortoises and mockingbirds. He mentions his years of work on his theory, and the arrival of Wallace at the same conclusion, which led him to &quot;publish this Abstract&quot; of his incomplete work. He outlines his ideas, and sets out the essence of his theory:

As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.

Starting with the third edition, Darwin prefaced the introduction with a sketch of the historical development of evolutionary ideas. In that sketch he acknowledged that Patrick Matthew had, unknown to Wallace or himself, anticipated the concept of natural selection in an appendix to a book published in 1831; in the fourth edition he mentioned that William Charles Wells had done so as early as 1813.

===Variation under domestication and under nature===
Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that &quot;[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing&quot;, yet all were descended from one species, the rock dove. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;monstrosities&quot; (example: Ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution. In this chapter Darwin expresses his erroneous belief that environmental change is necessary to generate variation. The opening two sentences of On The Origin demonstrate this point and also show that Darwin did not see the role of natural selection in stabilizing selection:

&quot;When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature.&quot;

It can be seen here that Darwin attributes the greater variation amongst individuals of domestic varieties compared to their progenitor populations in nature as being due to their &quot;conditions of life&quot; (environment) being &quot;not so uniform as&quot;, and &quot;somewhat different from&quot; those of the parent species&quot;. He later erroneously elaborates that changed &quot;conditions of life&quot; act on the reproductive organs to generate greater variability in the progeny. Even after 1860 when Darwin read the correct reason for greater variation in domestic varieties in Patrick Matthew&#x27;s book, On Naval Timber and Arboriculture published in 1831, future editions of On the Origin of Species contained these first two sentences unchanged and continued to omit the correct explanation of stabilizing selection.

In Chapter II, Darwin specifies that the distinction between species and varieties is arbitrary, with experts disagreeing and changing their decisions when new forms were found. He concludes that &quot;a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species&quot; and that &quot;species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties&quot;. He argues for the ubiquity of variation in nature. Historians have noted that naturalists had long been aware that the individuals of a species differed from one another, but had generally considered such variations to be limited and unimportant deviations from the archetype of each species, that archetype being a fixed ideal in the mind of God. Darwin and Wallace made variation among individuals of the same species central to understanding the natural world.

===Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence===
In Chapter III, Darwin asks how varieties &quot;which I have called incipient species&quot; become distinct species, and in answer introduces the key concept he calls &quot;natural selection&quot;; in the fifth edition he adds, &quot;But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.&quot;

Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring ... I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man&#x27;s power of selection.

He notes that both A. P. de Candolle and Charles Lyell had stated that all organisms are exposed to severe competition. Darwin emphasizes that he used the phrase &quot;struggle for existence&quot; in &quot;a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another&quot;; he gives examples ranging from plants struggling against drought to plants competing for birds to eat their fruit and disseminate their seeds. He describes the struggle resulting from population growth: &quot;It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.&quot; He discusses checks to such increase including complex ecological interdependencies, and notes that competition is most severe between closely related forms &quot;which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature&quot;.

Chapter IV details natural selection under the &quot;infinitely complex and close-fitting ... mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life&quot;. Darwin takes as an example a country where a change in conditions led to extinction of some species, immigration of others and, where suitable variations occurred, descendants of some species became adapted to new conditions. He remarks that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders frequently produced sharp divergence in character between breeds, and suggests that natural selection might do the same, saying:

But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.

Historians have remarked that here Darwin anticipated the modern concept of an ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.

Darwin proposes sexual selection, driven by competition between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic features such as lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could &quot;see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature&#x27;s power of selection&quot;. Using a tree diagram and calculations, he indicates the &quot;divergence of character&quot; from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in &quot;the great Tree of life ... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications&quot;.

===Variation and heredity===
In Darwin&#x27;s time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, &quot;The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.&quot; He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin&#x27;s death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought &quot;there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited&quot;, and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island-dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of &quot;Origin&quot;, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The &quot;observation&quot; that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of &quot;understanding&quot; of the underlying hereditary mechanism.

Breeding of animals and plants showed related varieties varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton&#x27;s mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.

More detail was given in Darwin&#x27;s 1868 book on &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;, which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis. Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance, he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population. However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin&#x27;s concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation. This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel&#x27;s theories of genetic inheritance.

===Difficulties for the theory===
Chapter VI begins by saying the next three chapters will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, &quot;Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?&quot; Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with the small number of individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms.

Another difficulty, related to the first one, is the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in time. Darwin commented that by the theory of natural selection &quot;innumerable transitional forms must have existed,&quot; and wondered &quot;why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?&quot; (For further discussion of these difficulties, see Speciation#Darwin&#x27;s dilemma: Why do species exist? and Bernstein et al. and Michod.)

The chapter then deals with whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures, and the behaviours to use them, when it would be difficult to imagine how intermediate forms could be functional. Darwin said:

Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?

His answer was that in many cases animals exist with intermediate structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: &quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.&quot;

In a section on &quot;organs of little apparent importance&quot;, Darwin discusses the difficulty of explaining various seemingly trivial traits with no evident adaptive function, and outlines some possibilities such as correlation with useful features. He accepts that we &quot;are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations&quot; which distinguish domesticated breeds of animals, and human races. He suggests that sexual selection might explain these variations:

I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.

Chapter VII (of the first edition) addresses the evolution of instincts. His examples included two he had investigated experimentally: slave-making ants and the construction of hexagonal cells by honey bees. Darwin noted that some species of slave-making ants were more dependent on slaves than others, and he observed that many ant species will collect and store the pupae of other species as food. He thought it reasonable that species with an extreme dependency on slave workers had evolved in incremental steps. He suggested that bees that make hexagonal cells evolved in steps from bees that made round cells, under pressure from natural selection to economise wax. Darwin concluded:

Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.

Chapter VIII addresses the idea that species had special characteristics that prevented hybrids from being fertile in order to preserve separately created species. Darwin said that, far from being constant, the difficulty in producing hybrids of related species, and the viability and fertility of the hybrids, varied greatly, especially among plants. Sometimes what were widely considered to be separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely, and in other cases what were considered to be mere varieties of the same species could only be crossed with difficulty. Darwin concluded: &quot;Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.&quot;

In the sixth edition Darwin inserted a new chapter VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and could not have been produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on &quot;Fertilisation of Orchids&quot; that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart&#x27;s criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on one side and the camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.

===Geological record===
Chapter IX deals with the fact that the geological record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell&#x27;s argument in &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well-founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of The Weald as discussed in &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well-developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.

Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at the same rate – some organisms such as &quot;Lingula&quot; were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin&#x27;s commitment to gradualism. He cited Richard Owen&#x27;s findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and William Clift had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.

===Geographic distribution===
Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: &quot;On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.&quot; Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.

Chapter XII continues the discussion of biogeography. After a brief discussion of freshwater species, it returns to oceanic islands and their peculiarities; for example on some islands roles played by mammals on continents were played by other animals such as flightless birds or reptiles. The summary of both chapters says:

... I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent ... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; ...

===Classification, morphology, embryology, rudimentary organs===
Chapter XIII starts by observing that classification depends on species being grouped together in a &quot;Taxonomy&quot;, a multilevel system of groups and sub-groups based on varying degrees of resemblance. After discussing classification issues, Darwin concludes:

All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, ...

Darwin discusses morphology, including the importance of homologous structures. He says, &quot;What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?&quot; This made no sense under doctrines of independent creation of species, as even Richard Owen had admitted, but the &quot;explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications&quot; showing common descent. He notes that animals of the same class often have extremely similar embryos. Darwin discusses rudimentary organs, such as the wings of flightless birds and the rudiments of pelvis and leg bones found in some snakes. He remarks that some rudimentary organs, such as teeth in baleen whales, are found only in embryonic stages. These factors also supported his theory of descent with modification.

===Concluding remarks===
The final chapter, &quot;Recapitulation and Conclusion&quot;, reviews points from earlier chapters, and Darwin concludes by hoping that his theory might produce revolutionary changes in many fields of natural history. He suggests that psychology will be put on a new foundation and implies the relevance of his theory to the first appearance of humanity with the sentence that &quot;Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.&quot; Darwin ends with a passage that became well known and much quoted:

It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us ... Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

Darwin added the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; from the 1860 second edition onwards, so that the ultimate sentence begins &quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one&quot;.

==Structure, style, and themes==
===Nature and structure of Darwin&#x27;s argument===
Darwin&#x27;s aims were twofold: to show that species had not been separately created, and to show that natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from &quot;Vestiges&quot;, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.

Later chapters provide evidence that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternative concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin&#x27;s argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a &quot;vera causa&quot; (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, and its ability to explain a wide range of observations. This reflected the influence of William Whewell&#x27;s idea of a consilience of inductions, as explained in his work &quot;Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot;, where if you could argue that a proposed mechanism successfully explained various phenomena you could then use those arguments as evidence for that mechanism.

===Literary style===
The &quot;Examiner&quot; review of 3 December 1859 commented, &quot;Much of Mr. Darwin&#x27;s volume is what ordinary readers would call &#x27;tough reading;&#x27; that is, writing which to comprehend requires concentrated attention and some preparation for the task. All, however, is by no means of this description, and many parts of the book abound in information, easy to comprehend and both instructive and entertaining.&quot;

While the book was readable enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists and could not be dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Though Richard Owen did complain in the Quarterly Review that the style was too easy for a serious work of science. Unlike the still-popular &quot;Vestiges&quot;, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin&#x27;s literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because the book was an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace&#x27;s essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of &quot;Origin&quot; are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.

=== Human evolution ===
From his early transmutation notebooks in the late 1830s onwards, Darwin considered human evolution as part of the natural processes he was investigating, and rejected divine intervention. In 1856, his &quot;big book on species&quot; titled &quot;Natural Selection&quot; was to include a &quot;note on Man&quot;, but when Wallace enquired in December 1857, Darwin replied; &quot;You ask whether I shall discuss &#x27;man&#x27;;—I think I shall avoid whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest &amp; most interesting problem for the naturalist.&quot;
On 28 March 1859, with his manuscript for the book well under way, Darwin wrote to Lyell offering the suggested publisher John Murray assurances &quot;That I do not discuss origin of man&quot;.

In the final chapter of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, &quot;Recapitulation and Conclusion&quot;, Darwin briefly highlights the human implications of his theory:

&quot;In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.&quot;

Discussing this in January 1860, Darwin assured Lyell that &quot;by the sentence [Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history] I show that I believe man is in same predicament with other animals. Many modern writers have seen this sentence as Darwin&#x27;s only reference to humans in the book; Janet Browne describes it as his only discussion there of human origins, while noting that the book makes other references to humanity.

Some other statements in the book are quietly effective at pointing out the implication that humans are simply another species, evolving through the same processes and principles affecting other organisms. For example, in Chapter III: &quot;Struggle for Existence&quot; Darwin includes &quot;slow-breeding man&quot; among other examples of Malthusian population growth. In his discussions on morphology, Darwin compares and comments on bone structures that are homologous between humans and other mammals.

Darwin&#x27;s early notebooks discussed how non-adaptive characteristics could be selected when animals or humans chose mates, with races of humans differing over ideas of beauty. In his 1856 notes responding to Robert Knox&#x27;s &quot;The Races of Man: A Fragment&quot;, he called this effect sexual selection. He added notes on sexual selection to his &quot;big book on species&quot;, and in mid-1857 he added a section heading &quot;Theory applied to Races of Man&quot;, but did not add text on this topic.

In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Chapter VI: &quot;Difficulties on Theory&quot;, Darwin mentions this in the context of &quot;slight and unimportant variations&quot;:

I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.&quot;

When Darwin published &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; twelve years later, he said that he had not gone into detail on human evolution in the &quot;Origin&quot; as he thought that would &quot;only add to the prejudices against my views&quot;. He had not completely avoided the topic:

It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my &quot;Origin of Species,&quot; that by this work &quot;light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;&quot; and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.

He also said that he had &quot;merely alluded&quot; in that book to sexual selection differentiating human races.

==Reception==

The book aroused international interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much of the initial reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin had to be taken seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce wrote a review in &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; in 1860 where he disagreed with Darwin&#x27;s &#x27;argument&#x27;. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication &quot;Vestiges of Creation&quot;, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The &quot;Origin of Species&quot; as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of &quot;Vestiges&quot;. Darwin&#x27;s book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term &#x27;Darwinism&#x27; was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.

While Darwin had been somewhat coy about human origins, not identifying any explicit conclusion on the matter in his book, he had dropped enough hints about human&#x27;s animal ancestry for the inference to be made, and the first review claimed it made a creed of the &quot;men from monkeys&quot; idea from &quot;Vestiges&quot;. Human evolution became central to the debate and was strongly argued by Huxley who featured it in his popular &quot;working-men&#x27;s lectures&quot;. Darwin did not publish his own views on this until 1871.

The naturalism of natural selection conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature and while this could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms &#x27;evolution&#x27; and &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27;, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.

===Impact on the scientific community===
Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague &quot;law of development&quot; of &quot;Vestiges&quot; had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin&#x27;s scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;A System of Logic&quot;, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot;, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive idea that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin&#x27;s ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay Archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.

Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin&#x27;s gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 &quot;Westminster Review&quot; promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for &quot;extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated&quot; and coining the term &quot;Darwinism&quot; as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal &quot;Nature&quot; to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late-Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.

The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen&#x27;s review of the &quot;Origin&quot; in the April 1860 &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous &quot;ordained becoming&quot;, with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported &quot;creation by birth&quot;, included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen&#x27;s view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the &quot;Great Hippocampus Question&quot; and parodied in &quot;The Water-Babies&quot; as the &quot;great hippopotamus test&quot;, Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the &quot;Descent of Man&quot; (1871).

====Impact outside Great Britain====
The German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond converted to Darwinism after reading an English copy of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in the spring of 1860. Du Bois-Reymond was a committed supporter, securing Darwin an honorary degree from the University of Breslau, teaching his theory to students at the University of Berlin, and defending his name to paying audiences across Germany and The Netherlands. Du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s exposition resembled Darwin&#x27;s: he endorsed natural selection, rejected the inheritance of acquired characters, remained silent on the origin of variation, and identified &quot;the altruism of bees, the regeneration of tissue, the effects of exercise, and the inheritance of disadvantageous traits&quot; as puzzles presented by the theory.

Evolutionary ideas, although not natural selection, were accepted by other German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis of Plants&quot; and from their long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn&#x27;s alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives but encouraged political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin&#x27;s ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;. His ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in palaeontology. Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution. Darwin was cautious about such histories, and had already noted that von Baer&#x27;s laws of embryology supported his idea of complex branching.

Asa Gray promoted and defended &quot;Origin&quot; against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz, who viewed every species as a distinct fixed unit in the mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.

French-speaking naturalists in several countries showed appreciation of the much-modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin&#x27;s ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin&#x27;s views.

====Challenges to natural selection====
There were serious scientific objections to the process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Carl Nägeli&#x27;s insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that the age of the Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that the Sun, and therefore life on Earth, was only about 100 million years old. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the fifth edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.

By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism&quot; included forms of &quot;saltationism&quot; in which new species were thought to arise through &quot;jumps&quot; rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin&#x27;s views.

===Impact on economic and political debates===
While some, like Spencer, used analogy from natural selection as an argument against government intervention in the economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities to level the playing field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot&#x27;s &quot;Physics and Politics&quot; (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working in anthropology to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non-white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin&#x27;s scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin&#x27;s work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.

===Religious attitudes===
The book produced a wide range of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground. Developments in geology meant that there was little opposition based on a literal reading of Genesis, but defence of the argument from design and natural theology was central to debates over the book in the English-speaking world.

Natural theology was not a unified doctrine, and while some such as Louis Agassiz were strongly opposed to the ideas in the book, others sought a reconciliation in which evolution was seen as purposeful. In the Church of England, some liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God&#x27;s design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity&quot;. In the second edition of January 1860, Darwin quoted Kingsley as &quot;a celebrated cleric&quot;, and added the phrase &quot;by the Creator&quot; to the closing sentence, which from then on read &quot;life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one&quot;. While some commentators have taken this as a concession to religion that Darwin later regretted, Darwin&#x27;s view at the time was of God creating life through the laws of nature, and even in the first edition there are several references to &quot;creation&quot;.

Baden Powell praised &quot;Mr Darwin&#x27;s masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature&quot;. In America, Asa Gray argued that evolution is the secondary effect, or &quot;modus operandi&quot;, of the first cause, design, and published a pamphlet defending the book in terms of theistic evolution, &quot;Natural Selection is not inconsistent with Natural Theology&quot;. Theistic evolution became a popular compromise, and St. George Jackson Mivart was among those accepting evolution but attacking Darwin&#x27;s naturalistic mechanism. Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as neo-Lamarckism were favoured over natural selection as being more compatible with purpose.

Even though the book did not explicitly spell out Darwin&#x27;s beliefs about human origins, it had dropped a number of hints about human&#x27;s animal ancestry and quickly became central to the debate, as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul, and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities. This conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans, or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind&#x27;s position at the head of nature. While many conservative theologians accepted evolution, Charles Hodge argued in his 1874 critique &quot;What is Darwinism?&quot; that &quot;Darwinism&quot;, defined narrowly as including rejection of design, was atheism though he accepted that Asa Gray did not reject design. Asa Gray responded that this charge misrepresented Darwin&#x27;s text. By the early 20th century, four noted authors of &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area. The English cardinal John Henry Newman stated in a letter that “… Darwin&#x27;s theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill.” The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.

==Modern influence==
Various alternative evolutionary mechanisms favoured during &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism&quot; became untenable as more was learned about inheritance and mutation. The full significance of natural selection was at last accepted in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis. During that synthesis biologists and statisticians, including R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, merged Darwinian selection with a statistical understanding of Mendelian genetics.

Modern evolutionary theory continues to develop. Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geological record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.

Interest in Darwin&#x27;s writings continues, and scholars have generated an extensive literature, the Darwin Industry, about his life and work. The text of &quot;Origin&quot; itself has been subject to much analysis including a variorum, detailing the changes made in every edition, first published in 1959, and a concordance, an exhaustive external index published in 1981. Worldwide commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and the bicentenary of Darwin&#x27;s birth were scheduled for 2009. They celebrated the ideas which &quot;over the last 150 years have revolutionised our understanding of nature and our place within it&quot;.

In a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was voted the most influential academic book ever written. It was hailed as &quot;the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter&quot; and &quot;a book which has changed the way we think about everything&quot;.

<text>The Texas Declaration of Independence was the formal declaration of independence of the Republic of Texas from Mexico in the Texas Revolution. It was adopted at the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836, and was formally signed the next day after mistakes were noted in the text.

==Background==
In October 1835, settlers in Mexican Texas launched the Texas Revolution.

However, within Austin, many struggled with understanding what the ultimate goal of the Revolution was. Some believed that the goal should be total independence from Mexico, while others sought the reimplementation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824 which enabled freedoms, including the ownership of slaves, that were not included in the 1835 constitution of Mexico, Siete Leyes. To settle the issue, a convention was called for March 1836.

This convention differed from the previous Texas councils of 1832, 1833, and the 1835 Consultation. Many of the delegates to the 1836 convention were young citizens of the United States, who had only recently arrived in Texas, in violation of Mexico&#x27;s immigration ban of April 1830, and many of them had fought in battles during the Texas Revolution against Mexico in 1835. The only two known native Texans to sign are Jose Francisco Ruiz and Jose Antonio Navarro. Most of the delegates were members of the War Party and were adamant that Texas must declare its independence from Mexico. Forty-one delegates arrived in Washington-on-the-Brazos on February 28.

==Development==

The convention was convened on March 1 with Richard Ellis as president. The delegates selected a committee of five to draft a declaration of independence; the committee was led by George Childress and also included Edward Conrad, James Gaines, Bailey Hardeman, and Collin McKinney. The committee submitted its draft within a mere 24 hours, leading historians to speculate that Childress had written much of it before he arrived at the Convention.

The declaration was approved on March 2 with no debate. Based primarily on the writings of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, the declaration proclaimed that the Mexican government &quot;ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived&quot; and complained about &quot;arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny.&quot; Throughout the declaration are numerous references to the United States laws, rights, and customs. Omitted from the declaration was that the author and many of the signatories were citizens of the United States, occupying Texas illegally, and therefore had no legal rights in the governance of Mexico. The declaration clarifies that the men were accustomed to the laws and privileges of the United States, and were unfamiliar with the language, religion, and traditions of the nation that they were rebelling against.

The declaration officially established the Republic of Texas, although it was not officially recognized at that time by any government other than itself. The Mexican Republic still claimed the land and considered the delegates to be invaders, and the United States didn&#x27;t recognize it since that would be an act of war against Mexico.

Among others, the declaration mentions the following reasons for the separation:

* The 1824 Constitution of Mexico establishing a federal republic had been overturned and changed into a centralist military dictatorship by Gen. Antonio López de Santa Anna.
* The Mexican government had invited settlers to Texas and promised them constitutional liberty and republican government, but then reneged on these guarantees. 
* Texas was in union with the Mexican state of Coahuila as Coahuila y Tejas, with the capital in distant Saltillo. Thus the affairs of Texas were decided at a great distance from the province and in the Spanish language, which the immigrants called &quot;an unknown tongue.&quot;
* Political rights to which the settlers had previously been accustomed in the United States, such as the right to keep and bear arms and the right to trial by jury, were denied. 
* No system of public education had been established.
* Attempts by the Mexican government to enforce import tariffs were called &quot;piratical attacks&quot; by &quot;foreign desperadoes.&quot;
* The settlers were not allowed freedom of religion. All legal settlers were required to convert to Catholicism.

Based upon the United States Declaration of Independence, the Texas Declaration also contains many memorable expressions of American political principles:

*&quot;&quot;the right of trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.&quot;
*&quot;our arms ... are essential to our defense, the rightful property of freemen, and formidable only to tyrannical governments.&quot;&quot;

==Signatories==

Sixty men signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Three of them were born in Mexico. Fifty-seven of the sixty moved to Texas from the United States. Ten of them had lived in Texas for more than six years, while one-quarter of them had been in the province for less than a year. This is significant, because it indicates that the majority of signatories had moved to Texas after the Law of April 6, 1830, banning immigration, had taken effect, meaning that the majority were legally citizens of the United States, occupying Texas illegally. Fifty-nine of these men were delegates to the Convention, and one was the Convention Secretary, Herbert S. Kimble, who was not a delegate.

<doc id="29942" wikidata="Q217627" url="?curid=29942" title="The Graduate">
<text>The Graduate is a 1967 American independent romantic comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols and written by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham, based on the 1963 novella by Charles Webb, who wrote it shortly after graduating from Williams College. The film tells the story of 21-year-old Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate with no well-defined aim in life who is seduced by an older married woman, Mrs. Robinson, but then falls for her daughter, Elaine.

&quot;The Graduate&quot; was released December 21, 1967, to critical and commercial success, grossing $104.9million in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-grossing film of 1967 in North America. Adjusted for inflation (as of 2021), the film&#x27;s gross is $857 million, making it the 22nd highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.

It received seven nominations at the 40th Academy Awards, including for Best Picture and Best Director, the latter being the film&#x27;s sole win. In 1996, &quot;The Graduate&quot; was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is currently (as of the 2007 rankings) ranked by the American Film Institute as the 17th greatest American film of all time, having been ranked 7th in 1997. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time.

==Plot==
After earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Benjamin Braddock returns to his parents&#x27; home in Pasadena, California. During his graduation party, Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father&#x27;s law partner, asks him to drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. At first he resists her advances but later changes his mind.
He invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the surname &quot;Gladstone&quot;.

Benjamin spends the summer idly floating in his parents&#x27; swimming pool and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she and her husband married after she accidentally became pregnant with their daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it.

His parents and Mr. Robinson relentlessly pester Benjamin to ask Elaine out. He reluctantly takes her on a date, to Mrs. Robinson&#x27;s displeasure. Benjamin attempts to sabotage the date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin chases after her, apologizes and kisses her. They eat at a drive-in restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as &quot;Mr. Gladstone&quot;, Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair. Benjamin admits to having an affair with a married woman whom he does not name. He tells Elaine the affair is over and asks to see her again.

To prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell her about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she throws Benjamin out of the house and soon returns to school at Berkeley. Benjamin follows her there, hoping to regain her affections. Elaine initially rejects him and briefly dates medical student Carl Smith. When she learns her mother lied about Benjamin raping her, she reconciles with him. Benjamin pushes for an early marriage, but Elaine is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and angrily confronts Benjamin. He informs him that he and Mrs. Robinson are getting divorced and threatens to have him jailed if he keeps seeing Elaine. Mr. Robinson forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl.

Benjamin drives to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home searching for Elaine. Instead he finds Mrs. Robinson, who tells him that he cannot prevent Elaine&#x27;s marriage to Carl. Benjamin flees the house and drives back to Berkeley. There he discovers the wedding is in Santa Barbara that very day. He speeds over 300 miles to Santa Barbara, but his car runs out of gas a short distance from the church.

Benjamin runs to the church, arriving just as the ceremony is ending. His desperate appearance in the glass church gallery stirs Elaine into defying her mother and fleeing the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large cross, which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping everyone inside. Benjamin and Elaine escape aboard a bus and sit among the startled passengers, with Elaine still in her wedding gown. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly change into neutral expressions.

==Cast==
Richard Dreyfuss makes an uncredited appearance in his second film role as one of the tenants in Mr. McCleery&#x27;s building. Ben Murphy also has an uncredited appearance, as the shaving fraternity brother who comes out with a double entendre. Mike Farrell was uncredited as a hotel bellhop. Kevin Tighe who would later go on to star in the 1970s TV series &quot;Emergency!&quot; made a brief uncredited appearance as one of the showering fraternity brothers.

==Production==
Getting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer Lawrence Turman, who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. Turman also said that every studio turned down the project, saying &quot;they read the book and hated it, and no one thought it was funny&quot;. He then contacted producer Joseph E. Levine, who said he would finance the film because he had associated with Nichols on the play &quot;The Knack&quot;, and because he heard Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot;.

With financing assured, Nichols suggested Buck Henry for screenwriter, although Henry&#x27;s experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and he had no writing background. Nichols said to Henry, &quot;I think you could do it; I think you do it.&quot; Nichols was paid $150,000, and was to receive one-sixth of the profits.

===Casting===
Nichols&#x27; first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actress Jeanne Moreau. The motivation for this was the cliché that in French culture, &quot;older&quot; women tended to &quot;train&quot; the younger men in sexual matters. Casting for the project was challenging. Doris Day turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her. Shelley Winters, Ingrid Bergman, Eva Marie Saint, Ava Gardner, Patricia Neal, Susan Hayward, Deborah Kerr, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner and Geraldine Page were also considered for the role of Mrs. Robinson.

Dustin Hoffman was cast as Liebkind in the Mel Brooks film &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967), but before filming began Hoffman begged Brooks to let him go to audition for &quot;The Graduate&quot;. When Dustin Hoffman auditioned for the role of Benjamin, he was just short of his 30th birthday at the time of filming. He was asked to perform a love scene with Ross, having previously never done one, and believed that, as he said later, &quot;a girl like [Ross] would never go for a guy like me in a million years&quot;. Ross agreed, believing that Hoffman &quot;looked about 3 feet tall ... so unkempt. This is going to be a disaster.&quot; Producer Joseph E. Levine later admitted that he at first believed Hoffman &quot;was one of the messenger boys&quot;. Despite – or perhaps because of – Hoffman&#x27;s awkwardness, Nichols chose him for the film.

&quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Mike Nichols did a very courageous thing casting me in a part that I was not right for, meaning I was Jewish,&quot; said Hoffman. &quot;In fact, many of the reviews were very negative. It was kind of veiled anti-Semitism... I was called &#x27;big-nosed&#x27; in the reviews; &#x27;a nasal voice&#x27;.&quot; Hoffman was paid $20,000 for his role in the film, but netted just $4,000 after taxes and living expenses. After spending that money, Hoffman filed for New York State unemployment benefits, receiving $55 per week while living in a two-room apartment in the West Village of Manhattan.

Before Hoffman was cast, Robert Redford and Charles Grodin were among the top choices. Redford tested for the part of Benjamin (with Candice Bergen as Elaine), but Nichols thought Redford did not possess the underdog quality Benjamin needed. Grodin turned down the part at first because of the low $500/week salary offered by producer Lawrence Turman. Grodin was offered more money, but declined again because he did not believe he could prepare for a screen test for the film overnight. &quot;If they had given me three days to prepare, I think I would have gotten the role,&quot; he said.

Harrison Ford also auditioned for the role of Benjamin Braddock but was turned down.

Burt Ward was informally offered Hoffman&#x27;s role, but was already committed to the role of Robin in the &quot;Batman&quot; television series.

Jack Nicholson, Steve McQueen, Anthony Perkins, Warren Beatty, George Peppard, George Hamilton, Keir Dullea, Brandon deWilde and Michael Parks were also considered for the role of Benjamin Braddock.

Ronald Reagan was considered for the part of Benjamin&#x27;s father Mr. Braddock, which eventually went to William Daniels. Nichols cast Gene Hackman as Mr. Robinson, but he was later fired after a few days of rehearsals; he was replaced by Murray Hamilton. Hackman would later say being fired from the film still hurts him.

Despite playing mother and daughter, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross were only eight years apart in age. Bancroft and Hoffman differed less than six.

===Filming===
The quality of the cinematography was influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner Robert Surtees to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, said later, &quot;It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job. I knew that Mike Nichols was a young director who went in for a lot of camera. We did more things in this picture than I ever did in one film.&quot;

Many of the exterior university campus shots of Berkeley were actually filmed on the brick campus of USC in Los Angeles.

The church used for the wedding scene is actually the United Methodist Church in La Verne. In an audio commentary released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the minister of the church had been watching the filming disapprovingly. The wedding scene was highly influenced by the ending of the 1924 comedy film &quot;Girl Shy&quot; starring Harold Lloyd, who also served as an advisor for the scene in &quot;The Graduate&quot;.

===Music===

The film boosted the profile of folk-rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Originally, Nichols and O&#x27;Steen used their existing songs like &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; merely as a pacing device for the editing, until Nichols decided that substituting original music would not be effective, and decided to include them on the soundtrack, an unusual move at that time.

According to a &quot;Variety&quot; article by Peter Bart in the May 15, 2005, issue, Lawrence Turman, his producer, then made a deal for Simon to write three new songs for the movie. By the time they had nearly finished editing the film, Simon had written only one new song. Nichols begged him for more, but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he did not have the time. He did play a few notes of a new song he had been working on: &quot;It&#x27;s not for the movie... It&#x27;s a song about times past — about Mrs. Roosevelt and Joe DiMaggio and stuff.&quot; Nichols advised Simon, &quot;It&#x27;s now about Mrs. Robinson, not Mrs. Roosevelt.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;The Graduate&quot; had a dual world premiere in New York City December 20, 1967, at the Coronet Theatre, and at the Lincoln Art Theatre on 57th Street. Its general release began on December 21, 1967.

===Home media===
&quot;The Graduate&quot; was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 1999 and 2007. A Blu-ray release was first issued by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in 2009 and later by StudioCanal in 2010. A 4K digital restoration of the film was released by The Criterion Collection in 2016.

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical response===
&quot;The Graduate&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from critics upon its release. A.D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film, with Murphy describing it as a &quot;delightful satirical comedy drama&quot;, and Ebert claiming it was the &quot;funniest American comedy of the year&quot;.

However, &quot;Life&quot; critic Richard Schickel felt the film &quot;starts out to satirize the alienated spirit of modern youth, does so with uncommon brilliance for its first half, but ends up selling out to the very spirit its creators intended to make fun of... It&#x27;s a shame – they were halfway to something wonderful when they skidded on a patch of greasy kid stuff.&quot;

Pauline Kael wondered, &quot;How could you convince them [younger viewers] that a movie that sells innocence is a very commercial piece of work when they&#x27;re so clearly in the market to buy innocence?&quot;

Critics continue to praise the film, if not always with the same ardor. For the film&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary reissue, Ebert retracted some of his previous praise for it, noting that he felt its time had passed, and that he now had more sympathy for Mrs. Robinson than for Benjamin (whom he considered &quot;an insufferable creep&quot;), viewing one&#x27;s sympathy for Mrs. Robinson and disdainful attitude toward Ben as a function of aging and wisdom.

He, along with Gene Siskel, gave the film a positive, if unenthusiastic review on the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;. Furthermore, the film&#x27;s rating in the American Film Institute list of the greatest American films fell from seventh in 1997 to 17th in the 2007 update. Lang Thompson, however, argued that &quot;it really hasn&#x27;t dated much&quot;.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 86% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The music, the performances, the precision in capturing the post-college malaise – &quot;The Graduate&quot; coming-of-age story is indeed one for the ages.&quot; On the similar website, Metacritic, the film holds a score of 83 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Numerous films, TV shows, music videos, and commercials have referenced &quot;The Graduate&quot;. The climactic sequence in which Benjamin crashes the wedding and leaves with Elaine is frequently parodied and referenced. TV show episodes that reference the scene include the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;When You Wish Upon a Weinstein&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, the &quot;Archer&quot; episode &quot;Skin Game&quot;, the &quot;New Girl&quot; episode &quot;Elaine&#x27;s Big Day&quot;, and &quot;The Office&quot; episode &quot;Golden Ticket&quot;.

The scene was elaborately parodied in the movie Wayne&#x27;s World 2, and was referenced in the music video for &quot;Love Action (I Believe in Love)&quot; by The Human League and &quot;If You Go&quot; by Jon Secada, as well as the song &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot; by Busted. The scene was also referenced in the 1998 finale of the Papa and Nicole advertising campaign in the United Kingdom for the MK1 Renault Clio, featuring Reeves and Mortimer and tying in with the release of the MK2 Renault Clio. The 1999 film &quot;The Other Sister&quot; contained a reference.

The leg-framing scene where Mrs. Robinson seduces Benjamin has been parodied in the &quot;Roseanne&quot; episode &quot;David and Goliath&quot;, which includes a fantasy scene in which Jackie assumes the Bancroft role and attempts to seduce David. This scene is also parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot;, when Mrs. Krabappel tries to seduce Mr. Bergstrom, who was voiced by Dustin Hoffman.

The car Benjamin drives in the movie is an Alfa Romeo Spider. Based on its iconic role, Alfa Romeo sold a version of the Spider in the United States from 1985 to 1990 under the name &quot;Spider Graduate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;conceptcarz.com/vehicle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 film &quot;The Player&quot;, Robert Altman&#x27;s satire of Hollywood, Buck Henry pitches a sequel to &quot;The Graduate&quot; to producer Griffin Mill (played by Tim Robbins) during the film&#x27;s opening sequence. A parody of Hollywood high concept films, Henry describes the plot as Ben and Elaine living in a haunted house in Northern California, with an invalid Mrs. Robinson living in the attic.

George Michael&#x27;s 1992 song, &quot;Too Funky,&quot; features a clip of the Anne Bancroft lines, &quot;I am not trying to seduce you... Would you like me to seduce you? Is that what you&#x27;re trying to tell me?&quot;, as an intro of the song, and is repeated during the final crescendo.

In conjunction with the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary home video release, alternative rock band The Lemonheads recorded a punk-style cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;. The music video includes scenes from the film.

The film &quot;Kingpin&quot; parodied the leg-framed shot, showing Woody Harrelson framed by his landlady&#x27;s leg, and features an excerpt of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; after Harrelson&#x27;s character has sex with the landlady to make up for back rent.

Hoffman recreated the church wedding scene for a 2004 Audi commercial, in which he stops his daughter (played by Lake Bell) from getting married, and tells her &quot;you&#x27;re just like your mother&quot; as they drive off, implying he is portraying an older Benjamin who has a daughter with Elaine.

The plot of the 2005 romantic comedy film &quot;Rumor Has It&quot;, directed by Rob Reiner and starring Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Costner, Shirley MacLaine and Mark Ruffalo, revolves around a story in which a woman learns that her mother and grandmother may be the inspiration for &quot;The Graduate&quot;, and the 1963 novel of the same name it was based on.

&quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot; features a scene in which the protagonist, Tom, watches &quot;The Graduate&quot; with his then girlfriend Summer. He is said to misinterpret the ending, a fact that serves to characterize his naivety concerning relationships.

===Accolades===
In 1996, &quot;The Graduate&quot; was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and placed #22 on the list of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada, adjusted for inflation.

==Stage adaptation==
Terry Johnson&#x27;s adaptation of the original novel and the film ran on both London&#x27;s West End and Broadway, and has toured the United States. There is a Brazilian version adapted by Miguel Falabella. Several actresses have starred as Mrs. Robinson, including Kathleen Turner, Lorraine Bracco, Jerry Hall, Amanda Donohoe, Morgan Fairchild, Anne Archer, Vera Fischer, Patricia Richardson and Linda Gray.

The stage production adds several scenes not in the novel nor the film, as well as using material from both film and novel.

The soundtrack uses songs by Simon &amp; Garfunkel also not used in the film, such as &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, as well as music from other popular musicians from the era, such as The Byrds and The Beach Boys. The West End production opened at the Gielgud Theatre on April 5, 2000, after previews from March 24, with Kathleen Turner starring as Mrs. Robinson. Jerry Hall replaced Turner from July 31, 2000, followed by Amanda Donohoe from February 2001, Anne Archer from June 2001, and Linda Gray from October 2001. The production closed in January 2002. The 2003 U.K. touring production starred Glynis Barber as Mrs. Robinson.

The Broadway production opened at the Plymouth Theatre April 4, 2002, and closed March 2, 2003, after 380 performances. Directed by Terry Johnson, the play featured the cast of Jason Biggs as Benjamin Braddock, Alicia Silverstone as Elaine Robinson, and Kathleen Turner as Mrs. Robinson. The play received no award nominations. Linda Gray briefly filled in for Turner in September 2002. Lorraine Bracco replaced Turner from November 19, 2002.

&quot;The Graduate&quot; ran at the Cape Playhouse (Dennis, Massachusetts) in July 2011, and starred Patricia Richardson.

==Possible sequel==
Charles Webb wrote a sequel to his original novel, titled &quot;Home School&quot;, but initially refused to publish it in its entirety because of a contract he signed in the 1960s. When he sold the film rights to &quot;The Graduate&quot;, he surrendered the rights to any sequels. If he were to publish &quot;Home School&quot;, the French media company that owns the rights to &quot;The Graduate&quot;, Canal+, would be able to adapt it for the screen without his permission. Extracts of &quot;Home School&quot; were printed in &quot;The Times&quot; on May 2, 2006. Webb told the newspaper there was a possibility he would find a publisher for the full text, provided he could retrieve the film rights using French copyright law. On May 30, 2006, &quot;The Times&quot; reported Webb had signed a publishing deal for &quot;Home School&quot; with Random House, which he hoped would enable him to instruct French lawyers to attempt to retrieve his rights. The novel was published in Britain in 2007.

<text>The Breakfast Club is a 1985 American indie teen coming-of-age comedy-drama film written, produced, and directed by John Hughes. It stars Emilio Estevez, Paul Gleason, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy. The film tells the story of five teenagers from different high school cliques who serve a Saturday detention overseen by their authoritarian vice principal.

Hughes had written the script in 1982, and began casting for the film after the release of &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; (1984). Filming took place from March to May 1984, and the entire film was shot at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Illinois.

The film premiered in Los Angeles on February 7, 1985, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures on February 15, 1985. It grossed $51.5 million against a $1 million budget, and earned acclaim from critics, who consider it to be one of Hughes&#x27;s most memorable and recognized works. The media subsequently referred to the film&#x27;s five main actors as members of a group called the &quot;Brat Pack&quot;. In 2015, the film was digitally remastered and was re-screened in 430 theaters in celebration of its 30th anniversary.

In 2016, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film has been considered as one of the best films of the 1980s, and one of the best teen films of all time.

==Plot==

On Saturday, March 24, 1984, five students at Shermer High School in Shermer, Illinois, report for an all-day detention: socially awkward Brian Johnson, jock Andrew Clark, shy loner Allison Reynolds, popular girl Claire Standish, and rebellious delinquent John Bender. They gather in the school library and meet with their vice principal Richard Vernon, who warns them not to talk or move from their seats and assigns each of them the task of writing a thousand-word essay describing &quot;who you think you are.&quot;

Bender ignores the rules and spends his time antagonizing the others and defying Vernon, who gives him eight additional weekends of detention. The students sneak off to retrieve Bender&#x27;s marijuana stash from his locker. When they see Vernon returning to the library, Bender deliberately gets caught to allow the others to sneak back in. Locked in a storage closet as punishment, Bender is berated by Vernon even further who tells him that he wants Bender to prove how tough he is and is offered a chance to punch Vernon but fails to act. He soon escapes into the ceiling panels and falls into the library, where the others hide him from Vernon.

The students pass the time arguing, listening to music, and smoking marijuana, gradually opening up about their home lives and their reasons for being in detention: 
* Claire&#x27;s popularity subjects her to intense peer pressure, while her bickering parents use her against each other. She received detention for skipping school to go shopping. 
* Bender reveals the physical abuse he and his mother suffer at the hands of his father, including cigar burns, as well as other injuries he has sustained from his father physically abusing him. He is serving detention for pulling a false fire alarm. 
* Andrew became influenced by jock culture and is intimidated by his father to succeed in wrestling. He was given detention for taping a student&#x27;s buttocks together in an attempt to win both his teammates&#x27; and his father&#x27;s approval.
* Brian is under so much academic pressure from his parents to get good grades that he contemplated suicide after getting an F in shop class. He was sent to detention for bringing a flare gun to school.
* Allison is compulsively dishonest with neglectful parents, constantly stealing things to use should she ever run away from home. She admits that she showed up to detention for lack of anything better to do.

Despite their differences, the students realize they all face similar problems; Andrew and Allison bond over their complex relationships with their parents; Brian and Claire each feel anxiety over being a virgin. Still, the group suspects that their new friendships will end once detention is over. Meanwhile, Vernon complains to the janitor, Carl, that students have become less disciplined and more arrogant compared to the ones he had when he was a teacher, but Carl suggests that Vernon is the one who has changed and cares too much about what the students think of him.

The others convince Brian to complete Vernon&#x27;s essay on the group&#x27;s behalf. Claire gives Allison a makeover, which sparks romantic interest from Andrew, and Bender crawls back to the closet, where Claire challenges her &quot;pristine&quot; reputation by kissing him. As the students part ways, Allison and Andrew kiss, and she rips the state championship patch off his letterman jacket to keep; Claire gives Bender one of her diamond earrings, and they share their own kiss.

Vernon reads Brian&#x27;s essay, which asserts that the vice principal has made petty assumptions about all of them and declares that &quot;each one of us is a brain (Brian), an athlete (Andrew), a basket case (Allison), a princess (Claire), and a criminal (Bender).&quot; &quot;Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.&quot; Bender walks home across the school&#x27;s football field and raises his fist in the air triumphantly as he leaves.

==Production==

===Development===
The title was originally &quot;The Lunch Bunch&quot;, but a friend of John&#x27;s from another school had a detention class called &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, so he decided to go with that. Hughes wrote the script around the time when he was writing &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, but he wrote the &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; script in mere days and it impressed the studio executives and they chose it to be his directorial debut.

===Casting===
Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall both starred in Hughes&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;. Towards the end of filming, Hughes asked them to be in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. Hall became the first to be cast, agreeing to the role of Brian Johnson; his real-life mother and sister played his character&#x27;s mother and sister in the film. Ringwald was originally approached to play the character of Allison Reynolds, but she was &quot;really upset&quot; because she wanted to play Claire Standish (then named &quot;Cathy&quot; in the first draft of the script), which saw the auditions of Robin Wright, Jodie Foster, Diane Lane and Laura Dern. She eventually convinced Hughes and the studio to give her the part. The role of Allison ultimately went to Ally Sheedy.

Emilio Estevez was originally cast in the role of John Bender, but when Hughes was unable to find someone to play Andrew Clark, Estevez was recast. Nicolas Cage was considered for the role of John Bender, which was the last role to be cast, though the role was narrowed down to John Cusack and Judd Nelson. Alan Ruck also auditioned for the role. Hughes originally cast Cusack, but decided to replace him with Nelson before shooting began, because Cusack did not look intimidating enough for the role. At one point, Hughes was disappointed in Nelson because he stayed in character and harassed Ringwald off-camera, with the other actors having to convince Hughes to not fire him. Rick Moranis was originally cast as the janitor but was released by Ned Tanen, who felt that Moranis&#x27; portrayal as an over-the-top Russian caricature didn&#x27;t suit the serious nature of the film. Moranis was replaced by John Kapelos.

===Filming===
In 1999, Hughes said that his request to direct the film met with resistance and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience. He ultimately convinced the film&#x27;s investors that due to the modest $1 million budget and its single-location shoot, he could greatly minimize their risk. Hughes originally thought that &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; would be his directorial debut. He opted for an insular, largely one-room set and wrote about high school students, who would be played by younger actors.

Principal photography began on March 28, 1984, and ended in May. Filming took place at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Illinois, which had been closed in May 1981. The same setting was used for interior scenes of Hughes&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, which featured exterior shots from nearby Glenbrook North High School. The appearance of the library at Maine North High, considered too small for use in the film, prompted the crew to build a virtually identical but larger set in the school&#x27;s gymnasium. The actors rehearsed for three weeks and then shot the film in sequence. Nelson tried other opinions for the ending scene until eventually landing the fist pump. On the &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; DVD commentary (featured on the 2004 DVD version), Hughes revealed that he shot the two films concurrently to save time and money, and some outtakes of both films feature elements of the film crews working on the other film. The first print was 150 minutes in length.

During a cast reunion in honor of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Ally Sheedy revealed that a director&#x27;s cut existed; but Hughes&#x27;s widow, who was also present, did not disclose any details concerning its whereabouts. In 2015, the first draft of the film&#x27;s script was discovered in a Maine South High School cabinet as district employees were moving offices to a new building.

===Poster===
The film&#x27;s poster, featuring the five characters huddled together, was photographed by Annie Leibovitz toward the end of shooting. The shot of five actors gazing at the camera influenced the way teen films were marketed from that point on. The poster refers to the five &quot;types&quot; of the story using slightly different terms than those used in the film, and in a different sequence, stating &quot;They were five total strangers with nothing in common, meeting for the first time. A brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse&quot;. &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; poster &quot;family shot&quot;, notably including Bender&#x27;s raised fist, was satirized in the poster for the comedy-horror film &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;. It also inspired the title page of chapter 29 of the manga series &quot;Akane-banashi&quot;.

==Themes==
The main theme of the film is the constant struggle of the American teenager to be understood, both by adults and by themselves. It explores the pressure put on teenagers to fit into their own realms of high school social constructs, as well as the lofty expectations of their parents, teachers, and other authority figures. On the surface, the students have little in common with each other, but they eventually bond over a common disdain for the aforementioned issues of peer pressure and parental expectations. Stereotyping is another theme. Once the obvious stereotypes are broken down, the characters &quot;empathize with each other&#x27;s struggles, dismiss some of the inaccuracies of their first impressions, and discover that they are more similar than different&quot;. The main adult character, Mr. Vernon, is portrayed with arguably no redeeming qualities; throughout the film, he consistently talks down to students, accesses private student information (then attempts to cover his tracks when confronted by a fellow employee) and forcefully flaunts his authority at each opportunity. He continually and aggressively challenges Bender, who is the only one of the group who chooses to stand up to him.

==Release==
The film premiered in Los Angeles on February 7, 1985. Universal Pictures released the film in cinemas on February 15, 1985, in the United States.

===Home media===
&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc. In 2003, the film was released on DVD as part of the &quot;High School Reunion Collection&quot;. In 2008, a &quot;Flashback Edition&quot; DVD was released with several special features, including an audio commentary with Anthony Michael Hall and Judd Nelson. A 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray was released in 2010, and the same disc was re-released with a DVD and digital copy in 2012 as part of Universal&#x27;s 100th Anniversary series.

On March 10, 2015, the 30th Anniversary Edition was released. This release was digitally remastered and restored from the original 35mm film negatives for better picture quality on DVD, Digital HD and Blu-ray. The Criterion Collection released a special edition two-disc DVD set and a Blu-ray disc on January 2, 2018. The transfer was the same as the previous release but included new features such as fifty minutes of new, deleted and extended scenes, an Electronic Press Kit, new and archival interviews, a 1985 excerpt of the &quot;Today&quot; program, a new video essay and an episode of &quot;This American Life&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert awarded three stars out of four and called the performances &quot;wonderful&quot;, adding that the film was &quot;more or less predictable&quot; but &quot;doesn&#x27;t need earthshaking revelations; it&#x27;s about kids who grow willing to talk to one another, and it has a surprisingly good ear for the way they speak.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote: &quot;This confessional formula has worked in films as different as &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, &quot;The Big Chill&quot;, and &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; and it works here too. It works especially well in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; because we keep waiting for the film to break out of its claustrophobic set and give us a typical teenage movie sex-or-violence scene. That doesn&#x27;t happen, much to our delight.&quot; Kathleen Carroll from the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; stated, &quot;Hughes has a wonderful knack for communicating the feelings of teenagers, as well as an obvious rapport with his exceptional cast–who deserve top grades.&quot;

Other reviews were less positive. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;There are some good young actors in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, though a couple of them have been given unplayable roles&quot;, namely Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson, adding, &quot;The five young stars would have mixed well even without the fraudulent encounter-group candor towards which &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; forces them. Mr. Hughes, having thought up the characters and simply flung them together, should have left well enough alone.&quot; James Harwood of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film as a movie that &quot;will probably pass as deeply profound among today&#x27;s teenage audience, meaning the youngsters in the film spend most of their time talking to each other instead of dancing, dropping their drawers and throwing food. This, on the other hand, should not suggest they have anything intelligent to say.&quot;

Among retrospective reviews, James Berardinelli wrote in 1998: &quot;Few will argue that &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a great film, but it has a candor that is unexpected and refreshing in a sea of too-often generic teen-themed films. The material is a little talky (albeit not in a way that will cause anyone to confuse it with something by Éric Rohmer), but it&#x27;s hard not to be drawn into the world of these characters.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 7.60/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;If &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;″s gestures towards authenticity are occasionally undercut by trendy flourishes, its blistering emotional honesty and talented troupe of young actors catapult it to the top of the teen comedy class.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 25 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Writing in 2015, P. J. O&#x27;Rourke called &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; &quot;Hughes&#x27;s masterwork[s]&quot;. He described the former film as an example of Hughes&#x27;s politics, in that the students do not organize a protest, but &quot;present themselves, like good conservatives do, as individuals and place the highest value, like this conservative does, on goofing off. Otherwise known as individual liberty.&quot;

===Box office===
In February 1985, the film debuted at No. 3 at the box office (behind &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and &quot;Witness&quot;). Grossing $45,875,171 domestically and $51,525,171 worldwide, the film was a box office success, given its $1 million budget.

===Accolades===

Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Paul Gleason and Ally Sheedy all won a Silver Bucket of Excellence Award at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.
==Legacy==
&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; has been called the quintessential 1980s film. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked it at number 369 on their &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list. It later ranked at number 38 on their 2014 list. Similarly, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film number 1 on its list of the 50 Best High School Movies. In the 2001 parody film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, Gleason reprised his role as Assistant Principal Vernon in a short scene that parodies &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. To emphasize its eminent position within the canon of American coming-of-age films and its continued influence to this day, scholar Björn Sonnenberg-Schrank called &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of the teen film genre&quot;. Sebastian Stan described the superhero film &quot;Thunderbolts*&quot; (2025) as &quot;&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; of Marvel&quot;.

In 2005, the film received the Silver Bucket of Excellence Award in honor of its 20th anniversary at the &quot;MTV Movie Awards&quot;. For the event, MTV attempted to reunite the original cast. Sheedy, Ringwald, and Hall appeared together on stage, with Kapelos in the audience; Gleason gave the award to his former castmates. Estevez could not attend because of other commitments, and Nelson appeared earlier in the show but left before the on-stage reunion, prompting Hall to joke that the two were &quot;in Africa with Dave Chappelle&quot;. Yellowcard performed Simple Minds&#x27; anthem for the film, &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, at the awards. At the 82nd Academy Awards (March 7, 2010), Sheedy, Hall, Ringwald, and Nelson all appeared in a tribute to John Hughes—who had died the prior year—along with other actors who had worked with him, including Jon Cryer from &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, Matthew Broderick from &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, and Macaulay Culkin from &quot;Home Alone&quot;. In 2012, the Nickelodeon television series &quot;Victorious&quot; had their own spoof on the film, in the episode titled &quot;The Breakfast Bunch&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article written by Ringwald in which she critiqued Hughes&#x27;s films &quot;in the age of #MeToo&quot;, beginning with a discussion of how she explained to her ten-year-old daughter what happened in the scene when her character seems to be sexually assaulted under a desk. The essay provoked some to claim that Ringwald was criticising the director who made her into a film star, but she was defended by Jenny Han for a &quot;tender, fair-minded piece&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack, The Breakfast Club (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), was produced by British pop musician Keith Forsey and released on February 19, 1985, by A&amp;M Records. The album peaked at No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, performed by Scottish rock band Simple Minds, was released as a single on February 23, 1985, in the United States and reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was released on April 8, 1985, in the United Kingdom.

===Track listing===

=== Overview ===
The album contains ten songs that are played partially throughout the movie, performed by bands and singers of the rock and new wave genre, including three instrumental songs by record producer Keith Forsey. Simple Minds&#x27;s international hit &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; is played in the opening and closing credits. A music video was made for this song and for Wang Chung&#x27;s &quot;Fire in the Twilight&quot; (reached No 110 on the US &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;). Not included on the soundtrack is the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; that the students are whistling when Principal Vernon walks into the room.

=== Critical reception ===
In a June 25, 1985 review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;D−&quot; and said that it has &quot;utterly negligible&quot; songs, and he commended Simple Minds for trying to distance themselves from their song, &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, best known for being played during the film&#x27;s opening and closing credits. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the soundtrack three out of five stars and wrote that, apart from Simple Minds&#x27; &quot;undisputed masterpiece&quot;, the album is largely &quot;disposable&quot; and marred by &quot;&#x27;80s artifacts&quot; and &quot;forgettable instrumentals&quot;.

== Cancelled sequel ==
Hughes had considered a sequel to the film, focusing on the teens reuniting years later in their 30s while serving detention in university. Only now the polar opposite of how they were in the first film. The film was never made prior to Hughes&#x27; death.

<text>Tasmania (; palawa kani: &quot;lutruwita&quot;) is an island state of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, and is separated from it by the Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 1000 islands. It is Australia&#x27;s smallest and least populous state, with 573,479 residents . The state capital and largest city is Hobart, with around 40% of the population living in the Greater Hobart area. Tasmania is the most decentralised state in Australia, with the lowest proportion of its residents living within its capital city.

Tasmania&#x27;s main island was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples. It is thought that Aboriginal Tasmanians became separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 11,700 years ago, after rising sea levels formed Bass Strait. The island was permanently settled by Europeans in 1803 as a penal settlement of the British Empire to prevent claims to the land by the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of British settlement, but was almost wiped out within 30 years during a period of conflicts with settlers known as the &quot;Black War&quot; and the spread of infectious diseases. The conflict, which peaked between 1825 and 1831 and led to more than three years of martial law, killed almost 1,100 Aboriginal people and settlers.

Under British rule, the island was initially part of the Colony of New South Wales; however, it became a separate colony under the name Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (named after Anthony van Diemen) in 1825. Approximately 80,000 convicts were sent to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land before this practice, known as transportation, ceased in 1853. In 1855, the present Constitution of Tasmania was enacted, and the following year the colony formally changed its name to Tasmania. In 1901, it became a state of Australia through the process of the federation of Australia.

Today, Tasmania has the second smallest economy of the Australian states and territories, and comprises principally tourism, agriculture, aquaculture, education, and healthcare. Tasmania is a significant agricultural exporter, as well as a significant destination for eco-tourism. About 42% of its land area, including national parks and World Heritage Sites (21%), is protected in some form of reserve. The first environmental political party in the world was founded in Tasmania.

==Toponymy==
Tasmania is named after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. Tasman named the island Anthony van Diemen&#x27;s Land after his sponsor Anthony van Diemen, the Governor of the Dutch East Indies. The name was later shortened to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land by the British. It was officially renamed &quot;Tasmania&quot; in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.

Tasmania was sometimes referred to as &quot;Dervon&quot;, as mentioned in the Jerilderie Letter written by the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is &quot;Tassie&quot;. Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to &quot;Tas&quot;, mainly when used in business names and website addresses. TAS is also the Australia Post abbreviation for the state.

In the constructed palawa kani language, the main island of Tasmania is called &quot;lutruwita&quot;, a name originally derived from the Bruny Island Tasmanian language. George Augustus Robinson recorded it as &quot;Loe.trou.witter&quot; and also as &quot;Trow.wer.nar&quot;, probably from one or more of the eastern or Northeastern Tasmanian languages. However, he also recorded it as a name for Cape Barren Island. In the 20th century, some writers used it as an Aboriginal name for Tasmania, spelled &quot;Trowenna&quot; or &quot;Trowunna&quot;. It is now believed that the name is more properly applied to Cape Barren Island, which has had an official dual name of &quot;Truwana&quot; since 2014.

A number of palawa kani names, based on historical records of aboriginal names, have been accepted by the Tasmanian government. A dozen of these (below) are &#x27;dual-use&#x27; (bilingual) names, and another two are unbounded areas with only palawa names.

;Bilingual names
;Palawa names
* larapuna: an unbounded area centred on the Bay of Fires
* Narawntapu National Park (formerly Asbestos Range National Park)
* putalina: an unbounded area centred on Oyster Cove (including the community of Oyster Cove)

There are also a number of archaeological sites with Palawa names. Some of these names have been contentious, with names being proposed without consultation with the aboriginal community, or without having a connection to the place in question.

As well as a diverse First Nations geography, where remnants are preserved in rough form by European documentation, Tasmania is known as a place for unorthodox place-names. These names often come about from lost definitions, where descriptive names have lost their old meanings and have taken on new modern interpretations (e.g. &#x27;Bobs Knobs&#x27;). Other names have retained their original meaning, and are often quaint or endearing descriptions (e.g. &#x27;Paradise&#x27;).

==History==

===Physical history===
The island was adjoined to the mainland of Australia until the end of the last glacial period about 11,700 years ago. Much of the island is composed of Jurassic dolerite intrusions (the upwelling of magma) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world&#x27;s largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The central plateau and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites. Mount Wellington above Hobart is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.

In the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by sandstone and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, Precambrian quartzites were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or Frenchmans Cap.

In the northeast and east, continental granites can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at Mount Read near Rosebery, or at Mount Lyell near Queenstown. Also present in the south and northwest is limestone with caves.

The quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of glaciation, and much of Australia&#x27;s glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. Cradle Mountain, another dolerite peak, for example, was a nunatak. The combination of these different rock types contributes to scenery which is distinct from any other region of the world. In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost wholly quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.

===Aboriginal people===
Evidence indicates the presence of Aboriginal people in Tasmania about 42,000 years ago. Rising sea levels cut Tasmania off from mainland Australia about 10,000 years ago and by the time of European contact, the Aboriginal people in Tasmania had nine major nations or ethnic groups. At the time of the British occupation and colonisation in 1803, the indigenous population was estimated at between 3,000 and 10,000.

Historian Lyndall Ryan&#x27;s analysis of population studies led her to conclude that there were about 7,000 spread throughout the island&#x27;s nine nations; Nicholas Clements, citing research by N.J.B. Plomley and Rhys Jones, settled on a figure of 3,000 to 4,000. They engaged in fire-stick farming, hunted game including kangaroo and wallabies, caught seals, mutton-birds, shellfish and fish and lived as nine separate &quot;nations&quot; on the island, which they knew as &quot;Trouwunna&quot;.

=== European arrival and governance ===

The first reported sighting of Tasmania by a European was on 24 November 1642 by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who landed at today&#x27;s Blackman Bay. More than a century later, in 1772, a French expedition led by Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne landed at (nearby but different) Blackmans Bay, and the following year Tobias Furneaux became the first Englishman to land in Tasmania when he arrived at Adventure Bay, which he named after his ship HMS &quot;Adventure&quot;. Captain James Cook also landed at Adventure Bay in 1777. Matthew Flinders and George Bass sailed through Bass Strait in 17981799, determining for the first time that Tasmania was an island.

Sealers and whalers based themselves on Tasmania&#x27;s islands from 1798, and in August 1803 New South Wales Governor Philip King sent Lieutenant John Bowen to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the Derwent River in order to forestall any claims to the island by French explorers who had been exploring the southern Australian coastline. Bowen, who led a party of 49, including 21 male and three female convicts, named the camp Risdon.

Several months later, a second settlement was established by Captain David Collins, with 308 convicts, to the south in Sullivans Cove on the western side of the Derwent, where fresh water was more plentiful. The latter settlement became known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, later shortened to Hobart, after the British Colonial Secretary of the time, Lord Hobart. The settlement at Risdon was later abandoned. Left on their own without further supplies, the Sullivans Cove settlement suffered severe food shortages and by 1806 its inhabitants were starving, with many resorting to scraping seaweed off rocks and scavenging washed-up whale blubber from the shore to survive.

A smaller colony was established at Port Dalrymple on the Tamar River in the island&#x27;s north in October 1804 and several other convict-based settlements were established, including the particularly harsh penal colonies at Port Arthur in the southeast and Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast. Tasmania was eventually sent 75,000 convicts—four out of every ten people transported to Australia. By 1819, the Aboriginal and British population reached parity with about 5000 of each, although among the colonists men outnumbered women four-to-one. Free settlers began arriving in large numbers from 1820, lured by the promise of land grants and free convict labour. Settlement in the island&#x27;s northwest corner was monopolised by the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company, which sent its first surveyors to the district in 1826. By 1830, one-third of Australia&#x27;s non-Indigenous population lived in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and the island accounted for about half of all land under cultivation and exports.

====Black War====


Tensions between Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal and white inhabitants rose, partly driven by increasing competition for kangaroo and other game. Explorer and naval officer John Oxley in 1810 noted the &quot;many atrocious cruelties&quot; inflicted on Aboriginal people by convict bushrangers in the north, which in turn led to black attacks on solitary white hunters. Hostilities increased further with the arrival of 600 colonists from Norfolk Island between 1807 and 1813. They established farms along the River Derwent and east and west of Launceston, occupying ten percent of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. By 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12,600, while the island&#x27;s sheep population had reached 200,000. The rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with grazing livestock as well as fences, hedges and stone walls, while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers.

Violence began to spiral rapidly from the mid-1820s in what became described as the &quot;Black War&quot;. Aboriginal inhabitants were driven to desperation by hunger – that included a desire for agricultural produce, as well as feeling anger at the prevalence of abductions of women and girls. New settlers motivated by fear carried out self-defence operations as well as attacks as a means of suppressing the native threat – or even in some cases, exacting revenge. Van Diemen&#x27;s Land had an enormous gender imbalance, with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822and 16 to one among the convict population. Historian Nicholas Clements has suggested the &quot;voracious appetite&quot; for native women was the most important trigger for the explosion of violence from the late 1820s.

From 1825 to 1828, the number of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among settlers. Over the summer of 18261827 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and made it clear that they wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826, Governor Sir George Arthur issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aboriginal people when they attacked settlers or their property, and in the following eight months more than 200 Aboriginal people were killed in the Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists. After another eight months, the death toll had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 Aboriginal people. In April 1828, Arthur issued a Proclamation of Demarcation forbidding Aboriginal people to enter the settled districts without a passport issued by the government. Arthur declared martial law in the colony in November that year, and this remained in force for over three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.

In November 1830, Arthur organised the so-called &quot;Black Line&quot;, ordering every able-bodied male colonist to assemble at one of seven designated places in the Settled Districts to join a massive drive to sweep Aboriginal people out of the region and on to the Tasman Peninsula. The campaign failed and was abandoned seven weeks later, but by then Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal population had fallen to about 300.

==== Removal of Aboriginal people ====

After hostilities between settlers and Aboriginal peoples ceased in 1832, almost all of the remnants of the Indigenous population were persuaded by government agent George Augustus Robinson to move to Flinders Island. Many quickly succumbed to infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, reducing the population further. Of those removed from Tasmania, the last to die was Truganini, in 1876.

The near-destruction of Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians including Robert Hughes, James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan and Tom Lawson. However, other historians including Henry Reynolds, Richard Broome and Nicholas Clements do not agree with the genocide thesis, arguing that the colonial authorities did not intend to destroy the Aboriginal population in whole or in part. Boyce has claimed that the April 1828 &quot;Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants&quot; sanctioned force against Aboriginal people &quot;for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal&quot;. However, as Reynolds, Broome and Clements point out, there was open warfare at the time. Boyce described the decision to remove all Tasmanian Aboriginal people after 1832by which time they had given up their fight against white colonistsas an extreme policy position. He concluded: &quot;The colonial government from 1832 to 1838 ethnically cleansed the western half of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.&quot; Nevertheless, Clements and Flood note that there was another wave of violence in north-west Tasmania in 1841, involving attacks on settlers&#x27; huts by a band of Aboriginal Tasmanians who had not been removed from the island.

==== Proclamation as a colony ====


Van Diemen&#x27;s Landwhich thus far had existed as a territory within the colony of New South Waleswas proclaimed a separate colony, with its own judicial establishment and Legislative Council, on 3 December 1825. Transportation to the island ceased in 1853 and the colony was renamed Tasmania in 1856, partly to differentiate the burgeoning society of free settlers from the island&#x27;s convict past.

The Legislative Council of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land drafted a new constitution which gained Royal Assent in 1855. The Privy Council also approved the colony changing its name from &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; to &quot;Tasmania&quot;, and in 1856 the newly elected bicameral parliament sat for the first time, establishing Tasmania as a self-governing colony of the British Empire.

The colony suffered from economic fluctuations, but for the most part was prosperous, experiencing steady growth. With few external threats and strong trade links with the Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually played a significant role in the Second Boer War in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians.

==== Federation ====

In 1901, the Colony of Tasmania united with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia. Tasmanians voted in favour of federation with the largest majority of all the Australian colonies.

===20th and 21st century===
Tasmania was an early adopter of electric street lighting. Australia&#x27;s first electric street lights were switched on in Waratah in 1886. Launceston became the first completely electrified city on the island in 1885, followed closely by the township of Zeehan in 1900.

The state economy was riding mining prosperity until World War I. In 1901, the state population was 172,475. The 1910 foundation of what would become Hydro Tasmania began to shape urban patterns, as well as future major damming programs. Hydro&#x27;s influence culminated in the 1970s when the state government announced plans to flood environmentally significant Lake Pedder. As a result of the eventual flooding of Lake Pedder, the world&#x27;s first green party was established; the United Tasmania Group. National and international attention surrounded the campaign against the Franklin Dam in the early 1980s.

Tasmanian Enid Lyons became the first female member of the House of Representatives at the 1943 federal election and first female to serve in the federal cabinet. In May 1948, Margaret McIntyre achieved another milestone as the first female elected to the Parliament of Tasmania. Less than six months after her election, McIntyre died in the crash of the &quot;Lutana&quot; near Quirindi on 2 September 1948.

After the end of World War II, the state saw major urbanisation, and the growth of towns like Ulverstone. It gained a reputation as &quot;Sanitorium of the South&quot; and a health-focused tourist boom began to grow. The&quot; Princess of Tasmania&quot; began her maiden voyage in 1959, the first car ferry to Tasmania. As part of the boom, Tasmania allowed the opening of the first casino in Australia in 1968. Queen Elizabeth II visited the state in 1954, and the 50s and 60s were charactered by the opening of major public services, including the Tasmanian Housing Department and Metro Tasmania public bus services. A jail was opened at Risdon in 1960, and the State Library of Tasmania the same year. The University of Tasmania also moved to its present location in 1963.

The state was badly affected by the 1967 Tasmanian fires, killing 64 people and destroying over 652,000 acres in five hours. In 1975 the Tasman Bridge collapsed when the bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot;. It was the only bridge in Hobart, and made crossing the Derwent River by road at the city impossible. The nearest bridge was approximately to the north, at Bridgewater.

Throughout the 1980s, strong environmental concerns saw the building of the Australian Antarctic Division headquarters, and the proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. The Franklin Dam was blocked by the federal government in 1983, and CSIRO opened its marine studies centre in Hobart. Pope John Paul II would hold mass at Elwick Racecourse in 1986.

The 1990s were characterised by the fight for LGBT rights in Tasmania, culminating in the intervention of the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1997 and the decriminalization of homosexuality that year. Christine Milne became the first female leader of a Tasmanian political party in 1993, and major council amalgamations reduce the number of councils from 46 to 29.

Following the Port Arthur massacre on 28 April 1996, which resulted in the loss of 35 lives and injured 21 others, the Australian Government conducted a review of its firearms policies and enacted new nationwide gun ownership laws under the National Firearms Agreement.

In 2000, Queen Elizabeth II once again visited the state. Gunns rose to prominence as a major forestry company during this decade, only to collapse in 2013. In 2004, Premier Jim Bacon died in office from lung cancer. In January 2011 philanthropist David Walsh opened the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart to international acclaim. Within 12 months, MONA became Tasmania&#x27;s top tourism attraction.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Tasmania resulted in at least 230 cases and 13 deaths . In 2020, after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread to Australia, the Tasmanian government issued a public health emergency on 17 March, the following month receiving the state&#x27;s most significant outbreak from the North-West which required assistance from the Federal government. In late 2021, Tasmania was leading the nationwide vaccination response.

==Geography==

Tasmania, the largest island of Australia, has a landmass of and is located directly in the pathway of the notorious &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; wind that encircles the globe. To its north, it is separated from mainland Australia by Bass Strait. Tasmania is the only Australian state that is not located on the Australian mainland. About south of Tasmania island lies the George V Coast of Antarctica. Depending on which borders of the oceans are used, the island can be said to be either surrounded by the Southern Ocean, or to have the Pacific on its east and the Indian to its west. Still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have Tasmania with the Great Australian Bight to the west, and the Tasman Sea to the east. The southernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately at South East Cape, and the northernmost point on mainland Tasmania is approximately in Woolnorth / Temdudheker near Cape Grim / Kennaook. Tasmania lies at similar latitudes to Te Waipounamu / South Island of New Zealand and parts of Patagonia in South America. Areas at equivalent latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere include Hokkaido in Japan, Northeast China (Manchuria), Central Italy, and United States cities such as New York and Chicago. 

The most mountainous region is the Central Highlands area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. The Midlands located in the central east, is fairly flat, and is predominantly used for agriculture, although farming activity is scattered throughout the state. Tasmania&#x27;s tallest mountain is Mount Ossa at . Much of Tasmania is still densely forested, with the Southwest National Park and neighbouring areas holding some of the last temperate rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere. The Tarkine, containing Savage River National Park located in the island&#x27;s far north west, is the largest temperate rainforest area in Australia covering about . With its rugged topography, Tasmania has a great number of rivers. Several of Tasmania&#x27;s largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide hydroelectricity. Many rivers begin in the Central Highlands and flow out to the coast. Tasmania&#x27;s major population centres are mainly situated around estuaries (some of which are named rivers).

Tasmania is in the shape of a downward-facing triangle, likened to a shield, heart, or face. It consists of the main island as well as at least a thousand neighbouring islands within the state&#x27;s jurisdiction. The largest of these are Flinders Island in the Furneaux Group of Bass Strait, King Island in the west of Bass Strait, Cape Barren Island south of Flinders Island, Bruny Island separated from Tasmania by the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel, Macquarie Island 1,500 km from Tasmania, and Maria Island off the east coast. 
Tasmania features a number of separated and continuous mountain ranges. The majority of the state is defined by a significant dolerite exposure, though the western half of the state is older and more rugged, featuring buttongrass plains, temperate rainforests, and quartzite ranges, notably Federation Peak and Frenchmans Cap. The presence of these mountain ranges is a primary factor in the rain shadow effect, where the western half receives the majority of rainfall, which also influences the types of vegetation that can grow. The Central Highlands feature a large plateau which forms a number of ranges and escarpments on its north side, tapering off along the south, and radiating into the highest mountain ranges in the west. At the north-west of this, another plateau radiates into a system of hills where takayna / Tarkine is located.

The Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) divides Tasmania into 9 bioregions: 
Ben Lomond, Furneaux, King, Central Highlands, Northern Midlands, Northern Slopes, Southern Ranges, South East, and West.

Tasmania&#x27;s environment consistes of many different biomes or communities across its different regions. It is the most forested state in Australia, and preserves the country&#x27;s largest areas of temperate rainforest. A distinctive type of moorland found across the west, and particularly south-west of Tasmania, are buttongrass plains, which are speculated to have been expanded by Tasmanian Aboriginal burning practices. Tasmania also features a diverse alpine garden environment, such as cushion plant. Highland areas receive consistent snowfall above ~1,000 metres every year, and due to cold air from Antarctica, this level often reaches 800 m, and more occasionally 600 or 400 metres. Every five or so years, snow can form at sea level. This environment gives rise to the cypress forests of the Central Plateau and mountainous highlands. In particular, the Walls of Jerusalem with large areas of rare pencil pine, and its closest relative King Billy pine. On the West Coast Range and partially on Mount Field, Australia&#x27;s only winter-deciduous plant, deciduous beech is found, which forms a carpet or krummholz, or very rarely a 4-metre tree.

Tasmania features a high concentration of waterfalls. These can be found in small creeks, alpine streams, rapid rivers, or off precipitous plunges. Some of the tallest waterfalls are found on mountain massifs, sometimes at a 200-metre cascade. The most famous and most visited waterfall in Tasmania is Russell Falls in Mount Field due to its proximity to Hobart and stepped falls at a total height of 58 metres. 
Tasmania also has a large number of beaches, the longest of which is Ocean Beach on the West Coast at about 40 kilometres. Wineglass Bay in Freycinet on the east coast is a well-known landmark of the state.

The Tasmanian temperate rainforests cover a few different types. These are also considered distinct from the more common wet sclerophyll forests, though these eucalypt forests often form with rainforest understorey and ferns (such as tree-ferns) are usually never absent. Rainforest found in deep gullies are usually difficult to traverse due to dense understorey growth, such as from horizontal (&quot;Anodopetalum biglandulosum&quot;). Higher-elevation forests (~500 to 800 m) have smaller ground vegetation and are thus easier to walk in. The most common rainforests usually have a 50-metre canopy and are varied by environmental factors. Emergent growth usually comes from eucalyptus, which can tower another 50 metres higher (usually less), providing the most common choice of nesting for giant wedge-tailed eagles.

The human environment ranges from urban or industrial development to farming or grazing land. The most cultivated area is the Midlands, where it has suitable soil but is also the driest part of the state.

Tasmania&#x27;s was possibly detected by Captain Abel Tasman when he charted Tasmania&#x27;s coast in 1642. On 5 December, Tasman was following the east coast northward to see how far it went. When the land veered to the north-west at Eddystone Point, he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the Roaring Forties howling through Bass Strait. Tasman was on a mission to find the Southern Continent, not more islands, so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.

The next European to enter the strait was Captain James Cook on HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; in April 1770. However, after sailing for two hours westward into the strait against the wind, he turned back east and noted in his journal that he was &quot;doubtful whether they [i.e. Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and New Holland] are one land or no&quot;.

The strait was named after George Bass, after he and Matthew Flinders passed through it while circumnavigating Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in the &quot;Norfolk&quot; in 1798–99. At Flinders&#x27; recommendation, the Governor of New South Wales, John Hunter, in 1800 named the stretch of water between the mainland and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land &quot;Bass&#x27;s Straits&quot;. Later it became known as Bass Strait.

The existence of the strait had been suggested in 1797 by the master of Sydney Cove when he reached Sydney after deliberately grounding his foundering ship and being stranded on Preservation Island (at the eastern end of the strait). He reported that the strong south westerly swell and the tides and currents suggested that the island was in a channel linking the Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. Governor Hunter thus wrote to Joseph Banks in August 1797 that it seemed certain a strait existed.

===Climate===


Tasmania has a relatively cool temperate climate compared to the rest of Australia, spared from the hot summers of the mainland and experiencing four distinct seasons. Summer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is and inland areas around Launceston reach . Other inland areas are much cooler, with Liawenee, located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia, ranging between in February. Autumn is from March to May, with mostly settled weather, as summer patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns. The winter months are from June to August and are generally the wettest and coldest months in the state, with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums are on average along coastal areas and on the central plateau, as a result of a series of cold fronts from the Southern Ocean. Inland areas receive regular freezes throughout the winter months. Spring is from September to November, and is an unsettled season of transition, where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, although snowfall is still common up until October. Spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.


=== Biodiversity ===


Geographically and biological isolated, Tasmania is known for its unique endemic flora and fauna.

==== Flora ====
Tasmania has extremely diverse vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen eucalypt forest, alpine heathlands and large areas of cool temperate rainforests and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the supercontinent of Gondwana, 50 million years ago. &quot;Nothofagus gunnii&quot;, commonly known as Australian beech, is Australia&#x27;s only temperate native deciduous tree and is found exclusively in Tasmania.

Distinctive species of plant in Tasmania include:
* &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; (mountain ash) – the tallest flowering plant and hardwood in the world, reaching 100 m (328 ft).
* &quot;Nothofagus cunninghamii&quot; (myrtle beech) – the most abundant temperate rainforest canopy species found in Tasmania.
* &quot;Nothofagus gunnii&quot; (deciduous beech) – Australia&#x27;s only winter-deciduous tree.
* &quot;Atherosperma moschatum&quot; (blackheart sassafras) – a co-dominant rainforest tree with a nutmeg aroma.
* &quot;Lagarostrobos franklinii&quot; (Huon pine) – one of the oldest-lived tree species, and a self-preserving timber. 
* &quot;Phyllocladus aspleniifolius&quot; (celery-top pine) – a celery-leaved conifer found in rainforests.
* Athrotaxis (Tasmanian cedar/redwood) – a genus comprising three extant species related to sequoia found in Tasmania.
* &quot;Eucryphia lucida&quot; (leatherwood) – a prominent floral symbol of Tasmania and a unique monofloral honey species.

===== Bush tucker =====

Tasmania also has a number of native edibles, known as bush tucker in Australia. These plants were foraged by the Tasmanian Aboriginals and also used for other purposes, such as construction. Unusual trees such as cider gum (&quot;Eucalyptus gunnii&quot;) had their manna used to make a syrup or an alcohol (cider). Other trees such as wattles (acacias) like blackwood (&quot;Acacia melanoxylon&quot;) and mimosa (&quot;Acacia dealbata&quot;) could have their seeds eaten or crushed into a powder. There are also many berries such as snowberry (&quot;Gaultheria hispida&quot;), fruits such as heartberry (&quot;Aristotelia peduncularis&quot;), and vegetables such as river mint (&quot;Mentha australis&quot;), though no crops like maize that are used for large production.

==== Fauna ====
Tasmania has a large percentage of endemism whilst featuring many types of animals found on mainland Australia. Many of these species, such as the platypus, are larger than their mainland relatives.
The island of Tasmania was home to the thylacine, a marsupial which resembled a fossa or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936 and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginal people.

Tasmania is a hotspot for giant habitat trees and the large animal species that occupy them, notably the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax fleayi&quot;), the Tasmanian masked owl (&quot;Tyto novaehollandiae castanops&quot;), the Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (&quot;Astacopsis gouldi&quot;), the yellow wattlebird (&quot;Anthochaera paradoxa&quot;), the green rosella (&quot;Platycercus caledonicus&quot;) and others. Tasmania is also home to the world&#x27;s only three migratory parrots, the critically endangered Orange-bellied parrot (&quot;Neophema chrysogaster&quot;), the Blue-winged parrot (&quot;Neophema chrysostoma&quot;), and the fastest parrot in the world, the swift parrot (&quot;Lathamus discolor&quot;).
Tasmania has 12 endemic species of bird in total.

==== Mycology ====
Tasmania is a hotspot for fungal diversity. The importance of fungi in Tasmania&#x27;s ecology is often overlooked; nonetheless, they play a vital role in the natural vegetation cycle. Tasmania&#x27;s southwestern wilderness hosts a rich diversity of alpine lichens, with at least 162 documented species. The region&#x27;s alpine lichen flora is particularly notable for its high level of endemism, with approximately 16% of species found nowhere else in the world. The area&#x27;s cool maritime climate, Precambrian geology, and extensive peat formations create unique habitats for these organisms. The lichen communities differ significantly from those found on Tasmania&#x27;s eastern dolerite mountains, with the southwestern species showing stronger affinities to New Zealand and sub-Antarctic flora rather than to mainland Australia. Major lichen habitats in the alpine southwest include heathlands, alpine lawns, feldmark (windswept rocky plateaus), and large rock outcrops, each supporting distinct assemblages of species. Some particularly diverse genera in the region include &quot;Bunodophoron&quot;, &quot;Cladia&quot;, &quot;Cladonia&quot;, &quot;Menegazzia&quot;, &quot;Micarea&quot;, &quot;Pertusaria&quot;, &quot;Pseudocyphellaria&quot;, &quot;Psoroma&quot;, &quot;Siphula&quot;, and &quot;Stereocaulon&quot;.

==== Conservation ====
Like the rest of Australia, Tasmania suffers from an endangered species problem. In particular, many important Tasmanian subspecies and world-significant species of animal are classified as at risk in some way. A famous example is the Tasmanian devil, which is endangered due to devil facial tumour disease. Some species have already gone extinct, primarily due to human interference, such as in the case of the thylacine or the Tasmanian emu. In Tasmania, there are about 90 endangered, vulnerable, or threatened vertebrate species classified by the state or Commonwealth governments. Because of a reliance on roads and private vehicle transport, and a high concentration of animal populations divided by this development, Tasmania has the worst (per kilometre) roadkill rate in the world, with 32 animals killed per hour and at least 300,000 per year.

Protected areas of Tasmania cover 21% of the island&#x27;s land area in the form of national parks. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) was inscribed by UNESCO in 1982, where it is globally significant because &quot;most UNESCO World Heritage sites meet only one or two of the ten criteria for that status. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) meets 7 out of 10 criteria. Only one other place on earth—China’s Mount Taishan—meets that many criteria&quot;. 
Controversy surrounds the decision in 2014 by the Abbott federal Liberal government to request the area&#x27;s delisting and opening for resource exploration (before it was rejected by the UN Committee at Doha), and the current mining and deforestation in the state&#x27;s Tarkine region, the largest single temperate rainforest in Australia.

==Demography==

The population of Tasmania is the most homogeneous of any Australian state, being mostly of British (primarily English) descent.

Until 2012, Tasmania was the only state in Australia with an above-replacement total fertility rate; Tasmanian women had an average of 2.24 children each. By 2012 the birth rate had slipped to 2.1 children per woman, bringing the state to the replacement threshold, but it continues to have the second-highest birth rate of any state or territory (behind the Northern Territory).

Major population centres include Hobart, Launceston, Devonport, Burnie, and Ulverstone. Kingston is often defined as a separate city but is generally regarded as part of the Greater Hobart Area.



===Ancestry and immigration===
At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
19.3% of the population was born overseas at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (3.7%), New Zealand (1%), Mainland China (0.6%), Scotland (0.4%) and the Netherlands (0.4%).

4.6% of the population, or 23,572 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.

===Language===
At the , 86.1% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (1.5%), Nepali (1.3%), Punjabi (0.5%) and Spanish (0.3%).

=== Religion ===
In 2021, 50.0% of people in Tasmania reported having no religious affiliation, a substantial increase from 38.2% in 2016 and just 5.1% in 1971. Meanwhile, Christianity remained the largest religious affiliation in the state, with 38.4% identifying as Christian, though this proportion has steadily declined over time—from 88.7% in 1971 to 49.7% in 2016.

Non-Christian religions accounted for 4.5% of the population in 2021, with Hinduism (1.7%), Buddhism (1.0%), and Islam (0.9%) being the most prevalent among them.

==Government==


The form of the government of Tasmania is prescribed in its constitution, which dates from 1934. Since 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Australian Constitution regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government is allowed.

Tasmania is represented in the Senate by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the House of Representatives, Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitution—the number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone. Tasmania&#x27;s House of Assembly use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as Hare-Clark.

===Parliamentary elections===
At the 2002 state election, the Labor Party won 14 of the 25 House seats. The people decreased their vote for the Liberal Party; representation in the Parliament fell to seven seats. The Greens won four seats, with over 18% of the popular vote, the highest proportion of any Green party in any parliament in the world at that time.

On 23 February 2004 the Premier Jim Bacon announced his retirement, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. In his last months he opened a vigorous anti-smoking campaign which included many restrictions on where individuals could smoke, such as pubs. He died four months later. Bacon was succeeded by Paul Lennon, who, after leading the state for two years, went on to win the 2006 state election in his own right. Lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by David Bartlett, who formed a coalition government with the Greens after the 2010 state election resulted in a hung parliament. Bartlett resigned as Premier in January 2011 and was replaced by Lara Giddings, who became Tasmania&#x27;s first female Premier. In March 2014 Will Hodgman&#x27;s Liberal Party won government, ending sixteen years of Labor governance, and ending an eight-year period for Hodgman himself as Leader of the Opposition. Hodgman then won a second term of government in the 2018 state election, but resigned mid-term in January 2020 and was replaced by Peter Gutwein.

In May 2021, the Tasmanian state election was held after being called early by the incumbent Liberal Party, resulting in their return to government and establishment of a one-seat majority. It was also the first time that the Liberal Party had been elected three-times in a row.

In April 2022, former deputy premier Jeremy Rockliff became Premier after Gutwein announced his retirement from politics.

===Politics===
Tasmania has a number of undeveloped regions. Proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity, or opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the Lake Pedder reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world&#x27;s first Green party, the United Tasmania Group.

In the early 1980s the state debated the proposed Franklin River Dam. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to old growth logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.

In 1996, the House of Assembly consisted of 35 seats with 7 seats per each of the five electorates. By the 1998 election, the number of seats had been reduced down to 25, or 5 per each electorate. This resulted in the reduction of the Greens&#x27; number of seats from 4 to 1, and increased the proportion of seats held by both the Labor and Liberal parties. This was despite growth in population (five-fold since responsible government) and an increase in the voting percentage required for a majority government. There was also no public consultation, and inquiries at the time had recommended the opposite. The House of Assembly Select Committee in 2020 recommended in its report that the number should be increased again from 25 to 35, arguing that such a small representation would undermine democracy and limit the capabilities of the government. In 2010, the major party leadership had even endorsed reinstating the 35 seat number, but Liberal and Labor support was withdrawn the following year, with only the Greens keeping their commitment. 


===Local government===
Tasmania has 29 local government areas. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.

As with the House of Assembly, Tasmania&#x27;s local government elections use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as Hare–Clark. Local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission by full postal ballot. The next local government elections will be held during October 2026.

==Economy==


Traditionally, Tasmania&#x27;s main industries have been mining (including copper, zinc, tin, and iron), agriculture, forestry, and tourism. Tasmania is on Australia&#x27;s electrical grid and in the 1940s and 1950s, a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by Hydro Tasmania. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time. The state also has a large number of food exporting sectors, including but not limited to seafood (such as salmon, abalone and crayfish).

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears, with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, saffron, pyrethrum and cherries have been fostered by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research.

Favourable economic conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new &quot;Spirit of Tasmania&quot; ferries have all contributed to what is now a rising tourism industry.

About 1.7% of the Tasmanian population are employed by local government. Other major employers include Nyrstar, Norske Skog, Grange Resources, Rio Tinto, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hobart, and Federal Group. Small business is a large part of the community life, including Incat, Moorilla Estate and Tassal. In the late 1990s, a number of national companies based their call centres in the state after obtaining cheap access to broad-band fibre optic connections.

34% of Tasmanians are reliant on welfare payments as their primary source of income. This number is in part due to the large number of older residents and retirees in Tasmania receiving Age Pensions. Due to its natural environment and clean air, Tasmania is a common retirement selection for Australians.



===Science and technology===
The modern scientific sector in Tasmania benefits from around $500 million in annual investment.
Tasmania has a long history of scientific and technological innovation. The first scientific-style observations were conducted by the First Nation Tasmanians, primarily through the watching and mythologising of the night sky. Their story explaining the phases of the moon and sun &quot;is one of the rare accounts that explicitly acknowledges that the light of the Moon is a reflection of the Sun&#x27;s light&quot;.

The French D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Expedition of 1792–93 had anchored twice during its search of the missing La Pérouse in the Baie de la Recherche (Recherche Bay) in far-south Tasmania. During their stay, the crew took botanical, astronomical, and geomagnetic observations which were the first of their kind performed on Australian soil. As well as this, they engaged in amicable relations with the locals and environment, gifting the area a &quot;French garden&quot;, in which &quot;the relatively extensive, well-documented (both pictorially and written) encounters [...] between [them] provided a very early opportunity for meetings and mutual observation&quot;.

The longest-running branch of the Royal Society outside of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society of Tasmania which was summoned in 1843. The Tasmanian Society of Natural History had been formed previously in 1838 before its merger with the Royal Society in 1849. It had been served by early botanists working in Tasmania such as Ronald Gunn and his correspondences.

Although Tamworth in New South Wales is often credited as being the first place in Australia with electric street lighting in 1888, Waratah in North West Tasmania was actually the first place to do so in Australia in 1886, although at a smaller scale.

==Culture==
=== Literature ===


Notable titles by Tasmanian authors include &quot;The Museum of Modern Love&quot; by Heather Rose, &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; by Richard Flanagan, &quot;The Alphabet of Light and Dark&quot; by Danielle Wood, &quot;The Roving Party&quot; by Rohan Wilson and &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; by Christopher Koch, &quot;The Rain Queen&quot; by Katherine Scholes, &quot;Bridget Crack&quot; by Rachel Leary, and &quot;The Blue Day Book&quot; by Bradley Trevor Greive. A small part of Helen Garner&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; is set in Hobart as the main characters take a sojourn there. Children&#x27;s books include &quot;They Found a Cave&quot; by Nan Chauncy, &quot;The Museum of Thieves&quot; by Lian Tanner, &quot;Finding Serendipity&quot;, &quot;A Week Without Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Blueberry Pancakes Forever&quot; by Angelica Banks, &quot;Tiger Tale&quot; by Marion and Steve Isham. Tasmania is home to the eminent literary magazine that was formed in 1979, Island magazine, and the biennial Tasmanian Writers and Readers Festival, now renamed the Hobart Writers Festival.

Tasmanian Gothic is a literary genre which expresses the island state&#x27;s &quot;peculiar &#x27;otherness&#x27; in relation to the mainland, as a remote, mysterious and self-enclosed place.&quot; Marcus Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;For the Term of his Natural Life&quot;, written in the 1870s and set in convict era Tasmania, is a seminal example. This distinctive Gothic is not just restricted to literature, but can be represented through all the arts, such as in painting, music, or architecture.

===Visual arts===
The biennial &quot;Tasmanian Living Artists&#x27; Week&quot; is a ten-day statewide festival for Tasmania&#x27;s visual artists. The fourth festival in 2007 involved more than 1000 artists. Tasmania is home to two winners of the prestigious Archibald Prize—Jack Carington Smith in 1963 for a portrait of James McAuley, and Geoffrey Dyer in 2003 for his portrait of Richard Flanagan. Photographers Olegas Truchanas and Peter Dombrovskis are known for works that became iconic in the Lake Pedder and Franklin Dam conservation movements. English-born painter John Glover (1767–1849) is known for his paintings of Tasmanian landscapes, and is the namesake for the annual Glover Prize, which is awarded to the best landscape painting of Tasmania. The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) opened in January 2011 at the Moorilla Estate in Berriedale, and is the largest privately owned museum complex in Australia.
===Music and performing arts===

Tasmania has a varied musical scene, ranging from the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra whose home is the Federation Concert Hall, to a substantial number of small bands, orchestras, string quintets, saxophone ensembles and individual artists who perform at a variety of venues around the state. Tasmania is also home to a vibrant community of composers including Constantine Koukias, Maria Grenfell and Don Kay. Tasmania is also home to one of Australia&#x27;s leading new music institutions, IHOS Music Theatre and Opera and gospel choirs, the Southern Gospel Choir. Prominent Australian metal bands Psycroptic and Striborg hail from Tasmania. Noir-rock band The Paradise Motel and 1980s power-pop band The Innocents are also citizens.

The Tasmanian Aboriginals were known to have sung oral traditions, as Fanny Cochrane Smith (the last fluent speaker of any Tasmanian language) had done so in recordings from 1899 to 1903. Tasmania has been home to some early and prominent Australian composers. In piano, Kitty Parker from Longford was described by world-famous Australian composer Percy Grainger as his most gifted student. Peter Sculthorpe was originally from Launceston and became well known in Australia for his works which were influenced by his Tasmanian origins, and he is, by coincidence, distantly related to Fanny Cochrane Smith. In 1996, Sculthorpe composed the piece &quot;Port Arthur: In Memoriam&quot; for chamber orchestra, which was first performed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. Charles Sandys Packer was an early Tasmanian example of the tradition of Australian classical music, transported for the crime of embezzlement in 1839, and at a similar time Francis Hartwell Henslowe had spent time as a public servant in Tasmania. Amy Sherwin, known as the &quot;Tasmanian Nightingale&quot; was a successful soprano, and Eileen Joyce, who came from remote Zeehan, became a world-renowned pianist at the time of her peak.

===Cinema===

Films set in Tasmania include &quot;Young Einstein&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Ruby Rose&quot;, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce&quot;, &quot;Arctic Blast&quot;, &quot;Manganinnie&quot; (with music composed by Peter Sculthorpe), &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;, &quot;Lion&quot;, and &quot;The Nightingale&quot;. Common within Australian cinema, the Tasmanian landscape is a focal point in most of their feature film productions. &quot;The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce&quot; and &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; are both set during an episode of Tasmania&#x27;s convict history. Tasmanian film production goes as far back as the silent era, with the epic &quot;For The Term of His Natural Life&quot; in 1927 being the most expensive feature film made on Australian shores. &quot;The Kettering Incident&quot;, filmed in and around Kettering, Tasmania, won the 2016 AACTA Award for Best Telefeature or Miniseries. The documentary series &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; was partly filmed in Tasmania due to its terrain.

The Tasmanian Film Corporation, which financed &quot;Manganinnie&quot;, was the successor to the Tasmanian Government Department of Film Production but disappeared after privatisation. Its role is now filled by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Screen Tasmania, and private ventures such as Blue Rocket Productions.

===Higher Education===
Tasmania is served by the University of Tasmania, a research university established in 1846.

===Media===

Tasmania has five broadcast television stations which produce local content including ABC Tasmania, Seven Tasmania – an affiliate of the Seven Network, WIN Television Tasmania – an affiliate of the Nine Network, 10 Tasmania – an affiliate of Network 10 (joint owned by WIN and Southern Cross), and SBS.

===Sport===

Sport is an important pastime in Tasmania, and the state has produced several famous sportsmen and women and also hosted several major sporting events. The Tasmanian Tigers cricket team represents the state successfully (for example the Sheffield Shield in 2007, 2011 and 2013) and plays its home games at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, which is also the home ground for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. In addition, Bellerive Oval regularly hosts international cricket matches. Famous Tasmanian cricketers include David Boon, former Australian captains Ricky Ponting and Tim Paine.

Australian rules football in Tasmania is the most watched form of football and a Tasmanian team was awarded a license to enter the Australian Football League (AFL) in 2028 to be based out of a new Macquarie Point Stadium. AFL matches have been played since 2001 at Aurora Stadium in Launceston and Bellerive Oval in Hobart. Local leagues include the North West Football League and Tasmanian State League.

Soccer in Tasmania is the most participated football code and there is an active Tasmanian A-League bid. The existing statewide league is the NPL Tasmania.

Rugby Union is also played in Tasmania and is governed by the Tasmanian Rugby Union. Ten clubs take part in the statewide Tasmanian Rugby Competition.

Tasmania hosts the professional Moorilla International tennis tournament as part of the lead up to the Australian Open and is played at the Hobart International Tennis Centre, Hobart.

The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is an annual event starting in Sydney, NSW, on Boxing Day and finishing in Hobart, Tasmania. It is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.

In basketball, Tasmania has previously been represented in the National Basketball League (NBL) by Launceston Casino City (1980–1982), the Devonport Warriors (1983–1984), and the Hobart Devils (1983–1996). Since the 2021–22 NBL season, Tasmania has been represented by the Tasmania JackJumpers, a state-wide franchise which plays its home games in both Hobart and Launceston. The JackJumpers secured their maiden NBL championship in the 2023–24 season, marking Tasmania&#x27;s first NBL title since Launceston Casino City in 1981.

===Cuisine===

Tasmanian Aboriginal people had a diverse diet, including native currants, pigface, and native plums, and a wide range of birds and kangaroos. Seafood has always been a significant part of the Tasmanian diet, including its wide range of shellfish, which are still commercially farmed such as crayfish, orange roughy, salmon and oysters. Seal meat also formed a significant part of the Aboriginal diet.

Tasmania&#x27;s non-Aboriginal cuisine has a unique history to mainland Australia. It has developed through many subsequent waves of immigration. Tasmanian traditional foods include scallop pies – a pie filled with scallops in curry – and curry powder, which was popularised by Keen&#x27;s Curry in the 19th century. Tasmania also produces and consumes wasabi, saffron, truffles and leatherwood honey.
Tasmania now has a wide range of restaurants, in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns. Scattered across Tasmania are many vineyards, and Tasmanian beer brands such as Boags and Cascade are known and sold in Mainland Australia. King Island off the northwestern coast of Tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses and dairy products.

The &quot;Central Cookery Book&quot; was written in 1930 by A. C. Irvine and is still popular in Australia and even internationally. Tasmanian cuisine is often unique and has won many awards. One example is the Hartshorn Distillery, which has won prizes in the World Vodka Awards for three years in a row since 2017.

===Events===
To foster tourism, the state government encourages or supports several annual events in and around the island. The best known of these is the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, starting on Boxing Day in Sydney and usually arriving at Constitution Dock in Hobart around three to four days later, during the Taste of Tasmania, an annual food and wine festival. Other events include the Targa Tasmania rally which attracts rally drivers from around the world and is staged all over the state, over five days. Rural or regional events include Agfest, a three-day agricultural show held at Carrick (just west of Launceston) in early May and NASA supported TastroFest – Tasmania&#x27;s Astronomy Festival, held early August in Ulverstone (Northwest Tasmania). The Royal Hobart Show and Royal Launceston Show are both held in October annually.

Music events held in Tasmania include the Falls Festival at Marion Bay (a Victorian event now held in both Victoria and Tasmania on New Year&#x27;s Eve); the Festival of Voices, a national celebration of song held each year in Hobart attracting international and national teachers and choirs in the heart of Winter; and MS Fest, a charity music event held in Launceston to raise money for those with multiple sclerosis. The Cygnet Folk Festival is one of Australia&#x27;s most iconic folk music festivals and is held in Cygnet in the Huon Valley every year in January. The Tasmanian Lute Festival is an early music event held in different locations in Tasmania every two years. Recent additions to the state arts events calendar include the 10 Days on the Island arts festival, MONA FOMA, run by David Walsh and curated by Brian Ritchie and Dark Mofo also run by David Walsh and curated by Leigh Carmichael.

The Unconformity is a three-day festival held every two years in Queenstown on the West Coast. Each February in Evandale a penny-farthing championships are held.

===Perception within Australia===
Tasmania is perceived within Australia and internationally as an island with pristine wildlife, water and air. It is known for its ecotourism for these reasons, and is considered an idyllic location for Australians considering a &quot;tree-&quot; or &quot;sea-change&quot;, or are seeking retirement because of Tasmania&#x27;s temperate environment and friendly locals. In other parts of the world, Tasmania is considered as the opposite side of the planet to most places, and supposedly home to mythically exotic animals, such as the Tasmanian Devil as popularised by Warner Brothers.

====Stereotypes====
Tasmania has a reputation within Australia that is often at odds with the reality of the state or may have only been true during colonial times and has only persevered on the Australian mainland as a myth. Because of these stereotypes, Tasmania is often referred to as the primary target (i.e., &quot;butt&quot;) of mainland Australian jokes. In more recent times, references to insults against Tasmania are more sarcastic and jovial, but angst against the island still exists. The most commonly cited sarcastic comment is on the supposedly &#x27;two-headed&#x27; Tasmanians, which originated due to some colonists developing goitres from the low amount of iodine in the island&#x27;s soil. But as Tasmania receives higher volumes of inter-state tourists, the perceptions are in the process of changing.

The most prominent example of negative stereotype is of inbreeding due to the relatively small size of Tasmania compared to the rest of Australia (though Tasmania is nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland in area, and more populous than Iceland). This is untrue and if it had once been the case, it would have existed in the rest of colonial Australia as well, though Tasmania&#x27;s penal establishments were some of the harshest in the entire colony and home to infamous bushrangers. This is a part of the also-receding global stereotype that all Australians are or were derived from criminals, even as most convicts were transported for petty crimes. During this period of European settlement, Tasmania was the second centre of power (and a significant port of the British Empire) on the continent after New South Wales, before being surpassed in the latter half of the 19th century by Victoria and regions sustained by mining booms following the cessation of transportation in 1853.
A mentality developed in certain corners of Australia, and led to a general dislike of Tasmania amongst these people, even if the opinion-holder had never properly visited. It can rise to such an extent as to argue for the secession of Tasmania from the rest of Australia, in an effort to &#x27;recover&#x27; Australia&#x27;s reputation from Tasmania.

==Transport==

===Air===
Tasmania&#x27;s main air carriers are Jetstar and Virgin Australia; Qantas and QantasLink. These airlines fly direct routes to Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. Major airports include Hobart Airport and Launceston Airport; the smaller airports, Burnie (Wynyard) and King Island, serviced by Rex Airlines; and Devonport, serviced by QantasLink; have services to Melbourne. Intra-Tasmanian air services are offered by Par Avion. Until 2001 Ansett Australia operated majorly out of Tasmania to 12 destinations nationwide. Tourism-related air travel is also represented in Tasmania, such as in the Par Avion route between Cambridge Aerodrome near Hobart to Melaleuca in Southwest National Park.

===Antarctica base===
Tasmania – Hobart in particular – serves as Australia&#x27;s chief sea link to Antarctica, with the Australian Antarctic Division located in Kingston. Hobart is also the home port of the French ship &quot;l&#x27;Astrolabe&quot;, which makes regular supply runs to the French Southern Territories near and in Antarctica.

===Road===

Within the state, the primary form of transport is by road. Since the 1980s, many of the state&#x27;s highways have undergone regular upgrades. These include the Hobart Southern Outlet, Launceston Southern Outlet, Bass Highway reconstruction, and the Huon Highway. Public transport is provided by Metro Tasmania bus services, regular taxis and Hobart only UBER ride-share services within urban areas, with Redline Coaches, Tassielink Transit and Callows Coaches providing bus service between population centres.
===Rail===

Rail transport in Tasmania consists of narrow-gauge lines to all four major population centres and to mining and forestry operations on the west coast and in the northwest. Services are operated by TasRail. Regular passenger train services in the state ceased in 1977; the only scheduled trains are for freight, but there are tourist trains in specific areas, for example the West Coast Wilderness Railway. There is an ongoing proposal to reinstate commuter trains to Hobart. This idea however lacks political motivation.

===Shipping===

There is a substantial amount of commercial and recreational shipping within Hobart&#x27;s harbour, and the port hosts approximately 120 cruise ships during the warmer half of the year, and there are occasional visits from military vessels.

Burnie and Devonport on the northwest coast host ports and several other coastal towns host either small fishing ports or substantial marinas. The domestic sea route between Tasmania and the mainland is serviced by Bass Strait passenger/vehicle ferries operated by the Tasmanian government-owned Spirit of Tasmania. The state is also home to Incat, a manufacturer of very high-speed aluminium catamarans that regularly broke records when they were first launched.

<doc id="29945" wikidata="Q821090" url="?curid=29945" title="Names of God in Judaism">
<text>Judaism has different names given to God, which are considered sacred: (), (&quot;Adonai&quot; ), (&quot;El&quot; ), ( ), (&quot;Shaddai&quot; ), and ( ); some also include I Am that I Am. Early authorities considered other Hebrew names mere epithets or descriptions of God, and wrote that they and names in other languages may be written and erased freely. Some moderns advise special care even in these cases, and many Orthodox Jews have adopted the chumras of writing &quot;G-d&quot; instead of &quot;God&quot; in English or saying Ṭēt-Vav (,  &#x27;9-6&#x27;) instead of Yōd-Hē (, &#x27;10-5&#x27;, but also &#x27;Jah&#x27;) for the number fifteen or Ṭēt-Zayin (, &#x27;9-7&#x27;) instead of Yōd-Vav (, &#x27;10-6&#x27;) for the Hebrew number sixteen.

==Seven names of God==
The names of God that, once written, cannot be erased because of their holiness are the Tetragrammaton, Adonai, El, Elohim, Shaddai, Tzevaot; some also include I Am that I Am. In addition, the name &quot;Jah&quot;—because it forms part of the Tetragrammaton—is similarly protected. The tanna Jose ben Halafta considered &quot;Tzevaot&quot; a common name in the second century and Rabbi Ishmael considered &quot;Elohim&quot; to be one. All other names, such as &quot;Merciful&quot;, &quot;Gracious&quot; and &quot;Faithful&quot;, merely represent attributes that are also common to human beings.

===YHWH===


Also abbreviated &quot;Jah&quot;, the most common name of God in the Hebrew Bible is the Tetragrammaton, , which is usually transliterated as YHWH. The Hebrew script is an abjad, and thus vowels are often omitted in writing. YHWH is usually expanded to &quot;Yahweh&quot; in English.

Modern Rabbinical Jewish culture judges it forbidden to pronounce this name. In prayers it is replaced by the word (, , Pluralis majestatis taken as singular), and in discussion by &#x27;The Name&#x27;. Nothing in the Torah explicitly prohibits speaking the name and the Book of Ruth shows that it continued to be pronounced as late as the 5th century BCE. Mark Sameth argues that only a pseudo name was pronounced, the four letters (YHVH, YHWH) being a cryptogram which the priests of ancient Israel read in reverse as , &#x27;he–she&#x27;, signifying a dual-gendered deity, as earlier theorized by Guillaume Postel (16th century) and (19th century). It had ceased to be spoken aloud by at least the 3rd century BCE, during Second Temple Judaism. The Talmud relates, perhaps anecdotally, that this began with the death of Simeon the Just. Vowel points began to be added to the Hebrew text only in the early medieval period. The Masoretic Text adds to the Tetragrammaton the vowel points of Adonai or Elohim (depending on the context), indicating that these are the words to be pronounced in place of the Tetragrammaton (see Qere and Ketiv), as shown also by the pronunciation changes when combined with a preposition or a conjunction. This is in contrast to Karaite Jews, who traditionally viewed pronouncing the Tetragrammaton as a mitzvah because the name appears some 6800 times throughout the Tanakh; however, most modern Karaites, under pressure and seeking acceptance from mainstream Rabbinical Jews, now also use the term &quot;Adonai&quot; instead. The Beta Israel pronounce the Tetragrammaton as &quot;Yahu&quot;, but also use the Geʽez term .

The Tetragrammaton appears in Genesis and occurs 6,828 times in total in the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia edition of the Masoretic Text. It is thought to be an archaic third-person singular of the imperfective aspect of the verb &quot;to be&quot; (i.e., &quot;[He] is/was/will be&quot;). This agrees with the passage in Exodus where God names himself as &quot;I Will Be What I Will Be&quot; using the first-person singular imperfective aspect, open to interpretation as present tense (&quot;I am what I am&quot;), future (&quot;I shall be what I shall be&quot;), or imperfect (&quot;I used to be what I used to be&quot;).

Rabbinic Judaism teaches that the name is forbidden to all except the High Priest of Israel, who should only speak it in the Holy of Holies of the Temple in Jerusalem on Yom Kippur. He then pronounces the name &quot;just as it is written.&quot; As each blessing was made, the people in the courtyard were to prostrate themselves completely as they heard it spoken aloud. As the Temple has not been rebuilt since its destruction in 70 CE, most modern Jews never pronounce YHWH but instead read (, , , Pluralis majestatis taken as singular) during prayer and while reading the Torah and as HaShem &#x27;The Name&#x27; at other times. Similarly, the Vulgate used (&#x27;The Lord&#x27;) and most English translations of the Bible write &quot;the &quot; for YHWH and &quot;the God&quot;, &quot;the Lord &quot; or &quot;the Sovereign &quot; for Adonai YHWH instead of transcribing the name. The Septuagint may have originally used the Hebrew letters themselves amid its Greek text, but there is no scholarly consensus on this point. All surviving Christian-era manuscripts use ( &#x27;Lord&#x27;) or very occasionally ( &#x27;God&#x27;) to translate the many thousand occurrences of the Name.

=== Adonai ===
 (, , taken as singular) is the possessive form of (&#x27;Lord&#x27;), along with the first-person singular pronoun enclitic. As with , Adonai&#x27;s grammatical form is usually explained as a plural of majesty. In the Hebrew Bible, the word is nearly always used to refer to God (approximately 450 occurrences). As pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided in the Hellenistic period, Jews may have begun to drop the Tetragrammaton when presented alongside Adonai and subsequently to expand it to cover for the Tetragrammaton in the forms of spoken prayer and written scripture. Owing to the expansion of (the idea of &quot;building a fence around the Torah&quot;), the word itself has come to be too holy to say for Orthodox Jews outside of prayer, leading to its replacement by (&#x27;The Name&#x27;).

The singular forms and (&#x27;my lord&#x27;) are used in the Hebrew Bible as royal titles, as in the First Book of Samuel, and for distinguished persons. The Phoenicians used it as a title of Tammuz (the origin of the Greek Adonis). It is also used very occasionally in Hebrew texts to refer to God (e.g. Psalm 136:3.) Deuteronomy 10:17 has the proper name alongside the superlative constructions &quot;God of gods&quot; (, literally, &quot;the gods of gods&quot;) and &quot;Lord of lords&quot; (, &quot;the lords of lords&quot;: ; KJV: &quot;For the your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords&quot;).

The final syllable of Adonai uses the vowel , rather than which would be expected from the Hebrew for &#x27;my lord(s)&#x27;. Professor Yoel Elitzur explains this as a normal transformation when a Hebrew word becomes a name, giving as other examples Nathan, Yitzchak, and Yigal. As became the most common reverent substitute for the Tetragrammaton, it too became considered un-erasable due to its holiness. As such, most prayer books avoid spelling out the word , and instead write two () in its place.

The forms , , and 
represent Ashkenazi Hebrew variant pronunciations of the word .

===El===

El appears in Ugaritic, Phoenician and other 2nd and 1st millennium BCE texts both as generic &quot;god&quot; and as the head of the divine pantheon. In the Hebrew Bible, El (, ) appears very occasionally alone (e.g. Genesis 33:20, , &#x27;Mighty God of Israel&#x27;, and Genesis 46:3, , &#x27;El the God of thy father&#x27;), but usually with some epithet or attribute attached (e.g. , &#x27;Most High El&#x27;, , &#x27;El of &#x27;, &#x27;Everlasting El&#x27;, , &#x27;Living El&#x27;, &#x27;El my Shepherd&#x27;, and &#x27;El of Strength&#x27;), in which cases it can be understood as the generic &quot;god&quot;. In theophoric names such as Gabriel (&quot;Strength of God&quot;), Michael (&quot;Who is like God?&quot;), Raphael (&quot;God healed&quot;), Ariel (&quot;My lion is God&quot;), Daniel (&quot;My judgment is God&quot;), Ezekiel (&quot;God shall strengthen&quot;), Israel (&quot;one who has struggled with God&quot;), Immanuel (&quot;God is with us&quot;), and Ishmael (&quot;God hears/ will hear / listens/ will listen&quot;) it is usually interpreted and translated as &quot;God&quot;, but it is not clear whether these &quot;el&quot;s refer to the deity in general or to the god El in particular.

El also appears in the form ().

===Elohim===

A common name of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (, ), the plural of (). When Elohim refers to God in the Hebrew Bible, singular verbs are used. The word is identical to meaning gods and is cognate to the found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El and conventionally vocalized as &quot;Elohim&quot; although the original Ugaritic vowels are unknown. When the Hebrew Bible uses not in reference to God, it is plural (for example, Exodus 20:2). There are a few other such uses in Hebrew, for example &quot;Behemoth&quot;. In Modern Hebrew, the singular word (&#x27;owner&#x27;) looks plural, but likewise takes a singular verb.

A number of scholars have traced the etymology to the Semitic root , &#x27;to be first, powerful&#x27;, despite some difficulties with this view. is thus the plural construct &#x27;powers&#x27;. Hebrew grammar allows for this form to mean &quot;He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)&quot;, just as the word means &#x27;owner&#x27; (see above). &quot;He is lord (singular) even over any of those things that he owns that are lordly (plural)&quot;.

Theologians who dispute this claim cite the hypothesis that plurals of majesty came about in more modern times. Richard Toporoski, a classics scholar, asserts that plurals of majesty first appeared in the reign of Diocletian (CE 284–305). Indeed, Gesenius states in his book &quot;Hebrew Grammar&quot; the following:

The Jewish grammarians call such plurals ... or ; later grammarians call them , , or .

This last name may have been suggested by the &quot;we&quot; used by kings when speaking of themselves (compare 1 Maccabees 10:19 and 11:31); and the plural used by God in Genesis 1:26 and 11:7; Isaiah 6:8 has been incorrectly explained in this way. It is, however, either &quot;communicative&quot; (including the attendant angels: so at all events in Isaiah 6:8 and Genesis 3:22), or according to others, an indication of &quot;the fullness of power and might&quot; implied. It is best explained as a plural of &quot;self-deliberation&quot;. The use of the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to Hebrew.

Mark S. Smith has cited the use of plural as possible evidence to suggest an evolution in the formation of early Jewish conceptions of monotheism, wherein references to &quot;the gods&quot; (plural) in earlier accounts of verbal tradition became either interpreted as multiple aspects of a single monotheistic God at the time of writing, or subsumed under a form of monolatry, wherein the god(s) of a certain city would be accepted after the fact as a reference to the God of Israel and the plural deliberately dropped.

The plural form ending in can also be understood as denoting abstraction, as in the Hebrew words (, &#x27;life&#x27;) or (, &#x27;virginity&#x27;). If understood this way, means &#x27;divinity&#x27; or &#x27;deity&#x27;. The word is similarly syntactically singular when used as a name but syntactically plural otherwise. In many of the passages in which occurs in the Bible, it refers to non-Israelite deities, or in some instances to powerful men or judges, and even angels (Exodus 21:6, Psalms 8:5) as a simple plural in those instances.

===Shaddai===

 (, , ) is one of the names of God in Judaism, with its etymology coming from the influence of the Ugaritic religion on modern Judaism. is conventionally translated as &quot;God Almighty&quot;. While the translation of as &#x27;god&#x27; in Ugaritic/Canaanite languages is straightforward, the literal meaning of is the subject of debate.

===Tzevaot===

Tzevaot, Tzevaoth, Tsebaoth or Sabaoth (, , ,  &quot;Armies&quot;), usually translated &quot;Hosts&quot;, appears in reference to armies or armed hosts of men but is not used as a divine epithet in the Torah, Joshua, or Judges. Starting in the Books of Samuel, the term &quot;Lord of Hosts&quot; appears hundreds of times throughout the Prophetic books, in Psalms, and in Chronicles.

The Hebrew word was also absorbed in Ancient Greek (, ) and Latin (, with no declension). Tertullian and other Fathers of the Church used it with the meaning of &quot;Army of angels of God&quot;.

=== Ehyeh===

 () is the first of three responses given to Moses when he asks for God&#x27;s name in the Book of Exodus. The King James Version of the Bible translates the Hebrew as &quot;I Am that I Am&quot; and uses it as a proper name for God.
The word is the first-person singular imperfect form of , &#x27;to be&#x27;. Biblical Hebrew does not distinguish between grammatical tenses. It has instead an aspectual system in which the imperfect denotes any actions that are not yet completed, Accordingly, can be rendered in English not only as &quot;I am that I am&quot; but also as &quot;I will be what I will be&quot; or &quot;I will be who I will be&quot;, or &quot;I shall prove to be whatsoever I shall prove to be&quot; or even &quot;I will be because I will be&quot;. Other renderings include: Leeser, &quot;I Will Be that I Will Be&quot;; Rotherham, &quot;I Will Become whatsoever I please&quot;, Greek, (), &quot;I am Being/the Existing One&quot; in the Septuagint, and Philo, and Revelation; Latin, , &quot;I am Who I am.&quot;

The word is a relative pronoun whose meaning depends on the immediate context, so that &quot;that&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, or &quot;where&quot; are all possible translations of that word.

==Other names and titles==

===Baal===

 meant &#x27;owner&#x27; and, by extension, &#x27;lord&#x27;, &#x27;master&#x27;, and &#x27;husband&#x27; in Hebrew and the other Northwest Semitic languages. In some early contexts and theophoric names, it and (; &quot;My Lord&quot;) were treated as synonyms of Adon and Adonai. After the time of Solomon and particularly after Jezebel&#x27;s attempt to promote the worship of the Lord of Tyre Melqart, however, the name became particularly associated with the Canaanite storm god Baʿal Haddu and was gradually avoided as a title for Yahweh. Several names that included it were rewritten as (&quot;shame&quot;). The prophet Hosea in particular reproached the Israelites for continuing to use the term:
===Elah===
 (, pl. or ; ) is the Aramaic word for God and the absolute singular form of , . The origin of the word is from Proto-Semitic and is thus cognate to the Hebrew, Arabic, Akkadian, and other Semitic languages&#x27; words for god. is found in the Tanakh in the books of Ezra, Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11, the only verse in the entire book written in Aramaic), and Daniel. is used to describe both pagan gods and the Abrahamic God.

* , God of Israel (Ezra 5:1)
* , God of Jerusalem (Ezra 7:19)
* , God of Heaven (Ezra 7:23)
* , God of my fathers, (Daniel 2:23)
* , God of gods (Daniel 2:47)

===El Roi===

In the Book of Genesis, Hagar uses this name for the God who spoke to her through his angel. In Hebrew, her phrase , literally, &#x27;God of Seeing Me&#x27;, is translated in the King James Version as &quot;Thou God seest me.&quot;

===Elyon===
The name () occurs in combination with , , and alone. It appears chiefly in poetic and later Biblical passages. The modern Hebrew adjective means &#x27;supreme&#x27; (as in &quot;Supreme Court&quot;: ) or &#x27;Most High&#x27;. has been traditionally translated into English as &#x27;God Most High&#x27;. The Phoenicians used what appears to be a similar name for God, one that the Greeks wrote as .

===Eternal One===
&quot;The Eternal One&quot; or &quot;The Eternal&quot; is increasingly used, particularly in Reform and Reconstructionist communities seeking to use gender-neutral language. In the Torah, (&quot;the Everlasting God&quot;) is used at Genesis 21:33 to refer to God.

===HaShem===

It is common Jewish practice to restrict the use of the names of God to a liturgical context. In casual conversation some Jews, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God HaShem (), which is Hebrew for &#x27;the Name&#x27; (compare Leviticus 24:11 and Deuteronomy 28:58). When written, it is often abbreviated to . Likewise, when quoting from the Tanakh or prayers, some pious Jews will replace with . For example, when making audio recordings of prayer services, will generally be substituted for .

A popular expression containing this phrase is , meaning &quot;Thank God&quot; (literally, &#x27;Blessed be the Name&#x27;).

Samaritans use the Aramaic equivalent (, &#x27;the name&#x27;) in much the same situations as Jews use .

===Shalom===

Talmudic authors, ruling on the basis of Gideon&#x27;s name for an altar (, according to Judges 6:24), write that &quot;the name of God is &#x27;Peace (, Shabbat 10b); consequently, a Talmudic opinion (, 10b) asserts that one would greet another with the word in order for the word not to be forgotten in the exile. But one is not permitted to greet another with the word in unholy places such as a bathroom, because of the holiness of the name.

===Shekhinah===

 () is the presence or manifestation of God which has descended to &quot;dwell&quot; among humanity. The term never appears in the Hebrew Bible; later rabbis used the word when speaking of God dwelling either in the Tabernacle or amongst the people of Israel. The root of the word means &quot;dwelling&quot;. Of the principal names of God, it is the only one that is of the feminine gender in Hebrew grammar. Some believe that this was the name of a female counterpart of God, but this is unlikely as the name is always mentioned in conjunction with an article (e.g.: &quot;the Shekhina descended and dwelt among them&quot; or &quot;He removed Himself and His Shekhina from their midst&quot;). This kind of usage does not occur in Semitic languages in conjunction with proper names. The term, however, may not be a name, as it may merely describe the presence of God, and not God Himself.

==Writing divine names==

In Jewish tradition the sacredness of the divine name or titles must be recognized by the professional (scribe) who writes Torah scrolls, or and . Before transcribing any of the divine titles or name, they prepare mentally to sanctify them. Once they begin a name, they do not stop until it is finished, and they must not be interrupted while writing it, even to greet a king. If an error is made in writing it may not be erased, but a line must be drawn round it to show that it is canceled, and the whole page must be put in a (burial place for scripture) and a new page begun.

==Kabbalistic use==

One of the most important names is that of the ( &#x27;Endless&#x27;), which first came into use after 1300 CE. 
Another name is derived from the names . By spelling these four names out with the names of the Hebrew letters ( and ) this new forty-five letter long name is produced. Spelling the letters in (YHWH) by itself gives . Each letter in Hebrew is given a value, according to gematria, and the value of is also 45.

The 72-fold name is derived from three verses in Exodus 14:19–21. Each of the verses contains 72 letters. When the verses are read boustrophedonically 72 names, three letters each, are produced (the of the source verses is disregarded in respect to pronunciation). Some regard this name as the Shem HaMephorash. The Proto-Kabbalistic book describes how the creation of the world was achieved by manipulation of these 216 sacred letters that form the names of God.

==Erasing the name of God==
From this it is understood by the rabbis that one should not erase or blot out the name of God. The general halachic opinion is that this only applies to the sacred Hebrew names of God, not to other euphemistic references; there is a dispute as to whether the word &quot;God&quot; in English or other languages may be erased or whether Jewish law and/or Jewish custom forbids doing so, directly or as a precautionary &quot;fence&quot; about the law.

The words &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Lord&quot; are written by some Jews as &quot;G-d&quot; and &quot;L-rd&quot; as a way of avoiding writing any name of God out in full. The hyphenated version of the English name (&quot;G-d&quot;) can be destroyed, so by writing that form, religious Jews prevent documents in their possession with the unhyphenated form from being destroyed later. Alternatively, a euphemistic reference such as (literally, &#x27;the Name&#x27;) may be substituted, or an abbreviation thereof, such as in ( &#x27;with the help of the Name&#x27;).

<text>A trick-taking game is a card- or tile-based game in which play of a &quot;hand&quot; centers on a series of finite rounds or units of play, called &quot;tricks&quot;, which are each evaluated to determine a winner or &quot;taker&quot; of that trick. The object of such games then may be closely tied to the number of tricks taken, as in plain-trick games such as contract bridge, whist, and spades, or to the value of the cards contained in taken tricks, as in point-trick games such as pinochle, the tarot family, briscola, and most evasion games like hearts. 

Trick-and-draw games are trick-taking games in which the players can fill up their hands after each trick. In most variants, players are free to play any card into a trick in the first phase of the game, but must &quot;follow suit&quot; as soon as the stock is depleted. Trick-avoidance games like reversis or polignac are those in which the aim is to avoid taking some or all tricks.

The domino game Texas 42 is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game.

==History==
The earliest card games were trick-taking games, as evidenced by the rank-and-suit structure, originating from China and spreading westwards during the early part of the second millennium. Michael Dummett noted that these games share various features. They were played without trumps, following suit was not required but only the highest card of the suit led wins, rotation was counter-clockwise, they were plain-trick games, and the pip cards of one or more suits were in reverse order so that the lower cards beat the higher ones. 

Two revolutions in European trick-taking games led to the development of ever more sophisticated card games: the invention of trumps, and the requirement of following suit to constrain their power, in the 15th century; and bidding in the 17th century.

According to card game researcher David Parlett, the oldest known European trick-taking game, Karnöffel, was mentioned in 1426 in the Bavarian town Nördlingen – roughly half a century after the introduction of playing cards to Europe, which were first mentioned in Spain in 1371. The oldest known game in which certain cards have additional privileges is Karnöffel, where specific ranks of one suit were named &quot;Karnöffel, Devil, Pope&quot; etc. and subject to an elaborate system of variable powers. However, these were not trumps in the sense of a suit whose cards uniformly beat all other suit cards. 

Around 1440 in Italy, special cards called &quot;trionfi&quot; were introduced with such a function. These special cards are now known as &quot;tarots&quot;, and a deck augmented by tarots as a tarot deck. The trionfi/tarots formed essentially a fifth suit without the ordinary ranks but consisting of trumps in a fixed hierarchy. One can get a similar effect by declaring all cards of a fixed or randomly determined suit to be trumps. This method, originating with triomphe, is still followed by a number of modern trick-taking games that do not involve an auction. 

Trumps were retroactively added to some games, such as trappola. It is much rarer for trumps to be removed. The invention of trumps became so popular that very few European trick-taking games exist without them. This did not stop the two-handed piquet from becoming the most popular card game in Europe during the 16th century. Parlett suggests the invention of trumps let players in games involving more than two a greater chance of heading a trick.
The invention of bidding for a trump suit is credited to ombre, the most popular card game of the 17th century. Rather than having a randomly selected trump suit, players can now hold an auction for it. The most popular game of the 18th-century was tarot which experienced a great revival. During this time, many tarot games were borrowed bidding over the stock (taroc l&#x27;hombre). In the 20th century, whist, now with bidding and the dummy hand, developed into contract bridge, the last global trick-taking game.

The practice of counting tricks, in plain-trick games, may have originated in the counting of cards won in tricks. It was therefore a logical development to accord some cards a higher counting-value, and some cards no value at all, leading to point-trick games. Point-trick games are at least as old as tarot decks and may even predate the invention of trumps. Elfern and Fünfzehnern are possible candidates, although the earliest references date to the 18th century. Nearly all point-trick games are played with tarot decks or stripped decks, which in many countries became standard before 1600. Neither point-trick games nor stripped decks have a tradition in England.

While there are a number of games with unusual card-point values, such as trappola and all fours, most point-trick games are in the huge family of ace–ten card games beginning with brusquembille. Pinochle is a representative of this family that is popular in the United States. Other examples include belote and skat.

In contrast to Europe, Chinese trick-taking games did not develop trumps or bidding. They diverged into multi-trick games where melds can only be beaten by other melds provided they have the same number of cards. During the Qing dynasty, these multi-trick games evolved into the earliest draw-and-discard games where the players&#x27; objective was to form melds and &quot;go out&quot; rather than capture the opponents&#x27; cards. Khanhoo is an example of a multi-trick game that became a draw-and-discard game. Multi-trick games are also probably the source for climbing games like &quot;Zheng Shangyou&quot; and &quot;dou dizhu&quot;, which first appeared during the Cultural Revolution.

==Basic structure==
Certain actions in trick-taking games with three or more players always proceed in the same direction. In games originating in North and West Europe, including England, Russia, and the United States and Canada, the rotation is typically clockwise, i.e., play proceeds to the left. In South and East Europe, South America, and Asia it is typically anticlockwise, so that play proceeds to the right. When games move from one region to another, they tend to initially preserve their original sense of rotation. A region with a dominant sense of rotation may adapt a migrated game to its own sensibilities. For two-player games the order of play is moot.

In each &quot;hand&quot; or &quot;deal,&quot; one player is the &quot;dealer.&quot; This function moves from deal to deal in the normal direction of play. The dealer usually shuffles the deck (some games use &quot;soft shuffling,&quot; where the dealer does not explicitly shuffle the deck), and after giving the player one seat from the dealer opposite the normal direction of play an opportunity to cut, hands out the same prescribed number of cards to each player, usually in an order following the normal direction of play. 

Most games deal cards one at a time in rotation. A few games require dealing multiple cards at one time in a &quot;packet.&quot; The cards apportioned to each player are collectively known as that player&#x27;s &quot;hand&quot; and are only known to the player. Some games involve a set of cards that are not dealt to a player&#x27;s hand. These cards form the &quot;stock.&quot; (see below) It is generally good manners to leave one&#x27;s cards on the table until the deal is complete.

The player sitting one seat after the declarer (one with the highest bid and not the dealer) in normal rotation is known as the &quot;eldest hand,&quot; also called the &quot;forehand&quot; in Skat and other games of German origin. The eldest hand &quot;leads&quot; to the first &quot;trick,&quot; i.e. places the first card of the trick face up in the middle of all players. The other players each follow with a single card, in the direction of play. When every player has played a card to the trick, the trick is evaluated to determine the winner, who takes the cards, places them face down on a pile, and leads to the next trick. The winner or taker of a trick is usually the player who played the highest-value card of the suit that was led, unless the game uses one or more &quot;trump&quot; cards (see below).

The player who leads to a trick is usually allowed to play an arbitrary card from their hand. Some games have restrictions on the first card played in the hand, or may disallow leading a card of a particular suit until that suit has been played &quot;off-suit&quot; in a prior trick, called &quot;breaking&quot; the suit, usually seen in cases of a trump or penalty suit. Other games have special restrictions on the card that must be led to the first trick. Usually this is a specific card, e.g., 2. The holder of that card is the eldest hand instead of the person one seat after the dealer.

In many games, the following players must &quot;follow suit&quot; if they can, i.e., they must play a card of the same suit if possible. A player who cannot follow suit may &quot;slough&quot; a card, i.e., play a card of a different suit. A trick is won by the player who has played the highest-ranked card of the &quot;suit led,&quot; i.e., of the suit of the first card in the trick, unless the game uses a trump suit.

It can be an advantage to lead to a trick, because the player who leads controls the suit that is led and which others must follow. The leading player playing a suit of which he has many, decreases the chance that anyone else would be able to follow suit. Playing a suit of which he has few, allows him to rid his hand of that suit, known as &quot;voiding&quot; the suit, freeing him from the restriction to follow suit when that suit is led by another player. 

On the other hand, it can be advantageous to be the final player who plays to the trick, because at that point one has full information about the other cards played to the trick. The last player to a trick can play a card just slightly higher or lower than the current winning card, guaranteeing they will win or lose it by the minimum amount necessary, saving more valuable high or low value cards for situations where they must guarantee that a card played early to a trick will win or lose.

When all cards have been played, the number or contents of the tricks won by each player is tallied and used to update the score. Scoring based on the play of tricks varies widely between games. In most games either the number of tricks a player or partnership has won (&quot;plain-trick&quot; games), or the value of certain cards that the player has won by taking tricks (&quot;point-trick&quot; games) is important.

== Partnerships ==
In many games such as hearts and oh hell, all players play individually against each other.

In many four-player games such as bridge, euchre and spades, the players sitting opposite to each other form a fixed partnership.

Some games such as pinochle are commonly played with or without partnerships, depending on the number of players.

In some contract/auction games for three or more players, e.g. most tarot variants, the contractor (&quot;declarer&quot; or &quot;taker&quot;) plays alone against all opponents, who form an &quot;ad hoc&quot; partnership (the &quot;defenders&quot;).

In some games the partnerships are decided by chance – the contractor forms a partnership with the winner of the first trick, or with the player who holds a certain card. This practice originated from cinquillo and quadrille. In Königrufen and five-player French tarot the taker can call out a suit of which he does not possess the king, and is partnered with whomever does have it against the other three. Standard Schafkopf is similar: A &quot;player&quot; can &quot;call&quot; a suit, and the person holding the ace of that suit becomes his partner for the hand. 

As this is not openly declared, it can be a challenge for the remaining players, to find out who is partnered with whom through cunning playing for several tricks. Aside from that, standard Schafkopf also has several solo options, where the &quot;player&quot; plays alone against the rest. In Doppelkopf, the two players holding the black queens are partners for that hand. Special rules are provided for the case where a single player holds both black queens.

==Stock==
In some games not all cards are distributed to the players, and a &quot;stock&quot; remains. This stock can be referred to by different names, depending on the game; &quot;supply&quot;, &quot;talon&quot;, &quot;nest&quot;, &quot;skat&quot;, &quot;kitty&quot;, and &quot;dog&quot; are common game-specific and/or regional names.

In some games the stock remains untouched throughout play of the hand. It is simply a pile of &quot;extra&quot; cards that will never be played and whose values are unknown, which will reduce the effectiveness of &quot;counting cards&quot;, a common strategy of keeping track of the cards that have been played or are yet to be played. In games without bidding, trumps may be decided by exposing a card in the stock as in Triomphe. 

In other games, the winner of an auction-bidding process, the taker or declarer, may get to exchange cards from his hand with the stock, either by integrating the stock into his hand and then discarding equal cards as in Skat, Rook and French tarot, or in a &quot;blind&quot; fashion by discarding and drawing as in Ombre. The stock, either in its original or discarded form, may additionally form part of one or more players&#x27; &quot;scoring piles&quot; of tricks taken; it may be kept by the declarer, may be won by the player of the first trick, or may go to an opposing player or partnership.

In some games, especially two-player games, after each trick every player draws a new card. This continues while the stock lasts. Since this drawing mechanism would normally make it difficult or impossible to detect a revoke (for instance, the player may not be able to follow suit, so they play off-suit and then immediately draw a card of the suit led), in the first phase of trick-play (before the stock is empty) players generally need not follow suit. A widespread game of this type is the Marriage group.

== Bidding ==

In a &quot;contract&quot; game the winning and scoring conditions are not fixed but are chosen by one of the players after seeing their hand. In such games, players make &quot;bids&quot; depending on the number of tricks or card points they believe they can win during play of the hand. One or more of these bids stands as the &quot;contract&quot;, and the player who made that bid is rewarded for meeting it or penalized for not meeting it.

In &quot;auction&quot; games, bidding players are competing against each other for the right to attempt to make the contract. In a few games, the contract is fixed, normally a simple majority, less often based on certain cards captured during play, and players&#x27; bids are a wager of game points to be won or lost. In others, the bid is a number of tricks or card points the bidder is confident that they or their partnership will take. Either of these can also include the suit to be used as trumps during the hand. 

Common bids include slam (winning all the tricks), misère (losing all the tricks), ouvert (the contractor&#x27;s hand is exposed), playing without using the stock or only part of it, and winning the last trick or other specific tricks. The highest bid becomes the contract and the highest bidder is the &quot;contractor&quot;, known in some games as the &quot;declarer&quot; or &quot;taker&quot;, who then plays either with or without a partner. The other players become &quot;opponents&quot; or &quot;defenders&quot;, whose main goal is to prevent the contract being met. They may announce a &quot;contra&quot; against the contractor which doubles the points for the hand. The contractor can declare a &quot;recontra&quot; which will double the points again.

Popular examples of games with auctions include Contract bridge, Pinochle, tarot games, Skat, Belote and Twenty-Eight. In many auction games the eldest hand leads to the first trick, regardless of who won the auction, but in some, such as Contract Bridge, the first lead is made by the player next in rotation after the contractor, so that the contractor plays last to that trick.

In &quot;precision&quot; or &quot;exact-prediction&quot; games, all players choose their winning condition independently: to win precisely a predicted number of tricks (oh hell) or card points (Differenzler). Each player&#x27;s bid stands. In partnership games the partners&#x27; bids are often combined. Each player or partnership then tries to take exactly the number of tricks or points they bid, and are rewarded or penalized for doing so independently of anyone else&#x27;s success or failure in meeting their bid. This type of game began to mature in the 20th century. Other games generally falling into the exact-prediction category are Spades and Ninety-Nine.

==Trumps==

&quot;Trump cards&quot; are a set of one or more cards in the deck that, when played, are of higher value than the suit led. If a trick contains any trump cards, it is won by the highest-value trump card played, not the highest-value card of the suit led.

In most games with trumps, one of the four suits is identified as the &quot;trump suit&quot;. In the simplest case, there is a static trump suit such as the Spade suit in the game Spades, or a dedicated trump suit in the Tarot family, in addition to the other four, is featured. More often, a dynamic trump suit is determined by some means, either randomly by selection of a card as in oh hell and the original form of Whist, or decided by the winner or winning bid of an auction as in contract bridge and some forms of Pinochle. 

In certain games, such as Rowboat and Rage, the trump suit may change during the course of the hand, even from trick to trick. Some psychological variety is added to the game and makes it more difficult to cheat if the trump suit is only chosen after dealing.

In some games, in addition to or separately from a trump suit, certain fixed cards are always the highest trumps, e.g. the Jacks in Skat, the Jacks or Jokers in Euchre, and the Rook Bird card in Rook. They are called &quot;matadors&quot; after the high trumps in Ombre. &quot;Matadors&quot; either have high point values or special abilities as in Spoil Five where they can revoke legally.

Some games have more than one trump suit, such as the quasi-trick game Stortok, in which there are two trumps, with one superseding the other. Other games have no trumps. Hearts for instance has no provision for a trump suit of any kind. The Hearts suit for which the game is named has a different significance. Though trump is part of contract bridge, teams can make bids that do not specify a trump suit, called notrump. If that is the winning bid, then there is no trump suit for that hand. Making such a contract is regarded as harder to accomplish.

In most cases for &quot;no trump&quot; deals, any card other than the leading suit played has no value. In some games such as Oh, hell, where the player may need to not get more tricks to win, playing cards other than the leading suit can be useful.

==Declarations==

In some games such as Piquet, Tarocchini, and Belote, before the taking of tricks commences, players can expose certain cards or melds (combinations) that they possess for bonus points. While this phase may seem to award players for pure chance, those who do declare risk letting their opponents develop strategies to counter the cards that they have revealed.

==Follow suit==
In many games, &quot;following suit&quot; is the action of playing a card of the same suit as that of the leading suit. A player must follow suit if that player has cards of the leading suit in his hands. There is a large variation of strictness in following suit among games.

In most modern games with trump suits, the rules for following suit do not distinguish between the trump suit and the &quot;plain suits&quot;. If a trick begins with a plain suit card and a later player cannot follow suit, the player may choose freely to either &quot;slough&quot; (discard a card of another plain suit), or &quot;ruff&quot; (&quot;trump&quot; the trick by playing a trump card). Subsequent players to the trick must still follow the original suit, and may only discard or trump if they do not hold a card of the suit led. 

Certain games are &quot;play to beat&quot; or &quot;must-trump&quot;. If a player cannot follow suit but can play trump, they must play trump. If they are able, they must beat any trump card already played to the trick. Pinochle and several of the Tarot card games have this rule.

Some games, notably French tarot and a variation of Rook, use a special card (in French Tarot&#x27;s case, the Excuse) that can be played at any time. If not, he has the choice of playing a trump to possibly win the trick, or rough (waste) a different suit.

If unable to follow suit or trump, any card can be played. Each trick must contain one card per player, and hence a player unable to satisfy any other instruction is at liberty to play any card. Usually a low-ranking card or one from a short suit is sacrificed. The former is used to protect a higher ranking card while the latter is to help void a suit so as to allow trumping a future trick.

For example, consider the following Whist hand, in a game where diamonds are the trump:
* North holds: 
* East holds: 
* South holds: 
* West holds: 

North leads the deal with . Now, all the other players must follow suit, i.e. play a spade card. East has a spade card, and thus must follow suit by playing . South, however, does not have any spade card, and thus is allowed to play any card he wants. If he desires to win the trick, he can override North&#x27;s by playing a diamond card (diamond being the trump), for example . If he does not want to win the trick, he can slough any other suit, such as . Let us assume that he plays , overriding North&#x27;s card. Now, West still has to follow suit, since he has a spade card, and plays . South&#x27;s trump card, gives him an opportunity to escape following suit, and he wins the trick.

If a player who can follow suit does not do so, or in games with additional restrictions on card play, not following these restrictions is known as a revoke, or &#x27;renege&#x27;. A revoke typically cannot be discovered at the time when it is committed, but when a player plays off-suit to a trick, competent opponents will make a mental note that the player does not hold the suit led, and will notice later if the player later plays a card of the suit they were thought to be void in. The situation is similar for other types of revoke. 

Most game rules prescribe a severe penalty for a revoke and may also result in the hand being voided, a &quot;misdeal&quot;. Decks of cards have been marketed for trick-taking games with the traditional French suit symbols, but in four colors. These are often called &quot;no-revoke&quot; decks, as the color contrast between each suit makes a potential revoking play easier to spot and harder to do accidentally.

In some trick games—typically ones in which players are not penalized for winning tricks, and there is no requirement for trumping or following suit when possible—players may &quot;slough&quot;, or play a card face down. A card so played is incapable of winning the trick; but sloughing has the advantage that the other players cannot see what card is played. As this form of sloughing has the potential to be used to cheat in most games (i.e. playing a winning card face-down to avoid taking an &quot;overtrick&quot; or a trick containing penalty points) and is thus not allowed. &quot;Sloughing&quot; in the vernacular more often refers to simply discarding an off-suit card on a trick, particularly one that could be dangerous to that player if kept. 

This form of sloughing is important in evasion games and in some contract games where &quot;overtricks&quot; are penalized. In oh hell, for instance, a player who cannot follow suit may elect to discard a card that would win if played to follow suit later, thus reducing the chance that the player will &quot;bag&quot;, or take more tricks than needed. This is common in Hearts, where high-value cards are dangerous, especially Spades and Hearts, as they increase the chance of winning a trick with penalty points.

Some games such as Pinochle use several decks shuffled together. In these games, there may be several equal winning cards in a trick; such games then use other rules to break ties. Common rules include:
* the first-played of the tying cards wins
* the last-played of the tying cards wins
* The tying cards cancel each other out, and the trick is taken by the next-highest card that was played.
* The tying cards cancel each other out, but the trick is spoiled (ignored).

A common additional rule to reduce these occurrences is that a player cannot play a card tying the current high card unless they would renege or fail to overtrump by making any other play.

==Scoring==
When all tricks have been played, the winner of the hand and the players&#x27; scores can be determined. The determining factor in plain-trick games, the most popular form of trick-taking games in English-speaking countries, is simply how many tricks each player or partnership has taken. In point-trick games, certain card values are worth varying points. The players sum the points from cards in their &quot;scoring piles&quot; that were accumulated by taking tricks. 

Points for cards, and the method of counting points, vary by game. In Rook, for example, the 5-card of each color is worth 5 points, the 10 and 14 (or Ace) is worth 10, and the Rook Bird (or Joker) is worth 20, while all other cards are worth nothing. Many Chinese card games like Finding Friends use a very similar system, in which each 5-card is worth 5 points, and the 10 and King are each worth 10 points. 

Pinochle has many popular scoring variants usually based on point values for face cards and Aces, while pip cards score no points. In French tarot, all cards have a value including a half-point, and are traditionally scored in pairs of a high-value and a low-value card which results in a whole-point value for the pair.

In the most common &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;race&quot; games, players seek to win as many tricks or card points as possible. To win a hand, a player typically needs to win a minimal number of tricks or card points; this minimal threshold is usually called the &quot;contract&quot;, and may be defined by the game&#x27;s rules (a simple majority of total available points or tricks, or tiered thresholds depending on which player or side has captured certain cards), or the result of an &quot;auction&quot; or &quot;bidding&quot; process. A player who wins more than the number of tricks or card points necessary for winning the hand may be rewarded with a higher score, or conversely (in exact-prediction games) they may be penalized.

There are also &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;evasion&quot; games, in which the object is to avoid tricks or card points. E.g. in Hearts each card point won in a trick contributes negatively to the score. A special type is &quot;misère&quot; games, which are usually variants of positive games which can only be won by not winning a single trick.

Other criteria also occur. Sometimes the last trick has special significance. In &quot;marriage games&quot; such as Pinochle the winner of the last trick receives 10 points in addition to the card points, while in &quot;final-trick&quot; games such as cắt tê only the winner of the last trick can win a hand. There are also blends between positive and negative games, e.g. the aim may be to win a certain prescribed number of tricks. Many card games, regardless of their normal scoring mechanism, give bonuses to players or partnerships who win all tricks or possible points in a hand, or conversely lose all tricks or points.

Games usually end after every player has had an equal chance to be the dealer. The number of rotations varies widely among games. Some games have a cumulative score where all points from each hand add up. Others assign only a set number of game points for winning a hand. For example, a player or side that wins one hand may be awarded one game point, two if they achieve a slam. The player or side with the most game points or the first to reach a certain number of card or game points, is considered the winner.

==Special variations==
=== Variations to basic rules ===
Numerous further variations to the basic rules may occur, and only a few examples can be mentioned here:
* Certain games require the holder of a certain card value to play it as the lead to the first trick of a hand; Hearts, as commonly played in North America, requires the player holding the 2 to play it as the lead-off card. Variants of Pinochle sometimes require the first player to the left of the dealer that holds a &quot;dix&quot; (9) to lead off.
* There may be restrictions on leading certain suits; a common Hearts rule is that a player may not lead a Heart until at least one trick has had a Heart played off-suit to another trick. Spades has a similar but less-common variation regarding its trump suit.
* There are trick-taking games played with Domino tiles instead of playing cards. These include the Chinese Tien Gow and Texas 42. Giog is played with Chinese chess tiles.
* Many games are played with one or more &quot;stripped decks&quot; (a deck from which certain card values are removed). The most common stripped deck is a piquet deck, used for piquet, Belote, Skat, Euchre, Bête, Écarté, Bezique and (with two piquet decks) Pinochle, among others. Rook&#x27;s main variant, Kentucky Discard, uses the equivalent of a 52-card deck with all card values 2–4 removed. Most regional Tarot variants, especially Central European and Italian variants like Tarock and Tarocco, use some subset of the &quot;full&quot; 78-card Tarot deck.
* In Bridge the partner of the contractor or &quot;declarer&quot; is called &quot;dummy&quot; and does not actively participate in the play; dummy&#x27;s hand is instead laid on the table face-up after the opening lead, and declarer chooses the cards from dummy&#x27;s hand to play during dummy&#x27;s turns.
* In Hachinin-meri and Truf, trumps are played face down. When the trick is finished, the trumps are revealed to see who won the trick.
* In many trumpless games that do not require following suit, sloughing is done face down. This is done in Madiao, Tien Gow, Tam cúc, Six Tigers, Ganjifa, Kaiserspiel, and Brazilian Truco.
* Some cards lose their trick-taking power if they are not led or played in a specific trick as in Karnöffel, Tien Gow, and Ganjifa.
* In tarot games played outside of Central Europe, the Fool is a special card that excuses the player from following suit. Except in rare circumstances in some games, it can neither capture nor be captured. Usually a non-counting card is given as compensation to the trick&#x27;s winner by the Fool&#x27;s owner.

=== Rules in Austrian and German games ===
In games derived from Austria and Germany, trick-taking is governed by the rules called &quot;Zwänge&quot;. The three main ones are &quot;Farbzwang&quot;, &quot;Stichzwang&quot; and &quot;Trumpfzwang&quot;. Although they broadly equate to rules in English-speaking countries, there are no single-word equivalents. For many games of this type, applying these rules correctly is crucial to the type of contract being played.

==== &quot;Farbzwang&quot; ====
&quot;Farbzwang&quot; (or &quot;Bedienzwang&quot;) literally means &quot;suit compulsion&quot; and is the rule that players must follow the suit of the first card to be led to the trick, provided that they have a card of that suit. If a player does not have a card of the led suit, rules vary depending on whether the other &quot;Zwänge&quot; apply.

==== &quot;Stichzwang&quot; ====
&quot;Stichzwang&quot; means &quot;trick compulsion&quot; and is the rule that players must attempt to win the trick if they are able, either by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing a trump card to a side suit lead.

==== &quot;Farbzwang&quot; with &quot;Stichzwang&quot; ====
Some games apply &quot;Farbzwang&quot; and &quot;Stichzwang&quot; together, which means that a player, when it is his or her turn, must:
* take the trick with a higher card of the led suit. If unable to do so, the player must
* discard a lower card of the led suit. If that is not possible, the player must
* take the trick with a trump card, but if that is also not feasible, the player may
* discard any card.

&quot;Farbzwang&quot;, the requirement to follow suit, almost always takes precedence over &quot;Stichzwang&quot;. A player is not allowed to take the trick with a trump if able to follow suit. There are rare instances where e.g. All Fours rules apply i.e. a player with a card of the led suit may either follow suit or trump, but only if unable to follow may a player discard.

==== &quot;Trumpfzwang&quot; ====
&quot;Trumpfzwang&quot; means &quot;trump compulsion&quot; and requires that a player &quot;must&quot; play a trump if unable to follow suit. In other words, the player may not simply discard, if unable to follow.

&quot;Example&quot;: Acorns are trumps. Peter is forehand and plays the 8 of Bells, middlehand trumps with a 10 of Acorns; Anna is rearhand and has no Bells, but does have a trump card, the 8 of Acorns. She must play this and cannot discard another non-trump card in order to keep the trump for a subsequent trick.

==== &quot;Tarockzwang&quot; ====
&quot;Tarockzwang&quot; is used in tarock games such as Königrufen and Tapp-Tarock and means &quot;Tarock compulsion&quot; or the requirement to play a Tarock card if one is led to the trick or if a player is unable to follow suit. It is a form of &quot;Trumpfzwang&quot;.

== Examples ==
Trick-taking games may be divided into point-trick games and plain-trick games. Examples of each are as follows:

=== Point-trick games ===
Point-trick game are those in which win or loss is determined by the total value of the &quot;counters&quot; in the tricks. The counters are cards with a point value, sometimes referred to as &quot;card points&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;game points&quot; awarded for winning the game and/or bonuses.

Examples include:
* Bavarian Tarock
* Belote
* Bézique
* Binokel
* Briscola
* Clabber
* Doppelkopf
* Jass
* Schafkopf
* Schnapsen or Sixty-six
* Skat
* Tarock games (French tarot, Königrufen, Zwanzigerrufen, etc.)
* Trappola (Bulka)
* Sheng ji

=== Plain-trick games ===
Plain-trick games are those in which the outcome is determined by the number of tricks taken, regardless of their content.

Examples of plain-trick games include:
* Boston
* Bridge
* Écarté
* Ombre, Bête, and Quadrille
* Piquet
* Préférence
* Solo Whist
* Tippen
* Watten
* Whist

In games that consist of several successive, different, trick-taking contracts, such as Herzeln or Quodlibet, it is not possible to categorise them as either point- or plain-trick games.

=== Last trick games ===
In a very few games the aim is to win the last trick. These include:

* Agram
* Femkort
* Letzter Stich
* Toepen

=== Trick-avoidance games ===
Trick-avoidance games are those in which the aim is to avoid taking certain tricks or to avoid taking all tricks. Misere or bettel are contracts in which the declarer undertakes to win no tricks. There are also contracts like Piccolo in the game of Königrufen, in which the aim is to take only one trick. Examples include:

* Bassadewitz
* Grasobern
* Hearts
* Polignac
* Slobberhannes

<text>A tile-based game is a game that uses tiles as one of the fundamental elements of play. Traditional tile-based games use small tiles as playing pieces for gambling or entertainment games. Some board games use tiles to create their board, giving multiple possibilities for board layout, or allowing changes in the board geometry during play.

Each tile has a back (undifferentiated) side and a face side. Domino tiles are usually rectangular, twice as long as they are wide and at least twice as wide as they are thick, though games exist with square tiles, triangular tiles and even hexagonal tiles. Modern games may use unconventional non-tileable shapes such as the curved-shaped Bendominoes, or use many different shapes that together tile a surface such as the polyominoes in Blokus.

<text>Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics, which convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities, but may be explained in terms of microscopic constituents by statistical mechanics. Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, especially physical chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering, but also in other complex fields such as meteorology.

Historically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines, particularly through the work of French physicist Sadi Carnot (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the Napoleonic Wars. Scots-Irish physicist Lord Kelvin was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854 which stated, &quot;Thermo-dynamics is the subject of the relation of heat to forces acting between contiguous parts of bodies, and the relation of heat to electrical agency.&quot; German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius restated Carnot&#x27;s principle known as the Carnot cycle and gave to the theory of heat a truer and sounder basis. His most important paper, &quot;On the Moving Force of Heat&quot;, published in 1850, first stated the second law of thermodynamics. In 1865 he introduced the concept of entropy. In 1870 he introduced the virial theorem, which applied to heat.

The initial application of thermodynamics to mechanical heat engines was quickly extended to the study of chemical compounds and chemical reactions. Chemical thermodynamics studies the nature of the role of entropy in the process of chemical reactions and has provided the bulk of expansion and knowledge of the field. Other formulations of thermodynamics emerged. Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerns itself with statistical predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, Constantin Carathéodory presented a purely mathematical approach in an axiomatic formulation, a description often referred to as &quot;geometrical thermodynamics&quot;.

==Introduction==
A description of any thermodynamic system employs the four laws of thermodynamics that form an axiomatic basis. The first law specifies that energy can be transferred between physical systems as heat, as work, and with transfer of matter. The second law defines the existence of a quantity called entropy, that describes the direction, thermodynamically, that a system can evolve and quantifies the state of order of a system and that can be used to quantify the useful work that can be extracted from the system.

In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of the thermodynamic &quot;system&quot; and its &quot;surroundings&quot;. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, and those properties are in turn related to one another through equations of state. Properties can be combined to express internal energy and thermodynamic potentials, which are useful for determining conditions for equilibrium and spontaneous processes.

With these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in science and engineering, such as engines, phase transitions, chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and even black holes. The results of thermodynamics are essential for other fields of physics and for chemistry, chemical engineering, corrosion engineering, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, cell biology, biomedical engineering, materials science, and economics, to name a few.

This article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances to that field.

==History==
The history of thermodynamics as a scientific discipline generally begins with Otto von Guericke who, in 1650, built and designed the world&#x27;s first vacuum pump and demonstrated a vacuum using his Magdeburg hemispheres. Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove Aristotle&#x27;s long-held supposition that &#x27;nature abhors a vacuum&#x27;. Shortly after Guericke, the Anglo-Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle had learned of Guericke&#x27;s designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist Robert Hooke, built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between pressure, temperature, and volume. In time, Boyle&#x27;s Law was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional. Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle&#x27;s named Denis Papin built a steam digester, which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated.

Later designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin&#x27;s designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first engine, followed by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time.

The fundamental concepts of heat capacity and latent heat, which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor Joseph Black at the University of Glasgow, where James Watt was employed as an instrument maker. Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the external condenser which resulted in a large increase in steam engine efficiency. Drawing on all the previous work led Sadi Carnot, the &quot;father of thermodynamics&quot;, to publish &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot; (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency. The book outlined the basic energetic relations between the Carnot engine, the Carnot cycle, and motive power. It marked the start of thermodynamics as a modern science.

The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by William Rankine, originally trained as a physicist and a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the University of Glasgow. The first and second laws of thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works of William Rankine, Rudolf Clausius, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).
The foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Max Planck, Rudolf Clausius and J. Willard Gibbs.

Clausius, who first stated the basic ideas of the second law in his paper &quot;On the Moving Force of Heat&quot;, published in 1850, and is called &quot;one of the founding fathers of thermodynamics&quot;, introduced the concept of entropy in 1865.

During the years 1873–76 the American mathematical physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs published a series of three papers, the most famous being &quot;On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances&quot;, in which he showed how thermodynamic processes, including chemical reactions, could be graphically analyzed, by studying the energy, entropy, volume, temperature and pressure of the thermodynamic system in such a manner, one can determine if a process would occur spontaneously. Also Pierre Duhem in the 19th century wrote about chemical thermodynamics. During the early 20th century, chemists such as Gilbert N. Lewis, Merle Randall, and E. A. Guggenheim&lt;ref name=&quot;Guggenheim 1949/1967&quot;&gt;Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967). &quot;Thermodynamics. An Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists&quot;, 1st edition 1949, 5th edition 1967, North-Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; applied the mathematical methods of Gibbs to the analysis of chemical processes.

==Etymology==

&quot;Thermodynamics&quot; has an intricate etymology.

By a surface-level analysis, the word consists of two parts that can be traced back to Ancient Greek. Firstly, (&quot;of heat&quot;; used in words such as &quot;thermometer&quot;) can be traced back to the root &quot;therme&quot;, meaning &quot;heat&quot;. Secondly, the word (&quot;science of force [or power]&quot;) can be traced back to the root &quot;dynamis&quot;, meaning &quot;power&quot;.

In 1849, the adjective &quot;thermo-dynamic&quot; is used by William Thomson.

In 1854, the noun &quot;thermo-dynamics&quot; is used by Thomson and William Rankine to represent the science of generalized heat engines.

Pierre Perrot claims that the term &quot;thermodynamics&quot; was coined by James Joule in 1858 to designate the science of relations between heat and power, however, Joule never used that term, but used instead the term &quot;perfect thermo-dynamic engine&quot; in reference to Thomson&#x27;s 1849 phraseology.

==Branches of thermodynamics==
The study of thermodynamical systems has developed into several related branches, each using a different fundamental model as a theoretical or experimental basis, or applying the principles to varying types of systems.

===Classical thermodynamics===
Classical thermodynamics is the description of the states of thermodynamic systems at near-equilibrium, that uses macroscopic, measurable properties. It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the laws of thermodynamics. The qualifier &quot;classical&quot; reflects the fact that it represents the first level of understanding of the subject as it developed in the 19th century and describes the changes of a system in terms of macroscopic empirical (large scale, and measurable) parameters. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was later provided by the development of &quot;statistical mechanics&quot;.

===Statistical mechanics===
Statistical mechanics, also known as statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and supplemented classical thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states. This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining classical thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum theory at the microscopic level.

===Chemical thermodynamics===
Chemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics. The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is determining the spontaneity of a given transformation.

===Equilibrium thermodynamics===
Equilibrium thermodynamics is the study of transfers of matter and energy in systems or bodies that, by agencies in their surroundings, can be driven from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another. The term &#x27;thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; indicates a state of balance, in which all macroscopic flows are zero; in the case of the simplest systems or bodies, their intensive properties are homogeneous, and their pressures are perpendicular to their boundaries. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, between macroscopically distinct parts of the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial equilibrium state, and given its surroundings, and given its constitutive walls, to calculate what will be the final equilibrium state of the system after a specified thermodynamic operation has changed its walls or surroundings.

===Non-equilibrium thermodynamics===
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.

==Laws of thermodynamics==

Thermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following.

===Zeroth law===
The zeroth law of thermodynamics states: &quot;If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.&quot;

This statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation on the set of thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide whether two bodies are at the same temperature, it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature, and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.

The zeroth law was not initially recognized as a separate law of thermodynamics, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws. The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated already, and found common acceptance in the physics community before the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized. As it was impractical to renumber the other laws, it was named the &quot;zeroth law&quot;.

===First law===

The first law of thermodynamics states: &quot;In a process without transfer of matter, the change in internal energy,&quot; formula_1&quot;, of a thermodynamic system is equal to the energy gained as heat,&quot; formula_2&quot;, less the thermodynamic work,&quot; formula_3&quot;, done by the system on its surroundings.&quot;

:formula_4.

where formula_1 denotes the change in the internal energy of a closed system (for which heat or work through the system boundary are possible, but matter transfer is not possible), formula_2 denotes the quantity of energy supplied &quot;to&quot; the system as heat, and formula_3 denotes the amount of thermodynamic work done &quot;by&quot; the system &quot;on&quot; its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible; work formula_3 done by a system on its surrounding requires that the system&#x27;s internal energy formula_9 decrease or be consumed, so that the amount of internal energy lost by that work must be resupplied as heat formula_2 by an external energy source or as work by an external machine acting on the system (so that formula_9 is recovered) to make the system work continuously.

For processes that include transfer of matter, a further statement is needed: &quot;With due account of the respective fiducial reference states of the systems, when two systems, which may be of different chemical compositions, initially separated only by an impermeable wall, and otherwise isolated, are combined into a new system by the thermodynamic operation of removal of the wall, then&quot;

:formula_12,

&quot;where&quot; &quot;denotes the internal energy of the combined system, and&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;denote the internal energies of the respective separated systems.&quot;

Adapted for thermodynamics, this law is an expression of the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.

Internal energy is a principal property of the thermodynamic state, while heat and work are modes of energy transfer by which a process may change this state. A change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat added or removed and work performed on or by the system. As a function of state, the internal energy does not depend on the manner, or on the path through intermediate steps, by which the system arrived at its state.

===Second law===
A traditional version of the second law of thermodynamics states: &quot;Heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.&quot;

The second law refers to a system of matter and radiation, initially with inhomogeneities in temperature, pressure, chemical potential, and other intensive properties, that are due to internal &#x27;constraints&#x27;, or impermeable rigid walls, within it, or to externally imposed forces. The law observes that, when the system is isolated from the outside world and from those forces, there is a definite thermodynamic quantity, its entropy, that increases as the constraints are removed, eventually reaching a maximum value at thermodynamic equilibrium, when the inhomogeneities practically vanish. For systems that are initially far from thermodynamic equilibrium, though several have been proposed, there is known no general physical principle that determines the rates of approach to thermodynamic equilibrium, and thermodynamics does not deal with such rates. The many versions of the second law all express the general irreversibility of the transitions involved in systems approaching thermodynamic equilibrium.

In macroscopic thermodynamics, the second law is a basic observation applicable to any actual thermodynamic process; in statistical thermodynamics, the second law is postulated to be a consequence of molecular chaos.

===Third law===
The third law of thermodynamics states: &quot;As the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.&quot;

This law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching absolute zero of temperature. This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate definitions include &quot;the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,&quot; or equivalently &quot;it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes&quot;.

Absolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to achieve, is −273.15 °C (degrees Celsius), or −459.67 °F (degrees Fahrenheit), or 0 K (kelvin), or 0° R (degrees Rankine).

==System models==

An important concept in thermodynamics is the thermodynamic system, which is a precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the universe except the system is called the &quot;surroundings&quot;. A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a &quot;boundary&quot; which may be a physical or notional, but serve to confine the system to a finite volume. Segments of the &quot;boundary&quot; are often described as &quot;walls&quot;; they have respective defined &#x27;permeabilities&#x27;. Transfers of energy as work, or as heat, or of matter, between the system and the surroundings, take place through the walls, according to their respective permeabilities.

Matter or energy that pass across the boundary so as to effect a change in the internal energy of the system need to be accounted for in the energy balance equation. The volume contained by the walls can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as Max Planck defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a steam engine, such as Sadi Carnot defined in 1824. The system could also be just one nuclide (i.e. a system of quarks) as hypothesized in quantum thermodynamics. When a looser viewpoint is adopted, and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium is dropped, the system can be the body of a tropical cyclone, such as Kerry Emanuel theorized in 1986 in the field of atmospheric thermodynamics, or the event horizon of a black hole.

Boundaries are of four types: fixed, movable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position, within which a constant volume process might occur. If the piston is allowed to move that boundary is movable while the cylinder and cylinder head boundaries are fixed. For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open systems boundaries are often imaginary. In the case of a jet engine, a fixed imaginary boundary might be assumed at the intake of the engine, fixed boundaries along the surface of the case and a second fixed imaginary boundary across the exhaust nozzle.

Generally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:

As time passes in an isolated system, internal differences of pressures, densities, and temperatures tend to even out. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone to completion is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.

Once in thermodynamic equilibrium, a system&#x27;s properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to understand than are systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and are said to be reversible processes.

==States and processes==
When a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to be in a definite thermodynamic state. The state of the system can be described by a number of state quantities that do not depend on the process by which the system arrived at its state. They are called intensive variables or extensive variables according to how they change when the size of the system changes. The properties of the system can be described by an equation of state which specifies the relationship between these variables. State may be thought of as the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of variables held constant.

A thermodynamic process may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can be described by process quantities. Typically, each thermodynamic process is distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed; Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a conjugate pair.

Several commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:
* Adiabatic process: occurs without loss or gain of energy by heat
* Isenthalpic process: occurs at a constant enthalpy
* Isentropic process: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant entropy
* Isobaric process: occurs at constant pressure
* Isochoric process: occurs at constant volume (also called isometric/isovolumetric)
* Isothermal process: occurs at a constant temperature
* Steady state process: occurs without a change in the internal energy

== Instrumentation ==
There are two types of thermodynamic instruments, the meter and the reservoir. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a thermodynamic system. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the zeroth law states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by James Maxwell in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature. An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the ideal gas law &quot;pV=nRT&quot;, the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a barometer may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A calorimeter is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.

A thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that its state parameters are not appreciably altered when it is brought into contact with the system of interest. When the reservoir is brought into contact with the system, the system is brought into equilibrium with the reservoir. For example, a pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that pressure upon the system to which it is mechanically connected. The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir. The ocean can act as temperature reservoir when used to cool power plants.

== Conjugate variables ==
The central concept of thermodynamics is that of energy, the ability to do work. By the First Law, the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In mechanics, for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.

Conjugate variables are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being akin to a &quot;force&quot; applied to some thermodynamic system, the second being akin to the resulting &quot;displacement&quot;, and the product of the two equaling the amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are:
* Pressure-volume (the mechanical parameters);
* Temperature-entropy (thermal parameters);
* Chemical potential-particle number (material parameters).

== Potentials ==
Thermodynamic potentials are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state. The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure. For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively. Thermodynamic potentials cannot be measured in laboratories, but can be computed using molecular thermodynamics.

The five most well known potentials are:
where formula_13 is the temperature, formula_14 the entropy, formula_15 the pressure, formula_16 the volume, formula_17 the chemical potential, formula_18 the number of particles in the system, and formula_19 is the count of particles types in the system.

Thermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through Legendre transformation.

== Axiomatic thermodynamics ==

Axiomatic thermodynamics is a mathematical discipline that aims to describe thermodynamics in terms of rigorous axioms, for example by finding a mathematically rigorous way to express the familiar laws of thermodynamics.

The first attempt at an axiomatic theory of thermodynamics was Constantin Carathéodory&#x27;s 1909 work &quot;Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics&quot;, which made use of Pfaffian systems and the concept of adiabatic accessibility, a notion that was introduced by Carathéodory himself. In this formulation, thermodynamic concepts such as heat, entropy, and temperature are derived from quantities that are more directly measurable. Theories that came after, differed in the sense that they made assumptions regarding thermodynamic processes with arbitrary initial and final states, as opposed to considering only neighboring states.

<text>Topology (from the Greek words , and ) is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is, without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.

A topological space is a set endowed with a structure, called a &quot;topology&quot;, which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. Euclidean spaces, and, more generally, metric spaces are examples of topological spaces, as any distance or metric defines a topology. The deformations that are considered in topology are homeomorphisms and homotopies. A property that is invariant under such deformations is a topological property. The following are basic examples of topological properties: the dimension, which allows distinguishing between a line and a surface; compactness, which allows distinguishing between a line and a circle; connectedness, which allows distinguishing a circle from two non-intersecting circles.

The ideas underlying topology go back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who in the 17th century envisioned the and . Leonhard Euler&#x27;s Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and polyhedron formula are arguably the field&#x27;s first theorems. The term &quot;topology&quot; was introduced by Johann Benedict Listing in the 19th century, although, it was not until the first decades of the 20th century that the idea of a topological space was developed.

==Motivation==

The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one-dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.

In one of the first papers in topology, Leonhard Euler demonstrated that it was impossible to find a route through the town of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges or on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges connect to which islands or riverbanks. This Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem led to the branch of mathematics known as graph theory.

Similarly, the hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology says that &quot;one cannot comb the hair flat on a hairy ball without creating a cowlick.&quot; This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on the sphere. As with the &quot;Bridges of Königsberg&quot;, the result does not depend on the shape of the sphere; it applies to any kind of smooth blob, as long as it has no holes.

To deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems do rely on. From this need arises the notion of homeomorphism. The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges homeomorphic to those in Königsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space homeomorphic to a sphere.

Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A famous example, known as the &quot;Topologist&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;, is that a topologist cannot distinguish a coffee mug from a doughnut; a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it while shrinking the hole into a handle.

Homeomorphism can be considered the most basic topological equivalence. Another is homotopy equivalence. This is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from &quot;squishing&quot; some larger object.

==History==

Topology, as a well-defined mathematical discipline, originates in the early part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries. Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. His 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology. On 14 November 1750, Euler wrote to a friend that he had realized the importance of the &quot;edges&quot; of a polyhedron. This led to his polyhedron formula, (where , , and respectively indicate the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the polyhedron). Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem, signaling the birth of topology.

Further contributions were made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Ludwig Schläfli, Johann Benedict Listing, Bernhard Riemann and Enrico Betti. Listing introduced the term &quot;Topologie&quot; in &quot;Vorstudien zur Topologie&quot;, written in his native German, in 1847, having used the word for ten years in correspondence before its first appearance in print. The English form &quot;topology&quot; was used in 1883 in Listing&#x27;s obituary in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; to distinguish &quot;qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated&quot;.

Their work was corrected, consolidated and greatly extended by Henri Poincaré. In 1895, he published his ground-breaking paper on &quot;Analysis Situs&quot;, which introduced the concepts now known as homotopy and homology, which are now considered part of algebraic topology.

The development of topology in the 20th century was marked by significant advances in both foundational theory and its application to other fields of mathematics. Unifying the work on function spaces of Georg Cantor, Vito Volterra, Cesare Arzelà, Jacques Hadamard, Giulio Ascoli and others, Maurice Fréchet introduced the metric space in 1906. A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space, with any given topological space potentially giving rise to many distinct metric spaces. In 1914, Felix Hausdorff coined the term &quot;topological space&quot; and defined what is now called a Hausdorff space. Currently, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by Kazimierz Kuratowski.

Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in Euclidean space as part of his study of Fourier series. For further developments, see point-set topology and algebraic topology.

The 2022 Abel Prize was awarded to Dennis Sullivan &quot;for his groundbreaking contributions to topology in its broadest sense, and in particular its algebraic, geometric and dynamical aspects&quot;.

==Concepts==

===Topologies on sets===
The term &quot;topology&quot; also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology. Informally, a topology describes how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the real line, the complex plane, and the Cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies.

Formally, let be a set and let be a family of subsets of . Then is called a topology on if:

# Both the empty set and are elements of .
# Any union of elements of is an element of .
# Any intersection of finitely many elements of is an element of .

If is a topology on , then the pair is called a topological space. The notation may be used to denote a set endowed with the particular topology . By definition, every topology is a -system.

The members of are called &quot;open sets&quot; in . A subset of is said to be closed if its complement is in (that is, its complement is open). A subset of may be open, closed, both (a clopen set), or neither. The empty set and itself are always both closed and open. An open subset of which contains a point is called an open neighborhood of .

===Continuous functions and homeomorphisms===


A function or map from one topological space to another is called &quot;continuous&quot; if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers to the real numbers (both spaces with the standard topology), then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. However, the sphere is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.

===Manifolds===

While topological spaces can be extremely varied and exotic, many areas of topology focus on the more familiar class of spaces known as manifolds. A &quot;manifold&quot; is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an -dimensional manifold has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension . Lines and circles, but not figure eights, are one-dimensional manifolds. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces, although not all surfaces are manifolds. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, which can all be realized without self-intersection in three dimensions, and the Klein bottle and real projective plane, which cannot (that is, all their realizations are surfaces that are not manifolds).

==Topics==

===General topology===

General topology is the branch of topology dealing with the basic set-theoretic definitions and constructions used in topology. It is the foundation of most other branches of topology, including differential topology, geometric topology, and algebraic topology. Another name for general topology is point-set topology.

The basic object of study is topological spaces, which are sets equipped with a topology, that is, a family of subsets, called &quot;open sets&quot;, which is closed under finite intersections and (finite or infinite) unions. The fundamental concepts of topology, such as &quot;continuity&quot;, &quot;compactness&quot;, and &quot;connectedness&quot;, can be defined in terms of open sets. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets are those that can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot be divided into two pieces that are far apart. The words &quot;nearby&quot;, &quot;arbitrarily small&quot;, and &quot;far apart&quot; can all be made precise by using open sets. Several topologies can be defined on a given space. Changing a topology consists of changing the collection of open sets. This changes which functions are continuous and which subsets are compact or connected.

Metric spaces are an important class of topological spaces where the distance between any two points is defined by a function called a &quot;metric&quot;. In a metric space, an open set is a union of open disks, where an open disk of radius centered at is the set of all points whose distance to is less than . Many common spaces are topological spaces whose topology can be defined by a metric. This is the case of the real line, the complex plane, real and complex vector spaces and Euclidean spaces. Having a metric simplifies many proofs.

===Algebraic topology===

Algebraic topology is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.

The most important of these invariants are homotopy groups, homology, and cohomology.

Although algebraic topology primarily uses algebra to study topological problems, using topology to solve algebraic problems is sometimes also possible. Algebraic topology, for example, allows for a convenient proof that any subgroup of a free group is again a free group.

===Differential topology===

Differential topology is the field dealing with differentiable functions on differentiable manifolds. It is closely related to differential geometry and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

More specifically, differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined. Smooth manifolds are &quot;softer&quot; than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifoldthat is, one can smoothly &quot;flatten out&quot; certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume.

===Geometric topology===
Geometric topology is a branch of topology that primarily focuses on low-dimensional manifolds (that is, spaces of dimensions 2, 3, and 4) and their interaction with geometry, but it also includes some higher-dimensional topology. Some examples of topics in geometric topology are orientability, handle decompositions, local flatness, crumpling and the planar and higher-dimensional Schönflies theorem.

In high-dimensional topology, characteristic classes are a basic invariant, and surgery theory is a key theory.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, and negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the geometrization conjecture (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as complex geometry in one variable (Riemann surfaces are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

===Generalizations===
Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a &quot;set of points&quot; is not available. In pointless topology one considers instead the lattice of open sets as the basic notion of the theory, while Grothendieck topologies are structures defined on arbitrary categories that allow the definition of sheaves on those categories and with that the definition of general cohomology theories.

==Applications==

===Biology===

Topology has been used to study various biological systems including molecules and nanostructure (e.g., membraneous objects). In particular, circuit topology and knot theory have been extensively applied to classify and compare the topology of folded proteins and nucleic acids. Circuit topology classifies folded molecular chains based on the pairwise arrangement of their intra-chain contacts and chain crossings. Knot theory, a branch of topology, is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on DNA. These enzymes cut, twist, and reconnect the DNA, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis.

===Computer science===

Topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large-scale structure of a set (for instance, determining if a cloud of points is spherical or toroidal). The main method used by topological data analysis is to:
# Replace a set of data points with a family of simplicial complexes, indexed by a proximity parameter.
# Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology – specifically, via the theory of persistent homology.
# Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a Betti number, which is called a barcode.

Several branches of programming language semantics, such as domain theory, are formalized using topology. In this context, Steve Vickers, building on work by Samson Abramsky and Michael B. Smyth, characterizes topological spaces as Boolean or Heyting algebras over open sets, which are characterized as semidecidable (equivalently, finitely observable) properties.

=== Physics ===
Topology is relevant to physics in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and physical cosmology.

The topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in the disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science. Electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of molecules and elementary units in materials. The compressive strength of crumpled topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high strength to weight of such structures that are mostly empty space. Topology is of further significance in Contact mechanics where the dependence of stiffness and friction on the dimensionality of surface structures is the subject of interest with applications in multi-body physics.

A topological quantum field theory (or topological field theory or TQFT) is a quantum field theory that computes topological invariants.

Although TQFTs were invented by physicists, they are also of mathematical interest, being related to, among other things, knot theory, the theory of four-manifolds in algebraic topology, and the theory of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry. Donaldson, Jones, Witten, and Kontsevich have all won Fields Medals for work related to topological field theory.

The topological classification of Calabi–Yau manifolds has important implications in string theory, as different manifolds can sustain different kinds of strings.

In cosmology, topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe. This area of research is commonly known as spacetime topology.

In condensed matter, a relevant application to topological physics comes from the possibility of obtaining a one-way current, which is a current protected from backscattering. It was first discovered in electronics with the famous quantum Hall effect, and then generalized in other areas of physics, for instance in photonics by F.D.M Haldane.

===Robotics===
The possible positions of a robot can be described by a manifold called configuration space. In the area of motion planning, one finds paths between two points in configuration space. These paths represent a motion of the robot&#x27;s joints and other parts into the desired pose.

===Games and puzzles===
Disentanglement puzzles are based on topological aspects of the puzzle&#x27;s shapes and components.

===Fiber art===
In order to create a continuous join of pieces in a modular construction, it is necessary to create an unbroken path in an order that surrounds each piece and traverses each edge only once. This process is an application of the Eulerian path.

<text>A troll is a being in Nordic folklore, including Norse mythology. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated areas of rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.

In later Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.

In Scandinavian folklore, trolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks (sometimes said to have been formed by a troll having been exposed to sunlight). Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse nouns &quot;troll&quot; and &quot;trǫll&quot; (variously meaning &quot;fiend, demon, werewolf, jötunn&quot;) and Middle High German &quot;troll, trolle&quot; &quot;fiend&quot; (according to philologist Vladimir Orel, the word is likely borrowed from Old Norse), possibly developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *&quot;trullan&quot;, meaning &quot;to tread, step on&quot;. The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown. Additionally, the Old Norse verb &quot;trylla&quot; &#x27;to enchant, to turn into a troll&#x27; and the Middle High German verb &quot;trüllen&quot; &quot;to flutter&quot; both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *&quot;trulljanan&quot;, a derivative of *&quot;trullan&quot;.

==Norse mythology==
In Norse mythology, &quot;troll&quot;, like &quot;thurs&quot;, is a term applied to &quot;jötnar&quot; and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and-daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason. According to the section, Bragi was driving through &quot;a certain forest&quot; late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself:

Bragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful skald, before the scenario ends.

There is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms &quot;jötunn&quot;, &quot;troll&quot;, &quot;þurs&quot;, and &quot;risi&quot;, which describe various beings. Lotte Motz theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (&quot;jötunn&quot;), mythical magicians (&quot;troll&quot;), hostile monsters (&quot;þurs&quot;), and heroic and courtly beings (&quot;risi&quot;), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, Ármann Jakobson is critical of Motz&#x27;s interpretation and calls this theory &quot;unsupported by any convincing evidence&quot;. Ármann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a jötunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a &quot;blámaðr&quot;, a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a brunnmigi, or a berserker.

==Scandinavian folklore==

Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being. Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight. However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having &quot;some form of social organization&quot;—unlike the &quot;rå&quot; and &quot;näck&quot;, who are attested as &quot;solitary beings&quot;. According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of &quot;bergtagning&quot; (&#x27;kidnapping&#x27;; literally &quot;mountain-taking&quot;) and overrunning a farm or estate.

Lindow states that the etymology of the word &quot;troll&quot; remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as &quot;nature beings&quot; and as &quot;all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to fairies in Anglo-Celtic traditions&quot;. They &quot;therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for&quot;. Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and &quot;little people&quot; in the folklore record.

A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god Thor&#x27;s role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the &quot;accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes&quot;. Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia is described in folklore as being a &quot;consequence of the constant din of the church-bells&quot;. This ringing caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll&#x27;s toss. Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.

Lindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to Grendel, the supernatural mead hall invader in the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and notes that &quot;just as the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off.&quot;

Smaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition. In Denmark, these creatures are recorded as &quot;troldfolk&quot; (&quot;troll-folk&quot;), &quot;bjergtrolde&quot; (&quot;mountain-trolls&quot;), or &quot;bjergfolk&quot; (&quot;mountain-folk&quot;) and in Norway also as &quot;trollfolk&quot; (&quot;troll-folk&quot;) and &quot;tusser&quot;. Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.

In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk (&quot;hidden-folk&quot;), yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word &quot;trow&quot; in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway, may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word &quot;troll&quot; may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshipped. &quot;Troll&quot; could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas &quot;Huldrefolk&quot; may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.

John Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse vættir and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.

Troll, a Norwegian research station in Antarctica, is so named because of the rugged mountains which stand around that place like trolls. It includes a ground station which tracks satellites in polar orbit.

==In popular culture==
Trolls have appeared in many works of modern fiction, most often in the fantasy genre, with classic examples being the portrayal of trolls in works such as in Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth or the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. 

Beginning in the 1950s, Troll dolls were a popular toy based on the folklore creature. Trolls based on the dolls appeared in the Hollywood animated movie &quot;Trolls&quot; (2016) and its subsequent sequels Trolls World Tour&quot; (2020), and &quot;Trolls Band Together&quot; (2023).

&quot;Troll&quot; is the name, and main antagonist, of a 2022 Norwegian movie released by Netflix on December 1, 2022.

Rolf Lidberg was a Swedish artist well known for his troll illustrations. 

The Danish artist Thomas Dambo has created from recycled wood a series of monumental troll sculptures that can be seen in several botanic gardens and similar installations.

==Other==

It has been hypothesized that the troll myth might have its origin in real-life interactions between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals.

<text>A trade secret is a form of intellectual property (IP) comprising confidential information that is not generally known or readily ascertainable, derives economic value from its secrecy, and is protected by reasonable efforts to maintain its confidentiality. Well-known examples include the Coca-Cola formula and the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

Unlike other forms of IP, trade secrets do not require formal registration and can be protected indefinitely, as long as they remain undisclosed. Instead, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), among other measures, are commonly used to keep the information secret. 

Like other IP assets, trade secrets may be sold or licensed. Unauthorized acquisition, use, or disclosure of a trade secret by others in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices is considered misappropriation of the trade secret. If trade secret misappropriation happens, the trade secret holder can seek various legal remedies.

== Definition ==

The precise definition of a trade secret varies by jurisdiction, as do the types of information eligible trade secret protection. However, in general, trade secrets are confidential information that is:

* not generally known among or accessible to individuals within the relevant business sector;
* commercially valuable because it is secret; and
* subject to reasonable steps taken by the rightful holder of the information to keep it secret.

All three elements are required. If any element ceases to exist, then the trade secret will also cease to exist.

Trade secret protection covers confidential information, which can include technical and scientific data, business and commercial information, and financial records. Even “negative” information, like failed experiments, can be valuable by helping companies avoid repeating costly mistakes.

In international law, while &quot;trade secrets&quot; and &quot;confidential information&quot; are often used interchangeably, trade secrets are technically a subset of confidential information. To qualify as a trade secret, confidential information must meet the specific requirements set by a country&#x27;s national laws, which are often influenced by Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement.

== History ==

=== Early origins ===
Commentators like A. Arthur Schiller have argued that trade secrets were protected under Roman law by a claim known as , meaning an &quot;action for making a slave worse&quot; or &quot;an action for corrupting a servant.&quot; The Roman law is described as follows:

[T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the &quot;actio servi corrupti&quot; ... which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions. &quot;If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day.&quot;

The suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; article called &quot;Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The &quot;Actio Servi Corrupti&quot;&quot;, which has been reproduced in Schiller&#x27;s, &quot;An American Experience in Roman Law&quot; 1 (1971).

However, the University of Georgia Law School professor Alan Watson argued in &quot;Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded &quot;that the &quot;actio servi corrupti&quot; was not used to protect trade secrets. Rather, he explained:

Schiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The &quot;actio servi corrupti&quot; presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used. In this regard the &quot;actio servi corrupti&quot; is not unique. Exactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests.

=== Early case law ===
Modern trade secret law is primarily rooted in Anglo-American common law. The earliest recorded court case was the 1817 English case &quot;Newbery v. James,&quot; which involved a secret formula for gout treatment. In the United States, this concept was first recognized in the 1837 case &quot;Vickery v. Welch&quot;, involving the sale of a chocolate factory and the seller’s agreement to keep the secret recipe confidential.

&quot;Newbery&quot; and &quot;Vickery&quot; only awarded compensation for losses (damages) and did not issue orders to prevent the misuse of secrets (injunctive relief). The first English case involving injunctive relief was &quot;Yovatt v. Winyard&quot; in 1820, where the court issued an injunction to prevent a former employee from using or disclosing recipes he had secretly copied from his employer&#x27;s veterinary medicine practice. 

In the United States, the 1868 Massachusetts Supreme Court decision in &quot;Peabody v. Norfolk&quot; is one of the most well-known and well-reasoned early trade secret case, establishing foundational legal principles that continue to be central to common law. In this case, the court ruled that Peabody’s confidential manufacturing process was a protectable trade secret and issued an injunction preventing former employees from using or disclosing it after they shared it with a competitor.

=== Uniform lawmaking and legislation ===
In 1939, the &quot;Restatement of Torts,&quot; published by the American Law Institute, offered, among other things, one of the earliest formal definitions of a trade secret. According to Section 757, Comment b, a trade secret may consist of &quot;any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information which is used in one&#x27;s business, and which gives the business an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.&quot; This definition became widely used by courts across the United States. As the first attempt to outline the accepted principles of trade secret law, the &quot;Restatement&quot; served as the primary authority adopted in virtually every reported case. 

Trade secret law saw further development in 1979 when the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) introduced a model law known as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which was later amended in 1985. The UTSA defines the types of information eligible for trade secret protection, establishes a private cause of action for misappropriation, and outlines remedies such as injunctions, damages, and, in certain cases, attorneys&#x27; fees. It has since been adopted by 48 states, along with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with New York and North Carolina as the exceptions. 

The UTSA influenced the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) of 2016, which created a federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation, allowing plaintiffs to file cases directly in federal courts if &quot;the trade secret is related to a product or service used in ... interstate or foreign commerce.&quot;

=== International standards ===
Trade secret law is governed by national legal systems. However, international standards for protecting secrets (called “undisclosed information”) were established as part of the TRIPS Agreement in 1995. Article 39 of TRIPS obligates member countries to protect “undisclosed information” from unauthorized use conducted “in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices,” including actions such as breach of contract, breach of confidence, and unfair competition. For the information to qualify, it must not be generally known or easily accessible, must hold value due to its secrecy, and must be safeguarded through “reasonable steps” to keep it secret. 

== Value ==

Trade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company&#x27;s intellectual property (IP). Their contribution to a company&#x27;s value can be major. Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure. Still, research shows that changes in trade secrets laws affect business spending on R&amp;D and patents. This research provides indirect evidence of the value of trade secrecy.

== Protection ==

Unlike other forms of intellectual property, trade secrets do not require formal registration and can be protected indefinitely, as long as they remain secret. Maintaining secrecy is both a practical necessity and a legal obligation, as trade secret owners must take &quot;reasonable&quot; measures to protect the confidentiality of their trade secrets to qualify for legal protection. &quot;Reasonable&quot; efforts are decided case by case, considering factors like the type and value of the secret, its importance to the business, the company’s size, and its organizational complexity.

The most common reason for trade secret disputes to arise is when former employees of trade secret-bearing companies leave to work for a competitor and are suspected of taking or using valuable confidential information belonging to their former employer. Legal protections include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and work-for-hire and non-compete clauses. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may agree to not reveal their prospective employer&#x27;s proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). 

Violating the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties, thus disincentivizing the revealing of trade secrets. Trade secret information can be protected through legal action including an injunction preventing breaches of confidentiality, monetary damages, and, in some instances, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees too. In extraordinary circumstances, an &quot;ex parte seizure&quot; under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) also allows for the court to seize property to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret. 

However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult. A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties, such as vendors, licensees, and board members.

As a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a patent or copyright. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through reverse engineering.

Therefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are Chartreuse liqueur and Coca-Cola.

Because protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last for a limited duration. For example, the Coca-Cola company has no patent for the formula of Coca-Cola and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges&#x27; orders.

Trade secret legal protection can reduce the knowledge spillover, which enhances the knowledge spread and technology improvement. Therefore, while trade secret laws strengthen R&amp;D exclusivity and encourage firms to engage in innovative activities, broadly reducing knowledge spillovers can harm economic growth.

== Misappropriation ==

In general, trade secret misappropriation occurs when someone improperly acquires, discloses, or uses a trade secret without the trade secret holder&#x27;s consent. Common scenarios include former employees taking proprietary data to a new employer in violation of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), espionage, or unauthorized disclosure.

To prove misappropriation, the trade secret holder must generally show—subject to the specific requirements of the applicable jurisdiction—that:

* the misappropriated information matches the trade secret, and
* the unlawful, improper, or dishonest methods used by the misappropriator, such as breaching confidentiality agreements, violating duties of confidentiality arising from special relationships (e.g., employer-employee), engaging in industrial espionage, hacking, coercion, or inducing others to breach their confidentiality obligations.

==Exceptions and limitations==

While the improper, dishonest, or unlawful acquisition, use, or disclosure of trade secret information by unauthorized third parties is generally prohibited, there are exceptions to this rule. The scope of these exceptions and limitations varies across jurisdictions:
* Independent discovery or development of the same information by a third party.
* Reverse engineering, acquisition of information through reverse engineering from examining a product placed in the market. In some countries though, a contract (such as a purchase agreement) may forbid to carry out reverse engineering.
* Employee’s general skills and experience acquired from the normal course of work with other employers.
* Public interest and national security per statutory law or case law in some countries.
* Whistleblowing when revealing misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity.

== By nation ==

=== Commonwealth nations ===

In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right.

The Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case of &quot;Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd&quot; held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving &quot;good faith&quot;.

The test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the common law world is set out in the case of &quot;Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd&quot;:

* The information itself must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;
* That information must have been imparted in circumstances imparting an obligation of confidence;
* There must be an unauthorized use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.

The &quot;quality of confidence&quot; highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them.

A successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of judicial relief, including:

* An injunction
* An account of profits or an award of damages
* A declaration

Hong Kong does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right.

=== European Union ===

The EU adopted a Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets on 27 May 2016. The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU.

Unlike other protections, like in the US, the trade secrets in the EU are not absolutely seen as an IP right, as it gives the holder no exclusive rights. It is more a protection against the unfair use or publication of the secret information.

=== United States ===

Within the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company&#x27;s proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.

Although trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark decision, &quot;Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,&quot; which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.

In 1979, several U.S. states adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996 (), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime.

This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity:

# , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers.
# , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes.

The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses. The EEA was extended in 2016 to allow companies to file civil suits in federal court.

On May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets. The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General.

The statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as,

However, the law contains several important differences from prior law:

# Because it is a federal law, trade secret cases can be prosecuted in federal courts with concomitant procedural advantages.
# It provides for the unusual remedy of preliminary seizure of &quot;property necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret,&quot; 18 U.S.C. §1836
# It provides for remedies to include royalties in appropriate cases and exemplary damages up to two times the actual damages in cases of &quot;willful and malicious&quot; appropriation, 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).
The DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. §1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers. 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).

The DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action. Because states vary significantly in their approach to the &quot;inevitable disclosure&quot; doctrine, its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.§1836(b)(3)(A).

== Comparison to other intellectual property laws ==

In the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same way as patents or trademarks. While the US Constitution explicitly authorizes the existence of and the federal jurisdiction over patents and copyrights, it is silent on trade secrets, trademarks, etc. For this reason, Federal Law for the latter types of intellectual property is based on the Commerce Clause (rather than the Copyright Clause) under a theory, that these IP types are used for interstate commerce. On other hand, the application of the Interstate Commerce Theory did not find much judicial support in regulating trade secrets: since a trade secret process is used in a State, where it is protected by state law, federal protection may be needed only when industrial espionage by a foreign entity is involved (given that the States themselves cannot regulate commerce with foreign powers).

Due to these Constitutional requirements, patents and trademarks enjoy a strong federal protection in the USA (the Lanham Act and Patent Act, respectively), while trade secrets usually have to rely on more limited state laws. Most states have adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), except for Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina. However, since 2016 with the enactment of the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), some additional trade secrets protection has become also available under federal law. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the owner has taken reasonable measures to protect the information as a secret (see (3)(A)).

Nations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to service marks and trade dress. By definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (&quot;qua&quot; trademark) until and unless it is &quot;disclosed&quot; to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to a certain trademark might itself be protectable as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.) To acquire a trademark rights under U.S. law, one must simply use the mark &quot;in commerce&quot;. It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels. Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection. Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement.

To acquire a patent, enabling information about the method or product has to be supplied to a patent office and upon publication (usually, years before issuance of a patent), it becomes available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The most important advantage of patents (compared to trade secrets) is that patents assure the monopoly of their owners, even when the patented subject matter is independently invented by others later (there are some exceptions), as well as when the patented subject matter was invented by others prior to the patent&#x27;s priority date, kept as a trade secret, and used by the other in its business. Although it is legally possible to &quot;convert&quot; a trade secret into a patent, the claims in such patent would be limited to things, that are easily discernable from examining such things. This means, that compositions of matter and articles of manufacture can not be patented after they become available to public, while processes can. 

The temporary monopoly on the patented invention is regarded as a pay-off for disclosing the information to the public. In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must disclose the invention, so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. Often, an invention will be improved after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of that additional information must be disclosed through the patent application process, and it may thus be kept as a trade secret. That nondisclosed information will often increase the commercial viability of the patent. Most patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have, and patent licensors must be careful to maintain their trade secrets while licensing a patent through such means as the use of a non-disclosure agreement. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not time limited (it &quot;continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public&quot;, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs, has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public. The disadvantages of trade secrets include that &quot;others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it&quot;, &quot;others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets&quot;, and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.

== Public safety ==
=== United States ===
The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (FOIA), which requires federal agencies to provide documents to the public on request, includes the discretionary exemption - to withhold information for trade secrets. Thus trade secret regulations can mask the composition of chemical agents in consumer products which has long been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and toxic substances. It has been argued that the public is being denied a clear picture of such products&#x27; safety, whereas competitors are well positioned to analyze its chemical composition. In 2004, the National Environmental Trust tested 40 common consumer products; in more than half of them they found toxic substances not listed on the product label.

<doc id="29965" wikidata="Q188524" url="?curid=29965" title="Tensor">
<text>In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors. There are many types of tensors, including scalars and vectors (which are the simplest tensors), dual vectors, multilinear maps between vector spaces, and even some operations such as the dot product. Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular coordinate system; those components form an array, which can be thought of as a high-dimensional matrix.

Tensors have become important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as mechanics (stress, elasticity, quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics, moment of inertia, ...), electrodynamics (electromagnetic tensor, Maxwell tensor, permittivity, magnetic susceptibility, ...), and general relativity (stress–energy tensor, curvature tensor, ...). In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. This leads to the concept of a tensor field. In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are often simply called &quot;tensors&quot;.

Tullio Levi-Civita and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro popularised tensors in 1900 – continuing the earlier work of Bernhard Riemann, Elwin Bruno Christoffel, and others – as part of the &quot;absolute differential calculus&quot;. The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic differential geometry of a manifold in the form of the Riemann curvature tensor.

== Definition ==
Although seemingly different, the various approaches to defining tensors describe the same geometric concept using different language and at different levels of abstraction.

=== As multidimensional arrays ===
A tensor may be represented as a (potentially multidimensional) array. Just as a vector in an -dimensional space is represented by a one-dimensional array with components with respect to a given basis, any tensor with respect to a basis is represented by a multidimensional array. For example, a linear operator is represented in a basis as a two-dimensional square array. The numbers in the multidimensional array are known as the &quot;components&quot; of the tensor. They are denoted by indices giving their position in the array, as subscripts and superscripts, following the symbolic name of the tensor. For example, the components of an order tensor could be denoted  , where and are indices running from to , or also by . Whether an index is displayed as a superscript or subscript depends on the transformation properties of the tensor, described below. Thus while and can both be expressed as &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices, and are numerically related via index juggling, the difference in their transformation laws indicates it would be improper to add them together.

The total number of indices () required to identify each component uniquely is equal to the &quot;dimension&quot; or the number of &quot;ways&quot; of an array, which is why a tensor is sometimes referred to as an -dimensional array or an -way array. The total number of indices is also called the &quot;order&quot;, &quot;degree&quot; or &quot;rank&quot; of a tensor, although the term &quot;rank&quot; generally has another meaning in the context of matrices and tensors.

Just as the components of a vector change when we change the basis of the vector space, the components of a tensor also change under such a transformation. Each type of tensor comes equipped with a &quot;transformation law&quot; that details how the components of the tensor respond to a change of basis. The components of a vector can respond in two distinct ways to a change of basis (see &quot;Covariance and contravariance of vectors&quot;), where the new basis vectors formula_1 are expressed in terms of the old basis vectors formula_2 as,
:formula_3

Here &quot;R&quot;&quot; j&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the entries of the change of basis matrix, and in the rightmost expression the summation sign was suppressed: this is the Einstein summation convention, which will be used throughout this article. The components &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; of a column vector v transform with the inverse of the matrix &quot;R&quot;,
:formula_4

where the hat denotes the components in the new basis. This is called a &quot;contravariant&quot; transformation law, because the vector components transform by the &quot;inverse&quot; of the change of basis. In contrast, the components, &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot;, of a covector (or row vector), w, transform with the matrix &quot;R&quot; itself,
:formula_5

This is called a &quot;covariant&quot; transformation law, because the covector components transform by the &quot;same matrix&quot; as the change of basis matrix. The components of a more general tensor are transformed by some combination of covariant and contravariant transformations, with one transformation law for each index. If the transformation matrix of an index is the inverse matrix of the basis transformation, then the index is called &quot;contravariant&quot; and is conventionally denoted with an upper index (superscript). If the transformation matrix of an index is the basis transformation itself, then the index is called &quot;covariant&quot; and is denoted with a lower index (subscript).

As a simple example, the matrix of a linear operator with respect to a basis is a rectangular array formula_6 that transforms under a change of basis matrix formula_7 by formula_8. For the individual matrix entries, this transformation law has the form formula_9 so the tensor corresponding to the matrix of a linear operator has one covariant and one contravariant index: it is of type (1,1).

Combinations of covariant and contravariant components with the same index allow us to express geometric invariants. For example, the fact that a vector is the same object in different coordinate systems can be captured by the following equations, using the formulas defined above:

:formula_10,

where formula_11 is the Kronecker delta, which functions similarly to the identity matrix, and has the effect of renaming indices (&quot;j&quot; into &quot;k&quot; in this example). This shows several features of the component notation: the ability to re-arrange terms at will (commutativity), the need to use different indices when working with multiple objects in the same expression, the ability to rename indices, and the manner in which contravariant and covariant tensors combine so that all instances of the transformation matrix and its inverse cancel, so that expressions like formula_12 can immediately be seen to be geometrically identical in all coordinate systems.

Similarly, a linear operator, viewed as a geometric object, does not actually depend on a basis: it is just a linear map that accepts a vector as an argument and produces another vector. The transformation law for how the matrix of components of a linear operator changes with the basis is consistent with the transformation law for a contravariant vector, so that the action of a linear operator on a contravariant vector is represented in coordinates as the matrix product of their respective coordinate representations. That is, the components formula_13 are given by formula_14. These components transform contravariantly, since
:formula_15

The transformation law for an order tensor with &quot;p&quot; contravariant indices and &quot;q&quot; covariant indices is thus given as,
:formula_16 formula_17 formula_18

Here the primed indices denote components in the new coordinates, and the unprimed indices denote the components in the old coordinates. Such a tensor is said to be of order or &quot;type&quot; . The terms &quot;order&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;rank&quot;, &quot;valence&quot;, and &quot;degree&quot; are all sometimes used for the same concept. Here, the term &quot;order&quot; or &quot;total order&quot; will be used for the total dimension of the array (or its generalization in other definitions), in the preceding example, and the term &quot;type&quot; for the pair giving the number of contravariant and covariant indices. A tensor of type is also called a -tensor for short.

This discussion motivates the following formal definition:

[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;
to each basis of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space such that, if we apply the change of basis
:formula_19
then the multidimensional array obeys the transformation law
:formula_20 formula_21 formula_22

The definition of a tensor as a multidimensional array satisfying a transformation law traces back to the work of Ricci.

An equivalent definition of a tensor uses the representations of the general linear group. There is an action of the general linear group on the set of all ordered bases of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space. If formula_23 is an ordered basis, and formula_24 is an invertible formula_25 matrix, then the action is given by
:formula_26

Let &quot;F&quot; be the set of all ordered bases. Then &quot;F&quot; is a principal homogeneous space for GL(&quot;n&quot;). Let &quot;W&quot; be a vector space and let formula_27 be a representation of GL(&quot;n&quot;) on &quot;W&quot; (that is, a group homomorphism formula_28). Then a tensor of type formula_27 is an equivariant map formula_30. Equivariance here means that
:formula_31

When formula_27 is a tensor representation of the general linear group, this gives the usual definition of tensors as multidimensional arrays. This definition is often used to describe tensors on manifolds, and readily generalizes to other groups.

=== As multilinear maps ===

A downside to the definition of a tensor using the multidimensional array approach is that it is not apparent from the definition that the defined object is indeed basis independent, as is expected from an intrinsically geometric object. Although it is possible to show that transformation laws indeed ensure independence from the basis, sometimes a more intrinsic definition is preferred. One approach that is common in differential geometry is to define tensors relative to a fixed (finite-dimensional) vector space &quot;V&quot;, which is usually taken to be a particular vector space of some geometrical significance like the tangent space to a manifold. In this approach, a type tensor &quot;T&quot; is defined as a multilinear map,
:formula_33

where &quot;V&quot;∗ is the corresponding dual space of covectors, which is linear in each of its arguments. The above assumes &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over the real numbers, . More generally, &quot;V&quot; can be taken over any field &quot;F&quot; (e.g. the complex numbers), with &quot;F&quot; replacing as the codomain of the multilinear maps.

By applying a multilinear map &quot;T&quot; of type to a basis {e&quot;j&quot;} for &quot;V&quot; and a canonical cobasis {ε&quot;i&quot;} for &quot;V&quot;∗,
:formula_34

a -dimensional array of components can be obtained. A different choice of basis will yield different components. But, because &quot;T&quot; is linear in all of its arguments, the components satisfy the tensor transformation law used in the multilinear array definition. The multidimensional array of components of &quot;T&quot; thus form a tensor according to that definition. Moreover, such an array can be realized as the components of some multilinear map &quot;T&quot;. This motivates viewing multilinear maps as the intrinsic objects underlying tensors.

In viewing a tensor as a multilinear map, it is conventional to identify the double dual &quot;V&quot;∗∗ of the vector space &quot;V&quot;, i.e., the space of linear functionals on the dual vector space &quot;V&quot;∗, with the vector space &quot;V&quot;. There is always a natural linear map from &quot;V&quot; to its double dual, given by evaluating a linear form in &quot;V&quot;∗ against a vector in &quot;V&quot;. This linear mapping is an isomorphism in finite dimensions, and it is often then expedient to identify &quot;V&quot; with its double dual.

=== Using tensor products ===

For some mathematical applications, a more abstract approach is sometimes useful. This can be achieved by defining tensors in terms of elements of tensor products of vector spaces, which in turn are defined through a universal property as explained here and here.

A type tensor is defined in this context as an element of the tensor product of vector spaces,
:formula_35

A basis of and basis of naturally induce a basis of the tensor product . The components of a tensor are the coefficients of the tensor with respect to the basis obtained from a basis for and its dual basis , i.e.
:formula_36

Using the properties of the tensor product, it can be shown that these components satisfy the transformation law for a type tensor. Moreover, the universal property of the tensor product gives a one-to-one correspondence between tensors defined in this way and tensors defined as multilinear maps.

This 1 to 1 correspondence can be achieved in the following way, because in the finite-dimensional case there exists a canonical isomorphism between a vector space and its double dual:

:formula_37

The last line is using the universal property of the tensor product, that there is a 1 to 1 correspondence between maps from formula_38 and formula_39.

Tensor products can be defined in great generality – for example, involving arbitrary modules over a ring. In principle, one could define a &quot;tensor&quot; simply to be an element of any tensor product. However, the mathematics literature usually reserves the term &quot;tensor&quot; for an element of a tensor product of any number of copies of a single vector space and its dual, as above.

=== Tensors in infinite dimensions ===
This discussion of tensors so far assumes finite dimensionality of the spaces involved, where the spaces of tensors obtained by each of these constructions are naturally isomorphic. Constructions of spaces of tensors based on the tensor product and multilinear mappings can be generalized, essentially without modification, to vector bundles or coherent sheaves. For infinite-dimensional vector spaces, inequivalent topologies lead to inequivalent notions of tensor, and these various isomorphisms may or may not hold depending on what exactly is meant by a tensor (see topological tensor product). In some applications, it is the tensor product of Hilbert spaces that is intended, whose properties are the most similar to the finite-dimensional case. A more modern view is that it is the tensors&#x27; structure as a symmetric monoidal category that encodes their most important properties, rather than the specific models of those categories.

=== Tensor fields ===

In many applications, especially in differential geometry and physics, it is natural to consider a tensor with components that are functions of the point in a space. This was the setting of Ricci&#x27;s original work. In modern mathematical terminology such an object is called a tensor field, often referred to simply as a tensor.

In this context, a coordinate basis is often chosen for the tangent vector space. The transformation law may then be expressed in terms of partial derivatives of the coordinate functions,
:formula_40

defining a coordinate transformation,
:formula_41

== History ==
The concepts of later tensor analysis arose from the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss in differential geometry, and the formulation was much influenced by the theory of algebraic forms and invariants developed during the middle of the nineteenth century. The word &quot;tensor&quot; itself was introduced in 1846 by William Rowan Hamilton to describe something different from what is now meant by a tensor. Gibbs introduced dyadics and polyadic algebra, which are also tensors in the modern sense. The contemporary usage was introduced by Woldemar Voigt in 1898.

Tensor calculus was developed around 1890 by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro under the title &quot;absolute differential calculus&quot;, and originally presented in 1892. It was made accessible to many mathematicians by the publication of Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita&#x27;s 1900 classic text &quot;Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications&quot; (Methods of absolute differential calculus and their applications). In Ricci&#x27;s notation, he refers to &quot;systems&quot; with covariant and contravariant components, which are known as tensor fields in the modern sense.

In the 20th century, the subject came to be known as &quot;tensor analysis&quot;, and achieved broader acceptance with the introduction of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, around 1915. General relativity is formulated completely in the language of tensors. Einstein had learned about them, with great difficulty, from the geometer Marcel Grossmann. Levi-Civita then initiated a correspondence with Einstein to correct mistakes Einstein had made in his use of tensor analysis. The correspondence lasted 1915–17, and was characterized by mutual respect:

Tensors and tensor fields were also found to be useful in other fields such as continuum mechanics. Some well-known examples of tensors in differential geometry are quadratic forms such as metric tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor. The exterior algebra of Hermann Grassmann, from the middle of the nineteenth century, is itself a tensor theory, and highly geometric, but it was some time before it was seen, with the theory of differential forms, as naturally unified with tensor calculus. The work of Élie Cartan made differential forms one of the basic kinds of tensors used in mathematics, and Hassler Whitney popularized the tensor product.

From about the 1920s onwards, it was realised that tensors play a basic role in algebraic topology (for example in the Künneth theorem). Correspondingly there are types of tensors at work in many branches of abstract algebra, particularly in homological algebra and representation theory. Multilinear algebra can be developed in greater generality than for scalars coming from a field. For example, scalars can come from a ring. But the theory is then less geometric and computations more technical and less algorithmic. Tensors are generalized within category theory by means of the concept of monoidal category, from the 1960s.

== Examples ==

An elementary example of a mapping describable as a tensor is the dot product, which maps two vectors to a scalar. A more complex example is the Cauchy stress tensor T, which takes a directional unit vector v as input and maps it to the stress vector T(v), which is the force (per unit area) exerted by material on the negative side of the plane orthogonal to v against the material on the positive side of the plane, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). The cross product, where two vectors are mapped to a third one, is strictly speaking not a tensor because it changes its sign under those transformations that change the orientation of the coordinate system. The totally anti-symmetric symbol formula_42 nevertheless allows a convenient handling of the cross product in equally oriented three dimensional coordinate systems.

This table shows important examples of tensors on vector spaces and tensor fields on manifolds. The tensors are classified according to their type , where &quot;n&quot; is the number of contravariant indices, &quot;m&quot; is the number of covariant indices, and gives the total order of the tensor. For example, a bilinear form is the same thing as a -tensor; an inner product is an example of a -tensor, but not all -tensors are inner products. In the -entry of the table, &quot;M&quot; denotes the dimensionality of the underlying vector space or manifold because for each dimension of the space, a separate index is needed to select that dimension to get a maximally covariant antisymmetric tensor.

Raising an index on an -tensor produces an -tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally down and to the left on the table. Symmetrically, lowering an index corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the right on the table. Contraction of an upper with a lower index of an -tensor produces an -tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the left on the table.


== Properties ==
Assuming a basis of a real vector space, e.g., a coordinate frame in the ambient space, a tensor can be represented as an organized multidimensional array of numerical values with respect to this specific basis. Changing the basis transforms the values in the array in a characteristic way that allows to &quot;define&quot; tensors as objects adhering to this transformational behavior. For example, there are invariants of tensors that must be preserved under any change of the basis, thereby making only certain multidimensional arrays of numbers a tensor. Compare this to the array representing formula_43 not being a tensor, for the sign change under transformations changing the orientation.

Because the components of vectors and their duals transform differently under the change of their dual bases, there is a covariant and/or contravariant transformation law that relates the arrays, which represent the tensor with respect to one basis and that with respect to the other one. The numbers of, respectively, (contravariant indices) and dual (covariant indices) in the input and output of a tensor determine the &quot;type&quot; (or &quot;valence&quot;) of the tensor, a pair of natural numbers , which determine the precise form of the transformation law. The &quot;&quot; of a tensor is the sum of these two numbers.

The order (also &quot;degree&quot; or &quot;&quot;) of a tensor is thus the sum of the orders of its arguments plus the order of the resulting tensor. This is also the dimensionality of the array of numbers needed to represent the tensor with respect to a specific basis, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label each component in that array. For example, in a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array), and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor. A simple vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array, and is therefore a 1st-order tensor. Scalars are simple numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. This way the tensor representing the scalar product, taking two vectors and resulting in a scalar has order , the same as the stress tensor, taking one vector and returning another . The mapping two vectors to one vector, would have order 

The collection of tensors on a vector space and its dual forms a tensor algebra, which allows products of arbitrary tensors. Simple applications of tensors of order , which can be represented as a square matrix, can be solved by clever arrangement of transposed vectors and by applying the rules of matrix multiplication, but the tensor product should not be confused with this.

== Notation ==

There are several notational systems that are used to describe tensors and perform calculations involving them.

=== Ricci calculus ===

Ricci calculus is the modern formalism and notation for tensor indices: indicating inner and outer products, covariance and contravariance, summations of tensor components, symmetry and antisymmetry, and partial and covariant derivatives.

=== Einstein summation convention ===

The Einstein summation convention dispenses with writing summation signs, leaving the summation implicit. Any repeated index symbol is summed over: if the index is used twice in a given term of a tensor expression, it means that the term is to be summed for all . Several distinct pairs of indices may be summed this way.

=== Penrose graphical notation ===

Penrose graphical notation is a diagrammatic notation which replaces the symbols for tensors with shapes, and their indices by lines and curves. It is independent of basis elements, and requires no symbols for the indices.

=== Abstract index notation ===

The abstract index notation is a way to write tensors such that the indices are no longer thought of as numerical, but rather are indeterminates. This notation captures the expressiveness of indices and the basis-independence of index-free notation.

=== Component-free notation ===

A component-free treatment of tensors uses notation that emphasises that tensors do not rely on any basis, and is defined in terms of the tensor product of vector spaces.

== Operations ==
There are several operations on tensors that again produce a tensor. The linear nature of tensor implies that two tensors of the same type may be added together, and that tensors may be multiplied by a scalar with results analogous to the scaling of a vector. On components, these operations are simply performed component-wise. These operations do not change the type of the tensor; but there are also operations that produce a tensor of different type.

=== Tensor product ===
The tensor product takes two tensors, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, and produces a new tensor, , whose order is the sum of the orders of the original tensors. When described as multilinear maps, the tensor product simply multiplies the two tensors, i.e.,
formula_44
which again produces a map that is linear in all its arguments. On components, the effect is to multiply the components of the two input tensors pairwise, i.e.,
formula_45
If is of type and is of type , then the tensor product has type .

=== Contraction ===
Tensor contraction is an operation that reduces a type tensor to a type tensor, of which the trace is a special case. It thereby reduces the total order of a tensor by two. The operation is achieved by summing components for which one specified contravariant index is the same as one specified covariant index to produce a new component. Components for which those two indices are different are discarded. For example, a -tensor formula_46 can be contracted to a scalar through formula_47, where the summation is again implied. When the -tensor is interpreted as a linear map, this operation is known as the trace.

The contraction is often used in conjunction with the tensor product to contract an index from each tensor.

The contraction can also be understood using the definition of a tensor as an element of a tensor product of copies of the space &quot;V&quot; with the space &quot;V&quot;∗ by first decomposing the tensor into a linear combination of simple tensors, and then applying a factor from &quot;V&quot;∗ to a factor from &quot;V&quot;. For example, a tensor formula_48 can be written as a linear combination
:formula_49

The contraction of &quot;T&quot; on the first and last slots is then the vector
:formula_50

In a vector space with an inner product (also known as a metric) &quot;g&quot;, the term contraction is used for removing two contravariant or two covariant indices by forming a trace with the metric tensor or its inverse. For example, a -tensor formula_51 can be contracted to a scalar through formula_52 (yet again assuming the summation convention).

=== Raising or lowering an index ===

When a vector space is equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form (or &quot;metric tensor&quot; as it is often called in this context), operations can be defined that convert a contravariant (upper) index into a covariant (lower) index and vice versa. A metric tensor is a (symmetric) (-tensor; it is thus possible to contract an upper index of a tensor with one of the lower indices of the metric tensor in the product. This produces a new tensor with the same index structure as the previous tensor, but with lower index generally shown in the same position of the contracted upper index. This operation is quite graphically known as &quot;lowering an index&quot;.

Conversely, the inverse operation can be defined, and is called &quot;raising an index&quot;. This is equivalent to a similar contraction on the product with a -tensor. This &quot;inverse metric tensor&quot; has components that are the matrix inverse of those of the metric tensor.

== Applications ==

=== Continuum mechanics ===

Important examples are provided by continuum mechanics. The stresses inside a solid body or fluid are described by a tensor field. The stress tensor and strain tensor are both second-order tensor fields, and are related in a general linear elastic material by a fourth-order elasticity tensor field. In detail, the tensor quantifying stress in a 3-dimensional solid object has components that can be conveniently represented as a 3 × 3 array. The three faces of a cube-shaped infinitesimal volume segment of the solid are each subject to some given force. The force&#x27;s vector components are also three in number. Thus, 3 × 3, or 9 components are required to describe the stress at this cube-shaped infinitesimal segment. Within the bounds of this solid is a whole mass of varying stress quantities, each requiring 9 quantities to describe. Thus, a second-order tensor is needed.

If a particular surface element inside the material is singled out, the material on one side of the surface will apply a force on the other side. In general, this force will not be orthogonal to the surface, but it will depend on the orientation of the surface in a linear manner. This is described by a tensor of type, in linear elasticity, or more precisely by a tensor field of type , since the stresses may vary from point to point.

=== Other examples from physics ===
Common applications include:
* Electromagnetic tensor (or Faraday tensor) in electromagnetism
* Finite deformation tensors for describing deformations and strain tensor for strain in continuum mechanics
* Permittivity and electric susceptibility are tensors in anisotropic media
* Four-tensors in general relativity (e.g. stress–energy tensor), used to represent momentum fluxes
* Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum angular momentum operator in spherical coordinates
* Diffusion tensors, the basis of diffusion tensor imaging, represent rates of diffusion in biological environments
* Quantum mechanics and quantum computing utilize tensor products for combination of quantum states

===Computer vision and optics===
The concept of a tensor of order two is often conflated with that of a matrix. Tensors of higher order do however capture ideas important in science and engineering, as has been shown successively in numerous areas as they develop. This happens, for instance, in the field of computer vision, with the trifocal tensor generalizing the fundamental matrix.

The field of nonlinear optics studies the changes to material polarization density under extreme electric fields. The polarization waves generated are related to the generating electric fields through the nonlinear susceptibility tensor. If the polarization P is not linearly proportional to the electric field E, the medium is termed &quot;nonlinear&quot;. To a good approximation (for sufficiently weak fields, assuming no permanent dipole moments are present), P is given by a Taylor series in E whose coefficients are the nonlinear susceptibilities:

:formula_53

Here formula_54 is the linear susceptibility, formula_55 gives the Pockels effect and second harmonic generation, and formula_56 gives the Kerr effect. This expansion shows the way higher-order tensors arise naturally in the subject matter.

===Machine learning===
The properties of tensors, especially tensor decomposition, have enabled their use in machine learning to embed higher dimensional data in artificial neural networks. This notion of tensor differs significantly from that in other areas of mathematics and physics, in the sense that a tensor is usually regarded as a numerical quantity in a fixed basis, and the dimension of the spaces along the different axes of the tensor need not be the same.

== Generalizations ==

=== Tensor products of vector spaces ===
The vector spaces of a tensor product need not be the same, and sometimes the elements of such a more general tensor product are called &quot;tensors&quot;. For example, an element of the tensor product space is a second-order &quot;tensor&quot; in this more general sense, and an order- tensor may likewise be defined as an element of a tensor product of different vector spaces. A type tensor, in the sense defined previously, is also a tensor of order in this more general sense. The concept of tensor product can be extended to arbitrary modules over a ring.

=== Tensors in infinite dimensions ===
The notion of a tensor can be generalized in a variety of ways to infinite dimensions. One, for instance, is via the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. Another way of generalizing the idea of tensor, common in nonlinear analysis, is via the multilinear maps definition where instead of using finite-dimensional vector spaces and their algebraic duals, one uses infinite-dimensional Banach spaces and their continuous dual. Tensors thus live naturally on Banach manifolds and Fréchet manifolds.

=== Tensor densities ===

Suppose that a homogeneous medium fills , so that the density of the medium is described by a single scalar value in . The mass, in kg, of a region is obtained by multiplying by the volume of the region , or equivalently integrating the constant over the region:
:formula_57

where the Cartesian coordinates , , are measured in . If the units of length are changed into , then the numerical values of the coordinate functions must be rescaled by a factor of 100:
:formula_58

The numerical value of the density must then also transform by to compensate, so that the numerical value of the mass in kg is still given by integral of formula_59. Thus formula_60 (in units of ).

More generally, if the Cartesian coordinates , , undergo a linear transformation, then the numerical value of the density must change by a factor of the reciprocal of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transformation, so that the integral remains invariant, by the change of variables formula for integration. Such a quantity that scales by the reciprocal of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition map is called a scalar density. To model a non-constant density, is a function of the variables , , (a scalar field), and under a curvilinear change of coordinates, it transforms by the reciprocal of the Jacobian of the coordinate change. For more on the intrinsic meaning, see &quot;Density on a manifold&quot;.

A tensor density transforms like a tensor under a coordinate change, except that it in addition picks up a factor of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition:
:formula_61

Here is called the weight. In general, any tensor multiplied by a power of this function or its absolute value is called a tensor density, or a weighted tensor. An example of a tensor density is the current density of electromagnetism.

Under an affine transformation of the coordinates, a tensor transforms by the linear part of the transformation itself (or its inverse) on each index. These come from the rational representations of the general linear group. But this is not quite the most general linear transformation law that such an object may have: tensor densities are non-rational, but are still semisimple representations. A further class of transformations come from the logarithmic representation of the general linear group, a reducible but not semisimple representation, consisting of an with the transformation law
:formula_62

=== Geometric objects ===
The transformation law for a tensor behaves as a functor on the category of admissible coordinate systems, under general linear transformations (or, other transformations within some class, such as local diffeomorphisms). This makes a tensor a special case of a geometrical object, in the technical sense that it is a function of the coordinate system transforming functorially under coordinate changes. Examples of objects obeying more general kinds of transformation laws are jets and, more generally still, natural bundles.

=== Spinors ===

When changing from one orthonormal basis (called a &quot;frame&quot;) to another by a rotation, the components of a tensor transform by that same rotation. This transformation does not depend on the path taken through the space of frames. However, the space of frames is not simply connected (see orientation entanglement and plate trick): there are continuous paths in the space of frames with the same beginning and ending configurations that are not deformable one into the other. It is possible to attach an additional discrete invariant to each frame that incorporates this path dependence, and which turns out (locally) to have values of ±1. A spinor is an object that transforms like a tensor under rotations in the frame, apart from a possible sign that is determined by the value of this discrete invariant.

Spinors are elements of the spin representation of the rotation group, while tensors are elements of its tensor representations. Other classical groups have tensor representations, and so also tensors that are compatible with the group, but all non-compact classical groups have infinite-dimensional unitary representations as well.

<doc id="29967" wikidata="Q155814" url="?curid=29967" title="Tarragon">
<text>Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus), also known as estragon, is a species of perennial herb in the family Asteraceae. It is widespread in the wild across much of Eurasia and North America and is cultivated for culinary and medicinal purposes.

One subspecies, &quot;Artemisia dracunculus&quot; var. &quot;sativa&quot;, is cultivated to use the leaves as an aromatic culinary herb. In some other subspecies, the characteristic aroma is largely absent. Informal names for distinguishing the variations include &quot;French tarragon&quot; (best for culinary use) and &quot;Russian tarragon&quot;.

Tarragon grows to tall, with slender branches. The leaves are lanceolate, long and broad, glossy green, with an entire margin. The flowers are produced in small capitula diameter, each capitulum containing up to 40 yellow or greenish-yellow florets. French tarragon, however, seldom produces any flowers (or seeds). Some tarragon plants produce seeds that are generally sterile. Others produce viable seeds. Tarragon has rhizomatous roots that it uses to spread and readily reproduce.

==Cultivation==
French tarragon is the variety used for cooking in the kitchen and is not grown from seed, as the flowers are sterile; instead, it is propagated by root division.

Russian tarragon (&quot;A. dracunculoides&quot; L.) can be grown from seed but is much weaker in flavor when compared to the French variety. However, Russian tarragon is a far more hardy and vigorous plant, spreading at the roots and growing over a meter tall. This tarragon actually prefers poor soils and happily tolerates drought and neglect. It is not as intensely aromatic and flavorsome as its French cousin, but it produces many more leaves from early spring onwards that are mild and good in salads and cooked food. Russian tarragon loses what flavor it has as it ages and is widely considered useless as a culinary herb, though it is sometimes used in crafts. The young stems in early spring can be cooked as an asparagus substitute. Horticulturists recommend that Russian tarragon be grown indoors from seed and planted in summer. The spreading plants can be divided easily.

A better substitute for Russian tarragon is Mexican tarragon (&quot;Tagetes lucida&quot;), also known as Mexican mint marigold, Texas tarragon, or winter tarragon. It is much more reminiscent of French tarragon, with a hint of anise. Although not in the same genus as the other tarragons, Mexican tarragon has a more robust flavor than Russian tarragon that does not diminish significantly with age. It can not however be grown as a perennial in cold climates.
==Health==
Tarragon has a flavor and odor profile reminiscent of anise due largely to the presence of estragole, a known carcinogen and teratogen in mice. Estragole concentration in fresh tarragon leaves is about 2900 mg/kg. However, a European Union investigation concluded that the danger of estragole is minimal. Research studying rat livers found a BMDL10 (Approximately the dose that would cause a 10% increase in background tumor rate) of estragole to be 3.3–6.5 mg/kg body weight per day, which for a 80 kg human would be ~400 mg per day, or 130 g of fresh tarragon leaves per day. As used as a culinary herb, a typical quantity used in a dish could be 5 g of fresh leaves. Estragole, along with other oils that provide tarragon its flavor, are highly volatile and will vaporise as the leaf is dried, reducing both the health risk and the useability of the herb.

Several other herbs, such as basil, also contain estragole.

==Uses==
===Culinary use===
In Syria, fresh tarragon is eaten with white Syrian cheese, and also used with dishes such as shish barak and kibbeh labaniyeh.

In Iran, tarragon is used as a side dish in sabzi khordan(fresh herbs), or in stews and Persian-style pickles, particularly khiar shoor (pickled cucumbers). 

Tarragon is one of the four &quot;fines herbes&quot; of French cooking and is particularly suitable for chicken, fish, and egg dishes. Tarragon is the main flavoring component of Béarnaise sauce. Fresh, lightly bruised tarragon sprigs are steeped in vinegar to produce tarragon vinegar. Pounded with butter, it produces an excellent topping for grilled salmon or beef.

Tarragon is used to flavor a popular carbonated soft drink in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia (where it originally comes from), and, by extension, Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The drink, named Tarkhun, is made out of sugar, carbonated water, and tarragon leaves which give it its signature green color.

Tarragon is one of the main ingredients in Chakapuli, a Georgian national dish.

In Slovenia, tarragon is used in a variation of the traditional nut roll sweet cake, called &quot;potica&quot;. In Hungary, a popular chicken soup is flavored with tarragon.

==Chemistry==
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis has revealed that &quot;A. dracunculus&quot; oil contains predominantly phenylpropanoids such as estragole (16.2%), methyl eugenol (35.8%), and &quot;trans&quot;-anethole (21.1%). The other major constituents were terpenes and terpenoids, including α-&quot;trans&quot;-ocimene (20.6%), limonene (12.4%), α-pinene (5.1%), &quot;allo&quot;-ocimene (4.8%), methyl eugenol (2.2%), β-pinene (0.8%), α-terpinolene (0.5%), bornyl acetate (0.5%) and bicyclogermacrene (0.5%). The organic compound capillin was initially isolated from &quot;Artemisia capillaris&quot; in 1956.

&quot;cis&quot;-Pellitorin, an isobutyramide eliciting a pungent taste, has been isolated from the tarragon plant.

==Name==
The plant is commonly known as in Swedish and Dutch. The use of for the herb or plant in German is outdated. The species name, , means &quot;little dragon&quot;, and the plant seems to be so named due to its coiled roots. See &quot;Artemisia&quot; for the genus name derivative.

<doc id="29968" wikidata="Q3215980" url="?curid=29968" title="Thyme">
<text>Thyme () is a culinary herb consisting of the dried aerial parts of some members of the genus &quot;Thymus&quot; of flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae. Thymes are native to Eurasia and north Africa. Thymes have culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses. The species most commonly cultivated and used for culinary purposes is &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot;, native to Southeast Europe.

== History ==

Wild thyme grows in the Levant, where it might have been first cultivated. Ancient Egyptians used common thyme (&quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot;) for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burnt it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage.

The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to &quot;give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs&quot;. In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares. In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, as it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, as it was supposed to assure passage into the next life.

The name of the genus of fish &quot;Thymallus&quot;, first given to the grayling (&quot;T. thymallus&quot;, described in the 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus), originates from the faint smell of thyme that emanates from the flesh.

== Cultivation ==
Thyme is best cultivated in a hot, sunny location with well-drained soil. It is generally planted in the spring, and thereafter grows as a perennial. It can be propagated by seed, cuttings, or dividing rooted sections of the plant. It tolerates drought well. It can be pruned after flowering to keep from getting woody.

== Culinary use ==

In some Levantine countries, the condiment &quot;za&#x27;atar&quot; (Arabic for both thyme and marjoram) contains many of the essential oils found in thyme. Thyme is a common component of the &quot;bouquet garni&quot;, and of &quot;herbes de Provence&quot;.

Thyme is sold both fresh and dried. While summer-seasonal, fresh greenhouse thyme is often available year-round. The fresh form is more flavourful but also less convenient; storage life is rarely more than a week. However, the fresh form can last many months if carefully frozen, and thyme retains its flavour on drying better than many other herbs.

Fresh thyme is commonly sold in bunches of sprigs. A sprig is a single stem snipped from the plant. It is composed of a woody stem with paired leaf or flower clusters (&quot;leaves&quot;) spaced apart. A recipe may measure thyme by the bunch (or fraction thereof), or by the sprig, or by the tablespoon or teaspoon. Dried thyme is widely used in Armenia in tisanes.

Depending on how it is used in a dish, the whole sprig may be used, or the leaves removed and the stems discarded. Usually, when a recipe mentions a bunch or sprig, it means the whole form; when it mentions spoons, it means the leaves. It is perfectly acceptable to substitute dried for whole thyme. Leaves may be removed from stems either by scraping with the back of a knife, or by pulling through the fingers or tines of a fork.

In Moroccan tradition, dried figs are elevated with the infusion of minty leaves. After softening in a couscous pot, the figs are rested with additional minty leaves before being sprinkled with thyme for a delightful flavor enhancement and preservation in sealed containers.

== Chemical and antimicrobial properties ==
The chemical composition of &quot;Thymus&quot; (thyme) includes a variety of essential oils, flavonoids, phenolic acids, triterpenes, and other compounds. The essential oils found in thyme include thymol, which is a major component responsible for the plant&#x27;s antiseptic properties, and carvacrol, another primary component with similar functions. Other essential oils present are p-cymene, γ-terpinene, linalool, and 1,8-cineole. Gas chromatographic analysis reveals that the most abundant volatile component of thyme leaves is thymol, at 8.55mg/g. Other components are carvacrol, linalool, α-terpineol, and 1,8-cineole.

Some of these compounds have beneficial properties. In particular, thymol has been historically used as an antibiotic and antiseptic, especially in traditional medicine. Oil of thyme, the essential oil of common thyme, contains 20–54% thymol. Thymol is an active ingredient in various commercially produced mouthwashes, such as Listerine.

Flavonoids in thyme include luteolin-7-O-glucoside, a glycoside known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as apigenin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, which is known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, along with caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, are also present in thyme.

Triterpenes, such as oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, are part of thyme&#x27;s composition, contributing to its overall health benefits. Additionally, thyme contains tannins, which contribute to its astringent properties, as well as saponins and other minor compounds.

== Important species and cultivars ==
* &quot;Thymus citriodorus&quot; – various lemon thymes, orange thymes, lime thyme
* &quot;Thymus herba-barona&quot; (caraway thyme) is used both as a culinary herb and a ground cover, and has a very strong caraway scent due to the chemical carvone.
* &quot;Thymus praecox&quot; (mother of thyme, wild thyme), is cultivated as an ornamental, but is in Iceland also gathered as a wild herb for cooking, and drunk as a warm infusion.
* &quot;Thymus pseudolanuginosus&quot; (woolly thyme) is not a culinary herb, but is grown as a ground cover.
* &quot;Thymus serpyllum&quot; (wild thyme, creeping thyme) is an important nectar source plant for honeybees. All thyme species are nectar sources, but wild thyme covers large areas of droughty, rocky soils in southern Europe (both Greece and Malta are especially famous for wild thyme honey) and North Africa, as well as in similar landscapes in the Berkshire and Catskill Mountains of the northeastern US. The lowest growing of the widely used thyme is good for walkways. It is also an important caterpillar food plant for large and common blue butterflies.
* &quot;Thymus vulgaris&quot; (common thyme, English thyme, summer thyme, winter thyme, French thyme, or garden thyme) is a commonly used culinary herb. It also has medicinal uses. Common thyme is a Mediterranean perennial which is best suited to well-drained soils and full sun.

<text>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of south-western China and northern Myanmar. Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of &quot;Camellia taliensis&quot;. After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.

An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician Hua Tuo. It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India.

The term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;. They are the infusions of fruit, leaves, or other plant parts, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These may be called &quot;tisanes&quot; or &quot;herbal infusions&quot; to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the various words for &quot;tea&quot; reflects the history of transmission of tea drinking culture and trade from China to countries around the world. Nearly all of the words for tea worldwide fall into three broad groups: &quot;te&quot;, &quot;cha&quot; and &quot;chai&quot;, present in English as &quot;tea&quot;, &quot;cha&quot; or &quot;char&quot;, and &quot;chai&quot;. The earliest of the three to enter English is &quot;cha&quot;, which came in the 1590s via the Portuguese, who traded in Macao and picked up the Cantonese pronunciation of the word. The more common &quot;tea&quot; form arrived in the 17th century via the Dutch, who acquired it either indirectly from the Malay &quot;teh&quot;, or directly from the &quot;tê&quot; pronunciation in Min Chinese. The third form &quot;chai&quot; (meaning &quot;spiced tea&quot;) originated from a northern Chinese pronunciation of &quot;cha&quot;, which travelled overland to Central Asia and Persia where it picked up a Persian ending &quot;yi&quot;. The Chinese word for tea itself was likely ultimately derived from the non-Sinitic languages of the botanical homeland of the tea plant in southwest China (or Burma), possibly from an archaic Austro-Asiatic root word *&quot;la&quot;, meaning &quot;leaf&quot;.

== Origin and history ==

===Botanical origin===

Tea plants are native to East Asia and the probable center of origin of tea is near the source of the Irrawaddy River from where it spread out fan-wise into southeast China, Indo-China and Assam. Thus, the natural home of the tea plant is considered to be within the comparatively small fan-shaped area between Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram along the Burma frontier in the west, through China as far as the Zhejiang Province in the east, and from this line generally south through the hills to Burma and Thailand to Vietnam. The west–east axis indicated above is about 2,400 km long extending from longitude 95°-120°E. The north–south axis covers about 1,920 km, starting from the northern part of Burma, latitude 29°N passing through Yunnan, Tongkin, Thailand, Laos and on to Annan, reaching latitude 11°N.

Chinese (small-leaf) type tea (&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot;) may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. However, since there are no known wild populations of this tea, its origin is speculative.

Given their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam-type tea (&quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;) may have two different parentages – one being found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu&#x27;er City) and the other in western Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan Assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species &quot;Camellia taliensis&quot;. Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam-type tea (also &quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot;). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species &quot;Camellia pubicosta&quot;.

Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small-leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago, while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. The divergence of Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam tea would correspond to the last glacial maximum.

===Early tea drinking===
People in ancient East Asia ate tea for centuries, perhaps even millennia, before ever consuming it as a beverage. They would nibble on the leaves raw, add them to soups or greens, or ferment them and chew them as areca nut is chewed.

Tea drinking may have begun in the region of Yunnan, where it was used for medicinal purposes. It is believed that in Sichuan, &quot;people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction.&quot;

Chinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical Shennong (in central and northern China) in 2737 BC, although evidence suggests that tea drinking may have been introduced from the southwest of China (Sichuan/Yunnan area). The earliest written records of tea come from China. The word &quot;tú&quot; appears in the &quot;Shijing&quot; and other ancient texts to signify a kind of &quot;bitter vegetable&quot; (), and it is possible that it referred to many different plants such as sow thistle, chicory, or smartweed, as well as tea. In the &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;, it was recorded that the Ba people in Sichuan presented &quot;tu&quot; to the Zhou king. The Qin later conquered the state of Ba and its neighbour Shu, and according to the 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu who wrote in &quot;Ri Zhi Lu&quot; (): &quot;It was after the Qin had taken Shu that they learned how to drink tea.&quot; Another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the Qin dynasty general Liu Kun who requested that some &quot;real tea&quot; to be sent to him.

The earliest known physical evidence of tea was discovered in 2016 in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi&#x27;an, indicating that tea from the genus &quot;Camellia&quot; was drunk by Han dynasty emperors as early as the second century BC. The Han dynasty work &quot;The Contract for a Youth&quot;, written by Wang Bao in 59 BC, contains the first known reference to boiling tea. Among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth, the contract states that &quot;he shall boil tea and fill the utensils&quot; and &quot;he shall buy tea at Wuyang&quot;. The first record of tea cultivation is dated to this period, during which tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain () near Chengdu. Another early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text by the Chinese physician Hua Tuo, who stated, &quot;to drink bitter t&#x27;u constantly makes one think better.&quot; However, before the Tang dynasty, tea-drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice centered in Jiankang. Tea was disdained by the Northern dynasties aristocrats, who describe it as inferior to yogurt. It became widely popular during the Tang dynasty, when it spread to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot;, a treatise on tea and its preparations, was written by the 8th century Chinese writer, Lu Yu. He was known to have influenced tea drinking on a large part in China.

===Developments===
Through the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first stirred in a hot dry pan, then rolled and air-dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that would have turned the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves are allowed to partially oxidize before being heated in the pan, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently careless practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, which yielded a different flavour.

===Worldwide spread===

Tea was first introduced to Western priests and merchants in China during the 16th century, at which time it was termed &quot;chá&quot;. The earliest European reference to tea, written as &quot;chiai&quot;, came from &quot;Delle navigationi e viaggi&quot; written by Venetian Giambattista Ramusio in 1545. The first recorded shipment of tea by a European nation was in 1607 when the Dutch East India Company moved a cargo of tea from Macao to Java, then two years later, the Dutch bought the first assignment of tea which was from Hirado in Japan to be shipped to Europe. Tea became a fashionable drink in The Hague in the Netherlands, and the Dutch introduced the drink to Germany, France, and across the Atlantic to New Amsterdam (New York).

In 1567, Russian people came in contact with tea when the Cossack Atamans Petrov and Yalyshev visited China. The Mongolian Khan donated to Tsar Michael I four poods (65–70 kg) of tea in 1638. According to Jeremiah Curtin, it was possibly in 1636 that Vassili Starkov was sent as envoy to the Altyn Khan. He was given 250 pounds of tea as a gift to the tsar. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from China via camel caravan in exchange for furs. It is today considered the &quot;de facto&quot; national beverage.

The first record of tea in English came from a letter written by Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, writing to a merchant in Macao requesting &quot;the best sort of chaw&quot; in 1615. Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fujian in 1637, wrote, &quot;&quot;chaa&quot; – only water with a kind of herb boyled in it&quot;. Tea was sold in a coffee house in London in 1657, Samuel Pepys tasted tea in 1660, and Catherine of Braganza took the tea-drinking habit to the English court when she married Charles II in 1662. Tea, however, was not widely consumed in the British Isles until the 18th century and remained expensive until the latter part of that period. English drinkers preferred to add sugar and milk to black tea, and black tea overtook green tea in popularity in the 1720s. Tea smuggling during the 18th century led to the general public being able to afford and consume tea. The British government removed the tax on tea, thereby eliminating the smuggling trade, by 1785. In Britain and Ireland, tea was initially consumed as a luxury item on special occasions, such as religious festivals, wakes, and domestic work gatherings. The price of tea in Europe fell steadily during the 19th century, especially after Indian tea began to arrive in large quantities; by the late 19th century tea had become an everyday beverage for all levels of society. The popularity of tea played a role in historical events – the Tea Act of 1773 provoked the Boston Tea Party that escalated into the American Revolution. The need to address the issue of British trade deficit because of the trade in tea resulted in the Opium Wars. The Qing Kangxi Emperor had banned foreign products from being sold in China, decreeing in 1685 that all goods bought from China must be paid for in silver coin or bullion. Traders from other nations then sought to find another product, in this case opium, to sell to China to earn back the silver they were required to pay for tea and other commodities. The subsequent attempts by the Chinese Government to curtail the trade in opium led to war.

Chinese small-leaf-type tea was introduced into India in 1836 by the British in an attempt to break the Chinese monopoly on tea. In 1841, Archibald Campbell brought seeds of Chinese tea from the Kumaun region and experimented with planting tea in Darjeeling. The Alubari tea garden was opened in 1856, and Darjeeling tea began to be produced. In 1848, Robert Fortune was sent by the East India Company on a mission to China to bring the tea plant back to Great Britain. He began his journey in high secrecy as his mission occurred in the lull between the First Opium War and the Second Opium War. The Chinese tea plants he brought back were introduced to the Himalayas, though most did not survive. The British had discovered that a different variety of tea was endemic to Assam and the northeast region of India, which was then hybridized with Chinese small-leaf-type tea. Using Chinese planting and cultivation techniques, the British colonial government established a tea industry by offering land in Assam to any European who agreed to cultivate it for export. Tea was originally consumed only by Anglo-Indians; however, it became widely popular in India in the 1950s because of a successful advertising campaign by the India Tea Board. The British introduced tea industry to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1867.

== Chemical composition ==
Physically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. It is a solution of the water-soluble compounds extracted from the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols and amino acids. Tea infusions are among most consumed beverages globally.

Caffeine makes up about 3% of tea&#x27;s dry weight, which translates to between 30 and 90 milligrams per cup depending on the type, brand, and brewing method. A study found that the caffeine content of one gram of black tea ranged from 22 to 28 mg, while the caffeine content of one gram of green tea ranged from 11 to 20 mg, reflecting a significant difference. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline, which are xanthines and stimulants, similar to caffeine.

The astringency in tea can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols. These are the most abundant compounds in tea leaves, making up 30–40% of their composition. Polyphenols in tea include flavonoids, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and other catechins. Although there has been preliminary clinical research on whether green or black teas may protect against various human diseases, there is no evidence that tea polyphenols have any effect on health or lowering disease risk.

== Health effects ==

Although health benefits have been assumed throughout the history of &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;&#x27;s consumption, there is no high-quality evidence showing that tea consumption gives significant benefits other than possibly increasing alertness, an effect caused by caffeine in the tea leaves. In clinical research conducted in the early 21st century, it was found there is no scientific evidence to indicate that consuming tea affects any disease or improves health.

Black and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant amounts, with the exception of the dietary mineral manganese, at 0.5 mg per cup or 26% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI). Fluoride is sometimes present in tea; certain types of &quot;brick tea&quot;, made from old leaves and stems, have the highest levels, enough to pose a health risk if much tea is drunk, which has been attributed to high levels of fluoride in soils, acidic soils, and long brewing.

== Cultivation and harvesting ==


&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Some varieties can tolerate oceanic climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England, Perthshire in Scotland, Washington in the United States, and Vancouver Island in Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart in Tasmania and Waikato in New Zealand.

Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting. In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall per year and prefer acidic soils. Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour.

Two principal varieties are used: &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis,&quot; which is used for most Chinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, and &quot;C. sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica,&quot; used in Pu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical varieties, many strains and modern clonal varieties are known. Leaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with three primary classifications being: Assam type, characterised by the largest leaves; China type, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambodian-type tea (&quot;C. assamica&quot; subsp. &quot;lasiocaly&quot;) was originally considered a type of Assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam-type tea. Darjeeling tea appears to be a hybrid between Chinese small-leaf tea and Assam-type large-leaf tea.

A tea plant will grow into a tree of up to if left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are generally pruned to waist height for ease of plucking. The short plants bear more new shoots which provide new and tender leaves and increase the quality of the tea. Only the top of the mature plant are picked. These buds and leaves are called &#x27;flushes&#x27;. A plant will grow a new flush every 7 to 15 days during the growing season. Leaves that are slow in development tend to produce better-flavoured teas. Several teas are available from specified flushes; for example, Darjeeling tea is available as first flush (at a premium price), second flush, monsoon and autumn. Assam second flush or &quot;tippy&quot; tea is considered superior to first flush, because of the gold tips that appear on the leaves.

Pests that can afflict tea plants include mosquito bugs, genus &quot;Helopeltis&quot;, which are true bugs and not to be confused with dipterous insects of family &quot;Culicidae&quot; (&#x27;mosquitos&#x27;). Mosquito bugs can damage leaves both by sucking plant materials, and by the laying of eggs (oviposition) within the plant. Spraying with synthetic insecticides may be deemed appropriate. Other pests are Lepidopteran leaf feeders and various tea diseases.

== Production ==

Tea is mainly grown in Asia and Africa, with smaller areas in South America and around the Black and Caspian Seas. The four biggest tea-producing countries are China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka, together representing 81% of world tea production. Smaller hubs of production include such places as São Miguel Island, Azores, in Portugal, and Guria, in Georgia. In 2022, global production of tea was 29.8 million tonnes, led by China with 49% and India with 20% of the world total. Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Turkey were secondary producers.

=== Storage ===

Storage conditions determine the shelf life of tea; that of black teas is greater than that of green teas. Some, such as flower teas, may last only a month or so. Others, such as pu-erh, improve with age. To remain fresh and prevent mold, tea needs to be stored away from heat, light, air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room temperature in an air-tight container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually in less than a year. Tightly rolled gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed Chun Mee tea.

Storage life for all teas can be extended by using desiccant or oxygen-absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in air-tight containers (except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is recommended and temperature variation kept to a minimum).

=== Processing and classification ===

Tea is divided into categories based on how it is processed. At least six different types are produced:
* White: wilted and unoxidized;
* Yellow: unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow;
* Green: unwilted and unoxidized;
* Oolong: wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized;
* Black: wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called [&quot;hóngchá&quot;], &quot;red tea&quot; in Chinese and other East Asian tea culture);
* Post-fermented (Dark): green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost (called &quot;Pu&#x27;er&quot; if from the Yunnan district of South-Western China or [&quot;hēichá&quot;] &quot;black tea&quot; in Chinese tea culture).

After picking, the leaves of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless immediately dried. An enzymatic oxidation process triggered by the plant&#x27;s intracellular enzymes causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea unfit for consumption.

=== Blending and additives ===

After basic processing, teas may be altered through additional processing steps before being sold and is often consumed with additions to the basic tea leaf and water added during preparation or drinking. Examples of additional processing steps that occur before tea is sold are blending, flavouring, scenting, and decaffeination of teas. Examples of additions added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.

Tea blending is the combination of different teas together to achieve the final product. Such teas may combine others from the same cultivation area or several different ones. The aim is to obtain consistency, better taste, higher price, or some combination of the three.

Flavoured and scented teas are enhancements of the base tea. This can be accomplished through directly adding flavouring agents, such as ginger, cloves, mint leaves, cardamom, bergamot (found in Earl Grey), vanilla, and spearmint. Alternatively, because tea easily retains odours, it can be placed in proximity to an aromatic ingredient to absorb its aroma, as in traditional jasmine tea.

The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de Sévigné. Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas tend to be very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity. The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style milk tea is based on British habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea with milk or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries, and in Russia and Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea is traditionally served with a slice of lemon and is sweetened with either sugar or honey; tea with milk is called a &quot;bawarka&quot; (&quot;Bavarian style&quot;) in Polish and is widely popular. In Australia, tea with milk is known as &quot;white tea&quot;.

The order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic and can vary widely between cultures and individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk to the cup before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk to the cup after the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer, so the earlier milk is added, the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the &quot;European Heart Journal&quot; found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.

== Packaging ==

=== Tea bags ===

In 1907, American tea merchant Thomas Sullivan began distributing samples of his tea in small bags of silk with a drawstring. Consumers noticed they could simply leave the tea in the bag and reuse it with fresh tea. However, the potential of this distribution and packaging method would not be fully realised until later. During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953, after rationing in the UK ended, Yorkshire-based tea manufacturer Tetley launched the tea bag in the UK, and it was an immediate success.

The &quot;pyramid tea bag&quot; (or sachet), introduced by Lipton and PG Tips/Scottish Blend in 1996, attempts to address one of the connoisseurs&#x27; arguments against paper tea bags by way of its three-dimensional tetrahedron shape, which allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. However, some types of pyramid tea bags have been criticised as being environmentally unfriendly, since their synthetic material is not as biodegradable as loose tea leaves and paper tea bags.

=== Loose tea ===

The tea leaves are packaged loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container such as a tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are vacuum-packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea is individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavour control at the expense of convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.

=== Compressed tea ===
Tea bricks or compressed tea are produced for convenience in transport, storage, and ageing. It can usually be stored longer without spoilage than loose leaf tea. Compressed tea is prepared by loosening leaves from the cake using a small knife, and steeping the extracted pieces in water. During the Tang dynasty, as described by Lu Yu, compressed tea was ground into a powder, combined with hot water, and ladled into bowls, resulting in a &quot;frothy&quot; mixture. In the Song dynasty, the tea powder would instead be whisked with hot water in the bowl. Although no longer practiced in China today, the whisking method of preparing powdered tea was transmitted to Japan by Zen Buddhist monks, and is still used to prepare matcha in the Japanese tea ceremony. Chinese pu-erh is often distributed in the form, as other teas may sometimes be.

Compressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty. By the beginning of the Ming dynasty, it had been displaced by loose-leaf tea. It remains popular, however, in the Himalayan countries and Mongolian steppes. In Mongolia, tea bricks were ubiquitous enough to be used as a form of currency. Among Himalayan peoples, compressed tea is consumed by combining it with yak butter and salt to produce butter tea.

=== Instant tea ===

&quot;Instant tea&quot;, similar to freeze-dried instant coffee and an alternative to brewed tea, can be consumed either hot or cold. Instant tea was developed in the 1930s, with Nestlé introducing the first commercial product in 1946, while Redi-Tea debuted instant iced tea in 1953. Additives such as chai, vanilla, honey or fruit, are popular, as is powdered milk.

During the Second World War British and Canadian soldiers were issued an instant tea in their composite ration (&quot;compo&quot;) packs. These blocks of instant tea, powdered milk, and sugar were not always well received. As Royal Canadian Artillery Gunner, George C Blackburn observed:

=== Bottled and canned tea ===

Canned tea is sold prepared and ready to drink. It was introduced in 1981 in Japan. The first bottled tea was introduced by an Indonesian tea company, PT. Sinar Sosro in 1969 with the brand name Teh Botol Sosro (or Sosro bottled tea). In 1983, Swiss-based Bischofszell Food Ltd. was the first company to bottle iced tea on an industrial scale.

== Tea culture ==
In many cultures, tea is consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea party. Tea ceremonies have arisen in different cultures, such as the Chinese and Japanese traditions, each of which employs certain techniques and ritualised protocol of brewing and serving tea for enjoyment in a refined setting. One form of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.

In the United Kingdom, 63% of people drink tea daily. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea is consumed both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of scones, clotted cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea.

Ireland, as of 2016, was the second-biggest per capita consumer of tea in the world, after Turkey. Local blends are the most popular in Ireland, including Irish breakfast tea, using Rwandan, Kenyan and Assam teas. The annual national average of tea consumption in Ireland is 2.7 kg to 4 kg per person. Tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar and brewed longer for a stronger taste.

Turkish tea is an important part of that country&#x27;s cuisine and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country&#x27;s long history with coffee. In 2004, Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the global total), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey and the rest being exported. In 2010, Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at 2.7 kg. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.
Russia has a long, rich tea history dating to 1638 when tea was introduced to Tsar Michael. Social gatherings were considered incomplete without tea, which was traditionally brewed in a samovar.

In Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as &quot;sabz chai&quot; and &quot;kahwah&quot;, respectively. The popular green tea is often served after every meal in the Pashtun belt of Balochistan and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In central and southern Punjab and the metropolitan Sindh region of Pakistan, tea with milk and sugar (sometimes with pistachios, cardamom, etc.), commonly referred to as &quot;chai&quot;, is widely consumed. It is the most common beverage of households in the region. In the northern Pakistani regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty, buttered Tibetan-style tea is consumed.

Indian tea culture is strong; the drink is the most popular hot beverage in the country. It is consumed daily in almost all houses, offered to guests, consumed in high amounts in domestic and official surroundings, and is made with the addition of milk with or without spices, and usually sweetened. It is sometimes served with biscuits to be dipped in the tea and eaten before consuming the tea. More often than not, it is drunk in &quot;doses&quot; of small cups (referred to as &quot;cutting&quot; chai if sold at street tea vendors) rather than one large cup.

Iranians have one of the highest per capita rates of tea consumption in the world. &quot;Châikhânes&quot; (teahouses) are common in Iran. Iranian tea is typically served in traditional Iranian glasses with a traditional saucer and teaspoon. Tea is cultivated in northern Iran along the shores of the Caspian Sea.

In Burma (Myanmar), tea is consumed not only as hot drinks, but also as sweet tea and green tea known locally as &quot;laphet-yay&quot; and &quot;laphet-yay-gyan&quot;, respectively. Pickled tea leaves, known locally as &quot;lahpet&quot;, are a national delicacy. Pickled tea is usually eaten with roasted sesame seeds, crispy fried beans, roasted peanuts and fried garlic chips.

In Mali, gunpowder tea is served in series of three, starting with the highest oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea, locally referred to as &quot;strong like death&quot;, followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added (&quot;pleasant as life&quot;), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added (&quot;sweet as love&quot;). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom, the &quot;Grin&quot;, an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and extending late into the night, and is widely popular in Bamako and other large urban areas.

In the United States, 80% of tea is consumed as iced tea. Sweet tea is native to the southeastern U.S. and is iconic in its cuisine due to its refreshing temperature and large amount of sweetener.

== Economics ==

=== Producers and consumers ===

Tea is the most popular manufactured drink consumed in the world, equaling all others – including coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol – combined. Most tea consumed outside East Asia is produced on large plantations in the hilly regions of India and Sri Lanka and is destined to be sold to large businesses. Opposite this large-scale industrial production are many small &quot;gardens,&quot; sometimes minuscule plantations, that produce highly sought-after teas prized by gourmets. These teas are both rare and expensive and can be compared to some of the most expensive wines in this respect.

India is the world&#x27;s largest tea-drinking nation, although the per capita consumption of tea remains a modest per person every year. Turkey, with of tea consumed per person per year, is the world&#x27;s greatest per capita consumer.

=== Certification ===

Several bodies independently certify the production of tea, such as Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, UTZ Certified, and Organic. From 2008 to 2016, sustainability standards-certified tea production experienced a compound annual growth rate of about 35%, accounting for at least 19% of overall tea production. In 2016, at least 1.15 million tonnes of sustainably certified tea was produced, valued at US$2 billion.

Rainforest Alliance certified tea is sold by Unilever brands Lipton and PG Tips in Western Europe, Australia and the U.S. Fairtrade certified tea is sold by a large number of suppliers around the world. UTZ Certified tea is sold by Pickwick tea.

Production of organic tea has risen since its introduction in 1990 at Rembeng, Kondoli Tea Estate, Assam. tons of organic tea were sold in 1999.
== Issues ==
===Safety ===
Tests of commercially popular teas have detected residues of banned toxic pesticides.

=== Fraud ===
Tea is a common target of food fraud. Lower cost ingredients may be substituted for tea, or a tea may be adulterated with undeclared and possibly toxic colors and flavors. The origin of the tea, picking season, and the processing techniques may be intentionally misidentified. Tea powders which undergo additional processing are more susceptible to food fraud.

=== Labour ===
Tea production in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda uses child labour, according to the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor.&quot; Workers who pick and pack tea on plantations in developing countries can face harsh working conditions and may earn below the living wage.
