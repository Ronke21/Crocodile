<text>Thuggee (, ) is the name given to alleged thugs, who, supposedly, were historical organised cults of professional robbers and murderers in India. They were said to have travelled in groups across the Indian subcontinent. 

They are purported to have murdered their victims by strangling using a bandana as a tool. The Thuggee were believed to practise their killings as a form of worship toward the goddess Kali. For centuries, the authorities of the Indian subcontinent, such as the Khalji dynasty, the Mughal Empire, and the British Raj, attempted to curtail the criminal activities of the Thuggee during their rule.

Contemporary scholarship is increasingly sceptical of the &quot;thuggee&quot; concept, and has questioned the existence of such a phenomenon, which has led many historians to describe &quot;thuggee&quot; as the invention of the British colonial regime.

== Etymology ==
ठग (), translated from Hindi as &quot;swindler&quot; or &quot;deceiver&quot;. It is related with the verb &quot;thugna&quot; (&quot;to deceive&quot;), from the Sanskrit स्थग ( &#x27;, , fraudulent&#x27;) and स्थगति (, &#x27;he conceals&#x27;). This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, especially the northern and eastern regions of India. The English word thug is derived from the same roots as the term &quot;Thuggee&quot;.

The Thuggee reportedly operated as gangs of highwaymen who tricked and murdered their victims by strangling. To take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence, which would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose. 
One of the Thuggee would befriend their potential targets (even to the point of assuming their religion) and accompany them for a while to assess their potential wealth. Eventually, as one Thug managed to distract their victims by engaging them in conversation, the other members who were tasked with the killing would strangle them swiftly from behind. After the murder, they sometimes mutilated the corpses to hide evidence, and buried the remains. Their modus operandi led to the thugs being called &quot;Phansigar&quot; (&quot;using a noose&quot;), a term more commonly used in southern India. 
Although strangulation is one of their most-recognised methods of murder, they also used blades and poison. The Thuggee gangs usually commenced their act in the evening, and attacked travelling groups whose numbers were smaller than their own groups to avoid unnecessary losses. To avoid suspicion, they carried only a few swords. The poisonous ingredients which prepared by the Thuggee were consisted of &quot;Datura metel&quot;, the Indian thornapple, (family Solanaceae), a poisonous plant sacred to Shiva with powerful deliriant properties, were sometimes used by thugs to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier. The Hindi name for the plant &quot;धतूरा&quot; (&quot;dhatūra&quot;) is derived from the Sanskrit and was adapted by Linnaeus into the Latinate genus name &quot;Datura&quot;.

A leader of a Thuggee was called &quot;jemadar&quot;. This was derived from military-style ranks such as jemadar and &quot;subedar&quot; among Thugs as well as reference to individual members as a &quot;private&quot;, suggests that the organisation of their gangs had a military link. They used a jargon known as &quot;Ramasee&quot; to disguise their true intentions from their targets. The Thuggee members comprised some who had inherited Thuggee as a family vocation, and others who were forced to turn to it out of necessity. The leadership of many of the groups tended to be hereditary with family members sometimes serving together in the same band. Such thugs were known as &quot;aseel&quot;. According to a Thuggee testimony, a young initiate who joined the group was usually trained by a senior experienced Thuggee member who held the title of &quot;guru&quot;. While they usually kept their acts a secret, female thugs also existed and were called &quot;baronee&quot; in Ramasee, while an important male Thuggee was called &quot;baroo&quot;.

The Thuggee usually avoided killing the children of the victims and instead adopted them. However, sometimes they resorted to killing women and children to eliminate witnesses. Some of the thugs avoided murdering victims they considered proscribed according to their beliefs and let other unscrupulous members commit the murder or were forced to let them by those who did not believe in their customs like the Muslim thugs. Many of them avoided committing the robberies near the areas in which they lived, to avoid recognition and criminal repercussion.

==History==

=== Origins ===
There were numerous traditions about their origin: 
* One theory stated the Thuggee existed back to 1760. Based on genealogies which were recounted by some thugs, historian Mike Dash stated that the origin of the Thuggee can be dated back to the second half of the 17th century. A general consensus among them was that they originated in Delhi. A Thuggee named Gholam Hossyn who was caught in early 1800s stated that his accomplices believed that thugs had existed since the time of Alexander the Great. Another tradition among Thugs who lived in the early 1800s stated that they had lived in Delhi till the time of Akbar and consisted of seven great Muslim clans, although they had Hindu names, during the period. After one of them killed a favoured slave of Akbar, they left Delhi for other regions to avoid being targeted by the emperor. 
* The earliest known reference to the Thugs as a band or fraternity, rather than ordinary thieves, is found in Ziau-d din Barni&#x27;s &quot;History of Firoz Shah&quot; (written about 1356). He narrated an incident of the sultan Jalal-ud-din Khalji having arrested 1,000 Thugs, and expelling them to the Lakhnauti. At first, Jalal-ud-din took a lenient attitude towards the Thuggees as he thought he could make them obedient with a softer approach. However, this approach proved unrealistic according to modern historian Syama Prasad Basu, , but also encouraged insolence towards the Sultan.
* Donald Friell McLeod theorised the Thuggee members originated from some Muslim tribes formed from those who fled Delhi after murdering a physician. Another source traced it to some great Muslim families who fled after murdering a favored slave of Akbar. According to this view, the original Muslim Thugs spread Thuggee amongst Hindus.
* Another tradition preserved by the Thuggee clan members stated that they were Kanjars or descended from those who worked in the Mughal camps. A Thuggee member has testified that some of his predecessors were forced to disguise themselves as members of the Kanjar tribe after fleeing Delhi, although they were originally descended from certain high-caste Muslim tribes. The said Thuggee, however, stated that their claimed descent was unverified and that some of them may be partially descended from the lower castes who worked in the Mughal army&#x27;s camps. However, Mike Dash stated that the Thuggee&#x27;s claim of being closed to outsiders is contradicted by the fact that people of all backgrounds were allowed to join them by the early 19th century according to available evidence. A Brahmin Thuggee who was interrogated by British Raj counselor William Henry Sleeman referred to the Muslim Thuggees as Kanjar tribesmen. However, another member of Thuggee refuted this.
* Donald Friell McLeod, Lieutenant Governor of Punjab Province, who led the campaign against them in the Rajputana Agency, recorded the traditions of their origins. According to them, they were originally Muslims and were taught Thuggee by the deity Devi or Bhavani. They then joined the Lodha people and migrated to Delhi, where 84 tribes—which were a part of all the criminal clans of India—also became a part of the Thugs. A physician who belonged to these 84 tribes gained prominence after curing a royal elephant and was murdered by other Thugs. A schism developed and they left Delhi, which in turn resulted in the existence of seven Muslim tribes. According to McLeod, these tribes were named Bhyns, Bursot, Kachinee, Hutar, Kathur Gugra, Behleem and Ganoo. According to him, the thugs from Delhi were separated into more than 12 &quot;classes&quot;.

=== 16th century onwards ===
In the 16th century Surdas, in his allegorical couplet, mentioned robbers called &quot;thags&quot; who would lure victims into their clutches to kill them and steal their property. Ibn Battuta, on his way to Calicut from Delhi as an envoy to China, was attacked by bandits, who probably were thugs. The Janamsakhis used the term thag to refer to a robber who used to lure pilgrims. Jean de Thévenot in his 1665 account referred to a band of robbers who used a &quot;certain Slip with a running noose&quot; to strangle their victims. John Fryer also mentions a similar method of strangling used by robbers from Surat whom he saw being given capital punishment by the Mughals in 1675. He mentioned that three of them were relatives, which Kim A. Wagner notices is similar to the Thugs who were thought to have engaged in this as a family profession. A decree issued by Aurangzeb in 1672 refers to a similar method and uses the term &quot;Phansigar&quot;.

The garrote is often depicted as a weapon of the Thuggee. Other evidences suggest that the katar (dagger) was their personal status weapon, the Thuggee wore this weapon proudly across their chest. Early references to Thugs reported they committed their strangulation murders with nooses of rope or catgut, but later they adopted the use of a length of cloth that could be used as a sash or scarf, and thus more easily concealed. This cloth is sometimes described as a rumāl (head covering or kerchief), translated as &quot;yellow scarf&quot;; &quot;yellow&quot;, in this case, may refer to a natural cream or khaki colour rather than bright yellow.

The Thuggees preferred to use the method of strangulation in order to take advantage of loopholes in civil law which persisted from the times of the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India from the 1500s. For a murderer to be sentenced to death, he or she must have shed the blood of their victim. Those who murdered but did not shed blood might face imprisonment, hard labor and paying a penalty—but they would not risk execution.

The &quot;River Thugs&quot; preyed upon people including Hindu pilgrims travelling using the Ganga river and became mostly active during the winter like their compatriots from Murnae, Bundelkhand and Awadh. Their dialect of Ramasee differed from the one used by their compatriots on land and used boats taken on lease from their builders or from a jemadar called Khuruck Baboo. Sleeman states that they tapped three times to give the signal to murder which they always committed during the day. To avoid detection of a corpse, they broke its back and threw it in the river to be eaten by crocodiles and only robbed money or jewels.

===British suppression===
The British found out about them in Southern India for the first time in 1807, while in Northern India they were discovered in 1809 with an effort to suppress them being carried out from 1809 to 1812.

After a dispute developed between the Zamindar official named Tejun with a Thuggee named Ghasee Ram in 1812, the latter took refuge with his family under another landlord called Laljee. Tejun in turn revealed the thugs of Sindouse to Nathaniel Halhed. Thomas Perry, the magistrate of Etawah, assembled some soldiers of the East India Company under the command of Halheld in 1812 to suppress the Thugs. Laljee and his forces including over 100 Thugs were defeated, with the village of Murnae, a headquarter of the Thugs, destroyed and burnt by the Company soldiers. Laljee fled to Rampura and the southern banks of Sindh River but was caught by the Marathas who turned him over to the company.

British authorities had occasionally captured and prosecuted Thugs, circulating information about these cases in newsletters or the journal &quot;Asiatick Researches&quot; of The Asiatic Society. However, Sleeman seems to have been the first to realize that information obtained from one group of stranglers might be used to track and identify other thugs in a different district. His first major breakthrough was the capture of &quot;Feringhea&quot; (also known as Syeed Amir Ali, Khuda Buksh, Deahuct Undun and Daviga Persaud), who was persuaded to turn King&#x27;s evidence. (Feringhea&#x27;s story was the basis of the successful 1839 novel &quot;Confessions of a Thug&quot;). Feringhea brought Sleeman to a mass grave with a hundred bodies, told him the circumstances of the murders and named the Thugs who had committed them.

After initial investigations confirmed what Feringhea had said, Sleeman began an extensive campaign using profiling and intelligence. Sleeman was made superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1835, an organ of the Indian government first established by the East India Company in 1830. (Dacoity referred to organised banditry, distinguished from thugs most notably by its open practice and due to the fact that murder was not an intrinsic element of their &quot;modus operandi&quot;.) Sleeman developed elaborate intelligence techniques that pre-dated similar methods in Europe and the US by decades. During the 1830s, the thugs were targeted for eradication by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, and his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman.

Records were made in which the accused were given prisoner numbers, against which their names, residences, fellow thugs, and the criminal acts for which they were blamed were also noted. Many thugs&#x27; names were similar; they often lacked surnames since the Thuggee naming convention was to use the names of their tribes, castes and job assignments in the gangs. Accurate recording was also difficult because the thugs adopted many aliases, with both Muslim and Hindu thugs often posing as members of the other religion. By the testimony from a Thuggee named Ghulam Hussain, Hindu and Muslim Thuggees avoided eating together, such was not the case for drinking and smoking.

The campaign relied heavily on captured thugs who became informants. These informants were offered protection on the condition that they told everything that they knew. According to historian Mike Dash, who used documents in the UK archives, suspects were subject to bench trials before British judges. Though the trials were lacking by later standards (e.g., suspects were not allowed legal representation), they were conducted with care to protocols of the time. While most suspects were convicted, Dash notes that the courts genuinely seemed interested in finding the truth and rejected a minority of allegations due to mistaken identity or insufficient evidence. Even by later standards, Dash argues, the evidence of guilt for many thugs was often overwhelming. Because they used boats and disposed of their victims in rivers, the &quot;River Thugs&quot; were able to evade the British authorities for some time after their compatriots on land were suppressed. They were ultimately betrayed to the authorities by one of their compatriots, from Awadh. Forces under Sleeman&#x27;s command hunted them down in 1836.

In 1870s the practice of thuggee was thought to have ceased. However, the history of Thuggee led to the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871. Although the CTA was repealed at Indian independence in 1947, tribes considered criminal still exist in India. The Thuggee and Dacoity Department remained in existence until 1904, when it was replaced by the Central Criminal Intelligence Department (CID).

In &quot;Following the Equator&quot;, Mark Twain wrote about an 1839 government report by William Henry Sleeman:

== Thug beliefs ==

Thugs considered themselves to be the children of Kali, having been created from her sweat. However, many of the Thugs who were captured and convicted by the British were Muslims, perhaps up to a third. 

According to colonial sources, Thugs believed that they played a positive role in saving human lives. Without the Thugs&#x27; sacred service, Kali might destroy all mankind:
* &quot;It is God who kills, but Bhowanee has [a] name for it.&quot;
* &quot;God is all in all, for good and evil.&quot;
* &quot;God has appointed blood for [Bhowanee&#x27;s] food, saying &#x27;khoon tum khao&#x27;: feed thou upon blood. In my opinion it is very bad, but what can she do, being ordered to subsist upon blood!&quot;
* &quot;Bhowanee is happy and more so in proportion to the blood that is shed.&quot;

The Muslim thugs, while retaining their monotheistic faith, had functionalised Bhavani for Thuggee and she was syncretised as a spirit subordinate to Allah. A Muslim thug caught by Sleeman stated, &quot;In my heart, I take the name of God, when I strangle a man – saying &quot;God thou are King!&quot; &quot;Alla, toomee Malik!&quot; I do not pray to Bhowanee, but I worship her.&quot; Other Muslim Thugs who had agreed to testify for Sleeman, stated they had assimilated Bhavani and started the practice of Thuggee.

In the view of the historian Mike Dash, the Thuggee had no religious motivation in their murderous conduct. When religious elements were present among Thugs, their beliefs, in principle, were little different from the religious beliefs of many others who lived on the Indian subcontinent and attributed their success or failure to supernatural powers: &quot;Indeed all of the Thugs&#x27;s legends which concerned the goddess Kali featured exactly the cautionary notes which are typically found in folklore.&quot;

Kim Wagner asserts that we can analyse their traditions about events after their flight from Delhi &quot;to a much greater advantage&quot;. A tradition which was recounted by a captive stated that Thuggee had originally tried to settle in Agra and they later settled in Akoopore in the Doab region. However, they had to flee to Himmutpur and later they fled to Parihara after their kings started demanding a larger share of the plunder. In turn the original Muslim and Kayastha Thugs helped spread Thuggee amongst other groups like the Brahmins, Rajputs, other Hindus, the Lodhi people and the Ahir people.

The Thuggee generally considered that it was forbidden to kill women, &quot;fakirs&quot;, ascetics, bards, musicians and dancers. Like the ancient Hindu texts which distinguished robbery from the murder of Brahmins, women or children as violent crimes, many Thugs considered it taboo to kill people who belonged to such categories. Those who worked in lowly professions, the diseased and disabled were also forbidden as victims based on their folk belief. The Thuggee cults believed that breaking these rules would incur divine retribution.

== Groups ==
The East India Company officers since the time of Thomas Perry, who was appointed to Etawah in 1811, came to understand that there were many Thuggee groups and they all viewed themselves to be different from the other groups.

The Thuggee groups were often formed based on their native hometown, although some were also formed based on their professions. The group called &quot;Jamuldahee&quot; was named so because its members lived along the Yamuna river, they hailed from the Doab and Awadh regions. Another stated origin is that their ancestor was the Thuggee Jumulud Deen. The Telinganie originated from Telangana, Arcottees from Arcot and Beraries from Berar. The &quot;Lodaha&quot; group, mostly concentrated in Bihar, were caravaneers named after the &quot;lodha&quot; or load they carried and according to a Thuggee from the Doab, originated from the same ancestors of his clan. The Lodahas were prevalent in the region around Nepal in Bihar and Bengal during the tenure of Perry and originally hailed from Awadh which they left around 1700. A Deccan Thuggee stated that the &quot;Hindu Thugs of Talghat&quot;, located around the Krishna River, didn&#x27;t marry with the Telinganies whom they considered to be descendants of lower classes as a result of their professions. The &quot;Telinganie&quot; group were also disparagingly called &quot;Handeewuls&quot; (from &quot;handi&quot;) due to their eating habits.

The Pungoo or Bungoo of Bengal derived their name from the region, with the Lodhees or Lodaha also present. The Motheea group of Rampur-Purnia region was from a caste of weavers and their name derived from the practice of giving &quot;handful&quot; (&quot;muhti&quot;) of the spoils to the head. In the modern-day Uttar Pradesh, the groups were: the &quot;Korkureeas&quot; from Kohrur, &quot;Agureeas&quot; of Agra, &quot;Jumaldahees&quot;, &quot;Lodhees&quot; and &quot;Tundals&quot;. The &quot;Multaneea&quot; were from Multan. In Madhya Pradesh, the groups were: &quot;Bangureeas&quot; or &quot;Banjaras&quot;, &quot;Balheems&quot; or &quot;Bulheems&quot;, &quot;Khokhureeas&quot; and &quot;Soopurreeas&quot; of Sheopur. In modern Rajasthan, the groups were &quot;Guguras&quot; whose name derives from river Ghaggar, and the &quot;Sooseeas&quot; who were part of the Dhanuk clan. The &quot;Dhoulanee&quot; group existed in modern-day Maharashtra. The &quot;Duckunies&quot; of Deccan were from Munirabad and &quot;Kurnaketies&quot; from the Carnatic region. Another group was called &quot;Kathurs&quot; whose name derives from a bowl called &quot;kathota&quot;, based on a tradition of a man who held it during celebrations by Thugs. The &quot;Qulundera&quot; group&#x27;s name was derived from the Muslim saints called &quot;qalandar&quot;. There were also Jogi thugs who were divided into twelve sub-groups.

According to Feringheea, the Brahmins of Tehngoor village of Parihar were taught Thuggee after they accompanied the kings of Meos to Delhi, and later helped in spreading it in the region around Murnae. He also stated that two of his ancestors had settled and intermarried with Brahmins of Murnae about seven generations ago, which led to the introduction of Thuggee in the area. A thug hailing from Shikohabad whilst talking of his clan&#x27;s origin, recounted to Perry a tradition that the Munhars were influenced to take up Thuggee after witnessing the immense plunder acquired by Afghans, Mewatties and the Sheikhs.

Sleeman in 1839 identified a band called &quot;Meypunnaists&quot; who he stated abducted children to sell them further. Another band called &quot;Tashmabazes&quot; who used methods introduced by a soldier named Creagh who was deployed at Cawnpore in 1802 were also identified by him. The group called &quot;River Thugs&quot; were based deep in the Hooghly region.

== Historical evaluations ==
Worship of Kali was particularly emphasized by the British contemporaries. McLeod commented, &quot;It is a notable fact that not only amongst the Thugs, but in an especial manner among all lawless fraternities, and to a certain extent throughout the uneducated population of Central India, the Mussulmans vie with the Hindus in a devotion of this sanguinary deity (&quot;Devi&quot; or &quot;Bhavani&quot;) far exceeding that they pay to any other.&quot; Sleeman thought that some Brahmins acted as intelligence providers to thugs, claiming that they profited from Thuggee and directed it. David Ochterlony blamed the Pindaris for the rise of Thuggee while Sleeman blamed it on Indian rulers dismissing their armies which took away the jobs of many soldiers. Based on Sleeman&#x27;s writings about the Thugs, Robert Vane Russell claimed that most of them were Kanjars. He viewed the Muslim Kanjars as having recently converted to Islam.

The British generally took the view that Thuggee was a type of ritual murder practiced by worshippers of Kali. Sleeman&#x27;s view of it as an aberrant faith was based on the contemporary British view that Hinduism was a despicable and immoral faith founded on idol-worship. R. C. Sherwood in &quot;Asiatick Researches&quot; published in 1820 traces this phenomenon back to the Muslim conquests of India and suggests links to Hindu mythology. Charles Trevelyan viewed Thugs as representatives of the &quot;essence&quot; of Hinduism (rather than as a deviant sect), which he considered to be &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

In 1882, Alexander Cunningham commented on Hiouen-Thsang&#x27;s remarks about &quot;people who visited Kahalgaon and forgot to leave it&quot;, speculating that the actual reason might not have been that posited by the monk and noting Kahalgaon&#x27;s later reputation as a place frequented by the &quot;River Thugs&quot;.

=== Modern scepticism ===
Modern contemporary scholars have become increasingly sceptical of the &quot;thuggee&quot; concept, and have even questioned the existence of such a phenomenon. The British representation of Thuggee is held by some critics to be full of inconsistencies and exaggerations. Numerous historians have described &quot;thuggee&quot; as basically the invention of the British colonial regime. However, the more radical critics in this camp have themselves been criticized for focusing overly on British perceptions of thuggee rather than on the historical accuracy of primary source documents, but conclude that &quot;the colonial representation of thuggee cannot be taken at face value&quot;.

Martine van Woerkens of École Pratique des Hautes Études writes that evidence for a Thuggee group in the 19th century was the product of &quot;colonial imaginings&quot;, arising from British fear of the little-known interior of India, as well as limited understanding of the religious and social practices of its inhabitants.

Cynthia Ann Humes states that the testimony of most of the thugs captured by Sleeman does not support his view of priests profiting from and directing the thugs. She adds that the Islamic idea of fate was more commonly invoked during Thuggee acts, while invoking the Hindu Bhavani was far more rare.

Historian Kim Wagner views the policies of East India Company in relation to the dismissal of armies of the conquered Indian kingdoms as being responsible for the development of Thuggee. Roaming bands of freelance soldiers had often joined one kingdom or another during the pre-British era, with the main income of many armies coming from plunder. After being dismissed from military service, they turned to robbery as a means of subsistence. He also contested whether the thugs mentioned by Firuz Shah Tughlaq&#x27;s biography were actually the same thugs the British authorities fought against.

Sagnik Bhattacharya agrees with the sceptics and claims the thug-phenomenon to be nothing but a manifestation of the fear of the unknown that dawned on the British Raj at the thought of being alone in the wilderness of Central India. Using literary and legal sources, he has connected the &quot;information panic&quot; of the thug-phenomenon to the limitations of British demographic models that fell short of truly capturing the ethnic diversity of India. He explains the &quot;Thuggee hysteria&quot; around 1830s as being caused by the Raj&#x27;s angst at realizing its own ignorance of local society.

<text>In electronics and photonics design, tape-out or tapeout is the final stage of the design process for integrated circuits or printed circuit boards before they are sent for manufacturing. The tapeout is specifically the point at which the graphic for the photomask of the circuit is sent to the fabrication facility. The name originates from the use of magnetic tape to send the data to the manufacturing facility.

== Procedures involved ==
The term &quot;tapeout&quot; currently is used to describe the creation of the photomask itself from the final approved electronic CAD file. Designers may use this term to refer to the writing of the final file to disk or CD and its subsequent transmission to the semiconductor foundry; however, in current practice the foundry will perform checks and make modifications to the mask design specific to the manufacturing process before actual tapeout. These modifications of the mask data include: 
* &quot;Chip finishing&quot; which includes custom designations and structures to improve manufacturability of the layout. Examples of the latter are a seal ring and filler structures.
* Producing a &quot;reticle layout&quot; with test patterns and alignment marks. 
* &quot;Layout-to-mask preparation&quot; that enhances layout data with graphics operations and adjusts the data to mask production devices. This step includes resolution enhancement technologies (RET), such as optical proximity correction (OPC) which corrects for the wave-like behavior of light when etching the nano scale features of the most modern integrated circuits.

A modern integrated circuit has to go through a long and complex design process before it is ready for tape-out. Many of the steps along the way use software tools collectively known as electronic design automation (EDA). The design must then go through a series of verification steps collectively known as &quot;signoff&quot; before it can be taped-out. Tape-out is usually a cause for celebration by everyone who worked on the project, followed by trepidation awaiting the first article, the first physical samples of a chip from the manufacturing facility (semiconductor foundry).

First tapeout is rarely the end of work for the design team. Most chips will go through a series of iterations, called &quot;spins&quot;, in which errors are detected and fixed after testing the first article. Many different factors can cause a spin, including:
*The taped-out design fails final checks at the foundry due to problems manufacturing the design itself.
*The design is successfully fabricated, but the first article fails functionality tests.

== Naming == 
The roots of the term can be traced back to the time when paper tape and later magnetic tape reels were loaded with the final electronic files used to create the photomask at the factory.

A synonym used at IBM is &quot;RIT&quot; (release interface tape). IBM differentiates between &quot;RIT-A&quot; for the non-metallic structures and &quot;RIT-B&quot; for the metal layers.
A synonym used at Texas Instruments is PG (pattern generation).

<doc id="31528" wikidata="Q2805651" url="?curid=31528" title="Treaty of Cahuenga">
<text>The Treaty of Cahuenga (), also called the Capitulation of Cahuenga (&quot;Capitulación de Cahuenga&quot;), was an 1847 agreement that ended the Conquest of California, resulting in a ceasefire between Californios and Americans. The treaty was signed at the Campo de Cahuenga on 13 January 1847, ending the fighting of the Mexican–American War within Alta California (modern-day California). The treaty was drafted in both English and Spanish by José Antonio Carrillo and signed by John C. Frémont, representing the American forces, and Andrés Pico, representing the Mexican forces.

The treaty called for the Californios to give up their artillery, and provided that all prisoners from both sides be immediately freed. Those Californios who promised not to again take up arms during the war, and to obey the laws and regulations of the United States, were allowed to peaceably return to their homes and ranchos. They were to be allowed the same rights and privileges as were allowed to citizens of the United States, and were not to be compelled to take an oath of allegiance until a treaty of peace was signed between the United States and Mexico, and were given the privilege of leaving the country if they wished to do so.

Under the later Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, Mexico formally ceded Alta California and other territories to the United States, and the disputed border of Texas was fixed at the Rio Grande. Pico, like nearly all the Californios, became an American citizen with full legal and voting rights. Pico later became a State Assemblyman and then a State Senator representing Los Angeles in the California State Legislature.

==Background==
On December 27, 1846, Frémont and the California Battalion, in their march south to Los Angeles, reached a deserted Santa Barbara and raised the American flag. He occupied a hotel close to the adobe of Bernarda Ruiz de Rodriguez, a wealthy educated woman of influence and Santa Barbara town matriarch, who had four sons on the Mexican side. She asked for and was granted ten minutes of Frémont&#x27;s time, which stretched to two hours; she advised him that a generous peace would be to his political advantage—one that included Pico&#x27;s pardon, release of prisoners, equal rights for all Californians and respect of property rights.
Frémont later wrote, &quot;I found that her object was to use her influence to put an end to the war, and to do so upon such just and friendly terms of compromise as would make the peace acceptable and enduring. ... She wished me to take into my mind this plan of settlement, to which she would influence her people; meantime, she urged me to hold my hand, so far as possible. ... I assured her I would bear her wishes in mind when the occasion came.&quot;
On January 8, 1847, Frémont arrived at San Fernando. On January 10, the combined army of Commodore Robert F. Stockton and Brigadier Stephen W. Kearny re-took Los Angeles following the Battle of the San Gabriel River and the Battle of La Mesa. Frémont learned of the reoccupation the next day. Frémont and two of Pico&#x27;s officers agreed to the terms for a surrender, and Articles of Capitulation were penned by Jose Antonio Carrillo in both English and Spanish. The first seven articles in the treaty were nearly the verbatim suggestions offered by Bernarda Ruiz de Rodriguez.

On January 13, at a rancho at the north end of Cahuenga Pass, John Frémont, Andrés Pico and six others signed the Articles of Capitulation, which became known as the Treaty of Cahuenga. The treaty, signed by the Mexican military commander of the area and a U.S. army colonel, was made without the formal backing of either the American government in Washington or the Mexican government in Mexico City, and even the ranking U.S. officers in the area (General Kearny and Commodore Stockton) were unaware of it. Still, it was eventually honored by both national governments and was immediately and permanently observed by the local American and Californio populations. Fighting ceased, thus ending the war in California.

On January 14, the California Battalion entered Los Angeles in a rainstorm, and Frémont delivered the treaty to Commodore Robert Stockton. Kearny and Stockton decided to accept the liberal terms offered by Frémont to terminate hostilities although Andrés Pico had broken his earlier pledge that he would not fight U.S. forces. The next day, Stockton approved the Treaty of Cahuenga in a message that he sent to the Secretary of the Navy.

==Historical re-enactment==
In celebration, on or around the date of the original signing, a historical ceremony is conducted at Campo de Cahuenga State Historic Park and site. From time to time, some of the descendants have appeared, along with actors to re-create this historical moment.

<doc id="31529" wikidata="Q909916" url="?curid=31529" title="The Fall (band)">
<text>The Fall were an English post-punk group, formed in 1976 in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. They had many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith being the only constant member. The Fall&#x27;s long-term musicians included drummers Paul Hanley, Simon Wolstencroft and Karl Burns; guitarists Craig Scanlon, Marc Riley, and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band&#x27;s sound from early 1980s albums such as &quot;Hex Enduction Hour&quot; to the late 1990s.

First associated with the late 1970s punk movement, the Fall&#x27;s music underwent numerous stylistic changes often concurrently with changes in the group&#x27;s lineup. Their music was generally characterised by an abrasive, repetitive guitar-driven sound, tense bass and drum rhythms, and Smith&#x27;s caustic lyrics. While the Fall never achieved widespread success beyond minor hit singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they have maintained a strong cult following.

The Fall have been called &quot;the most prolific band of the British post-punk movement&quot;. From 1979 to 2017, they released 31 studio albums, plus dozens of live albums and compilations released against Smith&#x27;s wishes. They were associated with the BBC DJ John Peel, who championed them from early on in their career and described them as his favourite band, saying: &quot;They are always different; they are always the same.&quot; The group disbanded after Smith&#x27;s death in 2018.

== History ==

=== Late 1970s: early years ===
The Fall were formed in Prestwich, England in 1976 by Mark E. Smith, Martin Bramah, Una Baines, and Tony Friel. The four friends met to read their writings to each other and take drugs. Their musical influences included Can (which the band would later pay tribute to on the track &quot;I Am Damo Suzuki&quot;), the Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart and garage rock bands like the Monks and the Stooges. The members were devoted readers, with Smith citing H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Malcolm Lowry among his favourite writers. After seeing the Sex Pistols play their second gig at Manchester&#x27;s Lesser Free Trade Hall in July 1976, they decided to start a group. Smith wanted to name the group &quot;the Outsiders&quot;, but Friel came up with the name &quot;the Fall&quot; after a 1956 novel by Albert Camus. Smith became the singer, Bramah the guitarist, Friel played bass guitar and Baines bashed biscuit tins instead of drums; unable to afford to buy a drum kit, she then switched to keyboards. Their music was intentionally raw and repetitive. The song &quot;Repetition&quot;, declaring that &quot;we&#x27;ve repetition in the music, and we&#x27;re never going to lose it&quot;, served as a manifesto for the Fall&#x27;s musical philosophy.

The group played their first concert on 23 May 1977, at the North West Arts basement. Their first drummer was remembered only as &quot;Dave&quot; or &quot;Steve&quot; for thirty-four years, until music writer Dave Simpson discovered that he had almost certainly been a man named Steve Ormrod. Ormrod lasted just one show, at least in part due to political differences with the other members of the group. He was replaced by Karl Burns, whom Friel played with in a band called Nuclear Angel. The Fall soon caught the attention of Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon, who funded their first recording session, and in November 1977 they recorded material for their debut EP, &quot;Bingo-Master&#x27;s Break-Out!&quot; Boon planned to release the EP on his New Hormones label, but after discovering that he could not afford to do so he gave the tapes back to the group. Thus, the Fall&#x27;s debut on vinyl came in June 1978 when &quot;Stepping Out&quot; and &quot;Last Orders&quot; were released by Virgin Records on &quot;Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus&quot;, a compilation of live recordings made at the Manchester venue The Electric Circus in October 1977 just before it was closed.

The Fall&#x27;s line-up had its first drastic changes in 1977–78. Kay Carroll, Una Baines&#x27;s friend and colleague at the psychiatric hospital, became the group&#x27;s manager and occasional backing vocalist, as well as Smith&#x27;s girlfriend. Friel, unhappy with Carroll&#x27;s management, left in December 1977 (he went on to form the Passage with Dick Witts). He was briefly replaced by Jonnie Brown, and later by Eric McGann (also known as Eric the Ferrett). The Fall were filmed on 13 February 1978 for the Granada TV show &quot;What&#x27;s On&quot;, hosted by Tony Wilson, performing &quot;Psycho Mafia&quot;, &quot;Industrial Estate&quot; and &quot;Dresden Dolls&quot;, featuring the brief line-up of Smith, Bramah, Burns, Baines and McGann. Baines left in March 1978 after a drug overdose and subsequent nervous breakdown, and was replaced by Yvonne Pawlett; McGann quit that May, in disgust at the group&#x27;s van driver Steve Davies wearing a Hawaiian shirt as he ferried them to the recording of their first-ever session for influential radio DJ John Peel. (The Fall would record a total of 24 sessions for Peel, who became a devoted fan of the group.) Martin Bramah blamed the dissolution of the original line-up on Smith&#x27;s style of leadership, together with Carroll&#x27;s favouring of her partner: &quot;The break-up wasn&#x27;t so much about the music, though; it was more how we were being treated as people on a daily basis.&quot; Marc Riley, the group&#x27;s roadie was 16; eventually he was recruited to be in the group and play bass guitar.
&quot;Bingo-Master&#x27;s Break-Out!&quot; finally was released in August 1978 on Step Forward Records. The single &quot;It&#x27;s the New Thing&quot; followed in November 1978, and in December the Fall recorded (in a single day) their debut album &quot;Live at the Witch Trials&quot;, which was released in March 1979. Burns quit the group shortly after the album was recorded, and was replaced by Mike Leigh from Rockin&#x27; Ricky, a cabaret band. In April 1979, Burns was followed by Martin Bramah, co-writer of most of the songs on &quot;Live at the Witch Trials&quot; and, according to writer Daryl Eslea, &quot;possibly the last true equal to Smith in the group&quot;; he went on to form Blue Orchids with Una Baines. Marc Riley switched from bass guitar to guitar, and Craig Scanlon (guitar) and Steve Hanley (bass guitar), former bandmates of Riley and members of Fall support act Staff 9, joined the group. Hanley&#x27;s melodic basslines became a vital part of the Fall&#x27;s music for almost two decades. Smith praised his playing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;The most original aspect of the Fall is Steve ... I&#x27;ve never heard a bass player like him ... I don&#x27;t have to tell him what to play, he just knows. He is the Fall sound.&quot; Yvonne Pawlett left in July 1979 to look after her dog. She later appeared in a band called Shy Tots.

On 30 July 1979, &quot;Rowche Rumble&quot;, the Fall&#x27;s third single, was released featuring the line up of Smith, Scanlon, Riley, Hanley, Pawlett and Leigh. Pawlett left the group shortly afterwards. &quot;Dragnet&quot;, the Fall&#x27;s second album, was recorded in August 1979 at Cargo Studios, Rochdale, and was released on 26 October 1979. &quot;Dragnet&quot; signalled a sparser, more jagged feel in the Fall&#x27;s music compared to &quot;Live at the Witch Trials&quot;. The studio allegedly complained about the sound quality and protested against putting its name on the album sleeve, fearing it would put other artists off using the facilities.

=== 1980–1982: Classic line-up ===

The Fall released their fourth single &quot;Fiery Jack&quot;, their last for Step Forward, on 13 January 1980. In March, Mike Leigh left the group and went back to the cabaret circuit. According to Leigh, the band would have to wait for weeks without work while Smith came up with new lyrics, as opposed to regular weekly gigs in cabaret. Leigh&#x27;s replacement was Paul Hanley, Steve Hanley&#x27;s younger brother. He first played live with the Fall on Friday 21 March at Electric Ballroom, London–he was only 16 and was actually still at school. Meanwhile, the Fall quit Step Forward and signed with Rough Trade; the first release on a new label became &quot;Totale&#x27;s Turns&quot; in May 1980. This, with the exception of two tracks, was a live album documenting the band during various appearances in 1979, with Smith announcing last orders at the bar [responding to a request for the song &quot;Last Orders&quot;] and berating band members and audience throughout.

In November 1980, the Fall released their third full-length album &quot;Grotesque (After the Gramme)&quot;. Preceded by a couple of acclaimed singles &quot;How I Wrote &#x27;Elastic Man&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Totally Wired&quot;, the album went to #1 on the UK Indie Chart. It was co-produced by Rough Trade&#x27;s Geoff Travis and Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola and showed a significant improvement in production, which was to continue throughout the period. Smith, however, was unhappy with Rough Trade&#x27;s politics, which showed when &quot;Slates&quot; came out in April 1981. Intentionally made too long for a single and too short to be considered an album, it was released as a 10&quot; EP for a price of just 2 pounds. The Fall eventually quit Rough Trade by the end of the year, and instead signed with a small indie label Kamera.

As the Fall were going to tour America after the release of &quot;Slates&quot;, Paul Hanley was denied a visa as he was too young to play American clubs that serve alcohol, which restrict entry to those age 21 or older. Smith thus invited Karl Burns back into the group, initially as a temporary replacement. Select recordings from this tour were released in 1982 as &quot;A Part of America Therein, 1981&quot;. After their return to the UK, Burns stayed in the group as a second drummer alongside Hanley. The first record to feature both Burns and Hanley became the &quot;Lie Dream of a Casino Soul&quot; single, produced by Richard Mazda and released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1981.

On 8 March 1982 &quot;Hex Enduction Hour&quot;, also produced by Mazda, was released on Kamera Records, the Fall&#x27;s seventh single (&quot;Look, Know&quot;) was released 19 April 1982 on Kamera. On 27 September the &quot;Room to Live&quot; album was released on Kamera. Marc Riley was sacked at the end of the year, following several arguments, one of which resulted in a fist fight during the Australian tour. In response, Riley&#x27;s band &quot;The Creepers&quot; wrote the track &quot;Jumper Clown&quot;, which directly references Riley&#x27;s dismissal, while also satirising Smith&#x27;s dress sense.

This era is often regarded as a high point in the band&#x27;s creative history, as noted by Ned Raggett of AllMusic who retrospectively described the late years with Riley and shortly after his departure as &quot;three years during which the band couldn&#x27;t seem to make a wrong step.&quot;

=== 1983–1989: Brix Smith years ===
In 1983, Rough Trade Records released the Fall&#x27;s ninth single, &quot;The Man Whose Head Expanded&quot;, and on 19 September issued the band&#x27;s tenth single and double pack &quot;Kicker Conspiracy&quot;. Bizarrely, in November Kamera Records released around two- to three-thousand copies of the planned 1982 single &quot;Marquis Cha Cha&quot;, the release date having been put back due to Kamera&#x27;s financial troubles in late 1982, making it the Fall&#x27;s eleventh single issue.
That year Smith&#x27;s American girlfriend and later wife, Brix Smith joined the band on guitar. Born Laura Elise Salenger, she was nicknamed after the track &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; by the Clash, a favourite song of hers. Brix&#x27;s tenure in the group marked a shift towards the relatively conventional, with the songs she co-wrote often having strong pop hooks and more orthodox verse-chorus-verse structures. Additionally, Brix&#x27;s keen sense of fashion gradually influenced the group&#x27;s members to give more attention to their clothing and styling, though her platinum blonde hair and glamorous style were somewhat at odds to the otherwise working class appearance of the Fall. Brix&#x27;s first live appearance with the Fall was on 21 September 1983 at the Hellfire Club, Wakefield.

&quot;Perverted by Language&quot;, released 5 December, was the Fall&#x27;s final album for Rough Trade Records, but the first to feature Brix. Also released in December was the live album &quot;In a Hole&quot;, recorded during the Fall&#x27;s tour of New Zealand in 1982, on Flying Nun Records.

This era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix&#x27;s effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of R. Dean Taylor&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Ghost in My House&quot; (no. 30, 1987) and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Victoria&quot; (no. 35, 1988) and their own songs &quot;Hey! Luciani&quot; (no. 59, 1986) and &quot;Hit the North&quot; (no. 57, 1987), and enjoyed a string of critically acclaimed albums: &quot;The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall&quot; (1984), &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot; (1985), &quot;Bend Sinister&quot; (1986), and &quot;The Frenz Experiment&quot; (1988). &quot;I Am Kurious, Oranj&quot; is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer Michael Clark. Simon Rogers and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting &quot;The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall&quot;, and Simon Wolstencroft replaced other drummer Burns after &quot;This Nation&#x27;s Saving Grace&quot;. Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group&#x27;s sound; his drumming was described as &quot;nimble&quot; and &quot;funky&quot; when compared to Burns. In 2014 Wolstencroft published a memoir &quot;You Can Drum But You Can&#x27;t Hide&quot; about his 11-year stint in the Fall.

=== 1990–2000 ===

With Brix&#x27;s departure in 1989 – both from the band and her marriage to Smith – Bramah returned briefly for 1990&#x27;s &quot;Extricate&quot;, the first of the Fall&#x27;s three albums for Phonogram Records. In the early 1990s the band continued to have modest success on the UK chart with singles including &quot;Telephone Thing&quot; (no. 58, 1990), &quot;White Lightning&quot; (no. 56, 1990), &quot;Free Range&quot; (no. 40, 1992) and &quot;Why Are People Grudgeful&quot; (no. 43, 1993). Bramah and Schofield were sacked in advance of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Shift-Work&quot;. Dave Bush joined on keyboards for 1992&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, followed by the band&#x27;s return to an independent record label for &quot;The Infotainment Scan&quot; (1993), &quot;Middle Class Revolt&quot; (1994), and &quot;Cerebral Caustic&quot; (1995). These albums featured varying degrees of electronica and IDM, courtesy of Bush&#x27;s keyboards and computers. &quot;Caustic&quot; saw the unexpected return of Smith&#x27;s ex-wife Brix, who recorded &quot;The Light User Syndrome&quot; before departing in 1996. When Dave Bush went to join Elastica, Scanlon was sacked after sixteen years, an unpopular decision which Smith would later regret. In November 1994 Julia Nagle joined to help promote the release of &quot;Cerebral Caustic&quot;, playing keyboards, guitars and computers. Nagle went onto contribute to &quot;The Light User Syndrome&quot; in 1996. That year also saw the start of a torrent of compilations of live, demo and alternative versions of songs on the Fall&#x27;s new label Receiver Records.

In 1994 and 1996, the Fall played at the Phoenix Festival in Stratford-upon-Avon, England–the 1996 appearance being one of much surprise to many fans as they were not scheduled to play. The next album, &quot;Levitate&quot; (1997), toyed with drum and bass and polarised opinion (long-serving drummer Simon Wolstencroft left halfway through the recording sessions, and was replaced–again–by Karl Burns). Steven Wells in the &quot;NME&quot; (11 October 1997) wrote, &quot;Imagine pop without perimeters. Imagine rock without rules. Imagine art without the wank. If you&#x27;ve never heard the Fall then &quot;Levitate&quot; will be either the best or the worst record you&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; The group was temporarily reduced to Smith and Nagle when a short US tour ended in April 1998 with onstage rows in New York, which resulted in Smith unplugging the amps during songs and lashing out at the other members, leading Burns to physically shove him. This led to the departure of Hanley (bassist of nineteen years), Burns, and guitarist Tommy Crooks. The following day, Smith was arrested and charged with assaulting Nagle in their hotel. Despite this, Nagle remained with the band. The Smith and Nagle line-up would release two albums: &quot;The Marshall Suite&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Unutterable&quot; (2000).

=== 2001–2017: later years ===

Further rifts within the band followed in 2001, which led to a new line-up of Smith, Ben Pritchard (guitar), Ed Blaney (guitar), Jim Watts (bass), and Spencer Birtwistle (drums) releasing &quot;Are You Are Missing Winner&quot; that year to mixed reviews. Spencer Birtwistle was replaced by Dave Milner on drums in November 2001. September 2002 saw Elena Poulou–Smith&#x27;s third wife–fill the vacant position of keyboards player, and that year &quot;Q&quot; magazine named the Fall one of &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;. &quot;The Real New Fall LP&quot; (renamed from &quot;Country on the Click&quot; after an earlier mix of the album appeared on Internet file sharing networks) followed in 2003, with a slightly different mix and some extra tracks for the US version, after which Jim Watts was sacked (replaced by Steve Trafford) and Milner was replaced by a returning Spencer Birtwistle. In 2004 the band released its first career-spanning compilation to positive reviews in June, and a new album, Interim, in November.
In January 2005, the Fall were the subject of a BBC Four TV documentary, &quot;The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith&quot;. Their twenty-fifth studio album, entitled &quot;Fall Heads Roll&quot;, was issued on 3 October 2005. The guitarist, bassist, and drummer all left the group acrimoniously during the US summer 2006 tour after just four dates. In a US radio interview, Smith described their departures as &quot;the best thing that ever happened&quot; to the Fall, although it was some months before he confirmed that they would not be returning.

Early in 2007 the Fall released the &quot;Reformation Post TLC&quot; album, recorded with the same lineup that salvaged the 2006 US tour. Yet another lineup released &quot;Imperial Wax Solvent&quot;, in 2008; this lineup would hold for the following three albums, and the core of Peter Greenway (guitar), David Spurr (bass), and Keiron Melling (drums) for the remainder of the band&#x27;s existence. In April 2009, the Fall signed with UK-based independent record label Domino Records. A new studio album, titled &quot;Your Future Our Clutter&quot;, was released on 26 April 2010 and followed in November 2011 by the album &quot;Ersatz GB&quot;. In March 2012, the band were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival he curated in Minehead, England. The Fall released their twenty-ninth studio album, &quot;Re-Mit&quot;, in 2013.

In 2014, former members Brix Smith Start, Steve Hanley and Paul Hanley formed a new group called Brix &amp; the Extricated. In addition to new original material, the group also performs songs that the members had written or co-written during their tenure with the Fall. Smith Start and Steve Hanley also both released autobiographies covering their tenures with the Fall around this time frame; 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Rise, the Fall &amp; the Rise&quot; and 2014&#x27;s &quot;The Big Midweek: Life Inside the Fall&quot;, respectively.

The Fall&#x27;s thirtieth album, &quot;Sub-Lingual Tablet&quot;, was released in 2015. This would be Elena Poulou&#x27;s last album with the band: in a 2016 interview with &quot;Mojo Magazine&quot;, Smith announced that she had resigned; they would divorce that year. The Fall&#x27;s thirty-first and final studio album, &quot;New Facts Emerge,&quot; was recorded as a four-piece and released in July 2017. Michael Clapham joined in May 2017 on keyboards, but never recorded with the band. Following Smith&#x27;s death, Greenway, Spurr and Melling recruited singer and guitarist Sam Curran to form a new band, Imperial Wax.
===Death of Mark E. Smith===
Early in 2017, there were reports that Smith was ill, and over the year numerous live dates were cancelled or postponed for reasons of health, including a week&#x27;s dates in New York. Having become weak due to a change in medicine, he performed a number of shows in a wheelchair. His final performance and last appearance in public took place at the Queen Margaret Union, Glasgow, on 4 November 2017. Another show was scheduled for the Fiddlers, Bristol, on 29 November; Smith travelled to Bristol but was then too unwell to leave his hotel room. The other members of the group made a brief appearance on stage and apologised to the people who had come to see the Fall.

On 24 January 2018, Smith died at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester after a long illness. He was 60 years old. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal lung and kidney cancer, which his family confirmed had contributed to his death. The announcement of Smith&#x27;s death was made by his partner and Fall manager Pamela Vander. Smith had been an alcoholic and periodic drug user for much of his adult life, and had undergone treatment on a number of occasions. His condition led to him falling and suffering bone fragmentation a number of times from the mid 2000s, leading to his performing several dates in a wheelchair and cast. A heavy smoker, Smith had long suffered from throat and respiratory problems; yet his work ethic or output never declined and he continued to release a new album close to once a year.

===Posthumous projects===
In August 2018, Cherry Red Records, the Fall&#x27;s final label, announced they had purchased the rights to 40 Fall albums from Smith before his death and plan to release a reissue series and box set sometime in the future.

==Smith&#x27;s vocal style and lyrics==
Smith&#x27;s vocal delivery was known for his tendency to end each phrase terminating in a consonant with an added schwa vocalisation (&quot;ah&quot;). He often spoke-sang or sing-slurred his lyrics, especially from the mid-1990s. His delivery, particularly when playing live, could be described as &quot;rambling&quot;, and he often interjected improvised rants.

His lyrics, delivered in a heavy Mancunian accent, are often cryptic, absurdist and inscrutable, and were described by critic Simon Reynolds as &quot;a kind of Northern English magic realism that mixed industrial grime with the unearthly and uncanny, voiced through a unique, one-note delivery somewhere between amphetamine-spiked rant and alcohol-addled yarn.&quot; Smith described his approach as wanting to combine &quot;primitive music with intelligent lyrics&quot;. Thematically, his frequently densely layered lyrics often centre around descriptions of urban grotesques, gloomy landscapes, &quot;crackpot history&quot;, and are infused with regional slang.

Fragments of Smith&#x27;s lyrics often appeared handwritten on early Fall album and single covers, along with collages he had put together. In a 1983 interview with &quot;Sounds&quot;, Smith said that he liked artwork to reflect the album content and that his graphic choices reflected his attitude to music. He mentioned how he was drawn to cheap and misspelled posters, amateur layouts of local papers and printed cash and carry signs with &quot;inverted commas where you don&#x27;t need them&quot;.

== Influence ==

On the group&#x27;s influence, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;the Fall, like many cult bands, inspired a new generation of underground bands, ranging from waves of sound-alike indie rockers in the UK to acts in America and New Zealand, which is only one indication of the size and dedication of their small, devoted fan base.&quot;

The Fall influenced groups and artists such as Pavement, Franz Ferdinand, Yung Lean, Happy Mondays, Sonic Youth, These New Puritans, LCD Soundsystem, as well as the Russian group Grazhdanskaya Oborona. Sonic Youth covered three Fall songs (and &quot;Victoria&quot; by the Kinks, also covered by the Fall) in a 1988 Peel session, which was released in 1990 as an EP, &quot;4 Tunna Brix&quot;, on Sonic Youth&#x27;s own Goofin&#x27; label. The Pixies covered &quot;Big New Prinz&quot; during their 2013 world tour. The 1990s indie acts Pavement (who recorded a version of &quot;The Classical&quot;) and Elastica (Smith contributed vocals to their final EP and album) showed an influence of the Fall, while Suede parodied the band with &quot;Implement Yeah!&quot;, a song found on the cassette edition of their 1999 single &quot;Electricity&quot;.

==Members==

Since the Fall formed in 1976, Mark E. Smith was the only constant member. All of the other founding members had left by the end of 1979, although Martin Bramah returned to the band from 1989 to 1990. Of the 66 musicians who came and went over the band&#x27;s 40-year existence, about one third played in the band for less than a year. The final line-up consisted of Smith, Pete Greenway, Dave Spurr, Keiron Melling and Michael Clapham. Melling, Spurr and Greenway joined the band in 2006.

Smith once remarked, in an oft-quoted quip about the band&#x27;s frequent lineup changes, &quot;If it&#x27;s me and your granny on bongos, it&#x27;s The Fall.&quot;

<text>Telstra Group Limited is an Australian telecommunications company that builds and operates telecommunications networks and markets related products and services. It is a member of the S&amp;P/ASX 20 stock index, and is Australia&#x27;s largest telecommunications company by market share.

Telstra has a long history in Australia, originating together with Australia Post as the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department upon federation in 1901. Telstra had transitioned from a state-owned enterprise to a fully privatised company by 2006.

==History==
Australia&#x27;s telecommunications services were originally controlled by the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department (PMG), formed in 1901 as a result of Australian Federation. Prior to 1901, telecommunications were administered by each colony. On 1 July 1975, separate commissions were established by statute to replace the PMG. Responsibility for postal services was transferred to the Australian Postal Commission (Australia Post). The Australian Telecommunications Commission, trading as Telecom Australia, ran domestic telecommunication services.

In 1989, the ATC introduced new buildings and frameworks.

In 1993, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, a separate government body established in 1946, was merged with the Australian Telecommunications Corporation into the short-lived Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) which continued trading under the established identities of Telecom and OTC. The AOTC was renamed to Telstra Corporation Limited in 1993. The name &quot;Telstra&quot; is derived from &quot;Telecom Australia&quot;. The corporation then traded under the &quot;Telstra&quot; brand internationally and &quot;Telecom Australia&quot; domestically until uniform branding of &quot;Telstra&quot; was introduced throughout the entire organisation in 1995, following an unsuccessful attempt to register the trademark &quot;Telecom Australia&quot;.

Telstra has faced competition since the early 1990s from Optus (Australia&#x27;s second largest communication company) and a number of smaller providers. Telstra once retained ownership of the fixed-line telephone network, but since the nationwide upgrade to the National Broadband Network (NBN), the Australian Government now has legal ownership of these lines since 2007, though Telstra has played a big part in this upgrade supplying resources to the Government on the new network. Telstra also has pay TV and owns 35% of the Australian media company Foxtel.

===Overseas Telecommunications Commission===

The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) was established by an Act of Parliament in August 1946. It inherited facilities and resources from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited (AWA) and Cable &amp; Wireless, and was charged with responsibility for all international telecommunications services into, through and out of Australia.

On 1 February 1992, it was merged with Australia&#x27;s domestic telecommunications carrier, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Limited (&quot;Telecom&quot;), to create the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Limited (AOTC). The new organisation underwent a corporate identity review and was subsequently renamed Telstra Corporation Limited (&quot;Telstra&quot;) for international business in 1993 and domestic business in 1995.

===Privatisation===
Beginning in 1997 and finalizing in 2011, the federal government began to privatise the corporation. The first three stages were initiated by the Liberal–National Coalition&#x27;s Howard government: the first, informally known as &quot;T1&quot; (with shares priced at $3.30), occurred in 1997. &quot;T2&quot; ($7.40) followed in 1999; &quot;T3&quot; ($3.60) in 2006.
In T1, the government sold one third of its shares in Telstra for A$14 billion and publicly listed the company on the Australian Stock Exchange. In 1998, a further 16% of Telstra shares were sold to the public, leaving the Australian government with 51% ownership. In 2006, T3 was announced by the government and was the largest of the three public releases, reducing the government&#x27;s ownership of Telstra to 17%. The 17% remainder of Telstra was placed in Australia&#x27;s Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established mainly to meet future liabilities for payment of superannuation to retired federal public servants. In 2009, the Future Fund sold off another $2.4 billion worth of shares, reducing the government&#x27;s stake in Telstra to 10.9%. In August 2011, under Labor&#x27;s Gillard government, the Future Fund sold its remaining &quot;above market weight&quot; Telstra shares, reducing its holding to 0.8% of the shares, effectively completing Telstra&#x27;s privatisation.

With more than one million shareholders, Telstra is currently the most widely held ASX-listed company.
===National Broadband Network===

On 26 November 2008, Telstra submitted a non-complying tender issued by the federal government to build a National Broadband Network, a 12-page letter proposing a $5 billion broadband network covering between 80 and 90 percent of the Australian population in major cities, despite the tender requiring 98 percent coverage.

As a result, Telstra was removed from the National Broadband Network RFP process on 15 December 2008. In response, Telstra announced that it would raise speeds on its existing Next G network and HFC &quot;cable&quot; network so that they both offer higher speeds than the RFP for the NBN requires. Following Telstra&#x27;s exclusion from the National Broadband Network bidding process Telstra&#x27;s share price suffered the biggest one-day percentage fall in its history.

NBN Co Limited signed a definitive agreement with Telstra on , estimated to be worth post-tax net present value, building upon the signing of a financial heads of agreement a year beforehand. Telstra agreed to &quot;disconnect&quot;&lt;ref name=&#x27;joint-committee-16/5/11-p16&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; its Internet customers from the copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial networks in areas where FTTP has been installed, and agreed to lease dark fibre, exchange space and ducts to NBN Co. As part of the agreement, Telstra would not be able to market their mobile network as an alternative to the NBN for a number of years. Telstra remains the owner of its networks.&lt;ref name=&#x27;joint-committee-16/5/11-p16,31&#x27;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2011, Telstra shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal.

On 14 December 2014 it was announced that in a A$11b renegotiated deal Telstra will transfer ownership of its copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks to NBN while disconnecting premises from these networks. This ownership allows NBN Co to use these networks &quot;where it sees fit in for its multi-technology NBN rollout.&quot;

=== David Thodey era (2010–2015) ===
Under the leadership of David Thodey, Telstra embarked upon a transformation agenda to become more sales and service focused.
As part of that, an ambitious customer service agenda was defined.

In 2014, Telstra was named &quot;most respected company&quot; by the Australian Financial Review newspaper.

==== Market share recovery ====
Early in 2010, Telstra announced the creation of a $1 billion &quot;fighting fund&quot; to be used in a concerted effort to win back market share in key product categories. This effort seems to have paid off with strong sales momentum announced in February 2011.

==== Customer service recovery ====
As part of its new strategy, Telstra announced that its &quot;goal is for customer service to be fundamental to everything we do&quot;. In August 2011, Telstra Digital announced expansion of customer service into social media with 24/7 coverage. By November 2012, Telstra claimed 140,000 live chats for the month and a growth rate of this service of 600% p.a. In October 2013, Telstra announced that it had grown its Live Chat workforce to 600 and its social media workforce to 30. Customer Service became a pillar of the corporation’s social responsibility ethos according to Telstra’s head of social services Gerard Devan and the Telstra foundation. 

The following table shows total complaints handled by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) 2010–2015, and of those, the ones made against Telstra.

==== Telstra Digital ====
In February 2011, Telstra announced the formation of Telstra Digital under the leadership of Gerd Schenkel who was hired from National Australia Bank/UBank. Telstra Digital&#x27;s initial purpose was to improve the use of digital channels for customer service. In April 2011, Telstra Digital relaunched its web homepage design. In July 2011, Telstra Digital launched &quot;CrowdSupport&quot;, an online forum to crowd source customer service. As of July 2017, Telstra&#x27;s &quot;CrowdSupport&quot; had 463,000 posts. It was also cited as an example of &quot;scaling at the edge&quot; by Deloitte&#x27;s Centre for the Edge.

In September 2011, Telstra Digital launched a new account services portal to help achieve its goal of managing 35% of Telstra&#x27;s transactions. In October 2011, Telstra Digital announced a new mobile smartphone optimised version of its website. In November 2011, Telstra Digital launched an iPhone app on a trial basis as well as a new online mobile phone shop.
In July 2012, Telstra Digital launched smartphone and Facebook apps for customers to manage their Telstra accounts and in November 2012, Telstra claimed that over 700,000 customers had downloaded those apps. In August 2013, Telstra revealed that the apps reached 2.5 million downloads.

At a results announcement, CEO David Thodey remarked that &quot;the group&#x27;s new online strategy was delivering&quot; in the context of a 28% reduction of inbound service calls. Telstra estimated that its digital program will provide productivity benefits of $100 million in the 2013 financial year from lower printing costs, decreasing commissions to third parties, and reduced dependence on call centre staff.

In October 2012, Telstra&#x27;s CEO David Thodey stated, &quot;The rise of online and social media had &#x27;fundamentally changed the way&#x27; which the company communicated with its customers&quot;. In a 2015 Deloitte report, Telstra disclosed that its &quot;CrowdSupport&quot; service community had generated 200,000 pieces of user-generated content. In August 2016, Telstra disclosed that &quot;more than 60%&quot; of visitors to &quot;CrowdSupport&quot; manage to find an answer on the community.

In February 2013, Telstra introduced the ability to pay its bills via PayPal. And in June 2013, Telstra launched a new website, including the ability for customers to link their online accounts to their Facebook identity.

In March 2014, Telstra announced a new digital development program called &quot;Digital First&quot; with a stated aim to conduct 65 to 70 percent of its transactions online. Telstra published a white paper sharing some key metrics of its digital program:
In September 2014, Telstra announced the opening of a &quot;Digital Transformation Centre&quot; in Sydney to design and built new digital tools for its service systems.

In June 2014, Telstra disclosed that it had 3 million customers on &quot;electronic billing&quot; saving it $3 million per month in costs. Telstra also mentioned that live chat accounted for 10% of total contact centre activity.

In December 2015, Telstra Digital launched customer service on Periscope.

In October 2016, the executive director of Telstra Digital Gerd Schenkel left Telstra to become CEO of a fintech company.

==== Retail store network ====
Telstra owns and operates a series of retail stores known as Telstra Stores. Some are directly owned and operated by Telstra and some are operated by licensees.

As of May 2016, Telstra has a total of 360 retail stores across Australia. This includes several new &#x27;Discovery&#x27; stores, where Telstra has invested millions in redesigning key stores based on local requirements. These designs include new displays, accessory shops, digital tickets and free baristas.

109 of Telstra&#x27;s stores are owned and operated by Vita Group, a publicly listed company with a market capitalisation of approximately $600m (June 2016).

In February 2011, Telstra announced the creation of an additional 100 retail stores within three years.

The carrier opened the world&#x27;s first Android store, called &quot;Androidland&quot;, on Bourke Street, Melbourne, Australia, in December 2011.

These developments built on Telstra&#x27;s T[life] concept stores it had launched in the early 2000s.

==== New brand ====
In October 2011, Telstra launched a new brand identity and colour scheme. The new identity launched with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s how we connect&quot;, and features the &quot;T&quot; from the previous logo in a variety of colors. This was followed by a &quot;brand refresh&quot; in February 2014 and again in 2016. In 2013, Telstra was assessed as Australia&#x27;s third most valuable brand, after Woolworths and BHP Billiton. In 2016 Telstra became Australia&#x27;s most valuable brand, which it maintained in 2017.

==== Sponsorships ====
Telstra sponsors numerous awards around Australia, including the Australian Business of the Year award, the MYOB Small Business Award, and the National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) which has become known as the Telstra Award. Notable past winners include Vaxine, APS Plastics, and eWAY. Telstra also set up a social services CEO round table under Gerard Devan which acted as a &quot;Think Tank&quot; to the sector.

Telstra was a major sponsor of the V8 Supercars car racing championship through its BigPond brand and directly sponsored the Sydney Telstra 500 event, the final round of the series held at Sydney Olympic Park. The sport ended this deal at the conclusion of the 2012 season.

Telstra had naming rights to the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne from 2002 until 2009. Telstra is also the naming rights sponsor of the National Rugby League Premiership. Telstra is also the principal sponsor of Swimming Australia. They also sponsored the Minardi team for the 2002 Formula One season, and the Rally Australia 2006 Championships.

Telstra also had the naming rights (under TelstraClear) for the TelstraClear Pacific events centre in Manukau City, New Zealand.

In September 2021 Telstra solutions and Telstra Purple announced a partnership with eVTOL racing series Airspeeder. The deal centred around providing a service to transmit terabytes of data for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communications for the EXA series. This deal incorporated on-vehicle branding for Telstra.

==== Share price development ====
In November 1997, the Australian government sold the first tranche of its Telstra shares, 4.29 Billion shares, publicly at a price of $3.40 per share to institutional investors and $3.30 to retail investors. This sale is commonly referred to as &quot;T1&quot;. In October 1999, the Australian government sold the second tranche of its Telstra shares under the &quot;T2&quot; program for $7.80 per share to institutional investors and $7.40 to retail investors. In November 2006, the government sold a third tranche of its shares, &quot;T3&quot;, at $3.60 per share.

Since its privatisation, Telstra shares have hit a low of just over $2.50 per share in late 2010. Since then, Telstra shares have risen to $5 per share in December 2013 and $6 per share in December 2014.
On 17 May 2019 the shares closed on the ASX at $3.56 up from a twelve-month low of $2.547 per share

In February 2014, Telstra raised its dividend from 14c to 14.5c per share.

Amid the global pandemic crisis of the coronavirus in 2020, Telstra was one of three companies of the ASX 200 to gain in the week starting 15 March. It increased by 1.8 percent on the Australian Securities Exchange.

==== Sale of Sensis ====
In January 2014, Telstra announced its intention to sell 70% of Sensis to Platinum Equity for $454 million. Sensis was said to have once been &quot;one of Telstra&#x27;s most lucrative businesses&quot; and reportedly &quot;has been under pressure in recent years amid competition from more agile digital alternatives such as Google&quot;.

In February 2014, Telstra was reportedly seeking to reduce Sensis employment by 400 to 1,000 positions.

==== New health business unit ====
In September 2013, Telstra launched a new health business unit – Telstra Health and hired Shane Solomon as the head.

In September 2016, Telstra Health was awarded a $220m government contract amidst claims of &quot;lack of transparency&quot;.

Shane Solomon left Telstra in Nov 2016.

===== Telstra Health Acquisitions =====
==== National Broadband Network (NBN) ====
In December 2014, Telstra signed an agreement with the federal government&#x27;s A.C.N. 86 136 533 741 (NBN Co) Limited. This agreement is said to retain the $11b value for Telstra of the original agreement from October 2011 and will see the company progressively sell its copper and Hybrid fiber-coaxial networks to A.C.N. 86 136 533 741 (NBN Co) Limited.

=== Andrew Penn era (2015–2022) ===
On 19 February 2015, Telstra announced that CEO David Thodey would retire on 1 May 2015 and be replaced by successor Andy Penn. Penn&#x27;s era was marked by the very difficult transition to the NBN, a government policy decision which had significant implications for Telstra. Penn indicated new focus on growth in the core business with a pulling back from international markets, including the discontinuation of a joint venture to build a mobile phone network in the Philippines. On 14 March 2016, Telstra ended their talks between the company and the Philippine-based conglomerate San Miguel Corporation for a planned joint telecommunications venture in the Philippines due to several factors.

In 2016, Telstra suffered a series of network outages for which the company apologised. In December of that year, Telstra announced the appointment of Robyn Denholm as its new COO, following the departure of Kate McKenzie who left after the network outages. In December, Telstra announced the hire of a new CTO to replace the predecessor who left amongst allegations of CV fraud. In 2016, the government raised the possibility that Telstra&#x27;s regional mobile network may be forced to be opened to competitor&#x27; use under a roaming scheme. A prospect strongly being fought by Telstra. Penn announced a $3bn investment program to strength its networks and as a platform for future digital investments.

In February 2017, Telstra announced that revenue had dropped 3.5%, Net Profit After Tax had dropped by over 14% due to the impact of the rollout of the NBN by the Australian Government. As a result, Telstra&#x27;s share price dropped by 4.5% on the same day. In August 2017, Telstra announced that it would cut its dividend in response to the financial implications of the NBN and to fund its network investments, leading to a drop in share price by over 10% in a single day to reach a 5-year low.

==== T22 strategy ====
In June 2018, Telstra announced its Telstra2022 strategy designed to face into headwinds from the NBN rollout and return the business to growth. Composed of four pillars, the strategy was designed to remove $1 billion of operating costs from the business, simplifying its overall structure and leading to six key outcomes: improve customer experiences, simplify its products and operating model, extend network superiority and 5G leadership, achieve global high performance in employee engagement, reduce net productivity costs, and attain a return on capital investment post the NBN rollout.

On 20 June 2018, Telstra announced a reduction of 9,500 jobs (8,000 net job losses after considering 1,500 new roles to be created) as part of its &quot;Telstra 2022&quot; (T22) plan.

===== InfraCo =====
Created on 1 July 2018, Telstra InfraCo would serve as the infrastructure business, owning an estimated $11 billion AUD in assets made up of data centres, non-mobiles related domestic fibre, copper, HFC, subsea cables, exchanges, poles, ducts, and pipes. InfraCo opened its dark fibre network across six Australian state capitals in February 2021. Telstra said the dark fibre network would open up a wealth of capabilities and control for its targeted audience of network operates and service providers such as global carriers, data centre operators, internet service producers and over the top providers according to Infrastructure Chief Ross Lambi.

===== Retail store strategy =====
In February 2021, Telstra announced plans to take back full ownership of its 337 retail stores. At the time of the announcement Telstra owned and operated 67 of its stores, Vita Group owned and operated 104 stores, and the remaining 166 were operated by individual licensees. The process of transitioning stores back to Telstra ownership took around 12 to 18 months to complete. As part of the T22 program Telstra also brought its call centres back on shore.

Ultimately the T22 strategy proved to be very successful with a significant improvement in customer metrics, employee engagement, a return to profitable growth supported by a $2.7 bn reduction in annualised costs. Telstra&#x27;s share price increased more than 50% from a low in 2018 of $2.63 to more than $4 in 2022.

=== Vicki Brady era (2022–present) ===
On 30 March 2022, Telstra announced that Vicki Brady would become the new chief executive officer effective 1 September 2022. In December 2023, Telstra acquired Versent, a provider of cloud transformation and security products and services, for $267.5 million. 

On 21 May 2024, Brady announced plans to lay off 2,800 employees by the end of 2024. Most of these roles would be in the B2B Telstra Enterprise division, with 377 roles in consultancy for redundancy. Brady said the changes were part of the company&#x27;s transition towards AI technology. Communication Workers Union national assistant secretary James Perkins criticised the lack of staff warning prior to the announcement.

In December 2024, Telstra announced it would acquire Boost Mobile, an MVNO which operates on its mobile network.

==Products and services==

===Fixed-line and mobile telephony===

Telstra is Australia&#x27;s incumbent and largest provider of fixed-line services. These include home phone, business and other PSTN products.

Telstra outsources a significant portion of network installation and maintenance to private contractors and joint ventures, such as ABB Communications and STCJV (Siemens Thiess Communications Joint Venture).

Telstra also owns and maintains the majority of Australia&#x27;s public telephones. In 2006, Telstra announced it would remove many of the phones, citing vandalism and the increasing adoption of mobile telephones. Telstra&#x27;s support page has a payphones section where information about their plans to add, remove, or move payphones can be found.

Telstra Mobile is Australia&#x27;s largest mobile telephone service providers, in terms of both subscriptions and coverage. Telstra operates Australia&#x27;s largest GSM and 3G UMTS (branded as Next G) mobile telephony networks in Australia, as well as holding a 50% stake in the 3GIS Ltd 2100 MHz UMTS network infrastructure, shared with Hutchison (Three). In September 2007, Telstra had an estimated 9.3M mobile subscribers. Telstra Mobile services are available in post-paid and prepaid payment types, known as Telstra Pre-Paid (formerly communic8 Pre-Paid).

Telstra&#x27;s GSM network was the first digital mobile network in Australia. It was launched in April 1993 on the 900 MHz band as &quot;Telstra MobileNet Digital&quot;. The GSM network has carried the majority of Telstra&#x27;s mobile subscribers for the last 10 years and has seen numerous upgrades. 1800 MHz capacity channels were added to the network in the late 1990s as well as GPRS packet data transmission capabilities. As part of the UMTS Next G deployment, the GSM network was also upgraded to a full EDGE data transmission capability in 2006 providing data transmission capabilities greater than 40 kbit/s on its GSM network.

In 1981, Telstra (then Telecom Australia) was the first company to provide mobile telephony services in Australia. The first automated mobile service operated in the major capital cities on 500 MHz using the &#x27;007&#x27; dialling prefix. This network only provided &quot;car phone&quot; capabilities to subscribers as portable hand-held terminals were not practical at that time. The first cellular system in Australia offering portable hand-held phones was launched by Telstra in 1987 using the AMPS analogue standard on the 800 MHz band. This network at its peak had over 1 million subscribers, but was mandated by the government to be closed down by 2000, partially due to privacy concerns which resulted from the AMPS technology, but also because of arrangements undertaken to secure sufficient interest in the GSM network licenses offered in 1992 to competitors. A license condition placed on Telstra to maintain an equivalent coverage footprint at the time resulted in Telstra deciding to deploy an IS-95 CDMA network in its place.

Telstra operated over 7,400 Next G Base Stations in 2010.

===Internet===

====Wholesale====
Telstra Wholesale provides products such as Data, Mobile, Voice, and other Facilities (including Co-location and Duct Access) to other companies and organisations for re-sale. Telstra Wholesale also provides operational support for its customers, and facilities for international customers such as International Data Transport and IP Transport.

Due to Telstra&#x27;s position as Australia&#x27;s incumbent telecommunications provider, Telstra Wholesale is the incumbent and dominant wholesaler of ADSL services to other Internet Service Providers. Telstra installed the first DSLAMs in exchanges prior to 2000, and began wholesaling access in late 2000. Telstra Wholesale has a comprehensive network of ADSL DSLAMs (the largest in Australia) and allows competitors access to each Telstra DSLAM at up to ADSL2+ speeds if available, and at ADSL1 speeds should 2+ be unavailable.

Since 2013, Telstra has wholesaled its 3G and 4G network. However the wholesale product only gives access to 7000 of Telstra&#x27;s over 8000 base stations, and does not include access to its faster 4GX and 5G networks.

====Retail internet====
As an internet service provider (ISP), Telstra provides internet services for personal and business clients. Telstra uses various delivery methods for its internet products via BigPond (now Telstra Media), including ADSL, Cable Internet, Dialup, Satellite, and Wireless Internet (through the Next G network)).

At the end of the 2007 financial year, BigPond had over two million broadband subscribers. In 2007 a survey of 14,000 people by PC Authority magazine found BigPond users rated poorly for customer service, and less than a third considered their service value for money. However, BigPond argued that the survey&#x27;s structure had encouraged people to provide extreme opinions. In January 2009, Telstra was ranked as the top Australian ISP in terms of performance by Epitiro.

=====Cable internet=====
*Cable – Telstra is Australia&#x27;s largest provider of Cable Internet access, which covers parts of Australia&#x27;s main cities (Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Sydney, Adelaide and the Gold Coast). Speeds available are &#x27;Turbo&#x27; (8 Mbit/s downstream, 128 kbit/s upstream), &#x27;Elite&#x27; (30 Mbit/s down, 1 Mbit/s up) and &#x27;Ultimate&#x27; (100 Mbit/s down, 2 Mbit/s up).
Telstra owned and operated the largest cable internet Hybrid Fibre cable network in Australia. Telstra Cable operates in selected cities and areas of Australia including (Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and the Gold Coast), providing downstream speeds of up to 30 Mbit/s in selected areas. The upgrade to 100 Mbit/s was complete in Melbourne by Christmas 2009, and launched the new DOCSIS 3.0 services on 1 December 2009 before the deadline.

This network has since been acquired by the National Broadband Network Company (NBNCo) for public cable broadband but is still used to distribute Cable TV under the Foxtel brand.

=====ADSL internet=====
*ADSL – Telstra provides both ADSL and ADSL2+ services where available, with speeds ranging from 256 kbit/s down/64 kbit/s up to 20 Mbit/s down/1 Mbit/s up. The current speeds available on ADSL plans that Telstra offers are &quot;up to&quot; 1.5 Mbit/s down/256 kbit/s up, &quot;up to&quot; 8 Mbit/s down/384 kbit/s up and &quot;up to&quot; 20 Mbit/s down/1 Mbit/s up.
:Naked DSL – A six-week trial of two kinds of naked DSL to &quot;assess customer demand&quot; was launched on 1 June 2010. &#x27;Pure DSL&#x27; having the ability to receive incoming calls and make emergency calls, and &#x27;Naked DSL&#x27; being offered without a dial tone.

On 10 November 2006, Telstra made two major changes to their ADSL network. The first was an increase of wholesale ADSL speeds from 1.5 Mbit/s/256 kbit/s to 8 Mbit/s/384 kbit/s. Telstra also released an ADSL2+ broadband service offering download speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s from exchanges where competitors were already offering ADSL2+ services.

On 6 February 2008, Telstra announced that it would activate high-speed ADSL2+ broadband in a further 900 telephone exchanges serving 2.4 million consumers across every state and territory in Australia. Telstra also claimed that it has received assurances from the Government that it would not be forced to wholesale these services to other providers, and that the move came &quot;after the Government made clear it did not consider a compelling case had been made for regulating third-party access to the service – an assurance sought by Telstra for more than one year&quot;.

On 10 June 2008, it was announced that Telstra was in discussions with some wholesale customers in reference to wholesaling ADSL2+ services.

=====Mobile broadband=====
* Mobile Broadband – Through their Next G network, Telstra provides the largest wireless network coverage in Australia, reaching 99% of the population. Download speeds on the 3G network range from 256 kbit/s to 3.5 Mbit/s in regional and interurban areas, and &quot;up to&quot; 21 Mbit/s in metropolitan and city areas. Download speeds on the 4G Network are &quot;up to&quot; 100 Mbit/s. The Telstra mobile network now has 4GX and 5G in all capital CBDs and selected suburban and regional areas and is progressively rolling out. In other coverage areas around Australia, Mobile devices that are capable will automatically switch to the fastest available 5G 4G or 3G. Typical download speeds in 4GX areas are 5 -300 Mbit/s with category 16 devices, 5–200 Mbit/s with category 11 devices, 5–150 Mbit/s with category 9 devices, 2–100 Mbit/s with category 6 devices, and 2–75 Mbit/s with category 4 devices. Telstra also provides wireless &#x27;hot spots&#x27;.

=====Satellite internet=====
* Satellite – Telstra provides satellite internet mainly for regional customers who are too far away from the exchange to get ADSL, and cannot get Cable. Satellite is delivered via 2 way Satellite with speeds ranging from 256 kbit/s down/64 kbit/s up to 800 kbit/s down/128 kbit/s up.

=====Dial-up internet=====
* Dial-up – Telstra offered dialup internet from 1995 until early 2015. However they have now ceased selling the service, and existing retail and wholesale customers have been migrated off of Dial-up.

===Low-cost mobile and internet brand===
In October 2013 Telstra launched &quot;Belong&quot;, a low-cost mobile and internet service provider. As of February 2020, Belong has over 600,000 services made up of almost 340,000 mobile services and around 300,000 broadband internet services. Belong is Australia&#x27;s first carbon neutral telecommunications provider certified by Climate Active, a partnership between the Australian Government and businesses that encourages voluntary action to reduce the impacts of climate change.

===Subscription television===
Telstra&#x27;s Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) (commonly referred to as &quot;cable&quot;) network is one of the delivery systems used by the Australian Subscription Television provider Foxtel. Telstra owns 35% of Foxtel in a joint venture with News Corp Australia who own the remainder. Telstra also sell Foxtel&#x27;s &quot;iQ digital-video-recorder&quot; to customers in Foxtel&#x27;s service area (as &quot;Foxtel from Telstra&quot;). Telstra offers discounts for Telstra full-service fixed-line customers, with internet, pay TV and/or mobile services with Telstra. Such discounts can include free installation and the first month of the best Foxtel package (all channels) for free.

===Entertainment and content===

====BigPond Music====

MOG, a subscription online music service and blog network, announced a partnership with Telstra offer their product in Australia – the first region outside of the United States to have access. Telstra and MOG launched under the BigPond Music branding on 21 June 2012, 

====BigPond Games and GameArena====

GameArena was a website dedicated to video gaming operating under the BigPond brand that was managed by Mammoth Media and based on the east coast of Australia. The site provided news, downloads and servers primarily for the PC, and Mac, though it later branched out to include console sites. GameArena provided an online game shop GameNow, which sported various benefits to Telstra customers.

Usage of the GameArena file library, gaming servers and booking service were freely available to anyone, but provided specific advantages to Telstra customers such as preference in downloads and unmetered usage, as well as various bonuses in competitions. In 2005, GameArena went through a new shift with the merging of GameNow and Gameshop into itself. The name became simply BigPond GameArena.

GameArena once operated over 100 gaming servers, which were monitored by a volunteer force of administrators, known as GameOps. &quot;GameCreate&quot; was a service offered free of charge where users may book a server for a specific game for a 2-hour period of time. This server was private and could be used for either ladder training or social events.

GameArena servers and its website closed on 20 October 2014.

====The Pond in &quot;Second Life&quot;====
Telstra BigPond owned and operated a number of virtual islands in the online game &quot;Second Life&quot; for approximately three years. BigPond closed its &quot;Second Life&quot; presence in December 2009.

====Facebook====
In 2011, Telstra launched &quot;Blurtl&quot;, a Facebook application that allows the user to leave audio messages on their Facebook walls.

==== Payphones ====
In 2021, Telstra made its pay phones free
* so that they can be used in emergencies
** for when mobile phones are out of service due fire, flood, storms, flat batteries, no nearby mobile tower, etc.
* declining use would have meant that the cost of collection exceeded the revenue anyhow
* for the benefit of people without a mobile phone
* good publicity

==Mobile networks==
The following is a list of known active mobile networks used by Telstra:
February 2011: Ericsson wins the LTE contract with Telstra. The LTE network is being deployed in capital city CBDs and select regional centres throughout 2011. It will operate at 1800 MHz and integrate with a HSPA+ service at 850 MHz. A dual mode (LTE/HSPA+) mobile broadband device has been developed for the network.

January 2012: Initial major LTE rollout complete. Incremental rollout continues, widening the coverage in capital cities and introducing new LTE coverage to regional centres.

July 2012: Telstra commences retailing a pocket-sized battery powered 4G WiFi router (ZTE MF91) for prepaid data customers, locked to Telstra, complementing its range of 4G-capable devices. Apart from the ZTE MF91, the Telstra 4G hardware range now comprises two dual mode (4G/3G) voice-capable handsets by HTC and ZTE (available for purchase outright or on a post-paid plan), a Sierra USB wireless modem (outright or post-paid plan), a ZTE USB wireless modem (prepaid, locked to Telstra) and a Sierra 4G Wifi battery powered pocket-sized router (outright or post-paid plan). Telstra is reported to now be operating LTE facilities from more than 3,500 transmission sites.

August 2013: Telstra demonstrates the world&#x27;s first ever LTE- Advanced Carrier Aggregation network using the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz spectrum bands in the Sunshine Coast.

April 2014: Telstra introduced a mobile broadband device from Huawei (&quot;E5786&quot;) with LTE Advanced capability.

May 2014: Telstra and Ericsson demonstrate world first 450 Mbit/s LTE-A downlink speeds in a commercial network with a Category 9 device.

September 2015: Telstra, in collaboration with NETGEAR, Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies announce that it is bringing the world&#x27;s first 4G LTE Advanced 600 Mbit/s Category 11 device to customers.

September 2016: Telstra conducts the first live 5G trial in Australia with Ericsson, demonstrating 5G capabilities in a real world environment, including speed and beam steering tests.

December 2016: Telstra shuts down the 900 MHz GSM/EDGE network on 1 December. Prior to this, EDGE data capabilities were available on 100% of the GSM networks used.

January 2017: Telstra launches world&#x27;s first Gigabit LTE-Advanced mobile network.

March 2019: Telstra closed the 2100 MHz (Band 1) section of its 3G network on 25 March.

May 2020: Telstra made available Australia&#x27;s first 5G network using 3500 MHz spectrum.

April 2021: Telstra purchased via Auction 1000 MHz of 26 GHz (26,000 MHz) Spectrum nationally for 5G mmWave technology.

December 2021: Telstra purchased via auction an additional 10 MHz paired of 850 MHz spectrum to put to use for their network.

November 2023: Telstra purchased via auction 55-110 MHz of additional 5G spectrum to boost capacity on their 5G network. Key markets such as Melbourne and Sydney gained an additional 80 MHz.

On 28 October 2024, Telstra will be closing its 3G network, saying &quot;It&#x27;s about providing a better experience for our customers.&quot; Telstra says that the closure of its 3G network will allow them to &quot;repurpose spectrum to support [Telstra&#x27;s] 5G rollout.&quot; In October 2019, Telstra had announced 3G&#x27;s closure to be in June 2024, but has since been moved to 28 October 2024.

===Next G network===

In 2005, Telstra announced a plan to upgrade its ageing networks and systems; which includes a new 3G network to replace the then current CDMA mobile network.

The network was built between November 2005 and September 2006, and launched in October 2006. , Next G was the largest mobile network in Australia, providing greater coverage than other 3G providers in Australia and over three times greater than any 2G provider in Australia. In December 2008, the Next G Network was also the fastest mobile network in the World, delivering theoretical network speeds of up to 21 Mbit/s
 using features of HSPA+ and Dual-Carrier HSPA+. In February 2010, Telstra increased the speed up to 42 Mbit/s making the Next G Network once again the fastest mobile network in the world.

On 26 September 2011, Telstra launched its 4G 1800 MHz LTE network, claiming typical download speeds of up to 40 Mbit/s.

The network is used for BigPond&#x27;s wireless broadband service and Telstra Mobile, which is Australia&#x27;s largest mobile telephone service provider, in terms of both subscriptions and coverage

====Network design====
It was built to replace Telstra&#x27;s CDMA network which operated from 1999 until 28 April 2008. Telstra opted to use the 850 MHz band for Next G in preference to the more common 2100 MHz band, since it requires fewer base stations to provide coverage, providing a lower capital cost. This network was implemented under contract by Ericsson as part of a project internally dubbed &quot;Project Jersey&quot; and launched on 6 October 2006. HSPA technology was included in the network to provide Australia&#x27;s first wide area wireless broadband network. The efficiency of the Next G network and its coverage has been challenged and scrutinised since its launch, requiring Telstra to go back to areas with average coverage, particularly rural towns to improve its coverage footprint. On 18 January 2008, Stephen Conroy, Minister for Communications, declined the proposal for Telstra to switch off its CDMA network on 28 January 2008, stating that whilst the Next G network provided coverage equal to or better than the CDMA network, the range of handsets available was not yet satisfactory. On 15 April 2008, the Minister gave approval to close the CDMA network after 28 April 2008. Telstra closed the network nationally during the early morning hours of 29 April 2008.

While most wireless modems offered by Telstra allow peak download speeds of up to 7.2 Mbit/s, a modem by Sierra Wireless was announced in 2009 that supported increased throughput. The &quot;USB 306&quot; is marketed and sold by Telstra as the &quot;Telstra Turbo 21 Modem&quot;, and was available in limited quantity in early 2009. By April, the &quot;Turbo 21&quot; was available to customers and offered peak download speeds of 21 Mbit/s, although actual speeds vary between 550 kbit/s and 8 Mbit/s. , Next G network HSUPA upgrades in selected regional and metropolitan areas, combined with software updates for the &quot;Turbo 21&quot; modem, will allow peak uplink speeds of up to 5.76 Mbit/s.

On 1 January 2015, Telstra launched, what it calls &quot;4GX&quot;: a 700 MHz based component of its mobile network claiming speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s with compatible devices. 4GX has been expanded up to a 5 x Carrier Aggregation LTE Advanced Pro network, with up to two gigabits of capacity in selected locations using 700, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz frequencies.

=== Business Technology Services (BTS) ===

In January 2016, Telstra announced its acquisition of cloud service provider Kloud. This was followed closely by the acquisition of application development company Readify in July 2016.

==Market position==
Since the Australian telecommunications industry was deregulated in the early 1990s, Telstra has managed to remain the largest provider of telecommunications services despite the emergence of rivals Optus and TPG Telecom. A &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article from 2005 authored by a consultant to Telstra on this topic, reported &quot;that a strategy of offering lower rates on some routes and at certain times of day, even though its prices, on average, were higher than its rivals&quot;, helped Telstra retain several points of market share it otherwise may have lost.

In early 2011, Telstra successfully extended its market share lead by discounting its mobile phone products.

By 2020, Telstra&#x27;s revenue was $26.2 billion, Optus&#x27; was $9.0 billion, and TPG Telecom&#x27;s was $4.4 billion.

==Management==
==International holdings==

Telstra has over 200 subsidiary businesses as of 30 June 2016. The full list can be found at their website.

==Controversies==
===Project Patrick===
In 2001 Telstra launched a secretive bid to purchase Channel 9 from the Packer PBL Empire. It was driven by the Chairman Bob Mansfield, CEO Ziggy Switkowski and Group Managing Directors Ted Pretty. John Stamhope and others. The Howard Government intervened and stopped the purchase and the debacle was captured on ABC&#x27;s Four Corners program the same year. Telstra employees which were part of the project team Brian Stapleton, John Loscoe. Pat Fuery, David Long, Gerard Devan and Mark Todd were disbanded and the project shelved.

===WotNext===
In January 2007 Telstra launched WotNext, a video-publishing website that allowed users to upload videos. The video content was then sold to mobile users for A$1, which the uploader and Telstra split equally. The website was shut down in after a media backlash over uploaded semi-pornographic videos.

===2011 Privacy investigation===
On 12 July 2011, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately 60,300 Telstra customers&#x27; personal information being sent to other customers. The Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said that the OAIC investigation confirmed that while Telstra breached the Privacy Act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties, this incident was caused by a one-off human error. The OAIC concluded that Telstra had taken steps to protect the personal information of its customers including privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses, privacy impact assessments, and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns. After becoming aware of the mailing list error, the commissioner determined that Telstra had acted &quot;immediately&quot; to prevent further breaches, notify customers, review its data security practices, and counselling staff involved the accidental data leak.

===Christchurch mosque shootings===
On 20 March 2019, Telstra denied access to millions of Australians to the websites 4chan, 8chan, Zero Hedge, and Liveleak as a reaction to the Christchurch mosque shootings.

===Race relations===
In May 2021, the Federal Court of Australia ordered the company to pay a $50 million fine for mistreating their Indigenous customers. In 2023, Telstra declared support for Yes in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, citing their &quot;strong ties to Indigenous communities and employees&quot;.

===2024 3G network shutdown===
In March 2024, the planned shutdown of the 3G network in June raised concerns among those with limited access to 4G/5G networks or newer devices. A Hillston farmer voiced fears that losing 3G connectivity could disrupt communication with her family in other rural places, posing potential risks to their safety and well-being.
As of November 4th 2024 the 3G Mobile Network has been fully decommissioned after 2 delays extended the closure date to October 28 2024.

<text>Timothy James McVeigh (April 23, 1968 – June 11, 2001) was an American domestic terrorist who masterminded and perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. The bombing itself killed 167 people, including 19 children, injured 684, and destroyed one-third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. A rescue worker was killed after the bombing when debris struck his head, bringing the total to 168 killed. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.

A Gulf War veteran, McVeigh became radicalized by anti-government beliefs. He sought revenge against the United States federal government for the 1993 Waco siege, as well as the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident. McVeigh expressed particular disapproval of federal agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for their handling of issues regarding private citizens. He hoped to inspire a revolution against the federal government, and he defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical government. He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. He was found guilty on all counts in 1997 and sentenced to death.

McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. His execution, which took place just over six years after the offense, was carried out in a considerably shorter time than for most inmates awaiting execution, due in part to his refusal to pursue appeals or stays of execution.

==Early life==
McVeigh was born on April 23, 1968, in Lockport, New York, the only son and the second of three children of his Irish American parents, Noreen Mildred &quot;Mickey&quot; Hill (1945–2007) and William McVeigh. In 1866, McVeigh&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Edward McVeigh emigrated from Ireland and settled in Niagara County. After McVeigh&#x27;s parents divorced when he was ten years old, he was raised by his father in Pendleton, New York.

McVeigh claimed to have been a target of bullying at school, and he took refuge in a fantasy world where he imagined retaliating against the bullies. At the end of his life, he stated his belief that the United States government is the ultimate bully.

Most who knew McVeigh remember him as being very shy and withdrawn while a few described him as an outgoing and playful child who withdrew as an adolescent. He is said to have had only one girlfriend as an adolescent; he later told journalists that he did not have any idea how to impress girls.

While in high school McVeigh became interested in computers, and hacked into government computer systems on his Commodore 64 under the handle The Wanderer, taken from the song by Dion DiMucci. In his senior year he was named &quot;most promising computer programmer&quot; of Starpoint Central High School (as well as &quot;Most Talkative&quot; by his classmates as a joke as he did not speak much) but had relatively poor grades until his 1986 graduation.

He was introduced to firearms by his grandfather. McVeigh told people of his wish to become a gun shop owner and sometimes took firearms to school to impress his classmates. He became intensely interested in gun rights as well as the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution after he graduated from high school and read magazines such as &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;. He briefly attended Bryant &amp; Stratton College before dropping out. After dropping out of college, McVeigh worked as an armored car guard and was noted by co-workers as being obsessed with guns. One co-worker recalled an instance when McVeigh came to work &quot;looking like Pancho Villa&quot; as he was wearing bandoliers.

==Military career==
In May 1988, at the age of 20, McVeigh enlisted in the United States Army and attended Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training at the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. While in the military, McVeigh used much of his spare time to read about firearms, sniper tactics, and explosives. McVeigh was reprimanded by the military for purchasing a &quot;White Power&quot; T-shirt at a Ku Klux Klan rally where they were objecting to black servicemen who wore &quot;Black Power&quot; T-shirts around a military installation (primarily Army). His future co-conspirator Terry Nichols was his platoon guide. He and Nichols quickly got along with their similar backgrounds as well as their views in gun collecting and survivalism. The two were later stationed together at Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas, where they met and became friends with their future accomplice, Michael Fortier.

McVeigh was a top-scoring gunner with the M242 25mm cannon of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles used by the 1st Infantry Division and was promoted to sergeant. After being promoted, McVeigh earned a reputation for assigning undesirable work to black servicemen and using derogatory language. He was stationed at Fort Riley before being deployed on Operation Desert Storm.

In an interview before his execution, McVeigh said that he hit an Iraqi tank more than 500 yards away on his first day in the war and then the Iraqis surrendered. He also decapitated an Iraqi soldier with cannon fire from 1,100 yards away. He said he was later shocked to see carnage on the road while leaving Kuwait City after U.S. troops routed the Iraqi Army. McVeigh received several service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Kuwaiti Liberation Medal.

McVeigh aspired to join the United States Army Special Forces (SF). After returning from the Gulf War, he entered the selection program, but withdrew on the second day of the 21-day assessment and selection course for the Special Forces, telling other recruits that he had injured an ankle. However, in a letter to his superiors, McVeigh wrote that he was not &quot;physically ready&quot;. McVeigh decided to leave the Army and was honorably discharged in 1991.

== Post-military life ==
McVeigh wrote letters to local newspapers complaining about taxes. In 1992, he wrote:
McVeigh also wrote to Representative John J. LaFalce (D–New York), complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace: 

McVeigh later moved with Nichols to Nichols&#x27; brother James&#x27; farm around Decker, Michigan. While visiting friends, McVeigh reportedly complained that the Army had implanted a microchip into his buttocks so that the government could keep track of him. McVeigh worked long hours in a dead-end job and felt that he did not have a home. He sought romance, but his advances were rejected by a co-worker and he felt nervous around women. He believed that he brought too much pain to his loved ones. He grew angry and frustrated at his difficulties in finding a girlfriend. He took up obsessive gambling. Unable to pay gambling debts, he took a cash advance and then defaulted on his repayments. He began looking for a state with low taxes so that he could live without heavy government regulation or high taxes. He became enraged when the government told him that he had been overpaid $1,058 while in the Army and he had to pay back the money. He wrote an angry letter to the government, saying: 

McVeigh introduced his sister to anti-government literature, but his father had little interest in these views. He moved out of his father&#x27;s house and into an apartment that had no telephone. This made it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments. He quit the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), believing that it was too weak on gun rights.

=== 1993 Waco siege and gun shows ===
In 1993, McVeigh drove to Waco, Texas, during the Waco siege to show his support. At the scene, he distributed pro-gun rights literature and bumper stickers bearing slogans such as, &quot;When guns are outlawed, I will become an outlaw.&quot; He told a student reporter:

For the five months following the Waco siege, McVeigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed with the name and address of Lon Horiuchi, an FBI sniper, &quot;in the hope that somebody in the Patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter.&quot; Horiuchi&#x27;s actions while an FBI agent have drawn controversy, specifically his shooting and killing of Randy Weaver&#x27;s wife while she held an infant child. McVeigh wrote hate mail to Horiuchi, suggesting that &quot;what goes around, comes around&quot;. McVeigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the Murrah Building to target Horiuchi or a member of his family instead.

McVeigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit, traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows. He found that the further west he went, the more anti-government sentiment he encountered, at least until he got to what he called &quot;The People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of California.&quot; McVeigh sold survival items and copies of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. One author said: 

== Arizona with Fortier ==
McVeigh had a road atlas with hand-drawn designations of the most likely places for nuclear attacks and considered buying property in Seligman, Arizona, which he determined to be in a &quot;nuclear-free zone.&quot; He lived with Michael Fortier in Kingman, Arizona, and the two became so close that he served as best man at Fortier&#x27;s wedding. McVeigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia. He was never as interested in drugs as Fortier was, and one of the reasons they parted ways was that McVeigh grew tired of Fortier&#x27;s drug habits.

== With Nichols, Waco siege, and radicalization ==
In April 1993, McVeigh headed for a farm in Michigan where former roommate Terry Nichols lived. In between watching coverage of the Waco siege on TV, Nichols and his brother began teaching McVeigh how to make explosives by combining household chemicals in plastic jugs. The destruction of the Waco compound enraged McVeigh and convinced him that it was time to take action. He was particularly angered by the government&#x27;s use of CS gas on women and children; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects. The disappearance of certain evidence, such as the bullet-riddled steel-reinforced front door to the complex, led him to suspect a cover-up.

McVeigh&#x27;s anti-government rhetoric became more radical. He began to sell Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) hats riddled with bullet holes, and a flare gun that he said could shoot down an &quot;ATF helicopter&quot;. He produced videos detailing the government&#x27;s actions at Waco and handed out pamphlets with titles such as &quot;U.S. Government Initiates Open Warfare Against American People&quot; and &quot;Waco Shootout Evokes Memory of Warsaw &#x27;43.&quot; He began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by Patrick Henry, such as &quot;Give me liberty or give me death.&quot; He began experimenting with making pipe bombs and other small explosive devices. The government imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 which McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.

McVeigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend Steve Hodge by sending him a 23-page farewell letter. He proclaimed his devotion to the United States Declaration of Independence, explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him. McVeigh declared that:
McVeigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies. He visited Area 51 in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to Gulfport, Mississippi, to determine the veracity of rumors about United Nations operations. These turned out to be false; the Russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in U.N.-sponsored humanitarian aid efforts. Around this time, McVeigh and Nichols began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate, an agricultural fertilizer, for resale to survivalists, since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it.

== Plan against federal building or individuals ==
McVeigh told Fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building, but Fortier declined to participate. Fortier also told his wife about the plans. McVeigh composed two letters to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the first titled &quot;Constitutional Defenders&quot; and the second &quot;ATF Read.&quot; He denounced government officials as &quot;fascist tyrants&quot; and &quot;storm troopers,&quot; and warned: 

McVeigh also wrote a letter to recruit a customer named Steve Colbern:
McVeigh began announcing that he had progressed from the &quot;propaganda&quot; phase to the &quot;action&quot; phase. He wrote to his Michigan friend Gwenda Strider, &quot;I have certain other &#x27;militant&#x27; talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded.&quot;

McVeigh later said he considered &quot;a campaign of individual assassination,&quot; with &quot;eligible&quot; targets including Attorney General Janet Reno, Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Federal District Court, who handled the Branch Davidian trial; and Lon Horiuchi, a member of the FBI hostage-rescue team, who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He said he wanted Reno to accept &quot;full responsibility in deed, not just words.&quot; Such an assassination seemed too difficult, and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, he should strike at them at their command centers. According to McVeigh&#x27;s authorized biography, he decided that he could make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he was ambivalent about his act and the deaths he caused; as he said in letters to his hometown newspaper, he sometimes wished that he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.

==Oklahoma City bombing==
Working at a lakeside campground near McVeigh&#x27;s old Army post, he and Nichols constructed an ANFO explosive device mounted in the back of a rented Ryder truck. The bomb consisted of about of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane.

On April 19, 1995, McVeigh drove the truck to the front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building just as its offices opened for the day. Before arriving, he stopped to light a two-minute fuse. At 09:02, a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building. It killed 168 people, including 19 children in the day care center on the second floor, and injured 684 others.

McVeigh said that he had not known that there was a daycare center on the second floor, and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it. Nichols said that he and McVeigh did know about the daycare center in the building, and that they did not care.

McVeigh&#x27;s biographers, Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, spoke with McVeigh in interviews totaling 75 hours. He said about the victims:
During an interview in 2000 with Ed Bradley for television news magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Bradley asked McVeigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children. McVeigh said: 

According to the Oklahoma City Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), more than 300 buildings in the city were damaged. More than 12,000 volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue, recovery and support operations following the bombing. In reference to theories that McVeigh had assistance from others, he responded with a well-known line from the film &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;You can&#x27;t handle the truth!&quot; He added, &quot;Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building and isn&#x27;t it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?&quot;

== Arrest and trial ==

By tracing the vehicle identification number of a rear axle found in the wreckage, the FBI identified the vehicle as a Ryder rental box truck rented from Junction City, Kansas. Workers at the agency assisted an FBI artist in creating a sketch of the renter, who had used the alias &quot;Robert Kling&quot;. The sketch was shown in the area. Lea McGown, manager of the local Dreamland Motel, identified the sketch as Timothy McVeigh.

Shortly after the bombing, while driving on Interstate 35 in Noble County, near Perry, Oklahoma, McVeigh was stopped by State Trooper Charles J. Hanger. Hanger had passed McVeigh&#x27;s yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis and noticed that it had no license plate. McVeigh admitted to the state trooperwho noticed a bulge under his jacketthat he had a gun; the trooper arrested him for driving without plates and possessing an illegal firearm. McVeigh&#x27;s concealed weapon permit was not legal in Oklahoma. McVeigh was wearing a shirt at that time with a picture of Abraham Lincoln and the motto (&#x27;Thus always to tyrants&#x27;), the supposed words shouted by John Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln. On the back, it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the Thomas Jefferson quote, &quot;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.&quot; Three days later, McVeigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt.
On August 10, 1995, McVeigh was indicted on 11 federal counts, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, use of a weapon of mass destruction, destruction with the use of explosives, and eight counts of first degree murder for the deaths of law enforcement officers. On February 20, 1996, the Court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from Oklahoma City to the District Court in Denver, to be presided over by District Judge Richard Paul Matsch.

McVeigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense, but they ended up not doing so. They would have had to prove that McVeigh was in &quot;imminent danger&quot; from the government. McVeigh argued that &quot;imminent&quot; did not necessarily mean &quot;immediate&quot;. They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at Waco, Texas, where the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians. As part of the defense, McVeigh&#x27;s lawyers showed the jury the controversial video &quot;Waco, the Big Lie&quot;.

On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on all 11 counts of the federal indictment. Although 168 people, including 19 children, were killed in the April 19, 1995, bombing, murder charges were brought against McVeigh for only the eight federal agents who were on duty when the bomb destroyed much of the Murrah Building. Along with the eight counts of murder, McVeigh was charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, and destroying a federal building. Oklahoma City District Attorney Bob Macy said he would file state charges in the other 160 murders after McVeigh&#x27;s co-defendant, Terry Nichols, was tried. After the verdict, McVeigh tried to calm his mother by saying, &quot;Think of it this way. When I was in the Army, you didn&#x27;t see me for years. Think of me that way now, like I&#x27;m away in the Army again, on an assignment for the military.&quot;

On June 13, the jury recommended that McVeigh receive the death penalty. The U.S. Department of Justice brought federal charges against McVeigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for McVeigh; they could not bring charges against McVeigh for the remaining 160 deaths in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma. Because McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to death, the State of Oklahoma did not file murder charges against McVeigh for the other 160 deaths. Before the sentence was formally pronounced by Judge Matsch, McVeigh addressed the court for the first time and said: &quot;If the Court please, I wish to use the words of Justice [Louis] Brandeis dissenting in &quot;Olmstead [v. United States]&quot; to speak for me. He wrote, &#x27;Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.&#x27; That&#x27;s all I have.&quot;

== Incarceration and execution ==
McVeigh&#x27;s death sentence was delayed pending an appeal. One of his appeals for , taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, was denied on March 8, 1999. McVeigh&#x27;s request for a nationally televised execution was also denied. Entertainment Network Inc., an Internet company that produces adult-themed websites, unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast the execution. At USP Florence ADMAX, McVeigh and Nichols were housed in what was known as &quot;bomber&#x27;s row&quot;. Ted Kaczynski, Luis Felipe, and Ramzi Yousef were also housed in this cell block. Yousef made frequent, unsuccessful attempts to convert McVeigh to Islam.

The day before his execution, McVeigh said in a letter to &quot;The Buffalo News&quot;: &quot;I am sorry these people had to lose their lives, but that&#x27;s the nature of the beast. It&#x27;s understood going in what the human toll will be.&quot; He said that if there turned out to be an afterlife, he would &quot;improvise, adapt and overcome&quot;, noting: &quot;If there is a hell, then I&#x27;ll be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war.&quot; He also said: &quot;I knew I wanted this before it happened. I knew my objective was state-assisted suicide and when it happens, it&#x27;s in your face. You just did something you&#x27;re trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel.&quot;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred McVeigh from USP Florence ADMAX to the federal death row at USP Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1999. McVeigh dropped his remaining appeals, saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison. On January 16, 2001, the BOP set May 16 as McVeigh&#x27;s execution date. McVeigh said that his only regret was not completely destroying the federal building. Six days prior to his scheduled execution, the FBI turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to McVeigh&#x27;s attorneys. As a result, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced McVeigh&#x27;s execution would be stayed for one month. The execution date was reset for June 11. Conductor David Woodard performed Requiem Mass music for McVeigh on the morning of McVeigh&#x27;s execution. While acknowledging McVeigh&#x27;s &quot;horrible deed&quot;, David Woodard intended to &quot;provide comfort&quot;. McVeigh also requested a Catholic chaplain. His last meal consisted of two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream.

McVeigh chose William Ernest Henley&#x27;s 1875 poem &quot;Invictus&quot; as his final written statement. Just before the execution, when he was asked if he had a final statement, he declined. Jay Sawyer, a relative of one of the victims, wrote, &quot;Without saying a word, he got the final word.&quot; Larry Whicher, whose brother died in the attack, described McVeigh as having &quot;a totally expressionless, blank stare. He had a look of defiance and that if he could, he&#x27;d do it all over again.&quot; McVeigh was executed by lethal injection at 7:14 a.m. on June 11, 2001, the first person to be executed by the United States federal government since Victor Feguer was executed in Iowa on March 15, 1963.

On November 21, 1997, President Bill Clinton had signed S. 923, special legislation introduced by Senator Arlen Specter to bar McVeigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery. His body was cremated at Mattox Ryan Funeral Home in Terre Haute. His ashes were given to his lawyer, who said &quot;the final destination of McVeigh&#x27;s remains would remain privileged forever.&quot; McVeigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood, but decided that would be &quot;too vengeful, too raw, too cold.&quot; He had expressed willingness to donate organs, but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations. Psychiatrist John Smith concluded that McVeigh was &quot;a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible, violent act.&quot; McVeigh&#x27;s IQ was assessed at 126.

==Associations==
According to CNN, his only known associations were as a registered Republican while in Buffalo, New York, in the 1980s, and a membership in the National Rifle Association while in the Army. 

After returning home from war he signed up for a trial membership in the KKK, although he did not ultimately continue with the Klan. There is no conclusive evidence that he ever belonged to any other extremist groups.

==Religious beliefs==
McVeigh was raised Roman Catholic. During his childhood, he and his father attended Mass regularly. McVeigh was confirmed at the Good Shepherd Church in Pendleton, New York, in 1985. In a 1996 interview, McVeigh professed belief in &quot;a God&quot;, although he said he had &quot;sort of lost touch with&quot; Catholicism and &quot;I never really picked it up, however I do maintain core beliefs.&quot; In McVeigh&#x27;s biography &quot;American Terrorist&quot;, released in 2002, he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion. In June 2001, a day before the execution, McVeigh wrote a letter to the &quot;Buffalo News&quot; identifying himself as agnostic. However, he took the last rites, administered by a priest, just before his execution. Father Charles Smith ministered to McVeigh in his last moments on death row.

==Motivations for the bombing==
McVeigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at Waco and Ruby Ridge. McVeigh visited Waco during the standoff. While there, he was interviewed by student reporter Michelle Rauch, a senior journalism major at Southern Methodist University who was writing for the school paper. McVeigh expressed his objections over what was happening there.

McVeigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;; he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms. Photocopies of pages sixty-one and sixty-two of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; were found in an envelope inside McVeigh&#x27;s car. These pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the U.S. Capitol in Washington.

In a 1,200-word essay dated March 1998, from the federal maximum-security prison at Florence, Colorado, McVeigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was &quot;morally equivalent&quot; to U.S. military actions against Iraq and other foreign countries. The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine &quot;Media Bypass&quot;, was distributed worldwide by the Associated Press on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 Iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before Operation Desert Fox.

On April 26, 2001, McVeigh wrote a letter to Fox News, &quot;I Explain Herein Why I Bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City&quot;, which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack. McVeigh read the novel &quot;Unintended Consequences&quot; (1996), and said that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building.

==Accomplices==
McVeigh&#x27;s accomplice Terry Nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime. At Nichols&#x27; trial, evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved. Several residents of central Kansas, including real estate agent Georgia Rucker and a retired Army NCO, testified at Terry Nichols&#x27; federal trial that they had seen two trucks at Geary Lake State Park, where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled. The retired NCO said he visited the lake on April 18, 1995, but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively. The operator of the Dreamland Motel testified that two Ryder trucks had been parked outside her Grandview Plaza motel where McVeigh stayed in Room 26 the weekend before the bombing. Terry Nichols is incarcerated at ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado.

Michael and Lori Fortier were also considered accomplices, due to their foreknowledge of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver&#x27;s license which was used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998, to twelve years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the bombing. On January 20, 2006, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.

An ATF informant, Carol Howe, told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of the private community of Elohim City, Oklahoma, were planning a major bombing attack. McVeigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time. Other than this speeding ticket, there is no evidence of a connection between McVeigh and members of the Midwest Bank Robbers at Elohim City.

Some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, and there was a search for a &quot;John Doe #2&quot;, but none was ever found.

==In popular culture==
As part of the expanded timeline for the official website of the 2003 alternate universe movie &quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot;, McVeigh is a terrorist who bombed the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., in 1995. His execution is aired live on national television and is shown on pay-per-view where it gets many viewers.

In the 2012 alternate universe novel &quot;The Mirage&quot;, McVeigh is a CIA officer of the Evangelical Republic of Texas. Terry Nichols is mentioned as an associate.

<text>The transuranium (or transuranic) elements are the chemical elements with atomic number greater than 92, which is the atomic number of uranium. All of them are radioactively unstable and decay into other elements. Except for neptunium and plutonium, which have been found in trace amounts in nature, none occur naturally on Earth and they are synthetic.

==Overview==
Of the elements with atomic numbers 1 to 92, most can be found in nature, having stable isotopes (such as oxygen) or very long-lived radioisotopes (such as uranium), or existing as common decay products of the decay of uranium and thorium (such as radon). The exceptions are technetium, promethium, astatine, and francium; all four occur in nature, but only in very minor branches of the uranium and thorium decay chains, and thus all save francium were first discovered by synthesis in the laboratory rather than in nature.

All elements with higher atomic numbers have been first discovered in the laboratory, with neptunium and plutonium later discovered in nature. They are all radioactive, with a half-life much shorter than the age of the Earth, so any primordial (i.e. present at the Earth&#x27;s formation) atoms of these elements, have long since decayed. Trace amounts of neptunium and plutonium form in some uranium-rich rock, and small amounts are produced during atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. These two elements are generated by neutron capture in uranium ore with subsequent beta decays (e.g. U + n → U → Np → Pu).

All elements beyond plutonium are entirely synthetic; they are created in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. The half-lives of these elements show a general trend of decreasing as atomic numbers increase. There are exceptions, however, including several isotopes of curium and dubnium. Some heavier elements in this series, around atomic numbers 110–114, are thought to break the trend and demonstrate increased nuclear stability, comprising the theoretical island of stability.

Transuranic elements are difficult and expensive to produce, and their prices increase rapidly with atomic number. As of 2008, the cost of weapons-grade plutonium was around $4,000/gram, and californium exceeded $60,000,000/gram. Einsteinium is the heaviest element that has been produced in macroscopic quantities.

Transuranic elements that have not been discovered, or have been discovered but are not yet officially named, use IUPAC&#x27;s systematic element names. The naming of transuranic elements may be a source of controversy.

==Discoveries==
So far, essentially all transuranium elements have been discovered at four laboratories: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in the United States (elements 93–101, 106, and joint credit for 103–105), the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia (elements 102 and 114–118, and joint credit for 103–105), the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany (elements 107–112), and RIKEN in Japan (element 113).
*The Radiation Laboratory (now LBNL) at University of California, Berkeley, led principally by Edwin McMillan, Glenn Seaborg, and Albert Ghiorso, during 1945-1974:
**93. neptunium, Np, named after the planet Neptune, as it follows uranium and Neptune follows Uranus in the planetary sequence (1940).
**94. plutonium, Pu, named after Pluto, following the same naming rule as it follows neptunium and Pluto follows Neptune in the Solar System (1940).
**95. americium, Am, named because it is an analog to europium, and so was named after the continent where it was first produced (1944).
**96. curium, Cm, named after Pierre and Marie Curie, scientists who separated out the first radioactive elements (1944), as its lighter analog gadolinium was named after Johan Gadolin.
**97. berkelium, Bk, named after Berkeley, where the University of California, Berkeley is located (1949).
**98. californium, Cf, named after California, where the university is located (1950).
**99. einsteinium, Es, named after Albert Einstein (1952).
**100. fermium, Fm, named after Enrico Fermi, the physicist who produced the first controlled chain reaction (1952).
**101. mendelevium, Md, named after Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, credited for being the primary creator of the periodic table of the chemical elements (1955).
**102. nobelium, No, named after Alfred Nobel (1958). The element was originally claimed by a team at the Nobel Institute in Sweden (1957) – though it later became apparent that the Swedish team had not discovered the element, the LBNL team decided to adopt their name &quot;nobelium&quot;. This discovery was also claimed by JINR, which doubted the LBNL claim, and named the element &quot;joliotium&quot; (Jl) after Frédéric Joliot-Curie (1965). IUPAC concluded that the JINR had been the first to convincingly synthesize the element (1965), but retained the name &quot;nobelium&quot; as deeply entrenched in the literature.
**103. lawrencium, Lr, named after Ernest Lawrence, a physicist best known for development of the cyclotron, and the person for whom Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and LBNL (which hosted the creation of these transuranium elements) are named (1961). This discovery was also claimed by the JINR (1965), which doubted the LBNL claim and proposed the name &quot;rutherfordium&quot; (Rf) after Ernest Rutherford. IUPAC concluded that credit should be shared, retaining the name &quot;lawrencium&quot; as entrenched in the literature.
**104. rutherfordium, Rf, named after Ernest Rutherford, who was responsible for the concept of the atomic nucleus (1969). This discovery was also claimed by JINR, led principally by Georgy Flyorov: they named the element &quot;kurchatovium&quot; (Ku), after Igor Kurchatov. IUPAC concluded that credit should be shared, and adopted the LBNL name &quot;rutherfordium&quot;.
**105. dubnium, Db, an element that is named after Dubna, where JINR is located. Originally named &quot;hahnium&quot; (Ha) in honor of Otto Hahn by the Berkeley group (1970). This discovery was also claimed by JINR, which named it &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; (Ns) after Niels Bohr. IUPAC concluded that credit should be shared, and renamed the element &quot;dubnium&quot; to honour the JINR team.
**106. seaborgium, Sg, named after Glenn T. Seaborg. This name caused controversy because Seaborg was still alive, but it eventually became accepted by international chemists (1974). This discovery was also claimed by JINR. IUPAC concluded that the Berkeley team had been the first to convincingly synthesize the element.
*The Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, led principally by Gottfried Münzenberg, Peter Armbruster, and Sigurd Hofmann, during 1980-2000:
**107. bohrium, Bh, named after Danish physicist Niels Bohr, important in the elucidation of the structure of the atom (1981). This discovery was also claimed by JINR. IUPAC concluded that the GSI had been the first to convincingly synthesise the element. The GSI team had originally proposed &quot;nielsbohrium&quot; (Ns) to resolve the naming dispute on element 105, but this was changed by IUPAC as there was no precedent for using a scientist&#x27;s first name in an element name.
**108. hassium, Hs, named after the Latin form of the name of Hessen, the German &quot;Bundesland&quot; where this work was performed (1984). This discovery was also claimed by JINR. IUPAC concluded that the GSI had been the first to convincingly synthesize the element, while acknowledging the pioneering work at JINR.
**109. meitnerium, Mt, named after Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist who was one of the earliest scientists to study nuclear fission (1982).
**110. darmstadtium, Ds, named after Darmstadt, Germany, the city in which this work was performed (1994). This discovery was also claimed by JINR, which proposed the name &quot;becquerelium&quot; after Henri Becquerel, and by LBNL, which proposed the name &quot;hahnium&quot; to resolve the dispute on element 105 (despite having protested the reusing of established names for different elements). IUPAC concluded that GSI had been the first to convincingly synthesize the element.
**111. roentgenium, Rg, named after Wilhelm Röntgen, discoverer of X-rays (1994).
**112. copernicium, Cn, named after astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1996).
*RIKEN in Wakō, Saitama, Japan, led principally by Kōsuke Morita:
**113. nihonium, Nh, named after Japan (&quot;Nihon&quot; in Japanese) where the element was discovered (2004). This discovery was also claimed by JINR. IUPAC concluded that RIKEN had been the first to convincingly synthesize the element.
*JINR in Dubna, Russia, led principally by Yuri Oganessian, in collaboration with several other labs including Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), since 2000:
**114. flerovium, Fl, named after Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov, founder of JINR (1999).
**115. moscovium, Mc, named after Moscow Oblast, where the element was discovered (2004).
**116. livermorium, Lv, named after Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a collaborator with JINR in the discovery (2000).
**117. tennessine, Ts, after Tennessee, where the berkelium target needed for the synthesis of the element was manufactured (2010).
**118. oganesson, Og, after Yuri Oganessian, who led the JINR team in its discovery of elements 114 to 118 (2002).

==Superheavy elements==


Superheavy elements, (also known as &quot;superheavies&quot;, or &quot;superheavy atoms&quot;, commonly abbreviated SHE) usually refer to the transactinide elements beginning with rutherfordium (atomic number 104). (Lawrencium, the first 6d element, is sometimes but not always included as well.) They have only been made artificially and currently serve no practical purpose because their short half-lives cause them to decay after a very short time, ranging from a few hours to just milliseconds, which also makes them extremely hard to study.

Superheavies have all been created since the latter half of the 20th century and are continually being created during the 21st century as technology advances. They are created through the bombardment of elements in a particle accelerator, in quantities on the atomic scale, and no method of mass creation has been found.

==Applications==

Transuranic elements may be used to synthesize superheavy elements. Elements of the island of stability have potentially important military applications, including the development of compact nuclear weapons. The potential everyday applications are vast; americium is used in devices such as smoke detectors and spectrometers.

<text>The Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979 after nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gifted his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a bass guitar. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson, and drummer Chris Mars for most of its existence. After two albums in the style of punk rock, they became one of the main pioneers of alternative rock with their acclaimed albums &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Tim&quot;. Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band&#x27;s career, Westerberg exerted more control over its creative output. The group disbanded in 1991 and the members eventually found various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012. Fans affectionately refer to the band as the &#x27;Mats, a nickname which originated as a truncation of &quot;The Placemats&quot;.

The Replacements&#x27; music was influenced by rock artists such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Faces, Big Star, Slade, Badfinger, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan as well as punk rock bands including the Ramones, the New York Dolls, Buzzcocks, the Damned, and the Sex Pistols. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played &quot;heart-on-the-sleeve&quot; rock songs which combined Westerberg&#x27;s &quot;raw-throated adolescent howl&quot; with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1978–1980)===
The Replacements&#x27; history began in Minneapolis in 1978, when nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gave his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a bass guitar to keep him off the streets. In the same year, Bob met Mars, a high school dropout. With Mars playing guitar and then switching to drums, the trio called themselves &quot;Dogbreath&quot; and began covering songs by Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and Yes without a singer. One day as Westerberg, who was a janitor in U.S. Senator David Durenberger&#x27;s office, was walking home from work he heard a band playing in the Stinsons&#x27; house. After being impressed by the band&#x27;s performance, Westerberg regularly listened in after work. Mars knew Westerberg and invited him over to jam. Westerberg was unaware Mars was a drummer in Dogbreath.

Dogbreath auditioned several vocalists, including a hippie who read lyrics off a sheet. The band eventually found a vocalist, but Westerberg wanted to be the singer and took him aside one day to say, &quot;The band doesn&#x27;t like you.&quot; The vocalist soon left and Westerberg replaced him. Before Westerberg joined the band, Dogbreath often drank and took various drugs during rehearsals, playing songs as an afterthought. In contrast to the rest of the band, the relatively disciplined Westerberg appeared at rehearsals in neat clothes and insisted on practicing songs until he was happy with them.

&quot;They didn&#x27;t even know what punk was. They didn&#x27;t like punk. Chris had hair down to his shoulders,&quot; Westerberg told an interviewer. But after the band members discovered first-generation English punk bands like the Clash, the Jam, the Damned, and the Buzzcocks, Dogbreath changed its name to the Impediments and played a drunken performance without Tommy Stinson at a church hall gig in June 1980. After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements. In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band&#x27;s choice of name: &quot;Like maybe the main act doesn&#x27;t show, and instead the crowd has to settle for an earful of us dirtbags... It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective &#x27;secondary&#x27; social esteem&quot;.

===Demo tape and Twin/Tone Records (1980–1981)===
The band recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars&#x27;s basement; Westerberg handed it to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis; he also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay&#x27;s Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band&#x27;s first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped while Jesperson put the tape on, only to run away as soon as the first song, &quot;Raised in the City&quot;, played. Jesperson played the song again and again. &quot;If I&#x27;ve ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in&quot;, said Jesperson. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode&quot;.

Jesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, &quot;So do you want to do a single or an album?&quot; With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980. Jesperson&#x27;s support of the band was welcomed and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later in the summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday &quot;New Band Night&quot;. 

They also played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson&#x27;s loud whistle and fast clapping. &quot;His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,&quot; Mars later said. &quot;His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.&quot; After the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write new songs and soon had a whole album&#x27;s worth of material. Mere weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album. Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records. Before settling on a title for the band&#x27;s debut album, Westerberg considered the names &quot;Unsuitable for Airplay&quot; and &quot;Power Trash.&quot;

===Early releases (1981–1982)===
When the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&quot;, was released in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. &quot;Option&quot;&#x27;s Blake Gumprecht wrote, &quot;Westerberg has the ability to make you feel like you&#x27;re right in the car with him, alongside him at the door, drinking from the same bottle.&quot; The album contained the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;I&#x27;m in Trouble&quot;, Westerberg&#x27;s &quot;first truly good song&quot;. &quot;Sorry Ma&quot; included the song &quot;Somethin to Dü&quot;, a homage to another Twin Cities punk band, Hüsker Dü. The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which began when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over Hüsker Dü. 

Hüsker Dü landed an opening slot at a Johnny Thunders gig that the Replacements had wanted. Hüsker Dü also influenced the band&#x27;s music, and the Replacements began playing faster and becoming more influenced by hardcore punk. Despite that the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later said, &quot;We were confused about what we were.&quot; Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called &quot;Kids Don&#x27;t Follow&quot;. Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, &quot;I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to.&quot; The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets. The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their &quot;balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt&quot;, their first EP &quot;Stink&quot;, containing &quot;Kids Don&#x27;t Follow&quot; and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after a show in Chicago.

The Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of &quot;Stink&quot;. &quot;We write songs rather than riffs with statements,&quot; Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, &quot;You&#x27;re Getting Married One Night&quot;, but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. &quot;Save that for your solo album, Paul,&quot; Bob Stinson said. &quot;That ain&#x27;t the Replacements&quot;. The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn&#x27;t catchy enough, Chris won&#x27;t like it, and if it isn&#x27;t modern enough, Tommy won&#x27;t like it.&quot;

===&quot;Hootenanny&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1983–1984)===
With some new songs, the Replacements entered a warehouse in Roseville, Minnesota to record their next album; Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineered. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark&#x27;s meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, &quot;It&#x27;s a hootenanny.&quot; The band declared it to be &quot;side one, track one&quot; of the new album. According to Stark, the recording &quot;was a complete joke from their point of view—they did not care what they delivered&quot;.

&quot;Hootenanny&quot;, the band&#x27;s second studio album, was released in April 1983. On &quot;Hootenanny&quot; Westerberg expanded his songwriting capabilities, in songs such as &quot;Willpower&quot;, with echoed vocals and a sparse arrangement, and &quot;Within Your Reach&quot;, which features Westerberg on all instruments, he revealed a more sensitive side. It was a more mature album than &quot;Stink&quot; and &quot;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&quot;. &quot;Hootenanny&quot; was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics giving the album acclaim. Robert Christgau, writing in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, deemed it to be &quot;the most critically independent album of 1983&quot;.

With &quot;Hootenanny&quot;&#x27;s release, the Replacements had begun to attract a following outside of Minneapolis. The band embarked on its first tour of the United States in April 1983, joined by Bill Sullivan, a young security guard, as roadie, who approached the band after a show at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Tommy Stinson dropped out of the tenth grade, joining the rest of the band on tour. The Replacements toured venues on the East Coast, including a tense gig at City Gardens, in Trenton, New Jersey where numerous punks lined the edge of the stage as the band played. The band performed in Detroit, Cleveland, and Philadelphia but its intended destination was New York City, where they played at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City; they also performed at Maxwell&#x27;s, in Hoboken, New Jersey.

The Replacements returned to New York in June 1983, playing at CBGB. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry. Bob Stinson was thrown out as soon as he walked in the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because &quot;The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out,&quot; according to manager Jesperson. The band supported R.E.M. on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low and Westerberg later said, &quot;We&#x27;d much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don&#x27;t care.&quot;

For the recording of their next studio album, the Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.&#x27;s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By that time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg said, &quot;Now we&#x27;re softening a little where we can do something that&#x27;s a little more sincere without being afraid that someone&#x27;s not going to like it or the punks aren&#x27;t going to be able to dance to it.&quot;

The new material placed more of a focus on songwriting, and the music was influenced by heavy metal, arena rock and Chicago blues. Instruments such as piano, twelve-string guitar and mandolin were featured throughout the album. The new album included songs such as &quot;I Will Dare&quot;, which featured Buck playing lead guitar; &quot;Androgynous&quot;, with Westerberg on piano; and &quot;Unsatisfied&quot; in which, according to writer Michael Azerrad, Westerberg &quot;had hit upon a moving new way to declare that he can&#x27;t get no satisfaction.&quot; The band&#x27;s album &quot;Let It Be&quot; was released in October 1984 to critical acclaim. Robert Christgau gave the album an A+, and the &quot;Seattle Rocket&quot; critic Bruce Pavitt called &quot;Let It Be&quot; &quot;mature diverse rock that could well shoot these regional boys into the national mainstream&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Let It Be&quot; was ranked number 12 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;25 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; and number 15 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

===Early major-label releases (1985–1988)===
&quot;Let It Be&quot; attracted the attention of major record labels, and by late 1984 several had expressed an interest in signing the Replacements. Financially, the band was not doing well; they were not selling enough records to recoup their expenses, and money from shows went to recording costs, hotels, travel, food and instrument repairs. Bob Stinson worked a day job as a pizza chef. Twin/Tone was not being paid reliably by distributors, and the sales of &quot;Let It Be&quot; were not high enough to justify extra promotion. &quot;It was time for a major label to take over,&quot; according to the label&#x27;s co-owner Stark. The band was close to a major-label contract but often alienated label representatives by intentionally performing badly in concert; their 1985 live album, &quot;The Shit Hits the Fans&quot;, was an example of their concert performances at the time.

One label, the Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Sire Records, eventually signed the Replacements. The band admired the label head, Seymour Stein, who had managed the Ramones, and Stein recruited Tommy Ramone as producer for their first major-label album, &quot;Tim&quot;, released by Sire in October 1985.

For the rest of 1985 and the first half of 1986 the band toured behind &quot;Tim&quot;. In mid-January 1986 the Replacements received a last-minute request to appear as the musical guests on the January 18th episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, replacing the scheduled act, The Pointer Sisters, who had been forced to cancel only days before the show. The invitation was partly thanks to the show&#x27;s musical director of the time, G.E. Smith, who was a Replacements fan. However, as a result of their shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, &quot;SNL&quot; producer Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to the show (although Westerberg returned as a solo artist in 1993, and was even allowed to play a Replacements song.) 

After playing an out-of-tune &quot;Bastards of Young&quot; (during which Westerberg audibly called out &quot;Come on fucker&quot; just off-mic) the band returned to stage wearing mismatched iterations of each other&#x27;s clothing and performed &quot;Kiss Me on the Bus&quot; while completely intoxicated. In a 2015 interview recorded for the Archive of American Television, G. E. Smith recalled that although the band had performed well for the early evening taped dress rehearsal performance, one of the band&#x27;s crew then smuggled alcohol into their dressing room and they spent the next few hours drinking (with the guest host, Harry Dean Stanton) and taking drugs. According to Smith, by the time of the late-night live broadcast they were so intoxicated that on their way to the stage to perform, Bob Stinson tripped in the corridor, fell over onto his guitar and broke it, and Smith had to hurriedly loan him one of the &quot;SNL&quot; house band&#x27;s spare instruments.

A few weeks later, on February 4, 1986, the band returned to the New York City area to perform at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, New Jersey. The show was professionally recorded by a crew hired by the band&#x27;s label Sire Records, for use in a possible live album. Over 30 years later, the recordings were released as the double album &quot;For Sale: Live at Maxwell&#x27;s 1986&quot;. The tour ended abruptly in June 1986 because Westerberg injured his finger during a show at The Ritz in New York City.

In August 1986, the Replacements either fired Bob Stinson from the band which he had founded, or he chose to leave, or a little of both. In any case, it was due to creative and personal differences between Stinson and the remainder of the band, aggravated by Stinson&#x27;s alcohol and drug abuse issues. They also fired Jesperson the same year. &quot;It was like being thrown out of a club that you helped start,&quot; Jesperson later commented. &quot;Everybody was drinking and doing more drugs than they needed to.&quot;

Stinson preferred the louder, faster style of the band&#x27;s early music, while Westerberg was exploring new territory in ballads like &quot;Here Comes a Regular&quot; and &quot;Swingin&#x27; Party&quot;. The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot; (1987), recorded in Memphis with Big Star producer Jim Dickinson. Minneapolis guitarist Slim Dunlap took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot; and &quot;All Shook Down&quot; (1989–1990)===
The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot;, was a quieter, less punky affair, largely considered an attempt at mainstream success. While the move cost the Replacements the appreciation of some hardcore fans, the album had some notable songs, such as &quot;Achin&#x27; to Be&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be You&quot;, the latter of which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart. The band then made a second appearance on network television, on the short-lived ABC program &quot;International Rock Awards&quot;, for which they performed a typically energetic version of &quot;Talent Show&quot; and caused a minor controversy when Westerberg responded to the network&#x27;s censoring of the &quot;feeling good from the pills we took&quot; line by inserting an uncensored &quot;It&#x27;s too late to take pills, here we go&quot; at the end of the song. The band appeared on the cover of &quot;Musician&quot; magazine in February 1989, in which it was described as &quot;the last, best band of the 80s&quot;.

Trouble in the band began following a disastrous tour opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. &quot;All Shook Down&quot; won critical praise and more mainstream attention and its debut single &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; again topped the Modern Rock charts. However, the album&#x27;s many guest players and Mars&#x27; quick departure from the band following the album&#x27;s release led many to wonder about the band&#x27;s future. They also received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

===Breakup (1991–2011)===
Steve Foley was recruited as Mars&#x27;s replacement in 1990, and the band toured with Elvis Costello in June 1991, the final show being at Madison Square Garden. The band embarked on a long farewell tour which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band played their last show for 22 years, with the Chicago power-pop trio Material Issue at Taste of Chicago in Grant Park, referred to by fans as &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over &#x27;Til the Fat Roadie Plays&quot;, because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast live by the Chicago radio station WXRT. Several bootlegs are available on the Internet.

After leaving the Replacements in 1986, Bob Stinson played in local Minneapolis bands such as Static Taxi and the Bleeding Hearts. After several years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died in 1995, at the age of 35. Tommy Stinson quickly followed his time in the Replacements with the short-lived bands Bash &amp; Pop and Perfect. He was the bass guitarist for Guns N&#x27; Roses beginning in 1998, replacing Duff McKagan from the band&#x27;s &quot;classic lineup&quot; until leaving the band in 2016. In 2004, he released a solo CD, &quot;Village Gorilla Head&quot;, followed in 2011 by &quot;One Man Mutiny&quot;.

Westerberg is a successful singer-songwriter signed to Vagrant Records and, under his alias Grandpaboy, to Fat Possum Records. His album &quot;Folker&quot; was released in September 2004, marking a return to the melodic low-fi of the Replacements. Dunlap kept a low national profile but remained active in the Twin Cities music scene until suffering a massive stroke in 2012, which left him without the ability to move or eat. Mars primarily works as a visual artist.

In 1997, Reprise Records released the two CD set &quot;All for Nothing / Nothing for All&quot;. The &quot;All for Nothing&quot; disc collected cuts from &quot;Tim&quot; through &quot;All Shook Down&quot;; the &quot;Nothing for All&quot; disc is a collection of B-sides and tracks not previously released on albums.

In 2002, in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Westerberg mentioned that the Replacements had been considering a reunion. He said, &quot;We&#x27;ll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it might take a few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain&#x27;t over.&quot; A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg on a tour of the Midwest, but Stinson&#x27;s prior commitments with Guns N&#x27; Roses prevented it from happening. 

In 2004, active members of the band performed as the fictional Christian Rock group, Godflight, in Brian Dannelly&#x27;s cult classic satirical black comedy, Saved!, starring Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Eva Amurri, and Macaulay Culkin.

On June 13, 2006, Rhino Records released the compilation album &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know Who I Think I Was?&quot;, consisting of songs from the Twin/Tone and Sire-Reprise years and including two new songs, &quot;Pool &amp; Dive&quot; and &quot;Message to the Boys&quot;. The new songs were written by Westerberg and recorded by the band (Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and Mars) at Flowers Studio in Minneapolis. Session musician Josh Freese (the Vandals, ex-A Perfect Circle, and ex-Guns N&#x27; Roses) played drums on the two tracks; Mars contributed backing vocals. Neither Slim Dunlap nor Steve Foley participated in the sessions.

On April 22, 2008, Rhino released remastered deluxe editions of the band&#x27;s four Twin/Tone albums with rare bonus tracks. On September 24, 2008, Rhino similarly released the four Sire albums in deluxe editions. Material recorded with Tom Waits in 1988 was released on the Westerberg solo album &quot;3oclockreep&quot; in 2008.

Foley died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of a prescription medication.

===Reunion (2012–2015)===

On October 3, 2012, it was announced that the Replacements had re-formed and that Westerberg and Tommy Stinson were in the studio recording an EP containing song cover versions. Titled &quot;Songs for Slim&quot;, the EP was sold in a 250-copy edition of 10&quot; vinyl and auctioned online to benefit former bandmate Dunlap, who had suffered a stroke.

In November 2012, the documentary filmmaker Gorman Bechard released &quot;Color Me Obsessed&quot;, a film which tells the band&#x27;s story through the eyes of their most ardent fans.

The Replacements played their first shows in 22 years at Riot Fest in Toronto (August 24 and 25, 2013), Chicago (September 13–15) and Denver (September 21 and 22). Dave Minehan, guitarist and vocalist of the Boston-based band the Neighborhoods as well as drummer Josh Freese rounded out the lineup for the shows. 

Westerberg said that the band has not ruled out touring or recording a new album. The band played two sets at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, on April 11 and 18, 2014; Green Day front man Billie Joe Armstrong joined the band onstage on the second date. The band was also announced as one of the headliners of the September 2014 Boston Calling Music Festival, along with Lorde and the National. On September 9, 2014, the Replacements appeared as the musical guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, performing &quot;Alex Chilton&quot;. On September 19, 2014, they played at Forest Hills Stadium. Monsoon rains cancelled the Summer Ends Music Festival in Tempe, Arizona, on September 27, 2014, resulting in their only indoor show of the tour when it was moved to the Marquee Theatre.

On December 17, 2014, a 24-minute jazz improvisation track entitled &quot;Poke Me in My Cage&quot; was uploaded to the band&#x27;s SoundCloud account.

On February 9, 2015, the band announced a spring tour of the United States. On this tour, they debuted a new song called &quot;Whole Foods Blues&quot;, and according to their co-manager Darren Hill, the band has &quot;laid down seven or eight&quot; for a possible new album. Towards the end of the tour, two shows in Columbus, Ohio and Pittsburgh were initially postponed for medical reasons, but were later canceled. The Replacements performed for the first time in Spain and Portugal at the Primavera Sound festival on May 28, 2015, and June 5, 2015, respectively as part of a brief European tour. On June 5, 2015, Westerberg announced onstage at the Primavera Sound festival in Porto, Portugal, that it was the band&#x27;s final show. T-shirts Westerberg had worn to previous shows had hinted at this outcome: each shirt had two letters on it (one each on front and back) spelling out, &quot;I have always loved you. Now I must whore my past.&quot;

In a September 2015 interview, Stinson discussed the band working on new studio material, stating, &quot;it was one of those things: We dipped our toe in the water, and it didn&#x27;t feel so good.&quot; Stinson said that he had reworked songs he wrote for the Replacements as material for his solo career.

==Live performances==
The Replacements gained local notoriety following their first live performance, because of Tommy Stinson&#x27;s young age. Early shows were consistently tight and became more aggressive following the release of the &quot;Stink&quot; EP in 1982. As their stylistic repertoire began to expand with the writing and recording of &quot;Hootenanny&quot; the following year, the band&#x27;s increasingly antagonistic stage show left them with a reputation for their rowdy, often drunken live shows. The band frequently went on stage too intoxicated to play. They were famously permanently banned from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after performing drunk before a national television audience on January 18, 1986. 

As a reviewer succinctly observed, the band could quite often be &quot;mouthing profanities into the camera, stumbling into each other, falling down, dropping their instruments, and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were.&quot; There emerged an element of unpredictability, as The Replacements—when sober—gained critical praise for their live shows. Part of the mystique of The Replacements was the fact that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play. It was not uncommon for the group to play entire sets of cover versions, ranging anywhere from Bryan Adams&#x27;s &quot;Summer of &#x27;69&quot; to Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &quot;The Look of Love&quot; to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;.

==Legacy==

The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh. Westerberg also has a star for his solo work; he is one of the few musicians to be honored with multiple stars on the mural.

The Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; vocalist and guitarist Johnny Rzeznik cites Paul Westerberg as an &quot;obvious influence&quot; on his music. The Goo Goo Dolls toured in support for the Replacements&#x27; final tour. They also co-wrote the song &quot;We Are the Normal&quot; with Westerberg for their 1993 album &quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot;. Members of the Cribs have cited the Replacements as a key influence. Members of the alternative country groups Uncle Tupelo and Whiskeytown have said that the Replacements were an important influence on them. Brian Fallon of Gaslight Anthem said in a 2009 interview that &quot;without the Replacements, there would be no Gaslight Anthem&quot; and that they were inspired by the song &quot;Left of the Dial&quot;. The band They Might Be Giants made a tribute song to them called &quot;We&#x27;re The Replacements&quot;.

1234 Go! Records released &quot;We&#x27;ll Inherit the Earth: A Tribute to The Replacements&quot; on October 3, 2006. The album contains twenty-three covers of the Replacements songs by various rock, punk, pop and country artists.

On October 16, 2013, the band was announced as one of the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees, but they were not inducted. &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; appears as a playable song in Harmonix&#x27;s music videogame &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; for all consoles. &quot;Kids Don&#x27;t Follow&quot; was also released for the game as downloadable content.

Indie rock band Art Brut released a song titled &quot;The Replacements&quot; on their third album (Art Brut vs. Satan), in which singer Eddie Argos expresses both appreciation for the band, and incredulousness over the fact he was not already familiar with their music.

Their songs have been used in many feature films. &quot;Treatment Bound&quot; was used in the official soundtrack for &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;. The 1998 teen comedy film &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; is named after their single, and the song itself plays over the end credits. The song &quot;I Will Dare&quot; is sung by Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz in the car in &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot;. Lou and Nick contemplate their lives and the possibility of changing the past in the 2010 comedy &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot; while &quot;I Will Dare&quot; plays in the background. 

&quot;I&#x27;ll Be You&quot; plays during Jerry&#x27;s bachelor party in the 1996 romantic comedy-drama sports film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;. The 2009 Greg Mottola film, &quot;Adventureland&quot;, opens with &quot;Bastards of Young&quot;. The song &quot;Unsatisfied&quot; is used in the film during the bus ride to New York. The song was also featured in the 1994 film &quot;Airheads&quot; and the 2016 film &quot;Ordinary World&quot;. The fictional band the Fingers, in the movie &quot;Losers Take All&quot;, gets their big break by securing a gig opening for the Replacements. &quot;Within Your Reach&quot; was used in the 1989 film &quot;Say Anything&quot;. &quot;Here Comes a Regular&quot; was on the episode &quot;Rigby&#x27;s Graduation Day Special&quot; on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Regular Show&quot;. &quot;Here Comes a Regular&quot; was on the episode &quot;The Wind That Blew My Heart Away&quot; on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. Peyton&#x27;s mother describes the song as &quot;the happiest&quot; and it is heard playing in the episode. &quot;Here Comes a Regular&quot; also appeared in the final episode of the Netflix series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;.

In what could be considered the only case of the Replacements somewhat receiving any official recording industry accolades, the band&#x27;s biographer Bob Mehr received the Best Album Notes trophy at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021 for his liner notes on the 2019 box set &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Pop&quot;, which is itself an anniversary reissue of their 1989 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell a Soul&quot;.

In 2023, Tommy Stinson said:
Part of our lure is that we stayed underground. We stayed underground, for the most part, because of our shortcomings[...] But that was also, somehow, our strong-suit—that we were so unable to conform to what would make us star-quality or what would catapult us. We always felt like the music had to do it, that we couldn&#x27;t do something with the music to make us more popular. In saying that, there were a lot of opportunities that I think we probably pissed away—because we just didn&#x27;t know how to greet them artistically and make them fun or make them palatable. We pretty much wung [sic] our entire career. From top to bottom, we were total defects and we didn&#x27;t know any better. All that you hear is exactly the way we were. It&#x27;s the good, the bad and the ugly, really.

<text>Twin cities are a special case of two neighboring cities or urban centres that grow into a single conurbation – or narrowly separated urban areas – over time. There are no formal criteria, but twin cities are generally comparable in status and size, though not necessarily equal; a city and a substantially smaller suburb would not typically qualify, even if they were once separate. Tri-cities and quad cities are similar phenomena involving three or four municipalities.

A common – but not universal – scenario is two cities that developed concurrently on opposite sides of a river. For example, Minneapolis and Saint Paul in Minnesota – one of the most widely known pairs of &quot;Twin Cities&quot; – were founded several miles apart on opposite sides of the Mississippi River, and competed for prominence as they grew.

In some cases, twin cities are separated by a state border, such as Albury (New South Wales) and Wodonga (Victoria) in Australia, on opposite sides of the Murray River. In Pakistan, Islamabad and Rawalpindi are twin cities located in northwestern Punjab region with Islamabad, administratively being part of the Islamabad Capital Territory, and Rawalpindi, part of the province of Punjab. Cities on opposite sides of international borders sometimes share enough cultural and historical identity to be seen as twins, such as Haparanda (Sweden) and Tornio (Finland), Leticia (Colombia) and Tabatinga (Brazil), or Valga (Estonia) and Valka (Latvia).

In some cases twin cities eventually merge into a single legal municipality, such as Buda and Pest merging in 1873 into Budapest, Hungary; Brooklyn being annexed by New York City in 1898; or the three ancient cities of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang joining in 1927 into Wuhan.

As a single urban area, twin cities may share an airport whose airport codes include both cities&#x27; initials, e.g., DFW (Dallas–Fort Worth), LBA (Leeds–Bradford), MSP (Minneapolis–Saint Paul), RDU (Raleigh and Durham), and CAK (Akron–Canton).

:China
:* Wuhan in China consists of the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang in Hubei Province.
:India
:* Delhi: What used to be Old Delhi, New Delhi, and a collection of smaller villages has now grown into the current megalopolis that is seen today, also known as the National Capital Region (NCR)
:* In Telangana, the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad are merged to form Greater Hyderabad.
:Japan
:* Fukuoka in Japan, a city of 1.4 million people, formerly the twin cities of Hakata and Fukuoka until the late 19th century.
:* Kitakyushu in Japan, a city of 900,000 people, created in 1963 by the merger of Yahata, Kokura, Moji, Wakamatsu, and Tobata. Yahata and Kokura had formerly been major cities in their own right.
:* Saitama in Japan, a city of 1.2 million people, created in 2001 by the merger of the cities of Urawa, Omiya, Yono, and later Iwatsuki. Urawa and Omiya could formerly have been considered twin cities.
:Pakistan
:* Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan, has been expanded to include smaller towns including Rawat in its territory. 
:* Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan, has, as of 2013, grown out so much that small towns by this giant city, such as Shahdara, have been absorbed in its city limits.
:Taiwan
:* The former cities of Taoyuan and Zhongli, Taiwan, which merged along with the entire county in 2014 to form a single municipality city of Taoyuan, the two cities sit directly next to each other and shares almost the same population.
:Thailand
:* Bangkok, the capital and largest city of Thailand, was created in 1971, when the previous Bangkok province (Phra Nakhon) was merged with Thonburi province.

== Fictional twin cities ==
* Ankh-Morpork, from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, is referred to as &quot;the twin cities of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork&quot;
* Besźel and Ul Qoma in China Miéville&#x27;s novel &quot;The City &amp; the City&quot; are intertwined twin city-states in Eastern Europe whose inhabitants have trained themselves to only see the city they live in and unsee the city they don&#x27;t.
* Central City and Keystone City, from the current &quot;Flash&quot; comics, are shown as twin cities. Before the 1985-86 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Central and Keystone are presented as located in the same space but on different parallel Earths.
* Duckburg and St. Canard were depicted in the cartoon &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; as sister cities connected by a bridge, very similar to Oakland and San Francisco.
* Gotham City (the home of Batman) and Metropolis (the home of Superman) have sometimes been presented as twin cities, mainly in 1970s and 1980s stories by DC Comics. In stories presenting them as twin cities, Gotham City and Metropolis are located on opposite sides of a large bay (identified as Delaware Bay in 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Atlas of the DC Universe&quot;), with both cities linked by the Metro-Narrows Bridge, a suspension bridge resembling New York City&#x27;s Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
* Helium, from the &quot;Barsoom&quot; series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, consists of the twin cities Greater Helium and Lesser Helium.

<text>The Tyrrhenian Sea (, ; or ) is part of the Mediterranean Sea off the western coast of Italy. It is named for the Tyrrhenian people identified with the Etruscans of Italy.

==Geography==
The sea is bounded by the islands of Corsica and Sardinia (to the west), the Italian Peninsula (regions of Tuscany, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata, and Calabria) to the north and east, and the island of Sicily (to the south). The Tyrrhenian Sea also includes a number of smaller islands like Capri, Elba, Ischia, and Ustica.
The maximum depth of the sea is .

The Tyrrhenian Sea is situated near where the African and Eurasian Plates meet; therefore mountain chains and active volcanoes, such as Mount Marsili, are found in its depths. The eight Aeolian Islands and Ustica are located in the southern part of the sea, north of Sicily.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tyrrhenian Sea as follows:
* In the Strait of Messina: A line joining the North extreme of Cape Paci (15°42′E) with the East extreme of the Island of Sicily, Cape Peloro (38°16′N).
* On the Southwest: A line running from Cape Lilibeo (West extreme of Sicily) to the South extreme of Cape Teulada (8°38′E) in Sardinia.
* In the Strait of Bonifacio: A line joining the West extreme of Cape Testa (41°14′N) in Sardinia with the Southwest extreme of Cape Feno (41°23′N) in Corsica.
* On the North: A line joining Cape Corse (Cape Grosso, 9°23′E) in Corsica, with Tinetto Island () and thence through Tino and Palmaria islands to San Pietro Point () on the coast of Italy.

===Exits===
There are four exits from the Tyrrhenian Sea (north to south):
===Basins===
The Tyrrhenian Basin is divided into two basins (or plains), the Vavilov plain and the Marsili plain. They are separated by the undersea ridge known as the Issel Bridge, after Arturo Issel.

== Geology ==
The Tyrrhenian Sea is a back-arc basin that formed due to the rollback of the Calabrian slab towards South-East during the Neogene. Episodes of fast and slow trench retreat formed first the Vavilov basin and, then, the Marsili basin. Submarine volcanoes and the active volcano Mount Stromboli formed because trench retreat produces extension in the overriding plate allowing the mantle to rise below the surface and partially melt. The magmatism here is also affected by the fluids released from the slab.

==Name==
Its name derives from the Greek name for the Etruscans, first mentioned by Hesiod in the 8th century BC who described them as residing in central Italy alongside the Latins. The Etruscans lived along the coast of modern Tuscany, Latium and Campania, and referred to the water as the &quot;Sea of the Etruscans&quot;.

== Islands ==

Islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea include:
* Corsica
* Sardinia
* Sicily
* Tuscan Archipelago
* Ischia
* Procida
* Capri
* Ustica
* Aeolian Islands (including Lipari and Stromboli)
* Pontine Islands including Ponza

==Ports==

The main ports of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy are: Naples, Palermo, Civitavecchia (Rome), Salerno, Trapani, and Gioia Tauro. There is also Bastia, located in Corsica.

Note that even though the phrase &quot;port of Rome&quot; is frequently used, there is in fact no port in Rome. Instead, the &quot;port of Rome&quot; refers to the maritime facilities at Civitavecchia, some to the northwest of Rome.

Giglio Porto is a small island port in this area. It rose to prominence, when the &quot;Costa Concordia&quot; ran aground near the coast of Giglio and sank. The ship was later refloated and towed to Genoa for scrapping.

==Winds==
In Greek mythology, it is believed that the cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea housed the four winds kept by Aeolus. The winds are the Mistral from the Rhône valley, the Libeccio from the southwest, and the Sirocco and Ostro from the south.

<doc id="31550" wikidata="Q62852" url="?curid=31550" title="Ted Nelson">
<text>Theodor Holm Nelson (born June 17, 1937) is an American pioneer of information technology, philosopher, and sociologist. He coined the terms &quot;hypertext&quot; and &quot;hypermedia&quot; in 1963 and published them in 1965. According to a 1997 &quot;Forbes&quot; profile, Nelson &quot;sees himself as a literary romantic, like a Cyrano de Bergerac, or &#x27;the Orson Welles of software&#x27;.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Nelson is the son of Emmy Award-winning director Ralph Nelson and Academy Award-winning actress Celeste Holm. His parents&#x27; marriage was brief and he was mostly raised by his grandparents, first in Chicago and later in Greenwich Village.

Nelson earned a B.A. in philosophy from Swarthmore College in 1959. While there, he made an experimental humorous student film, &quot;The Epiphany of Slocum Furlow&quot;, in which the titular hero discovers the meaning of life. His contemporary at the college, musician and composer Peter Schickele, scored the film. Following a year of graduate study in sociology at the University of Chicago, Nelson began graduate work in Social Relations, then a department at Harvard University specializing in sociology, ultimately earning a M.A in sociology from the Department of Social Relations in 1962. After Harvard, Nelson was a photographer and filmmaker for a year at John C. Lilly&#x27;s Communication Research Institute in Miami, Florida, where he briefly shared an office with Gregory Bateson. From 1964 to 1966, he was an instructor in sociology at Vassar College.

During college and graduate school, he began to envision a computer-based writing system that would provide a lasting repository for the world&#x27;s knowledge, and also permit greater flexibility of drawing connections between ideas. This came to be known as Project Xanadu.

Much later in life, in 2002, he obtained his PhD in media and governance from Keio University.

==Project Xanadu==

Nelson founded Project Xanadu in 1960, with the goal of creating a computer network with a simple user interface. The effort is documented in the books &quot;Computer Lib / Dream Machines&quot; (1974), &quot;The Home Computer Revolution&quot; (1977) and &quot;Literary Machines&quot; (1981). Much of his adult life has been devoted to working on Xanadu and advocating for it.

Throughout his career, Nelson supported his work on the project through a variety of administrative, academic and research positions and consultancies, including stints at Harcourt Brace and Company (a technology consultancy and assistantship where he met Douglas Engelbart, who later became a close friend; 1966–1967), Brown University (a tumultuous consultancy on the Nelson-inspired Hypertext Editing System and File Retrieval and Editing System with Swarthmore friend Andries van Dam&#x27;s group; c. 1967–1969), Bell Labs (hypertext-related defense research; 1968–1969), CBS Laboratories (&quot;writing and photographing interactive slide shows for their AVS-10 instructional device&quot;; 1968–1969), the University of Illinois at Chicago (an interdisciplinary staff position; 1973–1976) and Swarthmore College (visiting lecturer in computing; 1977).

Nelson also conducted research and development under the auspices of the Nelson Organization (founder and president; 1968–1972) and the Computopia Corporation (co-founder; 1977–1978). Clients of the former firm included IBM, Brown University, Western Electric, the University of California, the Jewish Museum, the Fretheim Chartering Corporation and the Deering-Milliken Research Corporation. He has alleged that the Nelson Organization was envisaged as a clandestine funding conduit for the Central Intelligence Agency, which expressed interest in Project Xanadu at an early juncture; however, the promised funds failed to materialize after several benchmarks were met.

From 1980 to 1981, he was the editor of &quot;Creative Computing&quot;. At the behest of Xanadu developers Mark S. Miller and Stuart Greene, Nelson joined San Antonio, Texas-based Datapoint as chief software designer (1981–1982), remaining with the company as a media specialist and technical writer until its Asher Edelman-driven restructuring in 1984. Following several San Antonio-based consultancies and the acquisition of Xanadu technology by Autodesk in 1988, he continued working on the project as a non-managerial Distinguished Fellow in the San Francisco Bay Area until the divestiture of the Xanadu Operating Group in 1992–1993.

After holding visiting professorships in media and information science at Hokkaido University (1995–1996), Keio University (1996–2002), the University of Southampton and the University of Nottingham, he was a fellow (2004–2006) and visiting fellow (2006–2008) of the Oxford Internet Institute in conjunction with Wadham College, Oxford. More recently, he has taught classes at Chapman University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.
The Xanadu project itself failed to flourish, for a variety of reasons which are disputed. Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history of Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of &quot;Wired&quot;, calling it &quot;the longest-running vaporware project in the history of computing&quot;. On his own website, Nelson expressed his disgust with the criticisms, referring to Wolf as &quot;Gory Jackal&quot;, and threatened to sue him. He also outlined his objections in a letter to &quot;Wired&quot;, and released a detailed rebuttal of the article.

As early as 1972, a demonstration iteration developed by Cal Daniels failed to reach fruition when Nelson was forced to return the project&#x27;s rented Data General Nova minicomputer due to financial exigencies. Nelson has stated that some aspects of his vision are being fulfilled by Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s invention of the World Wide Web, but he dislikes the World Wide Web, XML and all embedded markup – regarding Berners-Lee&#x27;s work as a gross over-simplification of his original vision: HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can&#x27;t follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.

Jaron Lanier explained the difference between the World Wide Web and Nelson&#x27;s vision, and the implications: 
A core technical difference between a Nelsonian network and what we have become familiar with online is that [Nelson&#x27;s] network links were two-way instead of one-way. In a network with two-way links, each node knows what other nodes are linked to it. ... Two-way linking would preserve context. It&#x27;s a small simple change in how online information should be stored that couldn&#x27;t have vaster implications for culture and the economy.

==Other projects==
In 1957, while a student, Nelson co-wrote and co-produced what he describes as a pioneering rock musical. Entitled &quot;Anything and Everything&quot;, it was produced and performed at Swarthmore College.

In 1965, he presented the paper &quot;Complex Information Processing: A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate&quot; at the ACM National Conference, in which he coined the term &quot;hypertext&quot;.

In 1976, Nelson co-founded and briefly served as the advertising director of the &quot;itty bitty machine company&quot;, or &quot;ibm&quot;, a small computer retail store that operated from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston, Illinois. In 1978, he had a significant impact upon IBM&#x27;s thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC.

From the 1960s to the mid-2000s, Nelson built an extensive collection of direct advertising mail he received in his mailbox, mainly from companies selling products in IT, print/publishing, aerospace, and engineering. In 2017, the Internet Archive began to publish it online in scanned form, in a collection titled &quot;Ted Nelson&#x27;s Junk Mail Cartons&quot;.

==ZigZag==

As of 2011, Nelson was working on a new information structure, ZigZag, which is described on the Xanadu project website, which also hosts two versions of the Xanadu code. He also developed XanaduSpace, a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents (an early version of this software may be freely downloaded).

==Influence and recognition==
In January 1988 &quot;Byte&quot; magazine published an article about Nelson&#x27;s ideas, titled &quot;Managing Immense Storage&quot;. This stimulated discussions within the computer industry, and encouraged people to experiment with Hypertext features.

In 1998, at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane, Australia, Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award.

In 2001, he was knighted by France as Officier des Arts et Lettres. In 2007, he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited lecture at the University of Southampton. In 2014, ACM SIGCHI honored him with a Special Recognition Award.

In 2014, Nelson was conferred with a Doctor of Science degree, honoris causa, by Chapman University. The ceremony took place during the &#x27;Intertwingled&#x27; conference, featuring Nelson and other prominent figures in the field, including Apple Computer founder Steve Wozniak and former Association for Computing Machinery president Wendy Hall. At the conference, Nelson stated confidence in the potential of his Xanadu system, saying &#x27;The world would have been a better place if I had succeeded, but I ain&#x27;t dead yet.&#x27;

<doc id="31551" wikidata="Q230052" url="?curid=31551" title="Tongue twister">
<text>A tongue twister is a phrase that is designed to be difficult to articulate properly, and can be used as a type of spoken (or sung) word game. Additionally, they can be used as exercises to improve pronunciation and fluency. Some tongue twisters produce results that are humorous (or humorously vulgar) when they are mispronounced, while others simply rely on the confusion and mistakes of the speaker for their amusement value.

== Types of tongue twisters ==
Some tongue twisters rely on rapid alternation between similar but distinct phonemes (e.g., &quot;s&quot; and &quot;sh&quot; ), combining two different alternation patterns, familiar constructs in loanwords, or other features of a spoken language in order to be difficult to articulate. For example, the following sentence was said to be &quot;the most difficult of common English-language tongue twisters&quot; by William Poundstone.

These deliberately difficult expressions were popular in the 19th century. The popular &quot;she sells seashells&quot; tongue twister was originally published in 1850 as a diction exercise. The term &quot;tongue twister&quot; was first applied to this kind of expression in 1895.

&quot;She sells seashells&quot; was turned into a popular song in 1908, with words by British songwriter Terry Sullivan and music by Harry Gifford. According to folklore, it was said to be inspired by the life and work of Mary Anning, an early fossil collector. However, there is no evidence that Anning inspired either the tongue twister or the song.

Another well-known tongue twister is &quot;Peter Piper&quot;:

Many tongue twisters use a combination of alliteration and rhyme. They have two or more sequences of sounds that require repositioning the tongue between syllables, then the same sounds are repeated in a different sequence. An example of this is the song &quot;Betty Botter&quot; (), first published in 1899:

There are twisters that make use of compound words and their stems, for example:

The following twister entered a contest in &quot;Games Magazine&quot; on the November/December 1979 issue and was announced the winner on the March/April 1980 issue:

Some tongue twisters take the form of words or short phrases which become tongue twisters when repeated rapidly (the game is often expressed in the form &quot;Say this phrase three (or five, or ten, etc.) times as fast as you can!&quot;). Examples include:

* Toy boat
* Cricket critic
* Unique New York
* A proper copper coffee pot
* Red leather, yellow leather
* Irish wristwatch, Swiss wristwatch
* Peggy Babcock
* Red lorry, yellow lorry

Some tongue twisters are used for speech practice and vocal warmup:

Tongue twisters are used to train pronunciation skills in non-native speakers:

Other types of tongue twisters derive their humor from producing vulgar results only when performed incorrectly:

Some twisters are amusing because they sound incorrect even when pronounced correctly:

In 2013, MIT researchers claimed that this is the trickiest twister to date:

== Linguistics of tongue twisters ==
=== Phonemes ===
Based on the MIT confusion matrix of 1620 single phoneme errors, the phoneme with the greatest margin of speech error is &quot;l&quot; [l] mistaken for &quot;r&quot; [r]. Other phonemes that had a high level of speech error include &quot;s&quot; [s] mistaken for &quot;sh&quot; [ʃ], &quot;f&quot; [f] for &quot;p&quot; [p], &quot;r&quot; [r] for &quot;l&quot; [l], &quot;w&quot; [w] for &quot;r&quot; [r], and many more. These sounds are most likely to transform to a similar sound when placed in near vicinity of each other. Most of these mix-ups can be attributed to the two phonemes having similar areas of articulation in the mouth.

Pronunciation difficulty is also theorized to have an effect on tongue twisters. For example, &quot;t&quot; [t] is thought to be easier to pronounce than &quot;ch&quot; [tʃ]. As a result, speakers may naturally transform &quot;ch&quot; [tʃ] to &quot;t&quot; [t] or when trying to pronounce certain tongue twisters.

=== Fortis and lenis ===
Fortis and lenis are the classification of strong and weak consonants.

Some characteristics of strong consonants include:
* high frequency in a language
* earlier development in language acquisition
* lower placement on the phonological hierarchy

It is common for more difficult sounds to be replaced with strong consonants in tongue twisters. This is partially determinant of which sounds are most likely to transform to other sounds with linguistic confusion.

== Other languages ==
Tongue twisters exist in many languages, such as , and .

The complexity of tongue twisters varies from language to language. For example, in Luganda vowels differ by length so tongue twisters exploit vowel length: &quot;Akawala akaawa Kaawa kaawa akaawa ka wa?&quot;. Translation: &quot;The girl who gave Kaawa bitter coffee, where is she from?&quot;

=== Shibboleths ===
Shibboleths, that is, phrases in a language that are difficult for someone who is not a native speaker of that language to say might be regarded as a type of tongue-twist. An example is Georgian &quot;baq&#x27;aq&#x27;i ts&#x27;q&#x27;alshi q&#x27;iq&#x27;inebs&quot; (&quot;a frog croaks in the water&quot;), in which &quot;q&quot;&#x27; is a uvular ejective. Another example, the Czech and Slovak &quot;strč prst skrz krk&quot; (&quot;stick a finger through the throat&quot;) is difficult for a non-native speaker due to the absence of vowels, although syllabic r is a common sound in Czech, Slovak and some other Slavic languages.

=== Finger-fumblers ===
The sign language equivalent of a tongue twister is called a finger-fumbler. According to Susan Fischer, the phrase &quot;Good blood, bad blood&quot; is a tongue twister in English as well as a finger-fumbler in ASL.

===One-syllable article===
One-syllable article is a form of Mandarin Chinese tongue twister, written in Classical Chinese. Due to Mandarin Chinese having only four tonal ranges (compared to nine in Cantonese, for example), these works sound like a work of one syllable in different tonal range when spoken in Mandarin, but are far more comprehensible when spoken in another dialect.

== In popular culture ==
*In 1951 Danny Kaye recorded a Sylvia Fine song titled &quot;Tongue Twisters&quot;.
*The children&#x27;s books by Dr. Seuss contain a significant number of tongue twisters, with &quot;Oh Say Can You Say?&quot;, and &quot;Fox in Socks&quot; being the most extreme cases.
*In the 1952 film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, movie star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) uses tongue twisters, such as Peter Piper, while learning proper diction so he can make the transition from silent films to &quot;talkies&quot; in 1920s Hollywood. He also turns one of them (&quot;Moses supposes his toeses are roses&quot;) into a song and dance number along with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O&#x27;Connor).
*In 1968, Jack Webb guested on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and took part in a parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot;. The premise was Webb (as Sgt. Joe Friday) grilling Carson about &quot;kleptomaniac Claude Cooper from Cleveland, who copped clean copper clappers kept in a closet.&quot; The sketch was regularly shown on anniversary specials.
*In the episode &quot;You Said a Mouseful&quot; from &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, both Pinky and Brain go through a collage of tongue twisters that cover almost every category possible.
*The TV series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; contains increasingly convoluted tongue twisters as the show progresses. The lines are often delivered by Princess Carolyn, and a notable set involves the actress &#x27;Courtney Portnoy&#x27;, for example: &quot;How would you enjoy joining Portnoy for a scorched soy porterhouse pork four-courser at Koi?&quot; followed by &quot;Glorify your source, but don&#x27;t make it feel forced, of course. And try the borscht!&quot; 
*Many examples of tongue twisters can be found in hip hop music. A commonly used tongue twister is &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, as seen in the 1986 Run-D.M.C. song &quot;Peter Piper&quot;.

<doc id="31552" wikidata="Q1522899" url="?curid=31552" title="Triple J">
<text>Triple J is an Australian government-funded national radio station founded in 1975 as a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). It aims to appeal to young listeners of alternative music, and plays more Australian content than commercial networks.

The station was set up under the Gough Whitlam government, wanting to extend the appeal of the ABC to young Australians. Initially broadcasting as 2JJ or Double Jay from 19 January 1975, it stood apart from commercial stations with its lack of private advertising and its fringe music programming. Following a transition to FM in 1981, the station rebranded as 2JJJ or Triple J as it expanded regionally throughout the 1990s. Two spin-off digital stations were launched in the early 2010s: Double J aims to appeal to more mature audiences, and Triple J Unearthed plays only unsigned, local musicians. 

Despite declining ratings in their target 18–24-year-old demographic, Triple J continues to have a significant impact on the Australian music landscape. It supports major music festivals and domestic tours, and organises its own events like One Night Stand. Every year, it broadcasts the Hottest 100, a public poll of the years&#x27; most popular music, and runs the J Awards, a music award series. Triple J annually champions Ausmusic Month and founded the nationwide Ausmusic T-Shirt Day initiative in 2013. The network&#x27;s online discovery platform, Unearthed, provides pathways for independent artists to be broadcast on the network. However, Triple J has been criticised for promoting a homogenous national music scene.

==History==
===1970s: Launch and early years===

==== Plans ====

The launch of a new, youth-focused radio station was a product of the progressive media policies of the Whitlam government of 1972–75. Prime minister Gough Whitlam wanted to set the station up to appeal to the youth vote, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), worried about its declining audience, &quot;wanted a station for young people who would grow up to be ABC listeners.&quot; A new station was also a recommendation stemming from the McLean Report of 1974, which suggested expanding radio broadcasting onto the FM band, issuing a new class of broadcasting licence which permitted the establishment of community radio stations, and the creation of two new stations for the ABC: 2JJ in Sydney, referred to as Double Jay, and the short-lived 3ZZ in Melbourne.

Double Jay was intended to be the first link in Whitlam&#x27;s planned national youth network; however, his administration was not re-elected in the 1975 federal election. The succeeding Fraser government&#x27;s budget cuts to the ABC also halted this plan from moving forward. By the time 2JJ went to air, the Whitlam government was in its final months of office, and presenters on the station were frequently accused of left-wing bias in the months that followed.

==== First broadcasts ====
Double Jay commenced broadcasting at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, 19 January 1975, at 1540 kHz on the AM band. The station was restricted largely to the Greater Sydney region, and its local reception was hampered by inadequate transmitter facilities. However, its frequency was a clear channel nationally, so it was easily heard at night throughout south-eastern Australia. After midnight, 2JJ would use off-air ABC networks to increase its broadcasting range.

Its first broadcast demonstrated a determination to distinguish itself from other Australian radio stations. The first on-air presenter, DJ Holger Brockmann, notably used his own name, which, at his previous role at 2SM, was considered &quot;too foreign-sounding&quot;. After an introductory montage that featured sounds from the countdown and launch of Apollo 11, Brockmann launched the station&#x27;s first broadcast with the words, &quot;Wow, and we&#x27;re away!&quot;, and then played Skyhooks&#x27; &quot;You Just Like Me &#x27;Cos I&#x27;m Good in Bed&quot;. The choice of this song to introduce the station was significant, as it represented several important features of the 2JJ brand at the time. Choosing an Australian band reflected the network&#x27;s commitment to Australian content at a time when American acts dominated pop stations. Further, the song was one of several tracks from the Skyhooks&#x27; album that had been banned on commercial radio for its explicit sexual content. The station chose to play songs that were banned from commercial airwaves, including the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;. Because 2JJ was a government-funded station operating under the umbrella of the ABC, it was not bound by commercial censorship codes, and was not answerable to advertisers nor the station owners. In contrast, their Sydney rival, 2SM, was owned by a holding company controlled by the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, resulting in the ban or editing of numerous songs.

The internal politics of 2JJ were considered a radical departure from the formats of commercial stations. 2JJ&#x27;s presenters had almost total freedom in their on-air delivery, and all staff participated in major policy decisions. For example, as former announcer Gayle Austin reflected: &quot;In early March, women took over the station as announcers to celebrate International Women&#x27;s Day&quot;, and &quot;The listeners owned the station... and if they wanted to come to the meetings and join the debate, they were welcome&quot;.

In its early years 2JJ&#x27;s on-air staff were mainly recruited from either commercial radio or other ABC stations. In another first for the industry, their roster also featured presenters who did not come from a radio background, including singer-songwriters Bob Hudson and John J. Francis, and actor Lex Marinos. Other notable foundation staff and presenters in January 1975 were Chris Winter, Marius Webb, Ron Moss, Arnold Frolows, Mark Colvin, Jim Middleton, Don Cumming, and Mac Cocker. Alan McGirvan was the breakfast announcer. Early staff also included Ted Robinson, Chris Winter, and Jim Middleton. Marius Webb and Ron Moss were the station coordinators, while Ros Cheney was progamme coordinator, and they established the workplace as kind of collective. Producer and programmer Sammy Collins later said of Cheney that she was &quot;more political and more dedicated than the men&quot;, and it was her presence which enabled female representation at every level. Double Jay was the first Australian music radio station to allow women DJs; one of these was Gayle Austin.

Before the launch of Double Jay in Sydney, Melbourne was the undisputed capital of music; the new station shone the light on musicians from Sydney musicians, and publicised gigs happening in the city. The station played artists such as Midnight Oil, Radio Birdman, INXS, Mental As Anything, and AC/DC long before they had exposure on any other media. 

==== Rise in popularity ====
The station rapidly gained popularity, especially with its target youth demographic: media articles noted that in its first two months on air, 2JJ reached a 5.4% share of the total radio audience, with 17% in the 18–24 age group, while the audience share of rival 2SM dropped by 2.3%. Despite the poor quality of reception caused by the Sydney transmitter, the station still saw rapid growth. Austin explained that station staff threatened industrial action in July 1975 due to the transmitter issues, but officials of the BCB still refused to meet with 2JJ representatives. A new transmitter was not provided until 1980, following the transition to the FM band.

After the station hosted an open-air concert in Liverpool, New South Wales, in May 1975 featuring Skyhooks and Dragon, city&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper claimed that attendees were &quot;shocked&quot; by &quot;depictions of sexual depravity and shouted obscenities&quot;, which allegedly caused women in the audience to clap their hands over their ears, prompting Coalition frontbencher Peter Nixon to call for the station to be closed down.

During the 1970s, the music programming varied a lot and depended on the presenters and producers, with various factions favouring different artists and styles.

===1980s: Relaunch and national expansion===
On 11 July 1980, 2JJ began broadcasting on the FM band at a frequency of 105.7 MHz (again restricted to within the Greater Sydney region) and became 2JJJ, referred to as Triple J. The first song played was another track then banned from commercial radio, &quot;Gay Guys&quot; by the Dugites. To celebrate the relaunch, the station organised a concert in Parramatta Park on 18 January 1981, featuring Midnight Oil and Matt Finish, who performed to a crowd of 40,000 people. 

On 19 January 1981, the AM transmissions ceased, and Triple J became an FM-only station. It was not until the 1989 that the ABC was finally able to expand to Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Perth. During this period, there were attempts to establish a playlist for the whole station.

In 1990 the station took strike action after ABC management censored the N.W.A. song &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;. In retaliation, the presenters played N.W.A.&#x27;s song &quot;Express Yourself&quot; 82 times in a row. Triple M director Barry Chapman was appointed as general manager to oversee Triple J&#x27;s network expansion and instil cultural change. His tenure generated controversy, most notably in 1990, when all senior announcers in the Sydney office were fired, including the most popular presenters Tony Biggs and Tim Ritchie. Several protests were held outside its William Street studios, including a 105-hour vigil, and a public meeting that packed the Sydney Town Hall with angry listeners spilled out onto the street. Listeners were concerned Chapman would bring a more commercial flair to Triple J with music programming that was less dominated by Sydney acts.

===1990s–2000s: Regional and digital expansion===
Throughout the 1990s, Triple J commenced expansion to more regional areas of Australia and, in 1994, it was extended to another 18 regional centres throughout the country. In 1996, the total was brought to 44, with the new additions including Launceston, Tasmania; Albany, Western Australia; Bathurst, New South Wales and Mackay, Queensland. Triple J&#x27;s most recent expansion was to Broome, Western Australia in 2005.

From the 1990s until around 2010, Triple J &quot;set the cultural agenda, particularly for Australian music&quot;. Grunge music came to the fore, and bands such as Spiderbait, the Beasts of Bourbon, and The Cruel Sea attained critical and popular success, boosted by Triple J&#x27;s playlist.

In May 2003, Arnold Frolows, the only remaining member of the original 2JJ staff of 1975, stepped down after 28 years as Triple J music director. He was replaced by presenter Richard Kingsmill, who joined the station in 1988.

In late 2004, the station&#x27;s promotion for their annual Beat the Drum contest – in which listeners were to send in the most remarkable places they could promote the Triple J logo – caused brief controversy after it issued a promotional image of the former World Trade Center draped with a huge drum flag. A notable winner of the competition was a Queensland farmer who formed a drum logo-shaped crop circle in his wheat-fields. 

Triple J launched its own music magazine, &quot;JMag&quot; (later known as &quot;Triple J Magazine&quot;), in 2005. It was initially published quarterly, then monthly, but in 2013 the magazine ceased publication by News Custom Publishing. It returned as an annual edition, produced in-house, until 2016.

Adapting to the digital streaming age, in 2004, the station began to release podcasts of some of its talkback shows, including &quot;Dr. Karl&quot;, &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, and &quot;Hack&quot;. In 2006, Triple J launched JTV (later rebranded to Triple J TV), a series of television programs broadcast on ABC1 and ABC2 including music videos, live concerts, documentaries, and comedy, as well as a behind-the-scenes look at Triple J&#x27;s studios.

===2010s: Double J and Unearthed relaunches===
In 2006, the website for Triple J Unearthed was launched. It remains a hub for unsigned Australian artists to upload their music and be heard by the Triple J team. A digital radio station, which only plays content from the website, was launched in 2011.

In 2014, ABC&#x27;s Dig Music digital radio station was rebranded under the Triple J umbrella, becoming Double J on 30 April 2014. The new station featured both new music and material from Triple J interview and sound archives. Former Triple J announcer Myf Warhurst, who hosted the inaugural shift, said &quot;it&#x27;s for people who love music, and also love a bit of music history&quot;.

In ratings released in August 2015, Triple J was the highest or equal first in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth in the 25–39 demographic.

Triple J attracted significant news coverage in the lead-up to the Hottest 100 of 2017, when the station announced they would move the countdown date to the fourth weekend of January, rather than on Australia Day (26 January). The decision was taken after a listener petition and survey indicated that the majority of listeners would like it changed, owing to sensitivities in the community about celebrating the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove.

=== 2020s: Kingsmill&#x27;s departure and restructuring ===
Triple J began 2020 with a major overhaul of its hosts, replacing longtime presenters including Gen Fricker and Tom Tilley with younger talent including Bryce Mills and Lucy Smith, in what was billed as a &quot;generational shift for the station&quot;.

In August 2021, the Triple J Twitter account posted a riff on a popular pick-up line, which attracted widespread criticism and accusations of ageism. Writing for &quot;NME,&quot; journalist Andrew Street said the controversy renewed discussion about the lack of airplay of older artists on the station, with many being &quot;deemed Double J-ready&quot; in their mid-20s.

As radio ratings continue to decline across the board due to the rise of streaming media, Triple J saw a 2.5% decline of listeners across the major capital cities between late April and June 2022. Compared to the audience share of 7.7% in the Sydney 18–24 year-old demographic in 2021, the station had dropped to 4.4% in 2022.

In December 2023, it was announced that Richard Kingsmill, who had been the music director of Triple J and its sister stations, would be leaving after 35 years at the ABC. During his tenure, he doubled the amount of airtime given to Australian artists, from 30% to 60%, and increased the station&#x27;s audience from 980,000 in 2006 to 3 million in 2022. Several news outlets, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Mumbrella&quot;, wrote pieces about Kingsmill&#x27;s importance to the Australian music scene, with Nathan Jolly of the latter calling the broadcaster &quot;the most important single figure in the history of Australian music&quot;, on par with Michael Gudinski and Molly Meldrum. 

Former head of the Nova network, Ben Latimer, was announced as the new head of radio at the ABC amidst a major board restructuring, causing audible &quot;shock and disappointment&quot; in a Sydney staff meeting. Several presenters also announced their departures, and long-running late night music show &quot;Good Nights&quot; was axed.

In May 2024, Triple J hosted the inaugural Bars of Steel Live event in Parramatta, showcasing hip hop and rap artists from all across Western Sydney. In September, the station also revived its One Night Stand regional music festival, which had not run since 2019. It took place in Warrnambool, Victoria to a sold-out crowd.

In January 2025, the station celebrated 50 years of existence. To celebrate the event, Double Jay broadcast the very first day of Triple J&#x27;s 1975 broadcast, on 19 January 2025 from 11am to 11pm, with a two-hour simulcast on triple j at 11am. Holger Brockmann introduced the replay.

==Music and identity==
In the station&#x27;s early years, Triple J primarily played alternative rock and pop rock, but the range of music programmed was far wider than its commercial rivals, encompassing both mainstream and alternative rock and pop, experimental and electronic music, progressive rock, funk, soul, disco, reggae, and the emerging ambient, punk and new wave genres of the late 1970s. Today, the station mostly plays modern rock, alt-pop, hip-hop and electronic music.

Triple J initially positioned itself as a &quot;punk&quot; brand due to its fringe and often controversial music programming. The first song played on the station, &quot;You Just Like Me &#x27;Cos I&#x27;m Good in Bed&quot; by Skyhooks, was banned from other Australian broadcasters due to its salacious content. The station had also been playing N.W.A&#x27;s protest song &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot; for six months before ABC management caught on, who banned it in 1990. As a result, Triple J staff went on strike and put the group&#x27;s song &quot;Express Yourself&quot; on continuous play for 24 hours, playing it roughly 82 times in a row.

The station also set itself apart by playing an unprecedented amount of Australian content, and it was a pioneer in its coverage of independent music. Early presenter Gayle Austin reflected in 2006 that before Triple J, &quot;Australian music didn’t have much production put into it because there wasn’t much money made out of it.&quot; The station has always had a 40% minimum Australian music quota, well above commercial radio&#x27;s 25%. In 2024, out of the 50 most played artists on Triple J, 33 were Australian, including eight in the top 10. Further, more than half of the acts included a non-male member. The most played act was indie pop duo Lime Cordiale.

For decades, Triple J has been criticised for apparently sounding too much like commercial radio and losing its distinct identity. According to Sam Whiting of &quot;The Conversation,&quot; the public critiquing the broadcaster for this reason is a &quot;national pastime&quot;. Writers have pointed to increased air time for international pop stars like Doja Cat, Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X as proof of this, and that Billie Eilish&#x27;s win in the 2018 Hottest 100 was an outcome &quot;unthinkable even a few years earlier.&quot; Similarly, Shaad D&#x27;Souza of &quot;The Guardian&quot; claims that in recent years, the station&#x27;s programming has been dominated by garage-pop bands, and overall &quot;consistent to a fault.&quot;

=== Music data ===
Launched in 2006 by Paul Stipack, J Play was an online archive of every song played by Triple J over 12 years. It showed an artist&#x27;s trajectory from their first airing to full rotation. The privately-owned site was acquired by Seventh Street Media (Brag Media) along with music publications &quot;Tone Deaf&quot; and &quot;The Brag&quot;, in early 2017. Owing to changes in the music industry, J Play&#x27;s usefulness diminished, and it ceased operation in January 2019. The Brag Media retained the J Play database of 40,000 songs, 11,000 artists, and 15,000 playlists.

In June 2024, Sydney software engineer Harrison Khannah launched Triple J Watchdog, a similar online resource that tracks each week&#x27;s top songs, musicians and genres, with additional statistics like artists&#x27; country of origin, pronouns and their amount of Spotify monthly listeners.

== Branding ==

The Triple J name is stylised in all lowercase, a marketing decision made in 1981 that according to writer Ben Eltham of &quot;Meanjin&quot;, is one that reflects &quot;a particular world-view that takes brand identity seriously&quot;. Marketing staff will vet press releases and posters to ensure the broadcaster name is written as &quot;triple j&quot;. In November 2024, the logos of Triple J and its sister stations were updated for the first time in 15 years.
The Triple J news theme is a &quot;very 90s remix&quot; of the classic ABC News theme &quot;Majestic Fanfare&quot;. It was written and produced by Paul McKercher and John Jacobs in 1991, and is still used as of 2024. It contains a drum sample from Prince&#x27;s &quot;Get Off&quot; and the record scratch from N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, a nod to the track after it was banned by ABC management. This unconventional news theme is another core element of the Triple J brand identity– McKercher wanted to create a sound that was distinctly uncommercial.

== Programs ==
Through the mid-to-late 1980s, Triple J pioneered special interest programs including the Japanese pop show &quot;Nippi Rock Shop&quot;, Arnold Frolows&#x27; weekly late-night ambient music show &quot;Ambience&quot;, and Jaslyn Hall&#x27;s world music show – the first of its kind on Australian mainstream radio. Nowadays, the station continues to broadcast several genre-specific music programs throughout the week, including:

* &quot;Soul Ctrl:&quot; playing neo soul and rhythm &amp; blues music
* &quot;The Racket:&quot; playing heavy metal music
* &quot;Short Fast Loud:&quot; playing punk rock, hardcore punk, metalcore and post-hardcore music
* &quot;Hip Hop Show:&quot; playing hip hop music.

Currently hosted by Ash McGregor, &quot;Home and Hosed&quot; is the flagship Australian music program on Triple J. It is broadcast most weekday evenings, whereas other specialist shows are only scheduled for once a week. Triple J also has several live music segments, including &quot;Like a Version&quot;– a weekly program which sees an artist perform an original and a cover song, &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;– broadcasts of exclusive concert recordings, and &quot;Bars of Steel&quot;, a web series featuring up-and-coming rappers freestyling.

News updates on Triple J are written and edited from a youth-oriented perspective. &quot;Hack&quot;, the station&#x27;s flagship current affairs program, is broadcast every weekday evening and features investigations into relevant issues affecting young Australians.

== Presenters ==
Many early Triple J presenters went on to successful careers with commercial stations, the most notable being Doug Mulray, who honed his distinctive comedy-based style at the ABC before moving to rival FM rock station Triple M in the 1980s, where he became the most popular breakfast presenter in Sydney, and one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the country. Presenter Annette Shun Wah went on to host the popular &quot;Rock Around the World&quot; series on SBS and is now a program executive with SBS TV and producer of &quot;The Movie Show&quot;.

From July 2024, presenters on daily programs include:

* &quot;Breakfast&quot;: Concetta Caristo and Luka Muller
* &quot;Mornings:&quot; Lucy Smith
* &quot;Lunch:&quot; Dave Woodhead
* &quot;Drive:&quot; Abby Butler and Tyrone Pynor
* &quot;Hack:&quot; Dave Marchese

== Initiatives ==

===Triple J Unearthed===
Triple J Unearthed is an online music discovery platform and digital radio station that features only unsigned Australian artists, focusing on discovering new local acts. Originally founded as a talent competition in 1996, notable winners of the time included Killing Heidi, Missy Higgins and Grinspoon. The Triple J Unearthed website was launched in 2006, and in five years, grew to host 30,000 artists and 250,000 users. Musicians can upload their songs to the site, and users can rate tracks and leave comments. In 2011, Triple J Unearthed was launched as a digital station in five Australian capital cities.

Unearthed hosts a number of competitions and initiatives to improve the recognition of independent artists. For example, Unearthed High is an annual contest held founded in 2008 aimed at musicians and bands in high school. The winner receives mentoring, recording opportunities and airplay on Triple J. Recent acts to have found success with the initiative include Hockey Dad (2014), The Kid Laroi (2018), Genesis Owusu (2015) Japanese Wallpaper (2014) and Gretta Ray (2016).

===Ausmusic Month===
Every November, Triple J celebrates Ausmusic Month, where Australian acts are heavily promoted across all its stations. A number of events are organised, including major concerts– in 2010 this included headlining acts Bag Raiders and Ball Park Music and in 2018 featured performances from Paul Kelly, Crowded House and Missy Higgins. Triple J hosts the J Awards during the month, and encourages listeners to wear their favourite band&#x27;s t-shirt on Ausmusic T-Shirt Day, an initiative which the station founded in 2013.

===J Awards===
The J Awards are an annual awards ceremony held in November each year to celebrate Australian music. As of 2024, the five award categories are Australian Album of the Year, Australian Music Video of the Year, Australian Live Act of the Year, Unearthed Artist of the Year and Double J Artist of the Year. The most recent J Award winners for Australian Album of the Year were &quot;Smiling With No Teeth&quot; by Genesis Owusu in 2021, &quot;Angel in Realtime&quot; by Gang of Youths in 2022, &quot;Drummer&quot; by G Flip in 2023, and &quot;Zorb&quot; by Sycco in 2024.

==Radio events==
===Hottest 100===
The Hottest 100 is an annual poll of the previous year&#x27;s most popular songs, as voted by listeners. It has been conducted for over two decades in its present form and attracts millions of votes annually. It is promoted as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest music democracy&quot; and has also spawned a series of compilation CDs released via ABC Music. The countdown of the poll had regularly taken place on Australia Day from 1998 to 2017. In response to controversy surrounding the Australia Day debate, and a petition and survey indicating that the majority of their listeners would like it to be changed, it was announced in November 2017 that future countdowns would be aired on the fourth weekend of January to avoid associations with the public holiday.

The station also runs irregular speciality Hottest 100 countdowns, such as the Hottest 100 Australian Albums in 2011, the Hottest 100 of the 2010s in 2020, and the Hottest 100 of &quot;Like a Version&quot; in 2023.

In July 2023, the network launched Triple J Hottest, an online radio station featuring a playlist of tracks from all previous Hottest 100 countdowns. It is the first sister channel to not be available on digital radio, instead only available via streaming (including the website, app, and streaming services such as TuneIn and iHeartRadio).

=== Requestival ===

Broadcast annually from 2020 until 2022, Triple J held Requestival, where they only played listeners&#x27; song requests for five days straight. Significant airtime was given to songs and artists that would never usually be played on the station, including &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot; by Ludwig van Beethoven, &quot;Shake It Off&quot; by Taylor Swift (which was notably banned from the 2014 Hottest 100), &quot;Rasputin&quot; by Boney M., the theme songs to TV programs &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; and &quot;Saddle Club,&quot; the entirety of Julia Gillard&#x27;s misogyny speech, and the Geelong Cats club song, &quot;We Are Geelong&quot;. In 2021, more than 80,000 song requests were submitted by listeners. The event was similar in concept to &quot;Super Request,&quot; a nightly music request show that aired from 1998 to 2001.

=== Impossible Music Festival ===
Broadcast annually from 2005 to 2008 was the Impossible Music Festival, a radio event that consisted of 55 live music recordings played consecutively over one weekend. The lineup of artists each time was decided by listeners, and recordings were derived from festivals, concerts, pub gigs and studio sessions.

== Live events ==

=== One Night Stand===
Beginning in 2004 and happening annually almost every year since, Triple J has hosted One Night Stand, a free, all-ages concert in a different small town. It is up to the audience to nominate their regional towns to host the event, needing to provide examples of local support, including community (signatures), local government (council approval), and a venue for the concert. The most recent One Night Stand was hosted in the coastal town of Warrnambool, Victoria in September 2024.

=== Bars of Steel Live ===
Based on the station&#x27;s &quot;Bars of Steel&quot; web series, the station hosted a free concert in Parramatta in May 2024, featuring hip hop and rap artists from all across Western Sydney. Billed as the inaugural event, the 2024 lineup included Youngn Lipz, A.Girl, Becca Hatch and Unearthed competition winners. Triple J also hosted several songwriting and music production workshops coinciding with the live performances.

===Beat the Drum===
On 16 January 2015, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Triple J, a one-off, seven-hour concert called Beat the Drum was held at the Domain, Sydney. Hosted by Peter Garrett, the list of performers, all of whom are the beneficiaries of the station&#x27;s support, included Hilltop Hoods, the Presets, the Cat Empire, You Am I, Daniel Johns, Joelistics, Ball Park Music, Adalita, Vance Joy, and Gotye. A recording of the event was released on CD and DVD in May 2015, which won the ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album.

=== Tribute concerts ===
In November 2009, Triple J hosted a tribute concert series for Paul Kelly called Before Too Long, which was run over two nights at Melbourne&#x27;s Forum Theatre. In 2011, another live set of shows was presented by the station, this time honouring Nick Cave, in a show called Straight to You. Both events were recorded to produce two commercially successful live albums.

== Impact ==
=== In the Australian music scene ===

Triple J, according to Whiting, &quot;retains substantial influence over Australia’s music market and the capacity for local artists to gain an audience,&quot; and has done since its inception. With a more adventurous music catalogue than that of commercial radio, especially throughout the 1980s, Triple J were responsible for popularising some of Australia&#x27;s most well-known acts, including Midnight Oil, Nick Cave, Silverchair and the John Butler Trio. They have also been given credit for creating local audiences for overseas acts, like Blondie, Devo, Garbage and the B-52s – 2JJ was the first radio station in the world to play the latter&#x27;s debut single &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;. Reflecting on the station&#x27;s 30 year anniversary in 2005, former presenter Steve Cannane said &quot;Plenty of musos, comedians, announcers and journos got their start courtesy of the station.&quot;

Triple J also had a significant effect on record distribution in its early years. Labels would previously only import recordings that they knew would yield good commercial return, leaving them often unwilling to take risks on local releases from unknown acts. For example, Australian distributors initially refused to offer 801&#x27;s 1976 live album &quot;801 Live&quot; in the country, but constant airplay on 2JJ made the record the highest selling import album of the year. Thus, the label decided to release it locally.

Triple J has sponsored Australian live music events since its inception, and has organised its own festivals like Bars of Steel Live and One Night Stand, the latter of which has run in small regional towns since 2004. In 2024, Triple J and Double J supported over 60 festivals and tours of international and domestic artists. They promote such events in their radio programs and commercials and on their social media channels.

In January 2014, Fairfax newspapers published a report questioning if Triple J could be blamed for the homogenisation of Australian music. Reporters interviewed a number of notable musicians who remained anonymous. One respondent talked of a certain &quot;Triple J sound&quot; that artists require to be played on the station. Music director of Triple J Unearthed, Dave Ruby Howe, acknowledged there were some similar sounds on the discovery platform, but said bands purely chasing airplay will get caught out.

Despite declining ratings in their target 18–24-year-old demographic, Triple J continues to have a significant impact on the Australian music landscape. It supports major music festivals and domestic tours, and organises its own events like One Night Stand. Every year, it broadcasts the Hottest 100, a public poll of the years&#x27; most popular music known as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest music democracy&quot;, and runs the J Awards, a music award series. Triple J annually champions Ausmusic Month and founded the nationwide Ausmusic T-Shirt Day initiative in 2013. The network&#x27;s online discovery platform, Unearthed, provides pathways for independent artists to be broadcast on the network. However, Triple J has been criticised for promoting a homogenous national music scene.

=== In radio ===
Triple J&#x27;s programming approach was copied by succeeding commercial stations. Notably, Nova, who had also branded themselves as a competitor youth station, had a &quot;clearly borrowed&quot; catalogue from Triple J, but was slightly more conservative with its song selections.

Former Australian Recording Industry Association staffer Danny Yau said that Triple J&#x27;s nationalisation from the early 1990s created a new role for local community radio stations, particularly Sydney&#x27;s FBi and Melbourne&#x27;s 3RRR, to fill the broadcaster&#x27;s gaps with more niche regional content.

<text>The Wizard of New Zealand (born Ian Brackenbury Channell; 4 December 1932) is a British-born New Zealand educator, comedian, illusionist, and politician. He is also known by his shorter name, The Wizard.

==Life and career==

=== England ===
The Wizard was born Ian Brackenbury Channell on 4 December 1932 in London, England. He was educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk, and from 1945 to 1951 at Bromley Grammar School for Boys, now Ravensbourne School. In 1951, he was called up for national service in the Royal Air Force. Although he initially trained to be a pilot, he was later transferred to navigator training in Canada and was subsequently posted as the adjutant at RAF Duxford. He left the RAF in 1953 and became a sales representative for a paper merchant. In 1956, he married his girlfriend, Monica, and from 1958 spent two years teaching English in Iran. He then returned to England in order to attend the University of Leeds and graduated with a double honours degree in psychology and sociology in 1963. As a student at Leeds, he was a member of the institution&#x27;s &quot;University Challenge&quot; team.

=== Australia ===
Shortly after his graduation in 1963, he was recruited by the University of Western Australia Adult Education Board to run their community arts programme. In 1967, he became a teaching fellow at the newly opened School of Sociology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He was required to study towards a PhD thesis, but was informally promised a lectureship once completed.

During this time he created a direct action reform movement called Alf (Action for Love and Freedom) and implemented what he called &quot;The Fun Revolution&quot;. In 1968, he separated from his wife and his thesis was terminated due to insufficient progress. As his position was dependent on the continuation of his studies, he was consequently dismissed as a teaching fellow. The next year he was appointed as &quot;Wizard&quot; (effectively an events officer) of the University of New South Wales. He would also take on another persona, when elected as dictator of the student union. In late 1969, he was made Wizard by the World University Service of Australia and toured university campuses throughout 1970. He was able to persuade the Melbourne University Union Activities Department to appoint him their unpaid &quot;Cosmologer, Living Work of Art and Shaman&quot; in 1971. The vice-chancellor gave him the use of the Old Pathology Lecture Theatre for his classes in synthetic cosmology and the director of the National Gallery of Victoria accepted the offer of his live body as a living work of art. At this time, shocked when the student pacifist society sent money to the Viet Cong, he founded Alf&#x27;s Imperial Army devoted to sensational but non-violent warfare and regularly organised battles on campus. He founded the Imperial British Conservative Party to provide a counterbalance to international capitalism and the various forms of Nazism.

The Wizard stood unsuccessfully in three Australian federal elections, contesting Sydney in 1969, and Kooyong in 1972 and 1974.

=== New Zealand ===

In 1974, the Wizard migrated to Christchurch in New Zealand and began to speak on a ladder in Cathedral Square. The city council attempted to have him arrested, but he became so popular that they made the square a public speaking area. Wearing his costume as a false prophet of the Church of England, or his wizard&#x27;s pointy hat, he has spoken there at lunchtimes in the summer months.

He confronted Telecom over the colour of public telephone boxes, played for the local rugby team, heckled Christian evangelist Ray Comfort, evaded the compulsory New Zealand census and performed rain dances in Canterbury, Auckland and the Australian outback.

In 1982, the New Zealand Art Gallery directors association issued a statement that in their opinion the Wizard was an authentic living work of art and the city council appointed him &quot;Wizard of Christchurch&quot;. In 1990, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mike Moore, an old friend, appointed him the official &quot;Wizard of New Zealand&quot;.

With the help of the mayor, Vicki Buck, the city of Christchurch hosted a wizards&#x27; conclave in 1995 when visiting colleagues gathered to help build a wizard&#x27;s nest on top of the university library tower, to witness the Wizard hatching from a giant egg in the city art gallery, sky diving whilst chanting a spell for a major rugby match and performing various rituals round the city. Soon afterwards, accompanied by 49 assistant wizards, he came down by gondola from the Port Hills with tablets bearing the address of his new website.

He initially provided his services free. In 1998, the Christchurch City Council signed a contract with him to &quot;provide acts of wizardry and other wizard-like-services – as part of promotional work for the city of Christchurch&quot; for an annual fee of $16,000. The Wizard also received financial support from his partner, Alice Flett.

On 8 September 2003, the Wizard&#x27;s large wooden house was destroyed by a fire, which Christchurch police treated as arson. The &quot;Wizardmobile&quot;, constructed from the front halves of two VW Beetles, was also attacked and damaged.

The Wizard was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Service Medal in the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for service to the community.

After the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the Wizard planned to retire and permanently leave Christchurch, saying that the town he loved had gone and that it was the end of an era. After it was announced by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and the Anglican bishop that the remains of Christchurch Cathedral would be demolished, the Wizard returned to Christchurch to oppose the demolition. The Wizard continues to speak on the need to preserve Christchurch&#x27;s heritage buildings.

Since 2014, Ari Freeman has been the Wizard&#x27;s apprentice.

In October 2021, the Christchurch City Council ended its contract with the Wizard after two decades of service. The Wizard said he was disappointed but will continue to appear in the city.

The Wizard stood as a candidate in the 2022 Christchurch mayoral election, receiving 2,474 votes and coming in fifth place.

==Public speaking==
The Wizard performed in Cathedral Square on weekdays from 1–2pm from November to Easter. He now spends a significant amount of his time in Oamaru, a place known as a centre for arts and craftsmanship.

==Autobiography==
In 1998, an autobiography titled &quot;My Life as a Miracle&quot; was published.

==Cartography==
The Wizard produced an upside-down map using the Hobo–Dyer projection which placed New Zealand and Australia top-centre.

==Documentaries==
&quot;The Wizard of New Zealand QSM&quot;, directed by Grant John Neville and director of photography Karlos Filipov includes interviews with the Wizard, Mike Moore and many others. Among other topics, the documentary details the Wizard&#x27;s views that women cause wars through their shopping habits and that governments with monarchies are more stable. It was awarded Best Short Documentary at the Beijing International Film Festival 2010, and Best Film about Real People at the Official Best of Fest 2010.

&quot;The Wizard and the Commodore – Chathams Islands/New Zealand&quot;, directed by Samuel A. Miller, follows the subject on a trip to the Chatham Islands, about 900 km east of mainland New Zealand. The film premiered on 1 July 2016 in New Zealand.

<text>The Magnificent Seven is a 1960 American Western film directed by John Sturges. The screenplay, credited to William Roberts, is a remake – in an Old West-style – of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1954 Japanese film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (itself initially released in the United States as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;). The ensemble cast includes Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, James Coburn, and Horst Buchholz as a group of seven gunfighters hired to protect a small village in Mexico from a group of marauding bandits led by Eli Wallach.

The film was released by United Artists on October 12, 1960, becoming both a critical and commercial success and has been appraised as one of the greatest films of the Western genre. It spawned three sequels, a television series that aired from 1998 to 2000, and a 2016 film remake. Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s film score was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and is listed on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the top 25 American film scores.

In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
A gang of bandits led by Calvera periodically raids a poor Mexican village for food and supplies. After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide to fight back. 

They send three villagers carrying their few objects of value to try and barter for weapons.
In a town just inside the United States, the villagers find approach gunslinger Chris Adams. Chris advises that they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as &quot;men are cheaper than guns.&quot; 

At first agreeing only to help them recruit, Chris eventually leads the group.
Despite the meager pay, Chris finds five willing gunmen. They include Vin Tanner, a gunfighter gone broke from gambling; Chris&#x27; friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo O&#x27;Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and so haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris allows him into the group.

Arriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them in combat. They note the lack of young women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, they share it with the village children.

Three of Calvera&#x27;s men are dispatched to reconnoiter the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill eleven gang members and run the rest out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. However, Chico infiltrates Calvera&#x27;s camp and learns that Calvera will return, as his men are short on food. Some villagers fear reprisals and call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay.

The seven ride out for a pre-emptive raid on Calvera&#x27;s camp but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are captured by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven&#x27;s lives, part believing they have been disillusioned by the betrayal, and part fearing reprisals from their friends across the border.

Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.

The gang escorts the seven gunmen from the village and returns their weapons. The seven debate their next move. All agree to return and fight, except Harry, who believes the effort is futile and suicidal.

The gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris&#x27;s life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about hidden gold to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after killing many bandits and exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who demands to know why he came back for the village. The remaining bandits flee.

After Chico decides to stay with Petra, Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder. The elder tells them that only the villagers have won, whereas the gunslingers are &quot;like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.&quot; As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits the elder was right.

==Production==
===Development===
Lou Morheim acquired rights to remake the film in the US for $2,500. He later signed a deal with Yul Brynner&#x27;s production company, who bought the rights from Morheim for $10,000 up front plus $1,000 a week as a producer and 5% of the net profits. Anthony Quinn was lined up to star with Brynner as director but later Martin Ritt was appointed as director with Brynner starring.

Brynner approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of remaking Kurosawa&#x27;s famous samurai film. However, once Mirisch had acquired the rights and finalized a deal with United Artists, Brynner was sued for breach of contract by Quinn, who claimed that he and Brynner had developed the concept together and had worked out many of the film&#x27;s details before the two had a falling-out. Quinn ultimately lost his claim because there was nothing in writing.

The film&#x27;s title comes from the initial American localized title of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, which was initially released under the title &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; in the United States in 1955.

===Writing===
Script credit was a subject of contention. Associate producer Morheim commissioned Walter Bernstein, a blacklisted scriptwriter, to produce the first draft &quot;faithfully&quot; adapted from the original script written by Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni and Akira Kurosawa; when Mirisch and Brynner took over the production, they brought on Walter Newman, whose version &quot;is largely what&#x27;s onscreen.&quot; When Newman was unavailable to be onsite during the film&#x27;s principal photography in Mexico, William Roberts was hired, in part to make changes required by Mexican censors. When Roberts asked the Writers Guild of America for a co-credit, Newman asked that his name be removed from the credits.

===Casting===
Sturges was eager to cast Steve McQueen in the picture, having just worked with him on the 1959 film &quot;Never So Few&quot;, but McQueen could not get a release from actor/producer Dick Powell, who controlled McQueen&#x27;s hit TV series &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;. On the advice of his agent, McQueen, an experienced race car driver, staged a car accident and claimed that he could not work on his series because he had suffered a whiplash injury and had to wear a neck brace. During the interval required for his &quot;recuperation&quot;, he was free to appear in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. James Coburn was a great fan of the Japanese film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, having seen it 15 times, and was hired through the help of co-star and former classmate Robert Vaughn, after the role of the expert knifethrower had been rejected by actors Sterling Hayden and John Ireland.

===Filming===
The film was shot by cinematographer Charles Lang in a 35 mm anamorphic format using Panavision lenses. Location shooting began on March 1, 1960, in Mexico, where both the village and the U.S. border town were built for the film. The location filming was in Cuernavaca, Durango, and Tepoztlán and at the Churubusco Studios. The first scenes were the first part of the six gunfighters&#x27; journey to the Mexican village prior to Chico being brought into the group.

During filming there was considerable tension between Brynner and McQueen, who was displeased at his character having only seven lines of dialogue in the original shooting script. (Sturges had told McQueen that he would &quot;give him the camera&quot;.) To compensate, McQueen took numerous opportunities to upstage Brynner and draw attention to himself, including shielding his eyes with his hat, flipping a coin during one of Brynner&#x27;s speeches, and rattling his shotgun shells. Brynner would often build up a little mound of earth to make himself look as tall as McQueen, only to have McQueen kick the dirt out of place when he passed by. When newspapers started reporting about a rivalry, Brynner issued a press statement saying, &quot;I never feud with actors. I feud with studios.&quot;

In an interview Eli Wallach recalled his own interaction with fellow players: &quot;Bronson was a loner. He kept to himself. I liked Robert Vaughn and James Coburn very much. Vaughn is a very intelligent guy. He wrote a book on blacklisting. Coburn was one of those quiet types which fit his character very well: silent but a knife thrower of great skill.&quot;

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

The film&#x27;s score is by Elmer Bernstein, with orchestrations by Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes. Along with the readily recognized main theme and effective support of the story line, the score also contains allusions to twentieth-century symphonic works, such as the reference to Bartok&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra, second movement, in the tense quiet scene just before the shootout. The original soundtrack was not released at the time until reused and rerecorded by Bernstein for the soundtrack of &quot;Return of the Seven&quot;. Electric guitar cover versions by Al Caiola in the U.S. and John Barry in the U.K. were successful on the popular charts. A vocal theme not written by Bernstein was used in a trailer.

In 1994, James Sedares conducted a re-recording of the score performed by The Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, which also included a suite from Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot;, issued by Koch Records; Bernstein himself conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra for a performance released by RCA in 1997, but the original film soundtrack was not released until the following year by Rykodisc. (Varèse Sarabande issued this album in 1996, and reissued it in 2004.)

At the 33rd Academy Awards, the score was nominated for Best Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, losing to Ernest Gold&#x27;s score for &quot;Exodus&quot;. In 2005, the score for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; was listed at 8 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the top 25 American film scores.

===In other media===
Bernstein&#x27;s score has frequently been quoted in the media and popular culture. Starting in 1963, the theme was used in commercials in the U.S. for Marlboro cigarettes for many years. A similar-sounding (but different) tune was used for Victoria Bitter beer in Australia, as was a similar-sounding (but different) tune for the introduction to the National Geographic television show. The theme was included in a scene of the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

Other uses include in the 2004 documentary film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;; in the 2005 film &quot;The Ringer&quot;; in the 2015 film &quot;Hardcore Henry&quot;; as entrance music for the British band James, as well as episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; that had a &quot;Western&quot; theme (mainly in the episode titled &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Ranch?&quot;). The opening horn riff in Arthur Conley&#x27;s 1967 hit &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot; is borrowed from the theme. Canadian band Kon Kan use the opening bars of the theme in their single &quot;I Beg Your Pardon&quot;. Celtic Football Club (Glasgow, Scotland) used the theme music whenever Henrik Larsson scored a goal. The 2008 J-pop song &quot;Ōgoe Diamond&quot; by AKB48 also used part of the main theme.

The &quot;Cheers&quot; episode &quot;Diane Chambers Day&quot; (season 4, episode 22) revolves around the bar denizens being invited to watch &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and ends with them singing an a cappella version of the theme.

The Mick Jones 1980s band Big Audio Dynamite covered the song as &quot;Keep off the Grass&quot; (although this cover was not officially released). In 1995, the KLF also did a drum and bass cover of the main title as &quot;The Magnificent&quot;; it was released under the group alias One World Orchestra on the charity compilation &quot;The Help Album&quot;.

In 1992, the main theme of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; came into use on a section of the Disneyland Railroad at Disneyland Paris. Portions of the theme play as the train exits the Grand Canyon diorama tunnel behind Phantom Manor, enters Frontierland, and travels along the bank of the Rivers of the Far West.

The &quot;Main Title&quot; was used as an intro tune on many nights of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour. The theme was played as the E Street Band entered the stage, adding to the dramatic atmosphere in the stadium.

==Theatrical release==
The film opened on October 12, 1960, in a thousand theaters across the South and Southwest of the United States.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, the film earned in theatrical rentals and was a box office disappointment, but proved to be such a smash hit in Europe that it ultimately made a profit. The overseas rental was almost three times as much as in the U.S. with a total of $7.5 million, giving it worldwide rentals of $9.75 million.

In Western Europe, the film sold tickets in Italy, 7,037,826 tickets in France, and 7.7million tickets in the United Kingdom, becoming one of the top 100 highest-grossing films in the United Kingdom and in France. It was also successful in Germany. In the Soviet Union (where Brynner was originally from), the film sold 67million tickets, becoming the highest-grossing Hollywood film ever in the Soviet Union (where it was among only a handful of Hollywood films to become blockbusters there). In South Korea, it sold 80,870 tickets in Seoul City, and it was also successful in Japan. This adds up to a total of at least 89,118,696 tickets sold in overseas territories.

===Critical response===
Contemporary reviews were mixed to positive. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;pallid, pretentious and overlong reflection of the Japanese original&quot;; according to Thompson, &quot;don&#x27;t expect anything like the ice-cold suspense, the superb juxtaposition of revealing human vignettes and especially the pile-driver tempo of the first &quot;Seven&quot;.&quot; According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; is a rip-roaring rootin&#x27; tootin&#x27; western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon. The last third is downhill, a long and cluttered anti-climax in which &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; grow slightly too magnificent for comfort.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;rough, tough, funny and splashy most of the way. There&#x27;s a serious dip the final third, but Keith&#x27;s newcomer offers shrewd, vastly enjoyable performances.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; praised the film as &quot;A superb Western, well acted and crammed full of action, human interest, pathos, suspense, plus some romance and humor.&quot;

A positive review from Charles Stinson in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the dialogue as &quot;by turns, virile, rowdily funny and then, abruptly, not always predictably, it is pensive, even gentle. John Sturges&#x27; direction is superbly staccato; making a knife-sharp use of pauses and silences, it brings out both the humor and melancholy, the humanity as well as the evil inherent in the situation.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called the casting of Yul Brynner and Horst Buchholz &quot;curious&quot; and thought Chico&#x27;s decision to stay put was &quot;the film&#x27;s most completely unbelievable contrivance,&quot; but still thought that &quot;the film manages to be both impressive and likeable.&quot;

Akira Kurosawa was reportedly so impressed by the film that he presented John Sturges with a sword, but said: &quot;The American copy is a disappointment. Although entertaining, it is not a version of Seven Samurai.&quot;

The film has grown greatly in esteem since its release, partly as several of its cast went on to become superstars, and its music score, but also due to the quality of the script. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval score of 89% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; transplants &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; into the Old West with a terrific cast of Hollywood stars—and without losing any of the story&#x27;s thematic richness.&quot; It is the second most shown film in U.S. television history, behind only &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The film is also ranked 79 on the AFI&#x27;s list of American cinema&#x27;s 100 most-thrilling films.

==Other media==
===Sequels===

Three sequels were eventually made: &quot;Return of the Seven&quot; (1966), &quot;Guns of the Magnificent Seven&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Magnificent Seven Ride!&quot; (1972). Yul Brynner returned as Chris Adams for &quot;Return of the Seven&quot;, but was replaced in the sequels by George Kennedy and Lee Van Cleef. He was the only member of the cast to return for any of the sequels. None were as successful as the original film.

===Television series===

The film also inspired a television series, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, which ran from 1998 to 2000. Robert Vaughn was a recurring guest star, a judge who hires the seven to protect the town in which his widowed daughter-in-law and his grandson live.

===Music===
In 1981, The Clash released a song, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, the third single from their fourth album, &quot;Sandinista!&quot;, which references the title of the 1960 film.

===Unofficial remake===

The 1980 science fiction film &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; was a remake of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; set in space. A group of mercenaries, including ones played by George Peppard (as a character known only as &quot;Space Cowboy&quot;) and Robert Vaughn (playing essentially the same character as in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;) defend farmers from space raiders on the planet Akir, home of the Akira (named after &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; director Akira Kurosawa).

===In popular culture===
* The 1980s action-adventure series &quot;The A-Team&quot; was initially devised as a combination of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. The show&#x27;s pilot film plays much on the plot of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, and there are similar plot echoes in various other episodes.
* Also in the 1980s, the British Television Series, &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, specifically the second series, heavily references the film. The first two episodes are called, &quot;The Return of the Seven (Parts 1 and 2)&quot; and the cast have a discussion during a stop on a motorway service area, each choosing an actor from the film that they feel best represents them. The soundtrack also references the main theme.
* Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2022 semi-autobiographical film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; utilizes selections from Bernstein&#x27;s score as source music played on a record player to underscore the protagonist Sammy Fabelman&#x27;s 8 mm short film &quot;Gunsmog&quot; (a rip-off of &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962)) as it is screened for his peers and Boy Scout troop at an assembly.

===Remake===

&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, a remake of the film with the same title, was released in 2016, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starred Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Lee Byung-hun, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier and Peter Sarsgaard.

On April 14, 2023, it was announced that MGM is rebooting many of its film franchises, including a TV adaptation of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

<text>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (, literally &quot;The good, the ugly, the bad&quot;) is a 1966 Italian epic spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood as &quot;the Good&quot;, Lee Van Cleef as &quot;the Bad&quot;, and Eli Wallach as &quot;the Ugly&quot;. Its screenplay was written by Age &amp; Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Leone (with additional screenplay material and dialogue provided by an uncredited Sergio Donati), based on a story by Vincenzoni and Leone. Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli was responsible for the film&#x27;s sweeping widescreen cinematography, and Ennio Morricone composed the film&#x27;s score. It was an Italian-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany, and the United States. Most of the filming took place in Spain.

The film is known for Leone&#x27;s use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of violence, tension, and highly stylised gunfights. The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find a fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amid the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the Battle of Glorieta Pass of the New Mexico Campaign in 1862) while participating in many battles, confrontations, and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Eastwood, and the second of those with Van Cleef.

&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was marketed as the third and final installment in the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, following &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964) and &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965). The film was a financial success, grossing over $38 million at the worldwide box office, and is credited with having catapulted Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years, and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential westerns of all time.

== Plot ==

In 1862, in the American Southwest during the American Civil War, three bounty-hunters ambush Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez, who shoots them and escapes.

Elsewhere, mercenary &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens for the alias of Jackson, a soldier who stole a cache of Confederate gold. Stevens gives the name &quot;Bill Carson&quot;, offers Angel Eyes a bribe and then draws his pistol. Angel Eyes kills him and, intrigued about the gold, kills his own employer.

Tuco is rescued from more bounty-hunters by an unnamed drifter whom he nicknames &quot;Blondie&quot;. Blondie delivers Tuco to a sheriff and collects his $2,000 () bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs the noose by shooting it and sets him free. The two escape and split the bounty. They repeat the process in other towns until Blondie grows weary of Tuco&#x27;s complaints and leaves him stranded in the desert.

Bent on revenge, and after one failed attempt with his gang, Tuco catches up with Blondie and force-marches him across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. A runaway ambulance arrives with several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who asks Tuco for help, offering $200,000 in gold (), buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died. However, before dying, he reveals the name on the grave to Blondie. The two reluctantly set aside their grudge and work together, since Tuco only knows the name of the cemetery while Blondie knows which grave to dig.

Posing as a Confederate soldier, Tuco takes Blondie to a nearby mission to recover. There, Tuco reunites with his brother, Pablo, who left his family to become a priest when Tuco was a child. Their meeting does not go well and Tuco angrily leaves with Blondie.

On the way, Tuco yells pro-Confederate statements to approaching soldiers who turn out to be a Union patrol. The two are taken to a prison camp that Angel Eyes has infiltrated as a Union sergeant in his search for Bill Carson. Having posed as Carson, Tuco is taken away for questioning. Under torture, he reveals the name of the cemetery and is sent away to be hanged. Knowing Blondie would not reveal the name on the grave, Angel Eyes recruits him into his search. Tuco escapes hanging by killing a henchman working for Angel Eyes, then goes to an evacuated town where Blondie, Angel Eyes and his gang have arrived.

Blondie finds Tuco and together they kill the gang, but Angel Eyes escapes. En route to the cemetery, the duo find themselves in a skirmish over a strategic bridge. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the armies and clear their path. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they exchange their secrets in case either is killed. Tuco reveals the cemetery name, and Blondie says &quot;Arch Stanton&quot; is the name on the grave.

After the bridge is demolished, Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. Blondie catches up to him as he digs up the grave, and Angel Eyes arrives soon after. When no gold is found in the grave, Blondie admits lying about the name. He then places a rock in the middle of the cemetery&#x27;s pavement on which he says the true name is written. The other two men accept his challenge and back away with pistols ready.

The men stand around the pavement in a Mexican standoff waiting for one of them to draw. Angel Eyes draws first and Blondie kills him as Tuco discovers that his gun isn&#x27;t loaded. Blondie reveals that he unloaded it the night before, and the gold is in the grave marked &quot;Unknown&quot; beside Stanton&#x27;s.

Tuco digs up the grave and finds large bags of gold. However, Blondie orders him at gunpoint into a hangman&#x27;s noose beneath a tree. With his hands bound, Tuco is forced to stand atop an unsteady grave marker while Blondie takes half of the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco face-first onto the remaining gold. Tuco furiously curses Blondie, who disappears over the hills.

== Cast ==
=== The trio ===
*Clint Eastwood as &#x27;Blondie&#x27; (the Man with No Name): The Good, a taciturn, confident bounty-hunter who to find buried gold teams up with Tuco and Angel Eyes temporarily. Blondie and Tuco have an ambivalent partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. Despite this greedy quest, Blondie&#x27;s pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the war is evident. &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen so many men wasted so badly,&quot; he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. &quot;Rawhide&quot; had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point, neither &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; nor &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had, but Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife travelled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000 and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets—a deal with which Leone was not happy. In the original Italian script for the film, he is named &quot;Joe&quot; (his nickname in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;), but is referred to as Blondie in the Italian and English dialogue.
*Eli Wallach as Tuco Benedicto Pacífico Juan María Ramírez (known as &quot;The Rat&quot; according to Blondie): The Ugly, a fast-talking, comically oafish yet also cunning, cagey, resilient, and resourceful Mexican bandit who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. The director originally considered Gian Maria Volonté (who portrayed the villains in both the preceding films) for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with &quot;natural comic talent&quot;. In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), in particular, his performance in &quot;The Railroads&quot; scene. In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was sceptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, Wallach said: &quot;When do you want me?&quot; The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humour. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realised that the character of Tuco was close to Leone&#x27;s heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, &quot;Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint and Lee&#x27;s characters remain mysteries.&quot; In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to &quot;The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]&quot;.
*Lee Van Cleef as &#x27;Angel Eyes&#x27;: The Bad, a ruthless, confident, borderline-sadistic mercenary who takes pleasure in killing and always finishes a job for which he is paid, usually tracking and assassination. Originally, Leone wanted Enrico Maria Salerno (who had dubbed Eastwood&#x27;s voice for the Italian versions of the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; films) or Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: &quot;I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in &quot;For a Few Dollars More.&quot; The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me.&quot; In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named &quot;Banjo&quot;, but is referred to as &quot;Sentenza&quot; (meaning &quot;Sentence&quot; or &quot;Judgement&quot;) in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.

=== Supporting cast ===
== Production ==
=== Pre-production ===
After the success of &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;, executives at United Artists approached the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to the film and the next one. Producer Alberto Grimaldi, Sergio Leone and he had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about &quot;a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War&quot;. The studio agreed but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni&#x27;s idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 upfront and 50% of the box-office takings outside of Italy. The total budget was eventually $1.2 million.

Leone built upon the screenwriter&#x27;s original concept to &quot;show the absurdity of war ... the Civil War, which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a &#x27;good cause&#x27;.&quot; An avid history buff, Leone said, &quot;I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as Andersonville. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.&quot; The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.

While Leone developed Vincenzoni&#x27;s idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t use a single thing they&#x27;d written. It was the grossest deception of my life.&quot; Donati agreed, saying, &quot;There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line.&quot; Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in eleven days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, &quot;[&quot;Sentenza&quot;] has no spirit, he&#x27;s a professional in the banalest sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn&#x27;t the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I&#x27;d be nearer &quot;il Biondo&quot; (Blondie), but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the &quot;Tuco&quot; side ... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity.&quot; Film director Alex Cox suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the anti-Communist Gladio organisation, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.

Eastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike in the first two films, from which he received a straight fee. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another &quot;Dollars&quot; film, he joked, &quot;the only reason they brought me back was that they forgot to kill me off in &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;&quot;.

The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;I due magnifici straccioni&quot; (&quot;The Two Magnificent Tramps&quot;). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up &quot;Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo&quot; (&quot;The Good, the Ugly, the Bad&quot;), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, &quot;River of Dollars&quot;, or &quot;The Man With No Name&quot;, but decided on &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Production began at the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain&#x27;s plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the Southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south of Spain. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp, and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones and wooden crosses to resemble an ancient Roman circus. The scene where the bridge was blown up had to be filmed twice because all three cameras were destroyed in the first take by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, &quot;They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and Spain. Then they&#x27;d scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you&#x27;re doing a Western that&#x27;s supposed to be laid in Southwest America or Mexico, they couldn&#x27;t care less what your story or subject is.&quot; Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like &quot;the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs&quot;, and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close-ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.

Eastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. &quot;In the first film, I was alone,&quot; he told Leone. &quot;In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.&quot; As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another Ferrari and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), he was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the William Morris Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh&#x27;s influence on the actor. Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells. For some time after, Eastwood&#x27;s publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam. Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialised with actor Franco Nero, who was filming &quot;Texas, Adios&quot; at the time.

Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid together, and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach&#x27;s neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach&#x27;s life was threatened was during the scene where Mario Brega and he—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach&#x27;s life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) soldier. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.

The bridge in the film was constructed twice by sappers of the Spanish army and rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. On the first occasion, an Italian camera operator signalled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning &quot;start&quot;. Nobody was injured in the resulting explosion. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy functional structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it. Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by Buster Keaton&#x27;s silent film &quot;The General&quot;.

As an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach spoke English and were dubbed into Italian for their debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English. The result is noticeable in the bad synchronisation of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with synchronised sound. Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play Morricone&#x27;s music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, recording the sound cleanly would have been difficult in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in postproduction.

By the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone&#x27;s perfectionist directorial traits. Leone insisted, often forcefully, on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which often exhausted the actors. Leone, who was obese, prompted amusement through his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him &quot;Yosemite Sam&quot; for his bad temper. After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role of Harmonica in &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to Charles Bronson. Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; when he described Eastwood&#x27;s abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of Robert De Niro, saying, &quot;Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same—a block of marble. Bobby, first of all, is an actor, and Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers and Clint yawns.&quot; Eastwood later gave a friend the poncho he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in Carmel, California.

=== Cinematography ===
In its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching for a holstered gun. Leone also incorporated music to heighten the tension and pressure before and during the film&#x27;s many gunfights.

In filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film&#x27;s iconic Mexican stand-off. This style can also be seen in one of the film&#x27;s protagonists, Blondie (The Man with No Name), who is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words. All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes, killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed trick shooting, such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person&#x27;s head and severing a hangman&#x27;s noose with a well-placed shot, in many of the film&#x27;s noted shootouts.

== Themes ==
Like many of his films, director Sergio Leone noted that the film is a satire of the western genre. He has noted the film&#x27;s theme of emphasis on violence and the deconstruction of Old West romanticism. The emphasis on violence is seen in how the three leads (Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco) are introduced to various acts of violence. With Blondie, it is seen in his attempt to free Tuco which results in a gun battle. Angel Eyes is set up in a scene in which he learns about hidden treasure from Stevens, kills Stevens when he draws on him, then his employer Baker (fulfilling his title as &#x27;The Bad&#x27;). Tuco is set up in a scene in which three bounty-hunters try to kill him. In the film&#x27;s opening scene, three bounty-hunters enter a building in which Tuco is hiding. After the sound of gunfire is heard, Tuco escapes through a window after shooting the three, one of whom survives (fulfilling his title as &#x27;The Ugly&#x27;). They are all after gold and will stop at nothing until they get it. The film deconstructs Old West Romanticism by portraying the characters as antiheroes. Even the character considered by the film as &#x27;The Good&#x27; can still be considered as not living up to that title in a moral sense. Critic Drew Marton describes it as a &quot;baroque manipulation&quot; that criticises the American Ideology of the Western, by replacing the heroic cowboy popularised by John Wayne with morally complex antiheroes.

Negative themes such as cruelty and greed are also given focus and are traits shared by the three leads in the story. Cruelty is shown in the character of Blondie in how he treats Tuco throughout the film. He is seen to sometimes be friendly with him and in other scenes double-cross him and throw him to the side. It is shown in Angel Eyes through his attitudes in the film and his tendency for committing violent acts throughout the film. For example, when he kills Stevens he also kills his son. It is also seen when he is violently torturing Tuco later in the film. It is shown in Tuco how he shows concern for Blondie when he is heavily dehydrated but in truth, he is only keeping him alive to find the gold. It is also shown in his conversation with his brother which reveals that a life of cruelty is all he knows. Richard Aquila writes &quot;The violent antiheroes of Italian westerns also fit into a folk tradition in southern Italy that honored mafioso and vigilante who used any means to combat corrupt government or church officials who threatened the peasants of the Mezzogiorno&quot;.

Greed is shown in the film through its main core plotline of the three characters wanting to find the $200,000 () that Bill Carson has said is buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. The main plot concerns their greed as there is a series of double crossings and changing allegiances to get the gold. Russ Hunter writes that the film will &quot;stress the formation of homosocial relationships as being functional only in the pursuit of wealth&quot;. This all culminates in the film&#x27;s final set-piece which takes place in the cemetery. After the death of Angel Eyes, Tuco is strung up with a rope precariously placed around his neck as Blondie leaves with his share of the money.

Many critics have also noticed the film&#x27;s anti-war theme. Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. This is seen in the film&#x27;s rugged and rough aesthetic. The film has an air of dirtiness that can be attributed to the Civil War and in turn, it affects the actions of people, showing how the war deep down has affected the lives of many people. A scene in the extended version presents Angel Eyes arriving in an embattled Confederate outpost. Angel Eyes shows compassion towards the agonising soldiers, pointing out that even &#x27;The Bad&#x27; is shocked by the horrors of the war.

Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to &quot;The Great War&quot;, a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age &amp; Scarpelli had contributed to). An example of this is how Tuco and Blondie blow up a bridge to disperse two sides of the battle. They need to clear a way to the cemetery and succeed in doing so. It is also seen in how Angel Eyes disguises himself as a union sergeant so he can attack and torture Tuco to get the information he needs, intertwining himself in the battle in the process.

== Music ==

The score is composed by frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone. &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; broke previous conventions on how the two had previously collaborated. Instead of scoring the film in the post-production stage, they decided to work on the themes together before shooting had started, this was so that the music helped inspire the film instead of the film inspiring the music. Leone even played the music on set and coordinated camera movements to match the music.

The vocals of Italian singer Edda Dell&#x27;Orso can be heard in the composition &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;. Guitarist Bruno Battisti D&#x27;Amario can be heard in the compositions &#x27;The Sundown&#x27; and &#x27;Padre Ramirez&#x27;. Trumpet players Michele Lacerenza and Francesco Catania can be heard on &#x27;The Trio&#x27;.

The only song to have a lyric is &#x27;The Story of a Soldier&#x27;, the words of which were written by Tommie Connor.

Morricone uses several unusual instruments, such as gunfire, whistling (by Alessandro Alessandroni), and yodelling.

The main theme, resembling the howling of a coyote (which blends in with an actual coyote howl in the first shot after the opening credits), is a two-pitch melody that is a frequent motif, and is used for the three main characters. A different instrument was used for each: flute for Blondie, ocarina for Angel Eyes, and human voices for Tuco.

The score complements the film&#x27;s American Civil War setting, containing the ballad, &quot;The Story of a Soldier&quot;, which is sung by prisoners as Tuco is being tortured by Angel Eyes. The film&#x27;s climax, a three-way Mexican stand-off, begins with the melody of &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; and is followed by &quot;The Trio&quot; (which contains a musical allusion to Morricone&#x27;s previous work on &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;).

The main theme, also titled &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, was a hit in 1968 with the soundtrack album on the charts for more than a year, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop album chart and No. 10 on the black album chart. The main theme was also a hit for Hugo Montenegro, whose rendition was a No. 2 &quot;Billboard&quot; pop single in 1968.

=== In popular culture ===
The soundtrack has been heavily referenced since the release of the film, especially two songs.

American heavy metal band Metallica has run &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; as prelude music at their concerts since 1985 (except 1996–1998), and in 2007 recorded a version of the instrumental for a compilation tribute to Morricone. Other bands such as the Ramones have featured the song in their albums and live shows. The song has also been sampled within the genre of Hip Hop, most notably by rappers such as Immortal Technique and Jay-Z. &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot; has also been used ceremoniously by the Los Angeles Football Club to open home games. XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Opie &amp; Anthony Show&quot; also opens every show with &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;.

Punk rock band the Ramones played the main theme as the opening for their live album &quot;Loco Live&quot; as well as in concerts until their disbandment in 1996. The British heavy metal band Motörhead played the main theme as the overture music on the 1981 &quot;No sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; tour. The American punk rock band The Vandals&#x27; song &quot;Urban Struggle&quot; begins with the main theme. British electronica act Bomb the Bass used the main theme as one of several samples on their 1988 single &quot;Beat Dis&quot;, and used sections of dialogue from Tuco&#x27;s hanging on &quot;Throughout The Entire World&quot;, the opening track from their 1991 album &quot;Unknown Territory&quot;. This dialogue along with some of the &quot;mule&quot; dialogue from Fistful of Dollars was also sampled by Big Audio Dynamite on their 1986 single Medicine Show. The main theme was also sampled/re-created by British band New Order for the album version of their 1993 single &quot;Ruined in a Day&quot;. A song from the band Gorillaz is named &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, and features references to the actor, along with a repeated sample of the theme song; the iconic yell featured in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;&#x27;s score is heard at the beginning of the music video.

American new wave group Wall of Voodoo performed a medley of Ennio Morricone&#x27;s movie themes, including the theme for this movie. The only known recording of it is a live performance on &quot;The Index Masters&quot;.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was released in Italy on 23 December 1966.

In the United States, all three of Leone&#x27;s Dollars Trilogy films were released during 1967: &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; was released 18 January; &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; was released 10 May; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was released 29 December. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.

=== Home media ===
On 28 January 1998, the film was released on DVD by MGM Home Video. Its release from MGM contained 14 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film&#x27;s North American release, including a scene which explains how Angel Eyes came to be waiting for Blondie and Tuco at the Union prison camp.

In 2002, the film was restored with the 14 minutes of scenes cut for US release re-inserted into the film. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach were brought back in to dub their characters&#x27; lines more than 35 years after the film&#x27;s original release. Voice actor Simon Prescott substituted for Lee Van Cleef who had died in 1989. Other voice actors filled in for actors who had since died. In 2004, MGM released this version in a two-disc special edition DVD.

Disc 1 contains an audio commentary with writer and critic Richard Schickel. Disc 2 contains two documentaries, &quot;Leone&#x27;s West&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Lost The Civil War&quot;, followed by the featurette &quot;Restoring &#x27;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&#x27;&quot;; an animated gallery of missing sequences titled &quot;The Socorro Sequence: A Reconstruction&quot;; an extended Tuco torture scene; a featurette called &quot;Il Maestro&quot;; an audio featurette named &quot;Il Maestro, Part 2&quot;; a French trailer; and a poster gallery.

This DVD was generally well received, though some purists complained about the re-mixed stereo soundtrack with many completely new sound effects (notably, the gunshots were replaced), with no option for the original soundtrack. At least one scene that was re-inserted had been cut by Leone before the film&#x27;s release in Italy but had been shown once at the Italian premiere. According to Richard Schickel, Leone willingly cut the scene for pacing reasons; thus, restoring it was contrary to the director&#x27;s wishes. MGM re-released the 2004 DVD edition in their &quot;Sergio Leone Anthology&quot; box set in 2007. Also included were the two other &quot;Dollars&quot; films, and &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;. On 12 May 2009, the extended version of the film was released on Blu-ray. It contains the same special features as the 2004 special edition DVD, except that it includes an added commentary by film historian Sir Christopher Frayling.

The film was re-released on Blu-ray in 2014 using a new 4K remaster, featuring improved picture quality and detail but a change of colour timing, resulting in the film having a more yellow hue than on previous releases. It was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Kino Lorber Studio Classics on 15 August 2017, in a new 50th Anniversary release that featured both theatrical and extended cuts, as well as new bonus features, and an attempt to correct the yellow colour timing from the earlier disc. On 27 April 2021, Kino released an Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the theatrical cut, using the same scan from the 2014 remaster, but with extensive colour correction.

==== Deleted scenes ====
The following scenes were originally deleted by distributors from the British and American theatrical versions of the film but were restored after the release of the 2004 Special Edition DVD.
*During his search for Bill Carson, Angel Eyes stumbles upon an embattled Confederate outpost after a massive artillery bombardment. Once there, after witnessing the wretched conditions of the survivors, he bribes a Confederate soldier (Víctor Israel, dubbed by Tom Wyner) for clues about Bill Carson.
*After being betrayed by Blondie, surviving the desert on his way to civilisation, and assembling a good revolver from the parts of worn-out guns being sold at a general store, Tuco meets with members of his gang in a distant cave, where he conspires with them to hunt and kill Blondie.
*The sequence with Tuco and Blondie crossing the desert has been extended: Tuco mentally tortures a severely dehydrated Blondie by eating and bathing in front of him.
*Tuco, transporting a dehydrated Blondie, finds a Confederate camp whose occupants tell him that Father Ramirez&#x27;s monastery is nearby.
*Tuco and Blondie discuss their plans when departing in a wagon from Father Ramirez&#x27;s monastery.
*A scene where Blondie and Angel Eyes are resting by a creek when a man appears and Blondie shoots him. Angel Eyes asks the rest of his men to come out of hiding. When the five men come out, Blondie counts them (including Angel Eyes), and concludes that six is the perfect number, implying one for each bullet in his gun.
*The sequence with Tuco, Blondie, and Captain Clinton has been extended: Clinton asks for their names, which they are reluctant to give.

The footage below is all featured within supplementary features of the 2004 DVD release
* Additional footage of the sequence where Tuco is tortured by Angel Eyes&#x27;s henchman was discovered. The original negative of this footage was deemed too badly damaged to be used in the theatrical cut.
* Lost footage of the missing Socorro Sequence where Tuco continues his search for Blondie in a Texican pueblo while Blondie is in a hotel room with a Mexican woman (Silvana Bacci) is reconstructed with photos and unfinished snippets from the French trailer. Also, in the documentary &quot;Reconstructing The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;, what looks to be footage of Tuco lighting cannons before the Ecstasy of the Gold sequence appears briefly. None of these scenes or sequences appear in the 2004 re-release but are featured in the supplementary features.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
In Italy, the film grossed $6.3 million at the time. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $25.1 million. It also grossed in other international territories, for a total of grossed worldwide.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; holds an approval rating of 97% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Arguably the greatest of the spaghetti westerns, this epic features a compelling story, memorable performances, breathtaking landscapes, and a haunting score.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Upon release, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; received criticism for its depiction of violence. Leone explains that &quot;the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns... The west was made by violent, uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.&quot; To this day, Leone&#x27;s effort to reinvigorate the timeworn Western is widely acknowledged.

Critical opinion of the film on initial release was mixed, as many reviewers at that time looked down on &quot;Spaghetti Westerns&quot;. In a negative review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a critic Renata Adler said that the film &quot;must be the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;temptation is hereby proved irresistible to call &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Ugly&quot;, now playing citywide, &quot;The Bad, The Dull, and the Interminable&quot;, only because it is.&quot; Roger Ebert, who later included the film in his list of Great Movies, retrospectively noted that in his original review he had &quot;described a four-star movie, but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a &#x27;Spaghetti Western&#x27; and so could not be art.&quot;

Despite the initial negative reception by some critics, the film has since accumulated very positive feedback. It is listed in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Movies of the Last Century&quot; as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel. &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; has been described as European cinema&#x27;s best Western, and Quentin Tarantino has called it &quot;the best-directed film of all time&quot; and &quot;the greatest achievement in the history of cinema&quot;. This was reflected in his votes for the 2002 and 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine polls, in which he voted for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; as his choice for the best film ever made. Its main music theme from the soundtrack is regarded by Classic FM as one of the most iconic themes of all time. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine ranked the film number 49 on their list of the 50 greatest movies. In 2002, Film4 held a poll of the 100 Greatest Movies, on which &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was voted in at number 46. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine included the film on their &quot;100 Most Daring Movies Ever Made&quot; list. Mr. Showbiz ranked the film #81 on its &quot;100 Best Movies of All Time&quot; list.

&quot;Empire&quot; magazine added &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; to their Masterpiece collection in the September 2007 issue, and their poll of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies&quot;, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was voted in at number 25. In 2014, &quot;The Good the Bad and the Ugly&quot; was ranked the 47th greatest film ever made on &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of &quot;The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time&quot; as voted by the magazine&#x27;s readers. It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 movies by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Ugly&quot; placed 52nd on their list. An article on the BBC website considers the &#x27;lasting legacy of the film, and describes the trio scene as &quot;one of the most riveting and acclaimed feature films sequences of all time&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
The film&#x27;s title has entered the English language as an idiomatic expression. Typically used when describing something thoroughly, the respective phrases refer to upsides, downsides, and the parts that could, or should have been done better, but were not.

Quentin Tarantino paid homage to the film&#x27;s climactic stand-off scene in his 1992 film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;.

The film was novelised in 1967 by Joe Millard as part of the &quot;Dollars Western&quot; series based on the &quot;Man with No Name&quot;. The South Korean western movie &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Weird&quot; (2008) is inspired by the film, with much of its plot and character elements borrowed from Leone&#x27;s film. In his introduction to the 2003 revised edition of his novel &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot;, Stephen King said the film was a primary influence for the Dark Tower series, with Eastwood&#x27;s character inspiring the creation of King&#x27;s protagonist, Roland Deschain.

In 1975, Willie Colón with Yomo Toro and Hector Lavoe, released an album titled &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Ugly&quot;. The album cover featured the three in cowboy attire.

=== Impact on Western genre ===
While the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; was not the beginning of the so-called Spaghetti Western cycle in Italy, many in the US saw it as the beginning of an Italian invasion of the most recognisably American film genre. Christopher Frayling argues that, on the whole, Americans had become &quot;bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre&quot;. He notes that Pauline Kael, for example, had appreciated how non-American films of the time &quot;could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality&quot;. Along with Peter Bondanella and others, Frayling argues that such revisionism was the key to Leone&#x27;s success and, to some degree, to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole. &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, like the later &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot;, belongs to multiple Western sub-genres: Epic Western, Outlaw (Gunfighter) Film, Revisionist Western and Spaghetti Western.

&quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot; has been called the definitive Spaghetti Western – colloquially, these are Westerns produced and directed by Italians, often in collaboration with other European countries, especially Spain and West Germany. The name &#x27;Spaghetti Western&#x27; originally was a pejorative term, given by foreign critics to these films because they thought they were inferior to American westerns. Most of the films were made with low budgets, but several still managed to be innovative and artistic, although at the time they did not get much recognition, even in Europe. The genre is unmistakably a Catholic genre, with a visual style strongly influenced by the Catholic iconography of, for instance, the crucifixion or the last supper. The outdoor scenes of many Spaghetti Westerns, especially those with a relatively higher budget, were shot in Spain, in particular the Tabernas desert of Almería and Colmenar Viejo and Hoyo de Manzanares. In Italy, the region of Lazio was a favourite location.

The genre expanded and became an international sensation with the success of Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s samurai film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. But a handful of westerns were made in Italy before Leone redefined the genre, and the Italians were not the first to make westerns in Europe in the sixties. But it was Leone who defined the look and attitude of the genre with his first western and the two that soon were to follow: &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Together these films are called the Dollars Trilogy. Leone&#x27;s portrayal of the west, in the latter, was not concerned with ideas of the frontier or good vs. evil but rather interested in how the world is unmistakably more complicated than that, and how the western world is one of kill or be killed. These films featured knifings, beatings, shootouts, or other violent action every five to ten minutes. &quot;The issue of morality belongs to the American western,&quot; explains Italian director Ferdinando Baldi. &quot;The violence in our movies is more gratuitous than in American films. There was very little morality because often the protagonist was a bad guy.&quot; Eastwood&#x27;s character is a violent and ruthless killer who murders opponents for fun and profit. Behind his cold and stony stare is a cynical mind powered by a dubious morality. Unlike earlier cowboy heroes, Eastwood&#x27;s character constantly smokes a small cigar and hardly ever shaves. He wears a flat-topped hat and Mexican poncho instead of more traditional western costuming. He never introduces himself when he meets anyone, and nobody ever asks his name. Furthermore, Spaghetti Westerns redefined the western genre to fit the everchanging times of the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Rather than portraying the traditional mythic West as an exotic and beautiful land of opportunity, hope, and redemption, they depicted a desolate and forsaken West. In these violent and troubled times, Spaghetti Westerns, with their antiheroes, ambiguous morals, brutality, and anti-Establishment themes, resonated with audiences. The film&#x27;s gratuitous violence, surrealistic style, gloomy look, and eerie sound captured the era&#x27;s melancholy. It is this new approach to the genre that defined the revisionist western of the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s; a movement started by this moral ambiguity of the Spaghetti Westerns, as well as a westerns placement in the context of historical events; both attributes defined and set by &quot;The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly&quot;.

These films have a recognisable style. With grandiose wide shots and close-ups that peered into the eyes and souls of the characters, &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot;, had the defining cinematographic techniques of the Spaghetti Western. This was Leone&#x27;s signature technique, using long drawn shots interspersed with extreme close-ups that build tension, as well as develop characters. However, Leone&#x27;s movies were not just influenced by style. As Quentin Tarantino notes:
 There was also realism to them: those shitty Mexican towns, the little shacks — a bit bigger to accommodate the camera — all the plates they put the beans on, the big wooden spoons. The films were so realistic, which had always seemed to be missing in the westerns of the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s, in the brutality and the different shades of grey and black. Leone found an even darker black and off-white. There is realism in Leone&#x27;s presentation of the Civil War in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; that was missing from all the Civil War movies that happened before him. Leone&#x27;s film, and the genre that he defined within it, shows a west that is more violent, less talky, more complex, more theatrical, and just overall more iconic through the use of music, appearing operatic as the music is an illustrative ingredient of the narrative.

With a greater sense of operatic violence than their American cousins, the cycle of spaghetti westerns lasted just a few years, but it has been said to have rewritten the genre.

=== Film tourism ===
Fans of the film have reconstructed the location of the Sad Hill Cemetery in Santo Domingo de Silos. The reconstruction was recorded in the documentary &quot;Sad Hill Unearthed&quot; (2017) by Guillermo de Oliveira.
In 2024, the Sabinares del Arlanza Natural Park announced a plan to rebuild the Betterville prisoner camp at its filmed location about 6 km from Sad Hill.

== Cancelled sequel ==
&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; is the last film in the Dollars Trilogy, and thus, does not have an official sequel. However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled &quot;Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2&quot; &quot;(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)&quot;. According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie&#x27;s grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film&#x27;s production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. The project was ultimately vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film&#x27;s title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.

<text>The RadioShack TRS-80 Color Computer, later marketed as the Tandy Color Computer, is a series of home computers developed and sold by Tandy Corporation. Despite sharing a name with the earlier TRS-80, the Color Computer is a completely different system and a radical departure in design based on the Motorola 6809E processor rather than the Zilog Z80 of earlier models.

The Tandy Color Computer line, nicknamed CoCo, started in 1980 with what is now called the Color Computer 1. It was followed by the Color Computer 2 in 1983, then the Color Computer 3 in 1986. All three models maintain a high level of software and hardware compatibility, with few programs written for an older model being unable to run on the newer ones. The Color Computer 3 was discontinued in 1991.

All Color Computer models shipped with Color BASIC, an implementation of Microsoft BASIC, in ROM. Variants of the OS-9 multitasking operating system were available from third parties.

==History==
Tandy Corporation announced the TRS-80 Color Computer in July 1980 as a low-cost home computer. The Color Computer is a completely different design than the Zilog Z80-based TRS-80 models. &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote, &quot;The only similarity between [the two computers] is the name&quot;.

The TRS-80 Color Computer derives from an &quot;experimental videotext project by the Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service and the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture&quot; in 1977. Motorola Semiconductor of Austin, Texas, won the contract for the user terminals and Tandy&#x27;s Computer Division joined later to manufacture the terminals. The initial goal of this project, called &quot;Green Thumb&quot;, was to create a low cost videotex terminal for farmers, ranchers, and others in the agricultural industry. This terminal would connect to a phone line and an ordinary color television and allow the user access to near-real-time information useful to their day-to-day operations on the farm.

Motorola&#x27;s MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) chip was released about the time the joint venture started. The 1978 prototype &quot;Green Thumb&quot; terminal used the MC6847 and the Motorola 6809 microprocessor. However, the prototype contained too many chips to be commercially viable. Motorola responded by integrating the functions of many smaller chips into one chip: the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer (SAM). The SAM, VDG, and 6809 were used as the core of the AgVision terminal. It was also sold through Radio Shack stores as the VideoTex terminal around 1980.

The VideoTex terminal provided the foundation for a general-purpose home computer. The internal modem was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector was added to the right side of the case for future enhancements and ROM cartridges (&quot;Program Paks&quot;). A sticker indicating the amount of installed memory in the machine covers the hole where the modem&#x27;s LED &quot;DATA&quot; indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer, which shares the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals.

Tandy viewed businesses as its primary market for computers. Although the company&#x27;s Ed Juge said in 1981 that the Color Computer was &quot;our entry into the home-computer market&quot;, he described it as &quot;for serious professionals&quot;, stating that a word processor and spreadsheet would soon be available. The initial model (catalog number 26-3001) shipped with 4 KB of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and in ROM. Its price was . Within a few months, Radio Shack stores across the US and Canada began selling the new computer.

==Color Computer 1 (1980–1983) ==
The original version of the Color Computer sports a large silver-gray case with a calculator-like chiclet keyboard and was available with memory sizes of 4K (26-3001), 16K (26-3002), or 32K (26-3003). Versions with at least 16K of memory installed shipped with standard Microsoft Color Basic or (optionally) Extended Color BASIC. The only available connection to a display device is to a TV.

Early versions of the CoCo 1 have a black keyboard surround, the TRS-80 nameplate above the keyboard to the left side, and a RAM badge (&quot;button&quot;) affixed on the top and right side of the case. Later versions removed the black keyboard surround and RAM button, and moved the TRS-80 nameplate to the mid-line of the case.

The computer is based on a single printed-circuit board with all semiconductors manufactured by Motorola including the MC6809E CPU, MC6847 VDG, MC6883 SAM, and RAM, which consists of 2104 (4Kx1) chips (4K models) or 4116 (16Kx1) chips (16K models). The early CoCos only have eight RAM sockets, so upgrading to 32K requires piggybacking two sets of 4116 chips and adding a few jumper wires. A later motherboard revision removed the 4K RAM option and were upgraded to 32K with &quot;half-bad&quot; 4164 DRAMs. These boards have jumpers marked HIGH/LOW to determine which half of the memory chip was good. As memory production yields improved and costs went down, many (perhaps most) 32K CoCo 1s shipped with perfectly good 4164 memory chips. Utilities and programs began to take advantage of the hidden 32K.

Users opening the case risked invalidating the warranty. Radio Shack could upgrade all versions that shipped with standard Color BASIC to Extended Color BASIC, developed by Microsoft, for $99. &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote in 1981 that through Extended Color BASIC, Radio Shack &quot;has released the first &quot;truly&quot; easy-to-use and inexpensive system that generates full-color graphics&quot;. Eventually the 32K memory option was dropped entirely and only 16K or 64K versions were offered.

In late 1982, a version of the Color Computer with a white case, called the TDP System 100, was distributed by RCA and sold through non-Tandy stores. Except for the nameplate and case, it is identical to the Color Computer.

Later, both the CoCo and the TDP System 100 shipped with a white case with ventilation slots running the length of the case rather than only the sides. This ventilation scheme carried over to the CoCo 2. Some late versions of the CoCo have a modified keyboard, often referred to as the &quot;melted&quot; keyboard, with bigger keycaps.

Peripherals included tape cassette storage, serial printers, a 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, a pen and graphics tablet called the X-Pad, speech and sound generators, and joysticks.

==Color Computer 2 (1983–1986) ==
During the initial CoCo 1 production run, much of the discrete support circuitry had been re-engineered into a handful of custom integrated circuits, leaving much of the circuit board area of the CoCo 1 as empty space. To cut production costs, the case was shortened by about 25% and a new, smaller power supply and motherboard were designed. The &quot;melted&quot; keyboard from the white CoCo 1 and the TDP-100 style ventilation slots were carried over. Aside from the new look and the deletion of the 12 volt power supply to the expansion connector, the computer was compatible with the previous generation. The removal of the 12V power supply crippled some peripherals such as the original floppy disk controller, which then needed to be upgraded, installed in a Multi-Pak interface, or supplied with external power.

The CoCo 2 was sold in 16K and 64K models. 16K models use 16Kx1 DRAMs, but the chips are not the common 4116; they were instead 4517s (Radio Shack P/N 8040517), which use only +5V power rather than the triple voltages used by the 4116. 64K models use standard 4164 chips and have a control register at $FFDE/$FFDF to switch between the second 32K of RAM and the OS ROMs. With the ROMs banked out, the entire 64K of system RAM can be accessed.

Upgraded BASIC ROMs add minor features and fix some bugs. A redesigned 5-volt disk controller was introduced with its own new Disk BASIC ROM (v1.1). It adds a new command, codice_1, to auto-boot software from disk (this requires a disk with a special boot sector). This allows the use of software on copy protected disks or third-party operating systems, chiefly OS-9.

Production was partially moved to Korea, with production in the US and Korea happening in parallel using the same part numbers.

Around March 1984, Radio Shack began advertising a 64K version of the CoCo 2 which also included an &#x27;enhanced&#x27; full-travel, typewriter-style keyboard in the production run, replacing the previous &quot;melted&quot; keyboard.

The final significant change in the life of the CoCo 2 (models 26-3134B, 26-3136B, and 26-3127B; 16K standard, 16K extended, and 64K extended respectively) was to use the enhanced VDG, the MC6847T1, allowing lowercase characters and changing the text screen border color. These features were not enabled in BASIC. Midway during the production run of these models, the nameplate was changed from &quot;Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 2&quot; to &quot;Tandy Color Computer 2&quot;. The red, green, and blue shapes were replaced with red, green, and blue parallelograms.

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; wrote in December 1984 that the Color Computer was the best educational computer under $1000. The magazine said that it had fewer but better-quality educational software titles than the Commodore 64, and that Radio Shack was dedicated to the educational market while Commodore was not.

== Color Computer 3 (1986–1991) ==
By 1985, Color Computer users worried that the company would abandon their computer in favor of the Tandy 1000. Tandy executive Ed Juge stated that year that &quot;No home computer on the market today has the potential horsepower of the Color Computer ... we believe [it] also has a good future&quot;.

On July 30, 1986, Tandy announced the Color Computer 3 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. It came with which could be upgraded to 512 KB. The panel behind the keyboard and cartridge door plastic were changed from black to grey. The keyboard layout was revised, putting the arrow keys in a diamond configuration and adding , , , and keys. It sold in Radio Shack stores and Tandy Computer Centers for $219.95.

The CoCo 3 is compatible with most older software and CoCo 2 peripherals. The 6809 in the CoCo 1 and 2 runs at 0.895 MHz. The CoCo 3 runs at that frequency by default, but is software controllable to run at twice that rate; OS-9 takes advantage of that capability. Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware in the CoCo 1 and 2 is an application-specific integrated circuit called the GIME (Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancement) chip. The GIME also provides:

* Output to a composite video monitor or analog RGB monitor, in addition to the CoCo 1 and 2&#x27;s TV output. This improves the clarity of its output.
* A paged memory management unit breaks up the 6809&#x27;s 64 KB address space into chunks. The scheme would later allow third party RAM upgrades of up to 2 MB().
* Text display with real lowercase at 32, 40, 64, or 80 characters per line and between 16 and 24 lines per screen.
* Text character attributes, including 8 foreground and 8 background colors, underline, and blink.
* New graphics resolutions of 160, 256, 320 or 640 pixels wide by 192 to 225 lines. 
* 320x192x4, 320x192x16, 640x192x2, and 640x192x4 from a palette of 64 colors. There are two palette modes - RGB (3 base colors with 3 levels of intensity and white, black and two gray tones) and Composite (16 distinct colors with 4 levels of intensity).

Omitted from the GIME are the seldom-used SAM-created Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24 modes. A rumored 256-color mode (detailed in the original Tandy spec for the GIME) has never been found.

Previous versions of the CoCo ROM were licensed from Microsoft, but Tandy could not convince them to provide further BASIC updates. Instead, Microware provided extensions to Extended Color BASIC to support the new display modes. To not violate the spirit of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and Tandy, Microsoft&#x27;s unmodified BASIC is loaded in the CoCo 3&#x27;s ROM. Upon startup, the ROM is copied to RAM and patched by Microware&#x27;s code. The patched code has several bugs, and support for many of the new hardware features is incomplete.

Microware also provided a version of the OS-9 Level 2 operating system shortly after launch. OS-9 uses memory-mapping (so each process has its own memory space up to 64K), windowed display, and a more extensive development environment that includes a copy of BASIC09. C and Pascal compilers were available. Members of the CoCo OS-9 community enhanced OS-9 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 at Tandy&#x27;s request, but Tandy stopped production of the CoCo 3 before the upgrade was officially released. Most of the improvements made it into NitrOS-9, a major rewrite of OS-9/6809 Level 2 for the CoCo 3 to take advantage of the features and speed of the Hitachi 6309 (if available).

A joystick adapter designed by Steve Bjork increases the resolution of the joystick/mouse interface by a factor of ten at the expense of CPU time.

==Hardware==
Internally the CoCo 1 and CoCo 2 models are functionally identical. The core of the system is virtually identical to the reference design included in the Motorola MC6883 data sheet and consists of five LSI chips:
* MC6809E Microprocessor Unit (MPU)
* MC6883/SN74LS783/SN74LS785 Synchronous Address Multiplexor (SAM)
* MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG)
* Two Peripheral Interface Adapters (PIA), either MC6821 or MC6822 chips

===SAM===
The SAM is a multifunction device that performs the following functions:
* Clock generation and synchronization for the 6809E MPU and 6847 VDG
* Up to 64 KB dynamic random access memory (DRAM) control and refresh
* Device selection based on MPU memory address to determine if the MPU access is to DRAM, ROM, PIA, etc.
* Duplication of the VDG address counter to &quot;feed&quot; the VDG the data it is expecting

The SAM was designed to replace numerous small LS/TTL chips into one integrated package. Its main purpose is to control the DRAM but, as outlined above, it integrates several other functions as well. It is connected to a crystal at 4 times the television colorburst frequency (14.31818 MHz for NTSC countries). This is divided by 4 internally and is fed to the VDG for its own internal timing (3.579545 MHz for NTSC). The SAM also divides the master clock by 16 (or 8 in certain cases) for the two phase MPU clock; in NTSC this is 0.89 MHz (or 1.8 MHz if divided by 8).

Switching the SAM into 1.8 MHz operation gives the CPU the time ordinarily used by the VDG and refresh. As such, the display shows garbage; this mode was seldom used. However, an unusual mode available by the SAM is called the Address Dependent mode, where ROM reads (since they do not use the DRAM) occur at 1.8 MHz but regular RAM access occurs at 0.89 MHz. In effect, since the BASIC interpreter runs from ROM, putting the machine in this mode would nearly double the performance of a BASIC program while maintaining video display and DRAM refresh. Of course, this would throw off the software timing loops and I/O operations would be affected. Despite this, however, the &quot;high speed POKE&quot; was used by many CoCo BASIC programs even though it overclocked the hardware in the CoCo, which was only rated for 1 MHz operation.

The SAM has no connection to the MPU data bus. As such, it is programmed in a curious manner; its 16-bit configuration register is spread across 32 memory addresses (FFC0-FFDF). Writing even bytes sets that register bit to 0, while writing odd bytes sets it to 1. The value (D7-D0) that is written is ignored.

Due to limitations in 40-pin packaging, the SAM contains a duplicate of the VDG&#x27;s internal 12-bit address counter. Normally this counter&#x27;s settings are set to duplicate the VDG&#x27;s display mode. However, this is not required and results in the creation of some new display modes not possible when the VDG is used in a system alone. Instead of the VDG requesting data from RAM by itself, the VDG is &quot;fed&quot; data by the SAM&#x27;s internal copy of the VDG address counter. This process is called &quot;Interleaved Direct Memory Access&quot; (IDMA) by Motorola and ensures that the processor and VDG always have full access to this shared memory resource with no wait states or contention.

There are two versions of the SAM. The early one is labeled MC6883 and/or SN74LS783; the later version is labeled SN74LS785. There are some minor timing differences, but the major difference is the support of an 8-bit refresh counter in the 785 version. This allowed for use of inexpensive 16K by 4-bit and certain 64K by 1-bit DRAMs. Some third-party bank-switching memory upgrades that used 256K DRAMs needed this 8-bit refresh counter to work.

===VDG===

The Motorola 6847 is display generator capable of displaying text and graphics contained within a roughly square display matrix 256 pixels wide by 192 lines high. It can display 9 colors: black, green, yellow, blue, red, white, cyan, magenta, and orange.

====Alphanumeric/Semigraphics display====
In alphanumeric mode, each character is a 5 dot wide by 7 dot high character in a box 8 dots wide and 12 lines high. This display mode occupies 512 bytes of memory from $400-$5FF and is a 32 character wide screen with 16 lines. The ROM character generator only holds 64 characters, so no lowercase characters are provided. &quot;Lowercase&quot; characters are rendered as uppercase with inverted color. On most CoCo generations it is green on very dark green.

Semigraphics is a mode where alphanumerics and low resolution graphics can be mixed together. The 8th bit of a character determines if it is alphanumeric or treated as a 2 × 2 pixel grid. When the 8th bit is set, the next three bits determine the color and last 4 bits specify which quadrants of the character box are either the selected color or black. This allows a 64 × 32 graphics mode with 9 colors, the only mode where it is possible to display all 9 colors simultaneously.

There are two colorsets. The default has black characters on a green background. The alternate has black characters on an orange background. The colorset selection does not affect semigraphics characters. The border is always black.

The 6847 is capable of a Semigraphics 6 display mode, where two bits select a color and 6 bits determine which 1/6 of the character box is lit. Only 4 colors are possible, but the colorset bit of the VDG selects two groups of 4 colors. Only two colors are available in graphics blocks when using Semigraphics 6 on the CoCo.

The default alphanumeric display for the CoCo is Semigraphics 4.

====Additional Semigraphics modes====
By setting the SAM such that it believes it is displaying a full graphics mode, but leaving the VDG in Alphanumeric/Semigraphics 4 mode, it is possible to subdivide the character box into smaller pieces. This creates the &quot;virtual&quot; modes Semigraphics 8, 12, and 24. In these modes it was possible to mix bits and pieces of different text characters as well as Semigraphics 4 characters. These modes were an interesting curiosity but not widely used, as the Semigraphics 24-screen consumed 6144 bytes of memory. These modes were not implemented on the CoCo 3.

A programmer&#x27;s reference manual for the CoCo states that due to a fire at Tandy&#x27;s research lab, the papers relating to the semigraphics modes were shuffled, and so some of the semigraphics modes were never documented. CoCo enthusiasts created experimental programs to try to reverse engineer the modes, and were able to reconstruct the missing documentation.

====Bitmap modes====
Bitmap display modes are divided into two categories: &quot;resolution&quot; and &quot;color&quot;.

In resolution modes, each pixel is addressable as either on or off. There are two colorsets available: black dots on a green background with a green border, and white dots on a black background with a white border.

In color modes, each pixel uses two bits to select one of four colors, with the overall colors determined by the colorset: 
* a green border with the colors green, yellow, red, and blue; 
* a white border with the colors white, cyan, magenta, and orange.

Resolution graphics store 8 pixels per byte and are available in 128×64, 128×96, 128×192, and 256×192 modes. Color graphics have 4 pixels per byte and are available in 64×64, 128×64, 128×96, and 128×192. The maximum size of a bitmap screen is 6144.

====Artifact colors====
The 256×192 two color graphics mode can display four colors due to a quirk in the NTSC television system. These are called composite artifact colors.

In the first colorset, where green and black dots are available, alternating columns of green and black appear as a muddy green color. With the white and black colorset, the result is either orange or blue. Reversing the order of the alternating dots gives the opposite color. In effect, this mode is 128×192 with four colors: black, orange, blue, and white. On PAL televisions, instead of solid orange and blue, artifacts appear as vertical stripes of green and peach with soft edges and a width of almost four pixels. On a CoCo 3 with an analog RGB monitor, the black and white dot patterns do not artifact.

The bit patterns that represent orange and blue can be different each time the system is powered up. Most Color Computer games start with a title screen and ask the user to press the reset button until the colors are correct. This is fixed on the Color Computer 3, and the other colorset can be chosen by holding during reset.

====Lowercase and the 6847T1====
The 6847 is capable of using an external character generator. Several third-party add-on boards allow the CoCo to display real lowercase characters.

Late in the CoCo 2 production run, the enhanced 6847T1 VDG was used. It includes a lowercase character generator and the ability to display a green/orange or black border on the text screen. The lowercase capability is disabled by default on these CoCo 2s, and is not mentioned in the manual.

====Sound====
The CoCo has two methods of making sound: a 6-bit digital-to-analog converter and a separate 1-bit sound source. Cassette playback or an analog signal can be also be routed from the cartridge port to the TV speaker.

===PIAs===
There are two Peripheral Interface Adapter chips in all CoCo models. The PIAs are dedicated to I/O operations such as driving the internal 6-bit digital-to-analog converter, controlling the relay for the cassette motor, reading the keyboard, controlling the VDG mode pins, and accessing the RS-232 serial I/O port.

The earliest CoCo models have two standard 6821 chips. Later, after changes in the keyboard design, the 6822 IIA (Industrial Interface Adapter) was used instead. The 6822 was eventually discontinued by Motorola, but was produced for Tandy as an application-specific integrated circuit with the part number SC67331P.

===Interface to external peripherals===
Due to the CoCo&#x27;s design, the MPU encounters no wait states in normal operation. This means that precise, software-controlled timing loops are easily implemented. This is important since the CoCo has no specialized hardware for any I/O. All I/O operations, such as cassette reading and writing, serial I/O, scanning the keyboard, and reading the position of the joysticks, must be done entirely in software. This reduces hardware cost but reduces system performance as the MPU is unavailable during these operations.

As an example, the CoCo cassette interface is perhaps one of the fastest available (1500 bit/s), but it does so entirely under software control. While reading or writing a cassette, the CoCo has no CPU time free for other tasks. They must wait until an error occurs or all the data needed is read.

===CoCo 3 hardware changes===
In the CoCo 3, a new VLSI ASIC called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME), integrated the functions of the SAM and VDG while enhancing the capabilities of both. The CoCo 3 supports 40- and 80-column text and the ability to run at 1.8 MHz without loss of video. The processor was changed to the 68B09E and the PIA was changed to the 68B21, which are 2 MHz parts.

==Discontinuation==

On October 26, 1990, Tandy announced that the CoCo 3 would be dropped from its computer line.

Wayne Green wrote in &quot;80 Micro&quot; in December 1982 that Tandy had &quot;virtually abandoned&quot; the Color Computer. As with its other computers, Tandy attempted to monopolize hardware and software sales, but, he wrote, the Color Computer was incompatible with other Tandy software and what was available was of poor quality. &quot;I&#x27;m sure there are at least fifty software firms out there that would love to work with the Shack&quot;, Green said, but &quot;it seems that the Shack people are at war with their supporters and potential suppliers&quot;. Many CoCo owners agree that Tandy did not take the computer seriously.

===Successors===
A few companies attempted to carry the CoCo torch, but the lack of decent backwards compatibility with the failed to entice much of the community. Some of these systems run OS9/68k, which is similar to OS-9.

Frank Hogg Labs introduced the Tomcat TC-9 in June 1990, which is somewhat compatible with the but is only able to run OS-9 software. A later version called the TC-70 has strong compatibility with the MM/1, and also runs OS-9/68K.

Multi-Media One was introduced in July 1990, runs OS-9/68K on a 15 MHz Signetics 68070 processor with and a 640×208 graphics resolution as well as supporting a 640×416 interlaced mode. It includes a SCSI interface, stereo A/D and D/A conversion, an optional MIDI interface, and an optional board to upgrade the CPU to a Motorola 68340. The AT306 (also known as the MM/1B) is a successor to the MM/1 that contains a Motorola 68306 CPU, OS-9/68K 3.0, and allows ISA bus cards. It was created by Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider, and sold by Carl&#x27;s company, Kreider Electronics.

Peripheral Technology produced a 16 MHz Motorola 68000 system called a PTK68K-4. Delmar sold systems based on the PT68K-4 and called the Delmar System IV. The PT68K-4 has the footprint of an IBM PC and seven 8-bit ISA slots. Video is provided by a standard video card and monitor, but for high-resolution graphics the software only supports certain video cards.

Gary Becker produced the CoCo3FPGA for Terasic DE FPGA boards. It contains a 6809 CPU core which can run at 25 MHz. It adds 256-color graphics modes, including a 640x450 mode.

Roger Taylor developed a CoCo 3 clone, Matchbox Coco, based on the DE0-Nano FPGA board. Renamed to RealCoCo, it has been ported to other FPGA hardware.

==Clones and cousins==
The Dragon 32 and 64 are British cousins of the CoCo based on a reference design from Motorola that was produced as an example of the capabilities of the MC6809E CPU when coupled with the MC6847 Video Display Generator and the MC6883 Synchronous Address Multiplexer. The BIOS for the Dragon 32 was written based on specifications and API drawn up by Microsoft and, to a certain extent, PA Consulting of Cambridge. The Dragon was a much improved unit with video output in addition to the TV output of the CoCo and CoCo 2. It also featured a Centronics parallel port (not present on any CoCo), an integrated 6551A serial UART (on the Dragon 64), and a higher-quality keyboard. In 1983, a version of the Dragon was licensed for manufacture for the North American market by Tano Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana. Tano started production at their facility in September 1983 and were running at capacity one month later. Sales did not meet expectations and Tano stopped production and support after a year.

In Brazil, there were several CoCo clones, including the Prológica CP 400 Color and CP 400 Color II, the Varix VC 50, the LZ Color 64, the Dynacom MX-1600, the Codimex CD-6809, and the vaporware Microdigital TKS800.

In Mexico, the Micro-SEP, a CoCo 2 clone with 64 KB of memory, was introduced by the Secretary of Education. The Micro-SEP was intended to be distributed nationally to all the public schools teaching the 7th to 9th grades. They were presented as a design of the Center of Advanced Research and Studies of Instituto Politécnico Nacional. Like the Dragon, these computers also included video output. Whether these computers were &quot;designed&quot; by this institute, or were licensed from the original design, is unclear.

A Taiwan-based company, Sampo, also made a CoCo clone, the Sampo Color Computer. The Sampo was supposedly available in Taiwan, Korea, and possibly other Asian countries. It is believed that Tandy blocked sales in the US with legal action due to copyright infringements on the ROM code.

The TRS-80 MC-10, or Micro Color Computer, was sold in Radio Shack stores as an entry-level computer at a lower cost than the CoCo. Released in 1983, it was similar in appearance to the Timex Sinclair. Like the CoCo, it uses the MC6847 VDG and Microsoft BASIC, but with the MC6803 instead of the 6809.

<text>Thomas Eugene Lovejoy III (August 22, 1941December 25, 2021) was an American ecologist who was President of the Amazon Biodiversity Center, a Senior Fellow at the United Nations Foundation and a university professor in the Environmental Science and Policy department at George Mason University. Lovejoy was the World Bank&#x27;s chief biodiversity advisor and the lead specialist for environment for Latin America and the Caribbean as well as senior advisor to the president of the United Nations Foundation. In 2008, he also was the first Biodiversity Chair of the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment to 2013. Previously he served as president of the Heinz Center since May 2002. Lovejoy introduced the term &quot;biological diversity&quot; to the scientific community in 1980. He was a past chair of the Scientific Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) for the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the multibillion-dollar funding mechanism for developing countries in support of their obligations under international environmental conventions.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Thomas Eugene Lovejoy III was born on August 22, 1941, in Manhattan, New York, to Jeanne (Gillette) and Thomas Eugene Lovejoy, Jr. He attended Millbrook School, where he worked at The Trevor Zoo, under zoo founder Frank Trevor and his wife Janet. &quot;The first three weeks were the key, and that&#x27;s what flipped my switch in life and Biology. I was not prepared for the impact the Trevors world actually have on me in the classroom. And it was like my first three weeks and that was it. I&#x27;m going to be a biologist.&quot; He graduated from Millbrook in 1959.

=== Education ===
Lovejoy enrolled at Yale University, earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology in 1964 while working as a zoological assistant at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. He also received his Ph.D. in biology from Yale University.

=== Conservation work ===
As a tropical biologist and conservation biologist, Lovejoy worked in the Amazon of Brazil beginning in 1965.

From 1973 to 1987 he directed the conservation program at World Wildlife Fund-U.S., and from 1987 to 1998 he served as assistant secretary for environmental and external affairs for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and in 1994 became counselor to the secretary for biodiversity and environmental affairs. From 1999 to 2002, he served as chief biodiversity adviser to the president of the World Bank. In 2010 and 2011, he served as chair of the Independent Advisory Group on Sustainability for the Inter-American Development Bank. He was senior adviser to the president of the United Nations Foundation, chair of the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies, and was past president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, past chairman of the United States Man and Biosphere Program, and past president of the Society for Conservation Biology.

Lovejoy developed the debt-for-nature swaps, in which environmental groups purchase shaky foreign debt on the secondary market at the market rate, which is considerably discounted, and then convert this debt at its face value into the local currency to purchase biologically sensitive tracts of land in the debtor nation for purposes of environmental protection.

Critics of the &#x27;debt-for-nature&#x27; schemes, such as National Center for Public Policy Research, which distributes a wide variety of materials consistently justifying corporate freedom and environmental deregulation, aver that plans deprive developing nations of the extractable raw resources that are currently essential to further economic development. Economic stagnation and local resentment of &quot;Yankee imperialism&quot; can result, they warn. In reality, no debt-for-nature swap occurs without the approval of the country in question.

Lovejoy also supported the Forests Now Declaration, which calls for new market-based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.

Lovejoy played a central role in the establishment of conservation biology, by initiating the idea and planning with B. A. Wilcox in June 1978 for &quot;The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology&quot;, that was held in La Jolla, in September 1978. The proceedings, introduced conservation biology to the scientific community.

Lovejoy founded the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) near Manaus, Brazil, in 1979 to understand the effects of the fragmentation on tropical rainforests on ecosystems and wildlife.

Lovejoy served on many scientific and conservation boards and advisory groups, and was the author of numerous articles and books. As often misassociated, he was not the founder but served as an advisor in the early days of the public television series NATURE. He served in an official capacity in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton administrations.

Lovejoy predicted in 1980 (see quote below), that 10–20 percent of all species on earth would have gone extinct by the year 2020.

=== Awards and recognitions ===
In 1996, Lovejoy was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Lovejoy was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1999.

In 2001, Lovejoy was the recipient of the University of Southern California&#x27;s Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. Lovejoy has been granted the 2008 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category (&quot;ex aequo&quot; with William F. Laurance).

In 2001, Lovejoy received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Peter H. Raven.

In 2004, a new wasp species that acts as a parasite on butterfly larvae was discovered on the Pacific slope of the Talamanca mountain range in Costa Rica by Ronald Zúñiga, a specialist in bees, wasps and ants at the National Biodiversity Institute (INBio). INBio named the species &quot;Polycyrtus lovejoyi&quot; in honor of Lovejoy for his contributions in the world of biodiversity and support for INBio.

On October 31, 2012, Lovejoy was awarded the Blue Planet Prize for being &quot;the first scientist to academically clarify how humans are causing habitat fragmentation and pushing biological diversity towards crisis.&quot;

Lovejoy served continuously on the board of directors, from 2000, of the Amazon Conservation Team, which works in partnership with indigenous people of tropical South America in conserving the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest, as well as the culture and land of its indigenous people. He served on the board of directors from 2009 for the Amazon Conservation Association, whose mission is to conserve the biological diversity of the Amazon. He was also an emeritus member of the board of directors for Population Action International and served on the Scientific Board of SavingSpecies (elevated to SavingNature in 2019), a conservation organization featured in a &quot;Nature&quot; magazine article about Thomas Lovejoy&#x27;s scientific accomplishments.

In 2016, he was selected as a U.S. Science Envoy by the United States State Department.

In 2018, Lovejoy co-founded the Amazon Biodiversity Center to support the work of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project.

In 2021, he was elected member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences.

He died from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor on December 25, 2021, in McLean, Virginia, at the age of 80.

<text>The State of the World (SoW) was a series of books published annually from 1984 to 2017 by the U.S. based Worldwatch Institute, a thinktank that was founded in the 1970s by renowned environmentalist Lester R. Brown and ceased operations in 2017. The series attempted to identify the planet&#x27;s most significant environmental challenges.

The 2010 edition discussed different ways of changing current cultures such that it felt as natural to live sustainably as living as a consumer felt at the time. The 2011 edition looked at the global food crisis and surrounding environmental and social problems, with a particular emphasis on global innovations that could help solve that worldwide problem. The 2012 edition showcased innovative projects, creative policies, and fresh approaches that were advancing sustainable development in the twenty-first century. The 2013 edition defined the term sustainability, and assessed attempts to cultivate it.

<doc id="31567" wikidata="Q1126234" url="?curid=31567" title="Tavolara Island">
<text>Tavolara is a small island off the northeast coast of Sardinia, Italy. The island is a limestone massif long and wide, with steep cliffs except at its ends. Its highest point, Monte Cannone, is above sea level. A cove and beach can be found at each end of the island, Spalmatore di Fuori at the northeast, and Spalmatore di Terra at the southwest. Currently, the island is inhabited by only a handful of families, and has a small cemetery and summer restaurant. The water around the island is a popular spot for scuba diving.

The nearest sizable town is Olbia, and the small fishing village of Porto San Paolo is directly across a small strait. The islands of Molara and Molarotto are nearby.

Most of the population of the island was displaced in 1962 when a NATO radiogoniometric station was constructed on the eastern half of the island. The aerials from the station can be seen from quite a distance, and that entire half of the island is restricted to military personnel.

Tavolara is also home of the VLF-transmitter ICV, which works on 20.27 kHz and 20.76 kHz and which is used for transmitting messages to submarines. It can also be received (but not decoded) by PCs with a coil antenna at the soundcard entrance and FFT-analysis software.

The island and the surrounding waters are part of the Tavolara and Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Preserve created in 1997. The environmental protections placed on the park have added restrictions to the use of the area for tourism.

A natural column of rock on the island&#x27;s coast resembles a human figure and is known as &quot;the Stone Sentry&quot; or &quot;Pope&#x27;s Rock.&quot; Other stone formations include &quot;Ulysses&#x27; Bow&quot; (a natural arch) and the &quot;Grotta del Papa&quot; (a cave accessible by sea and boasting Neolithic cave paintings).

==Flora and fauna==
A rare species of thorny knapweed, &quot;Centaurea horrida&quot;, is endemic only to Tavolara and a few other fringe areas of northern Sardinia. In his &quot;Natural History of Sardinia&quot; (1774), Francesco Cetti reported huge rats inhabiting Tavolara, but these were likely Sardinian pikas, an endemic species of lagomorph that had already been driven to extinction in Sardinia proper by then. In the 18th century, Sardinian lore claimed the wild goats of Tavolara had gold teeth. The goat herds were moved to Sardinia when the NATO station was built and it was asumed there are no longer any goats on the island. However, in 2024 goats have been spotted again.The critically endangered monk seal had a breeding colony here until the 1960s. Once the home of a thriving lobster industry, Tavolara now attracts divers who come to view the coral, sponges, sea anemones, bottlenose dolphins, and even a few specimens of &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, the rare giant clam whose byssus fibers were formerly used in the manufacture of sea silk for royal garments.

==History==

The island was known in ancient times as Hermea. According to tradition, Pope St. Pontian died on Tavolara following his abdication and exile in 235. It is probably the island previously called Tolar, which was used by some Arab ships in 848–849 as a base to attack nearby coasts.

Joachim Murat visited Tavolara in 1815 during his attempt to regain the Kingdom of Naples. At that time the island was uninhabited.

In 1836 the imaginary kingdom of Tavolara was given to the Bertoleoni family by Charles Albert the King of Sardinia.

After Italian unification, “King Paolo” actively sought recognition from Italy. During his “reign”, in 1868 the Italian government began operating a lighthouse on the northeast end of the island.

The tomb of one of its members “Paolo I” is in the graveyard on the island, surmounted by a crown.

== VLF- Antenna ==
The VLF-antenna of Tavolara VLF transmitter is spun between a 133-metre-tall mast at on Spalmatore di Fuori and 4 masts, which are situated on mountains southwards.
They are situated at , at , at and at 
The two masts on the eastern mountain are tall, the two others are smaller.

==In popular culture==
Tavolara is the name given to a fictional island in the Philippines ruled by a cannibal king, in the 1902 Harvard comic opera &quot;Queen Philippine.&quot;

<doc id="31569" wikidata="Q2000344" url="?curid=31569" title="Tactic (method)">
<text>A tactic is a conceptual action or short series of actions with the aim of achieving a short-term goal. This action can be implemented as one or more specific tasks. The term is commonly used in business, by protest groups, in military, espionage, and law enforcement contexts, as well as in chess, sports or other competitive activities.

==Etymology==
The word originates from the Ancient Greek adjective (&quot;taktikos&quot;), meaning &quot;that which pertains to ordinance&quot;. The related Ancient Greek noun is (&quot;tagma&quot;), meaning &quot;ordinance, command&quot;.
Both words root in the verb (&quot;tasso&quot;), meaning &quot;draw up in order, station, appoint&quot;

==Distinction from strategy==
A strategy is a set of guidelines used to achieve an overall objective, whereas tactics are the specific actions aimed at adhering to those guidelines.

===Military usage===
In military usage, a military tactic is used by a military unit of no larger than a division to implement a specific mission and achieve a specific objective, or to advance toward a specific target.

The terms tactic and strategy are often confused: tactics are the actual means used to gain an objective, while strategy is the overall campaign plan, which may involve complex operational patterns, activity, and decision-making that govern tactical execution. The United States Department of Defense &quot;Dictionary of Military Terms&quot; defines the tactical level as &quot;the level of war at which battles and engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces. Activities at this level focus on the ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.&quot;

If, for example, the overall goal is to win a war against another country, one strategy might be to undermine the other nation&#x27;s ability to wage war by preemptively annihilating their military forces. The tactics involved might describe specific actions taken in specific locations, like surprise attacks on military facilities, missile attacks on offensive weapon stockpiles, and the specific techniques involved in accomplishing such objectives.

<doc id="31570" wikidata="Q713529" url="?curid=31570" title="Battle of the River Plate">
<text>The Battle of the River Plate was fought in the South Atlantic on 13 December 1939 as the first British naval battle of the Second World War.

The Kriegsmarine heavy cruiser , commanded by Captain Hans Langsdorff, engaged a Royal Navy squadron, commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood, comprising the light cruisers , (on loan to the New Zealand Division) and the heavy cruiser .

&quot;Graf Spee&quot; had sailed into the South Atlantic in August 1939, before the war began, and had begun commerce raiding after receiving the appropriate authorisation on 26 September 1939. Harwood&#x27;s squadron was one of several search groups sent in pursuit by the British Admiralty and sighted &quot;Graf Spee&quot; off the estuary of the River Plate ( the ) near the coasts of Argentina and Uruguay.

In the ensuing battle, &quot;Exeter&quot; was severely damaged and forced to retire, making for the Falklands; &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; suffered moderate damage. Damage to &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, although not extensive, was critical because her fuel system was crippled. &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; shadowed the German ship until she entered the port of Montevideo, the capital of neutral Uruguay, to effect urgent repairs. Langsdorff was told that his stay could not be extended beyond 72 hours. Apparently believing that the British had gathered a superior force to await his departure, he ordered for the ship to be scuttled. Langsdorff then committed suicide three days later.

== Background ==
&quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; had been at sea at the start of the Second World War in September 1939 and had sunk several merchantmen in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean without loss of life because of her captain&#x27;s policy of taking all crews on board before sinking the victim.
The Royal Navy assembled nine forces to search for the surface raider: Force G, the South American Cruiser Squadron, comprised the heavy cruiser of with eight guns in four turrets, the heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; of with six guns in three turrets, and two light cruisers, HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot;, both of with eight guns. Although technically a heavy cruiser because of the calibre of her guns, &quot;Exeter&quot; was a scaled-down version of the County class. The force was commanded by Commodore Henry Harwood whose flagship was &quot;Ajax&quot;, captained by Charles Woodhouse. &quot;Achilles&quot; was on loan to the New Zealand Division (precursor to the Royal New Zealand Navy) and captained by Edward Parry. &quot;Exeter&quot; was commanded by Captain Frederick Secker Bell. 

During the period before and at the immediate time of the battle, &quot;Cumberland&quot; (commanded by Captain Walter Herman Gordon Fallowfield) was refitting in the Falkland Islands but was available for sea at short notice. Force G was supported by the oilers RFA &quot;Olna&quot;, RFA &quot;Olynthus&quot;, and RFA &quot;Orangeleaf&quot;. &quot;Olynthus&quot; replenished HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; on 22 November 1939, and &quot;Exeter&quot; on 26 November, at San Borombon Bay. &quot;Olynthus&quot; was also directed to keep observation between Medanos and Cape San Antonio, off Argentina south of the River Plate estuary (see chart below).
Following a raider-warning radio message from the merchantman &quot;Doric Star&quot;, which was sunk by &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; off South Africa, Harwood suspected that the raider would try to strike next at the merchant shipping off the River Plate estuary between Uruguay and Argentina. He ordered his squadron to steam toward the position 32° south, 47° west. Harwood chose that position, according to his despatch, because it was the most congested part of the shipping routes in the South Atlantic and therefore the point at which a raider could do the most damage to enemy shipping. A Norwegian freighter saw &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; practising the use of her searchlights and radioed that her course was toward South America, the three available cruisers of Force G rendezvoused off the estuary on 12 December and conducted manoeuvres.

Regarding strategy, the British combat instructions for engaging a pocket battleship with a cruiser squadron had been devised by Harwood himself during his period at the Royal Naval War College between 1934 and 1936. The strategy specified an attack at once, day or night. During the day, the ships would attack as two units, in this case with &quot;Exeter&quot; separate from &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;. At night, the ships would remain in company, but in open order. By attacking from two sides, Harwood hoped to give his lighter warships a chance of overcoming the German advantage of greater range and heavier broadside by dividing the enemy&#x27;s fire. By splitting his force, Harwood would force the Germans to split their fire and reduce its effectiveness, or to keep it focused on one opponent and allow the other vessels to attack with less fear of return fire.

Although outgunned by &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; and therefore at a tactical disadvantage, the British had the upper hand strategically since any raider returning to Germany would have to run the blockade of the North Sea and might reasonably be expected to encounter the Home Fleet. For victory, the British had only to damage the raider enough so that she was either unable to make the journey or unable to fight a subsequent battle with the Home Fleet (by contrast, the Germans would have to destroy the British force without being severely damaged). Because of overwhelming numerical superiority, the loss of even all three cruisers would not have severely altered Britain&#x27;s naval capabilities, but &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was one of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s few capital ships. The British could, therefore, afford to risk a tactical defeat if it brought strategic victory.

== Battle ==

On 13 December at 05:20, the British squadron was proceeding on a course of 060° at 14 knots with &quot;Ajax&quot; at , east of Montevideo. At 06:10, smoke was sighted on a bearing of Red-100, or 320° (to the north-west). Harwood ordered the &quot;Exeter&quot; to investigate. She swung out of line, and at 06:16, she signaled by lamp: &quot;I think it is a pocket-battleship&quot;. Captain Bell ordered Flag N hoisted to the yard arm – &quot;Enemy in sight&quot;. &quot;Graf Spee&quot; had already sighted mastheads and identified &quot;Exeter&quot; but initially suspected that the two light cruisers were smaller destroyers and that the British ships were protecting a merchant convoy, the destruction of which would be a major prize. Since &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s reconnaissance aircraft was out of service, Langsdorff relied on his lookouts for that information. He decided to engage despite having received a broadly accurate report from the German naval staff on 4 December. It outlined British activity in the River Plate area and included information that &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot; were patrolling the South American coast.
Langsdorff realised too late that he was facing three cruisers. Calling on the immediate acceleration of his diesel engines, he closed with the enemy squadron at in the hope of engaging the steam-driven British ships before they could work up from cruising speed to full power. An alternative strategy would have been keeping the British ships at a distance to destroy them with his guns and remaining out of range of their smaller 6-inch and 8-inch guns. However, Langsdorff knew the British cruisers had a speed advantage over &quot;Graf Spee&quot; and could stay out of range while calling for reinforcements.
The British executed their battle plan: &quot;Exeter&quot; turned north-west, and &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;, operating together, turned north-east to spread &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s fire. &quot;Graf Spee&quot; opened fire on &quot;Exeter&quot; at with her six guns at 06:18. &quot;Exeter&quot; opened fire at 06:20, &quot;Achilles&quot; at 06:21, &quot;Exeter&quot;″s aft guns at 06:22 and &quot;Ajax&quot; at 06:23. Lieutenant-Commander Richard Jennings, &quot;Exeter&quot;″s gunnery officer remembers:

As I was crossing the compass platform [to his Action Station in the Director Control Tower], the captain hailed me, not with the usual rigmarole of &quot;Enemy in sight, bearing, etc&quot;, but with &quot;There&#x27;s the fucking &quot;Scheer&quot;! Open fire at her!&quot; Throughout the battle the crew of the &quot;Exeter&quot; thought they were fighting the [sister ship] &quot;Scheer&quot;. But the name of the enemy ship was of course the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;.

From her opening salvo, &quot;Graf Spee&quot;&#x27;s gunfire proved fairly accurate, her third salvo straddling &quot;Exeter&quot;. At 06:23, a shell burst just short of &quot;Exeter&quot;, abreast the ship. Splinters from the shell killed the torpedo tubes&#x27; crews, damaged the ship&#x27;s communications, riddled the ship&#x27;s funnels and searchlights and wrecked the ship&#x27;s Walrus aircraft just as it was about to be launched for gunnery spotting. Three minutes later, &quot;Exeter&quot; suffered a direct hit on her &quot;B&quot; turret, putting it and its two guns out of action. Shrapnel swept the bridge, killing or wounding all bridge personnel except the captain and two others. Captain Bell&#x27;s communications were wrecked. Communications from the aft conning position were also destroyed. The ship had to be steered via a chain of messengers for the rest of the battle.
Meanwhile, &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; closed to and started making in front of &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, causing her to split her main armament at 06:30 and otherwise use her guns against them. Shortly after, &quot;Exeter&quot; fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes but both missed. At 06:37, &quot;Ajax&quot; launched her Fairey Seafox spotter floatplane from her catapult. At 06:38, &quot;Exeter&quot; turned so that she could fire her port torpedoes and received two more direct hits from shells. One hit &quot;A&quot; turret and put it out of action, the other entered the hull and started fires. &quot;Exeter&quot; was severely damaged, having only &quot;Y&quot; turret still in action under &quot;local&quot; control, with Jennings on the roof shouting instructions to those inside. She also had a 7° list, was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small boat&#x27;s compass. However, &quot;Exeter&quot; dealt the decisive blow; one of her 8-inch shells had penetrated two decks before exploding in &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s funnel area, destroyed her raw fuel processing system and left her with just 16 hours fuel, insufficient to allow her to return home.

At this point, nearly one hour after the battle had started, &quot;Graf Spee&quot; was doomed since she could not make fuel system repairs of that complexity under fire. Two thirds of her anti-aircraft guns were knocked out, as well as one of her secondary turrets. There were no friendly naval bases within reach or reinforcements available. She was not seaworthy and could make only the neutral port of Montevideo.
&quot;Graf Spee&quot; hauled round from an easterly course, now behind &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;, towards the north-west and laid smoke. That course brought Langsdorff roughly parallel to &quot;Exeter&quot;. By 06:50, &quot;Exeter&quot; listed heavily to starboard and took water forward. Nevertheless, she still steamed at full speed and fired with her one remaining turret. Forty minutes later, water splashed in by a near miss short-circuited her electrical system for that turret. Captain Bell was forced to break off the action. That would have been the opportunity to finish off &quot;Exeter&quot;. Instead, the combined fire of &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; drew Langsdorff&#x27;s attention as both ships closed the German ship.

Twenty minutes later, &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear, causing &quot;Graf Spee&quot; to turn away and lay a smoke screen. At 07:10, the two light cruisers turned to reduce the range from even though that meant that only their forward guns could fire. At 07:16, &quot;Graf Spee&quot; turned to port and headed straight for the badly-damaged &quot;Exeter&quot;, but fire from &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; forced her at 07:20 to turn and fire her guns at them, while they turned to starboard to bring all their guns to bear. &quot;Ajax&quot; turned to starboard at 07:24 and fired her torpedoes at a range of , causing &quot;Graf Spee&quot; to turn away under a smoke screen. At 07:25, &quot;Ajax&quot; was hit by a shell that put &quot;X&quot; turret out of action and jammed &quot;Y&quot; turret, causing some casualties. By 07:40, &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; were running low on resources, and the British decided to change tactics and move to the east under a smokescreen. Harwood decided to shadow &quot;Graf Spee&quot; and try to attack at night, when he could attack with torpedoes, better use his advantages of speed and manoeuvrability and minimise his deficiencies in armour. &quot;Ajax&quot; was again hit by a shell that destroyed her mast and caused more casualties. &quot;Graf Spee&quot; continued to the south-west.

=== Pursuit ===

The battle now turned into a pursuit. Captain Parry of &quot;Achilles&quot; wrote afterwards: &quot;To this day I do not know why the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; did not dispose of us in the &quot;Ajax&quot; and the &quot;Achilles&quot; as soon as she had finished with the &quot;Exeter&quot;&quot;. The British and New Zealand cruisers split up, keeping about from &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. &quot;Ajax&quot; kept to the German&#x27;s port and &quot;Achilles&quot; to the starboard. At 09:15, &quot;Ajax&quot; recovered her aircraft. At 09:46, Harwood signalled to &quot;Cumberland&quot; for reinforcement and the Admiralty also ordered ships within to proceed to the River Plate. 

At 10:05, &quot;Achilles&quot; had overestimated &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s speed and came into range of the German guns. &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; turned and fired two three-gun salvoes with her fore guns. &quot;Achilles&quot; turned away under a smokescreen.

According to Pope, a merchant ship was sighted at 11:03 close to &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. After a few minutes, &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; called &quot;Ajax&quot; on W/T, probably on the international watchkeeping frequency of 500 kHz, and used both ships&#x27; pre-war call signs, with the signal: &quot;please pick up lifeboats of English steamer&quot;. The German call sign was DTGS, confirming to Harwood that the pocket-battleship he had engaged was indeed &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. &quot;Ajax&quot; did not reply, but a little later, the British flagship closed with SS &quot;Shakespeare&quot; with her lifeboats still hoisted and men still on board. &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; had fired a gun and ordered them to stop but when they did not obey orders to leave the ship, Langsdorff decided to continue on his way, and &quot;Shakespeare&quot; had a lucky escape. The shadowing continued for the rest of the day until 19:15, when &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; turned and opened fire on &quot;Ajax&quot;, which turned away under a smokescreen.

It was now clear that &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was entering the River Plate estuary. Since the estuary had sandbanks, Harwood ordered &quot;Achilles&quot; to shadow &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; while &quot;Ajax&quot; would cover any attempt to double back through a different channel. The sun set at 20:48, with &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; silhouetted against the sun. &quot;Achilles&quot; had again closed the range and &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; opened fire, forcing &quot;Achilles&quot; to turn away. During the battle, a total of 108 men had been killed on both sides, including 36 on &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;.

&quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; entered Montevideo in neutral Uruguay and dropped anchor at about 00:10 on 14 December. That was a political error since Uruguay, while neutral, had benefited from significant British influence during its development and favoured the Allies. The British Hospital, for example, where the wounded from the battle were taken, was the leading hospital in the city. The port of Mar del Plata on the Argentine coast and south of Montevideo would have been a better choice for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. Also, had &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; left port at the time, she would have encountered no British warships in the area except for the damaged &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;.

=== Trap of Montevideo ===
In Montevideo, the 13th Hague Convention came into play. Under Article 12, &quot;belligerent war-ships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four hours&quot;. Under Article 14, a &quot;belligerent war-ship may not prolong its stay in a neutral port beyond the permissible time except on account of damage&quot;. British diplomats duly pressed for the speedy departure of the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;. Also relevant was Article 16 of which part reads, &quot;A belligerent war-ship may not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the flag of its adversary&quot;.

In accordance with their obligations, the Germans released 61 captive British merchant seamen who had been on board. Langsdorff then asked the Uruguayan government for two weeks to make repairs. Initially, the British diplomats in Uruguay, principally Eugen Millington-Drake, made several requests for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; to leave port immediately. After consultation with London, which was aware that there were no significant British naval forces in the area, Millington-Drake continued to demand for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; to leave. At the same time, he arranged for British and French merchant ships to steam from Montevideo at intervals of 24 hours, whether they had originally intended to do so or not, thus invoking Article 16. That kept &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; in port and allowed more time for British forces to reach the area.

At the same time, the British attempted to feed false intelligence to the Germans that an overwhelming British force was being assembled, including Force H (the aircraft carrier and the battlecruiser ) by broadcasting a series of signals, on frequencies known to be intercepted by German intelligence. In fact, the two cruisers had been joined only by &quot;Cumberland&quot;, which had arrived at 22:00 on 14 December, after steaming from the Falkland Islands in 34 hours, at an average of over 90% of her full trials speed attained over much shorter distances. The older and larger &quot;Cumberland&quot; was more powerful than &quot;Exeter&quot;, with an additional aft turret containing two more 8-inch guns, but it was no match for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; whose guns had significantly longer range and fired much heavier shells (660 lb against 256 lb). Overwhelming British forces (HMS &quot;Renown&quot;, &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, , , and ) were &quot;en route&quot; but would not assemble until 19 December although they could intercept earlier if &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; headed north or north-east from Montevideo shadowed by &quot;Cumberland&quot; and her smaller consorts. For the time being, the total force comprised the undamaged &quot;Cumberland&quot; with a full ammunition load, and the damaged &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; with depleted stocks of shells. To reinforce the propaganda effect, these ships, which were waiting just outside the three-mile limit, were ordered to make smoke, which could be clearly seen from the Montevideo waterfront.

On 15 December 1939, &quot;Olynthus&quot; refuelled &quot;Ajax&quot;, which proved a difficult operation. The ship had to use hurricane hawsers to complete the replenishment. On 17 December &quot;Achilles&quot; was replenished from &quot;Olynthus&quot; off Rouen Bank.

The Germans were entirely deceived and expected to face a far superior force on leaving the River Plate. &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; had also used two thirds of her ammunition and had enough left for approximately only a further 20 minutes of firing. Such a reduced ammunition stock was hardly sufficient for the ship to fight her way out of Montevideo against the large force expected, let alone get back to Germany. Even the only actual British newcomer, the previously-unengaged &quot;Cumberland&quot;, could fight at full capacity for about 90 minutes and pursue at equal or higher speed for at least another before she required replenishment at sea.

Meanwhile, as the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; remained in the bay, British diplomatic personnel based in Montevideo and Buenos Aires carefully watched her from shore 24 hours a day, and the expectation of a potential breakout and resumption of the battle caused tensions and anxiety to surge to enormous levels among British sailors and diplomats.

On the German side, while the ship was prevented from leaving the harbour, Captain Langsdorff consulted with his command in Germany. He received orders that permitted some options but not internment in Uruguay. The Germans feared that Uruguay could be persuaded to join the Allied cause. Ultimately, he chose to scuttle his ship in the River Plate estuary on 17 December to avoid unnecessary loss of life for no particular military advantage, a decision that infuriated Adolf Hitler.

The crew of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; were taken to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Captain Langsdorff shot himself on 19 December. He was buried there with full military honours, and several British officers attended. Many of the crew members made their homes in Montevideo with the help of local people of German origin. The German dead were buried in the Cementerio del Norte, Montevideo.

== Aftermath ==

The German propaganda machine had reported that &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; had sunk a heavy cruiser and heavily damaged two light cruisers and had been only lightly damaged herself. The scuttling of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, however, was a severe embarrassment and difficult to explain on the basis of publicly-available facts. The battle was a major victory for the British, as the damage to &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; was not sufficient to reduce their fighting efficiency, and &quot;Exeter&quot;, as badly damaged as she was, had managed to reach the Falkland Islands for emergency repairs. 

Lieutenant Atwill, who wrote an account of the battle in which he served on &quot;Exeter&quot;, detailed the damage done and the emergency repairs to make the ship seaworthy enough to reach Stanley, Falkland Islands. There were rumours that she would remain there and become a rusting hulk until the end of the war, but First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill wrote to the First Sea Lord and others, &quot;We ought not readily to accept the non-repair during the war of &quot;Exeter&quot;. She should be strengthened and strutted internally as far as possible . . . and come home&quot;. &quot;Exeter&quot; returned to Devonport for a 13-month refit, enhancing Churchill&#x27;s reputation.

While highly praised for his excellent performance in battle, Harwood received criticism directed towards his lack of initiative and for not employing a more aggressive approach; those criticisms are mostly due to &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; being allowed to escape though outnumbered by ships able jointly to make a more damaging rate of fire.

Prisoners taken from merchant ships by &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; who had been transferred to her supply ship &quot;Altmark&quot; were freed by a boarding party from the British destroyer in the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident (16 February 1940) in Jøssingfjord, at the time neutral Norwegian waters. Prisoners who had not been transferred to &quot;Altmark&quot; had remained aboard &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; during the battle; they were released on arrival in Montevideo.

On 22 December 1939, over 1,000 sailors from &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; were taken to Buenos Aires and interned there; at least 92 were transferred during 1940 to a camp in Rosario, some were transferred to Club Hotel de la Ventana in Buenos Aires Province and another group to Villa General Belgrano, a small town founded by German immigrants in 1932. Some of these sailors later settled there. After the war many German sailors settled permanently in various parts of Uruguay, some returning after being repatriated to Germany. Rows of simple crosses in the Cementerio del Norte, in the north of the city of Montevideo, mark the burial places of the German dead. Three sailors killed aboard &quot;Achilles&quot; were buried in the British Cemetery in Montevideo, while those who died on &quot;Exeter&quot; were buried at sea.

=== Intelligence gathering and salvage ===

Immediately after her scuttling, the wreck of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; rested in shallow water, with much of the ship&#x27;s superstructure remaining above water level, but over the years, the wreck has subsided into the muddy bottom, and only the tip of the mast remains above the surface.

A radar expert was sent to Montevideo shortly after the scuttling and reported a rotating aerial, probably for gunlaying, transmitting on either 57 or 114 centimetres. In February 1940, the wreck was boarded by United States Navy sailors from the light cruiser .

Pieces and parts of the ship have also been displayed in museums and studied by scientists who have carried out tests like metallurgical analyses of the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;.

In 1964 a memorial to the ship was erected in Montevideo&#x27;s port. Part of it is &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s anchor.

In 1997, one of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s secondary gun mounts was raised and restored; it can now be seen outside Montevideo&#x27;s National Maritime Museum.

In February 2004, a salvage team began work raising the wreck. The operation is being funded in part by the government of Uruguay, in part by the private sector, as the wreck is now a hazard to navigation. The first major section, the heavy gunnery control station, was raised on 25 February 2004. It is expected to take several years to raise the entire wreck. James Cameron filmed the salvage operation. After she has been raised, it is planned that the ship might be restored and put on display at the National Marine Museum.

Many German veterans did not approve of the restoration attempt, as they considered the wreck to be a war grave and an underwater historical monument that should be respected. One of them, Hans Eupel, a former specialist torpedo mechanic, 87 years old in 2005, said that &quot;this is madness, too expensive and senseless. It is also dangerous, as one of the three explosive charges we placed did not explode&quot;.
On 10 February 2006, the , 400 kg eagle and swastika crest of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was recovered from the stern of the ship. The spread-wing statue of a Nazi eagle with a wreath in its talons containing a swastika was attached to the stern, not the bow like traditional figureheads. It was a common feature of prewar German warships. In other cases, it was removed for a variety of practical reasons on the outbreak of the war, but because &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was already at sea when the war began, she went into action and was scuttled with it attached, which permitted its recovery. To protect the feelings of those with painful memories of Nazi Germany, the swastika at the base of the figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water. The figurehead was stored in a Uruguayan naval warehouse after German complaints about exhibiting &quot;Nazi paraphernalia&quot;.
== Legacy ==

In 1956, the film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (US title: &quot;Pursuit of the Graf Spee&quot;) was made of the battle and &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s end, with Peter Finch as Langsdorff and Anthony Quayle as Harwood. Finch portrays Langsdorff sympathetically as a gentleman. The &quot;Achilles&quot;, which had been recommissioned in 1948 as HMIS &quot;Delhi&quot;, flagship of the Royal Indian Navy, played herself in the film. HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; (twin turrets) was &quot;played&quot; by HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; (triple turrets), HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; (twin turrets) by HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; (triple turrets) and HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; by herself (although de-gunned as a trials platform). &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; (two turrets) was portrayed by the U.S. heavy cruiser (three turrets).

The incomplete Battle-class destroyer HMS &quot;River Plate&quot; was named after the battle.

The battle was for many years re-enacted with large-scale model boats throughout the summer season at Peasholm Park in the English seaside resort of Scarborough. The re-enactment now portrays an anonymous battle between a convoy of British ships and an unspecified enemy in possession of the nearby shore.

After the battle, the new town of Ajax, Ontario, in Canada, constructed as a Second World War munitions production centre, was named after HMS &quot;Ajax&quot;. Many of its streets are named after Admiral Harwood&#x27;s crewmen on &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Exeter&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;. Its main street is named after Admiral Harwood, while a small street was named (after some controversy) for Captain Langsdorff. According to an article in the German language paper &quot;Albertaner&quot; on 6 October 2007, Steve Parish, the mayor of Ajax, defended the decision, declaring that Langsdorff had not been a typical Nazi officer. An accompanying photograph (in the &quot;Aftermath&quot; section above) from the funeral of crew members shows Langsdorff paying tribute with a traditional naval salute, while people beside and behind himeven some clergymenare giving the Fascist salute. The street name was changed in 2021 in response to public opposition.

Also in Canada, the names of the ships, and the commander of Force G, have been used for Cadet Corps. The Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps (RCSCC) Ajax No. 89 in Guelph, Ontario; the Navy League Cadet Corps (NLCC) Achilles No. 34 in Guelph, Ontario; the Navy League Wrenette Corps (NLWC) Lady Exeter (now disbanded) and the camp shared by all three corps, called Camp Cumberland (this camp no longer exists; it was decommissioned around 1999). RCSCC Harwood No. 244 and NLCC Exeter No. 173 are situated in Ajax, Ontario.

A number of streets in Nelson Bay, New South Wales, have been named after the battle including Montevideo Parade, Achilles Street, Ajax Avenue, Harwood Avenue, and Exeter Road (now called Shoal Bay Road). In Auckland, home port of the Royal New Zealand Navy, streets have been named for &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot;. Three streets in North Wollongong, New South Wales, are named Ajax Avenue, Exeter Avenue and Achilles Avenue.

The battle is also significant as it was the first time the Flag of New Zealand was flown in battle, from HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;. Also in New Zealand, four mountain peaks in the Two Thumb Range region of the South Island are named in commemoration of the battle. These are Achilles (2,544 m), Exeter (2,327 m), Ajax (2,319 m) and Graf Spee (2,267 m).

<text>Trillium (trillium, wakerobin, toadshade, tri flower, birthroot, birthwort, and sometimes &quot;wood lily&quot;) is a genus of about fifty flowering plant species in the family Melanthiaceae. &quot;Trillium&quot; species are native to temperate regions of North America and Asia, with the greatest diversity of species found in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the southeastern United States.

==Description==

Plants of this genus are perennial herbs growing from rhizomes. There are three large leaf-like bracts arranged in a whorl about a scape that rises directly from the rhizome. There are no true aboveground leaves but sometimes there are scale-like leaves on the underground rhizome. The bracts are photosynthetic and are sometimes called leaves. The inflorescence is a single flower with three green or reddish sepals and three petals in shades of red, purple, pink, white, yellow, or green. At the center of the flower there are six stamens and three stigmas borne on a very short style, if any. The fruit is fleshy and capsule-like or berrylike. The seeds have large, oily elaiosomes.

Occasionally individuals have four-fold symmetry, with four bracts (leaves), four sepals, and four petals in the blossom.. The tetramerous condition has been described for several species of &quot;Trillium&quot; including &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot;, &quot;T. erectum&quot;, &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;T. maculatum&quot;, &quot;T. sessile&quot;, and &quot;T. undulatum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

In 1753, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus established the genus &quot;Trillium&quot; by recognizing three species, &quot;Trillium cernuum&quot;, &quot;Trillium erectum&quot;, and &quot;Trillium sessile&quot;. The type specimen &quot;Trillium cernuum&quot; described by Linnaeus was actually &quot;Trillium catesbaei&quot;, an oversight that subsequently led to much confusion regarding the type species of this genus.

Initially the &quot;Trillium&quot; genus was placed in the family Liliaceae. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it was sometimes placed in a smaller family, Trilliaceae. By 1981 Liliaceae had grown to about 280 genera and 4,000 species. As it became clearer that the very large version of Liliaceae was polyphyletic, some botanists preferred to place &quot;Trillium&quot; and related genera into that separate family. Others defined a larger family, Melanthiaceae, for a similar purpose, but included several other genera not historically recognized as close relatives of &quot;Trillium&quot;. This latter approach was followed in 1998 by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, which assigned the genus &quot;Trillium&quot;, along with its close relative &quot;Paris&quot;, to the family Melanthiaceae. 
However, other taxonomists have since preferred to break up the heterogenous Melanthiaceae into several smaller monophyletic families, each with more coherent morphological features, returning &quot;Trillium&quot; to a resurrected Trilliaceae.

In 1850, German botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth segregated &quot;Trillium govanianum&quot; into genus &quot;Trillidium&quot;. Some authorities consider &quot;Trillidium&quot; to be a synonym for &quot;Trillium&quot; , while others recognize the taxon &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot; based on morphological differences (with other &quot;Trillium&quot; species) and molecular evidence. Still others support the segregation of &quot;Trillium undulatum&quot; into genus &quot;Trillidium&quot; alongside &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot;.

==Subdivisions==
All names used in this section are taken from the International Plant Names Index. , Plants of the World Online (POWO) accepts 49 species and 5 named hybrids, all of which are listed below. The geographical locations are taken from POWO and the Flora of North America, except where noted.

The &quot;Trillium&quot; genus has traditionally been divided into two subgenera, &quot;Trillium&quot; subgenus &quot;Trillium&quot; and &quot;Trillium&quot; subgenus &quot;Phyllantherum&quot;, based on whether the flower is pedicellate or sessile. At the time, the former subgenus was considered to be the more primitive group. Based on molecular systematics, &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Phyllantherum&quot; has been shown to be a monophyletic group, but its segregation renders the remaining &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Trillium&quot; paraphyletic.

&quot;Trillium&quot; subgenus &quot;Phyllantherum&quot; was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1820, but since he did not provide a description, the name was declared invalid in 2014. At that time, the correct name was thought to be &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Sessilium&quot;, which was described by Rafinesque in 1830. However, that name was later found to be incorrect as well. , the correct name of the subgenus is &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Sessilia&quot; Its type species is &quot;Trillium sessile&quot; 

In 1819, Rafinesque described and named the genus &quot;Delostylis&quot;, and then placed &quot;Trillium stylosum&quot; (now a synonym for &quot;Trillium catesbaei&quot; ) into the new genus. Reversing himself a decade later, Rafinesque instead placed &quot;Trillium stylosum&quot; into a new subgenus &quot;Delostylium&quot; in 1830. Presumably Rafinesque had intended the subgeneric name to replace the earlier generic name, and so the correct name of the former is &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Delostylis&quot; . Its type species is &quot;Trillium catesbaei&quot;. Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Catesbaei group. The word &quot;Delostylis&quot; means &quot;with a small but conspicuous style&quot;.

Based on morphology and molecular evidence, a few taxa in genus &quot;Trillium&quot; have been segregated into other genera:

* &quot;Trillium rivale&quot;, first described in 1885, was segregated into genus &quot;Pseudotrillium&quot; in 2002. The name &quot;Pseudotrillium rivale&quot; is widely recognized.
* &quot;Trillium govanianum&quot;, first described in 1839, was segregated into genus &quot;Trillidium&quot; in 1850. However, the name &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot; is not widely recognized.
* &quot;Trillium undulatum&quot;, first described in 1801, was segregated into genus &quot;Trillidium&quot; in 2018, but the name &quot;Trillidium undulatum&quot; is controversial and not widely recognized.

Phylogenetic analysis places &quot;Trillidium govanianum&quot; and &quot;Trillidium undulatum&quot; together in a clade with high support. However, since &quot;Trillium&quot; and &quot;Trillidium&quot; are both individually and collectively monophyletic, it is a matter of choice whether or not to recognize genus &quot;Trillidium&quot;.

Excluding the segregate taxa listed above, the remaining taxa separate into four clades with the following names:

# &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Trillium&quot;
# &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Callipetalon&quot; 
# &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Delostylis&quot; [as Delostylium]
# &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Sessilia&quot; [as Sessilium]

Traditionally, &quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Trillium&quot; has included all pedicellate-flowered species (which is a paraphyletic group), but in 2022, the subgenus was circumscribed as a clade of fourteen (14) species. Its type species is &quot;Trillium erectum&quot; Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Erectum group.

&quot;Trillium&quot; subgen. &quot;Callipetalon&quot; was described by Jayne A. Lampley and Edward E. Schilling in 2022. The word &quot;Callipetalon&quot; means &quot;beautiful petal&quot;, a reference to &quot;the famously beautiful flowers&quot; of its type species, &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; Historically, the subgenus has been known as the Grandiflorum group.

This leads to a four-part concept of &quot;Trillium&quot; that sharply contrasts with the traditional pedicellate vs. sessile dichotomy outlined previously.

===Ungrouped taxa===

The following pair of taxa do not fit into any of the above groups since they are markedly different from other &quot;Trillium&quot; species. There is evidence to support the segregation of these species into a separate genus (&quot;Trillidium&quot;) but the proposal is controversial.
* &quot;Trillium govanianum&quot; – NE Afghanistan, Bhutan, China (Tibet Autonomous Region, Yunnan), N + NE India (Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Uttarakhand), Nepal, N Pakistan
* &quot;Trillium undulatum&quot; – New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec; Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia
===Other taxa===

, Plants of the World Online does not accept these taxa:

* &quot;Trillium tennesseense&quot; is considered by some authorities to be a synonym for &quot;Trillium lancifolium&quot; 
* &quot;Trillium parviflorum&quot; is an accepted name by some authorities while others regard this name as a synonym of &quot;T. albidum&quot; subsp. &quot;parviflorum&quot; .

The following taxa are of historical interest:

* &quot;Trillium rivale&quot; has been segregated to a monotypic genus as &quot;Pseudotrillium rivale&quot; .
* &quot;Trillium&quot; × &quot;crockerianum&quot; was originally described as a hybrid with parents &quot;Trillium ovatum&quot; and &quot;Trillium rivale&quot;, but since the latter is now a member of genus &quot;Pseudotrillium&quot;, the hybrid has become an undescribed intergeneric hybrid, and therefore its taxonomic placement is uncertain.

==Distribution==

&quot;Trillium&quot; species are native to North America and Asia.

===North America===

More than three dozen &quot;Trillium&quot; species are found in North America, most of which are native to eastern North America. Just six species are native to western North America: &quot;T. albidum&quot;, &quot;T. angustipetalum&quot;, &quot;T. chloropetalum&quot;, &quot;T. kurabayashii&quot;, &quot;T. ovatum&quot;, and &quot;T. petiolatum&quot;. Of these, only &quot;T. ovatum&quot; is pedicellate-flowered.

==Identification==

A fully general dichotomous key requires a mature, flowering plant. The first step is to determine whether or not the flower sits on a pedicel, which determines the subgenus. (Any mature plant may be identified to this extent, even if it is not in bloom.) Identification proceeds based on flower parts, leaves, and other characteristics. A combination of characteristics is usually required to identify the plant.

Identification of a non-flowering, non-fruiting plant with bare leaves may be difficult. Although some species of &quot;Trillium&quot; have petioles (leaf stalks) and/or distinctive leaf shapes, these features are seldom sufficient to identify the plant down to the species level.

In eastern North America, jack-in-the-pulpit (&quot;Arisaema triphyllum&quot;) is often mistaken for bare-leaved &quot;Trillium&quot;. Both species are about the same height with trifoliate leaves but the former lacks 3-way rotational symmetry and has leaf veins unlike those of &quot;Trillium&quot;.

==Ecology==

Trilliums are myrmecochorous, that is, ants act as agents of seed dispersal. Each seed of a ripe fruit has a white fleshy appendage called an elaiosome. Ants are attracted to the elaiosome, so much so they often bore holes into the fruit instead of waiting for it to drop off on its own. The ants carry the seeds back to their nest where they eat the elaiosomes and discard the seeds. Here the seeds eventually germinate, an average of about 1 meter away from the parent plant.

For example, the seeds of &quot;Trillium camschatcense&quot; and &quot;T. tschonoskii&quot; are collected by ant species &quot;Aphaenogaster smythiesi&quot; and &quot;Myrmica ruginodis&quot;. Sometimes beetles interfere with the dispersal process by eating the elaiosomes, which makes the seeds less attractive to ants.

Yellow jackets (&quot;Vespula&quot; spp.) and other wasps are similarly attracted to elaiosomes. The wasps carry off the seeds and feed on the elaiosomes an average of about 1.4 meters away from the parent plant. Yellow jackets are documented seed dispersers for at least three species of &quot;Trillium&quot; (&quot;T. catesbaei&quot;, &quot;T. cuneatum&quot;, &quot;T. undulatum&quot;).

The seeds of some &quot;Trillium&quot; species are more attractive to ants than others. Widely distributed species (e.g., &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;Trillium catesbaei&quot;, and &quot;Trillium cuneatum&quot;) are more attractive to ants than narrowly endemic species (e.g., &quot;Trillium lancifolium&quot;, &quot;Trillium discolor&quot;, and &quot;Trillium decumbens&quot;).

===Hybrids===
, Plants of the World Online recognizes five named hybrids, four in Asia and one in North America. Three of the Asian hybrids, , , and , are well studied, but little is known about the Asian hybrid . One of its parents is &quot;T. camschatcense&quot; but the other parent is unknown.

The only named hybrid in North America is whose type specimen was collected in Del Norte County, California. As originally described, its parents are &quot;Trillium ovatum&quot; and &quot;Trillium rivale&quot;, but the latter species is now a member of genus &quot;Pseudotrillium&quot;, and so has become an intergeneric hybrid.

In 1982, Haga and Channell crossed the Asiatic species &quot;Trillium camschatcense&quot; with several North American species. Of those, the crosses with &quot;T. erectum&quot;, &quot;T. flexipes&quot;, and &quot;T. vaseyi&quot; produced solid, seemingly viable seed. Seeds of the cross between &quot;T. camschatcense&quot; and &quot;T. erectum&quot; flowered in 9 to 10 years.

===Disease===

Various &quot;Trillium&quot; species are susceptible to a greening disorder caused by bacterial organisms called phytoplasmas that alter the morphology of infected plants. Symptoms of phytoplasma infection include abnormal green markings on the petals (floral virescence), extra leaves (phyllody), and other abnormal characteristics. Infected populations occur throughout the species range but are prevalent in Ontario, Michigan, and New York.

For many years, this condition was thought to originate from mutation, and so many of these forms were given taxonomic names now known to be invalid. In 1971, Hooper, Case, and Meyers used electron microscopy to detect the presence of mycoplasma-like organisms (i.e., phytoplasmas) in &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; with virescent petals. The means of transmission was not established but leafhoppers were suspected. , the insect vector for &quot;Trillium&quot; greening disorder is unknown.

Phytoplasmas were positively identified in &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot; and &quot;T. erectum&quot; in Ontario in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis supported the grouping of the phytoplasmas isolated from infected plants as a related strain of &#x27;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Phytoplasma pruni&#x27; (subgroup 16SrIII-F) with 99% sequence identity. This subgroup of phytoplasmas is associated with various other diseases, including milkweed yellows, &quot;Vaccinium&quot; witches&#x27; broom, and potato purple top.

==Conservation==
Picking parts off a trillium plant can kill it even if the rhizome is left undisturbed. Some species of trillium are listed as threatened or endangered and collecting these species may be illegal. Laws in some jurisdictions may restrict the commercial exploitation of trilliums and prohibit collection without the landowner&#x27;s permission. In the US states of Michigan and Minnesota it is illegal to pick trilliums. In New York it is illegal to pick the red trillium.

In 2009, the Ontario Trillium Protection Act, a Private Members Bill, was proposed in the Ontario legislature that would have made it illegal to in any way injure the common &quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot; (white trillium) in the province (with some exceptions), however the bill was never passed. The rare &quot;Trillium flexipes&quot; (drooping trillium) is also protected by law in Ontario, because of its decreasing Canadian population.

High white-tailed deer population density has been shown to decrease or eliminate trillium in an area, particularly white trillium. As such height of trillium can be used as an indicator for white-tailed deer population density within forested and urban areas to help forest regeneration.

Some species are harvested from the wild to an unsustainable degree. This is particularly dire in the case of &quot;T. govanianum&quot;, whose high selling price as a folk medicine has motivated harvesters to destroy swathes of ecologically sensitive Himalayan forests, causing mudslides.

==Medicinal uses==

Several species contain sapogenins. They have been used traditionally as uterine stimulants, the inspiration for the common name birthwort. In a 1918 publication, Joseph E. Meyer called it &quot;beth root&quot;, probably a corruption of &quot;birthroot&quot;. He claimed that an astringent tonic derived from the root was useful in controlling bleeding and diarrhea.

==Culture==

The white trillium (&quot;Trillium grandiflorum&quot;) serves as the official flower and emblem of the Canadian province of Ontario. It is an official symbol of the Government of Ontario. The large white trillium is the official wildflower of Ohio. In light of their shared connection to the flower, the Major League Soccer teams in Toronto and Columbus compete with each other for the Trillium Cup.

Citizen scientists regularly report observations of &quot;Trillium&quot; species from around the world. &quot;T. grandiflorum&quot;, &quot;T. erectum&quot;, and &quot;T. ovatum&quot; (in that order) are the most often observed &quot;Trillium&quot; species.

&quot;Trillium&quot; is the literary magazine of Ramapo College of New Jersey, which features poetry, fiction, photography, and other visual arts created by Ramapo students.

In the 1990s, the activist Michael Page established the use of the trillium as a symbol of bisexuality, and in 2001, Francisco Javier Lagunes Gaitán and Miguel Angel Corona designed a Mexican variant of the bisexual pride flag, which is emblazoned with an emblem of a trillium.

<doc id="31572" wikidata="Q7764218" url="?curid=31572" title="The Silent Gondoliers">
<text>The Silent Gondoliers () is a 1983 novel by William Goldman, written under the pseudonym of &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot;. The novel purports to explain why the gondoliers of Venice no longer sing, through the story of the protagonist Luigi. Chapters I and II build up further mythology behind the name Morgenstern and the backstory of Gondolierian history, and the tale of Luigi actually starts in Chapter III. 

It was released in hardcover in 1983, and a trade paperback version came out from Del Rey in 2001. Paul Giovanopoulos provided 20 pen-and-ink illustrations for the story.

== Author ==
Goldman also uses the pseudonym &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot; in his better-known novel, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. However, in this tale, he writes as if he remembers spending Christmas in Venice, with the echo of singing gondoliers, once as a child and again with his wife and daughters. The story haunts him and he begins to research. This leads him into the trail of why gondoliers can no longer sing well, contrary to the belief that &quot;gondoliers are the greatest singers of the world&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
Luigi is an aspiring gondolier in Venice. Though he is a talented boatman, he is a terrible singer, and people get stomach cramps and migraines just listening to him. As gondoliers have a reputation as the best singers in the world, and customers expect it as part of the service, a tone-deaf gondolier is unacceptable, no matter how skilled he is with his oar..
As the story unfolds, his fiancee Laura Lorenzini breaks off her engagement, and marries a &#x27;better suitor&#x27;. Though he is an awful singer, Luigi&#x27;s friends are fond of him and his affable nature. It is agreed that although he cannot be a gondolier, he can work in the Tavern, the Gondoliers&#x27; exclusive haunt. But over time he becomes dissatisfied.

Luigi disappears for many years, and is turned away from various singing teachers. Finally Piccoli agrees to teach him, although unbeknown to Luigi, Piccoli has not taught in many years and is deaf. Luigi eventually returns to Venice and sings, but his singing is even worse because it has become more powerful. When a &#x27;killer storm&#x27; approaches, everyone is in danger. When the Church of Souls of Those Who Died for the Sea, the most sacred building to the Gondoliers, is struck by lightning, even the most skilled gondoliers in Venice are too overcome with fear to go out and call for the Great Fireboat of Venice to save their church from fire.

Finally, Luigi manages to reach the Great Fireboat of Venice, which sets out to save the church. The other gondoliers notice that Luigi did not return with the fireboat, and discover him sailing on the turbulent waters of the Grand Canal. Covered by the noise of the storm, Luigi is finally able to realize his dream of singing on the Grand Canal, singing songs from Bellini and all the solos he knows. All the gondoliers witness this and they talk about it all night.

After the storm, the Queen of Corsica visits. She requests a gondolier to sing for her on her royal boat. One gondolier starts to sing &quot;’O sole mio&quot;, but sings terribly to the queen&#x27;s disgust. It is discovered that all gondoliers have started to sing terribly from that moment on, and so no-one asks them to sing anymore.

Luigi is reinstated as a gondolier, without the requirement to sing. After a long career and happy life, as with all gondoliers when they die, Luigi is set in his black boat and pushed out into the Adriatic Sea.

==Background==
Goldman says he got the idea to write the book when visiting Venice with his then-wife:
We were on one of the water buses, Vaporettos, and a bunch of gondoliers came rowing down the canal and they were quiet. I suddenly turned to [my wife] Ilene and I said, &#x27;I know why the gondoliers don&#x27;t sing&#x27; and we got off the bus immediately and I went running back to the hotel. I wrote the story down in about five minutes on a piece of paper.
Goldman says this was one of the few times that a novel had popped into his head &quot;fully formed&quot;, the other being &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot;.

<text>Timothy James Curry (born 19 April 1946) is an English actor and singer. He rose to prominence as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the musical film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), reprising the role he had originated in the 1973 London, 1974 Los Angeles, and 1975 Broadway musical stage productions of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

As a singer, Curry has released three rock-focused studio albums: &quot;Read My Lips&quot; (1978), &quot;Fearless&quot; (1979), and &quot;Simplicity&quot; (1981).

==Early life==
Timothy James Curry was born on 19 April 1946 in Grappenhall, Cheshire, the son of school secretary Patricia and Royal Navy chaplain James Curry. His father died of pneumonia in 1958, when Curry was 12 years old. His elder sister, Judith, was a concert pianist who died of a brain tumour in 2001. Curry spent most of his childhood in Plymouth. After his father&#x27;s death, Curry and his family moved to South London, where he attended boarding school before attending Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset. Curry developed into a talented boy soprano (treble). Deciding to concentrate on acting, he graduated from the University of Birmingham with a combined BA in English and drama in 1968.

==Career==
===Acting===
====&quot;Rocky Horror&quot;====
Curry&#x27;s first full-time role was as part of the original London cast of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; in 1968, where he met Richard O&#x27;Brien, who went on to write Curry&#x27;s role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; (1973). Curry recalled his first encounter with the project:
Originally, Curry rehearsed the character with a German accent and peroxide blond hair, and later, with an American accent. In March 2005, in an interview with Terry Gross of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air,&quot; he explained that he decided to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter with an English accent after listening to an English woman say, &quot;Do you have a house in town or a house in the country,&quot; and decided, &quot;Yes, [Dr. Frank-N-Furter] should sound like the Queen.&quot;

Curry originally thought the character was merely a laboratory doctor dressed in a white lab coat. However, at the suggestion of director Sharman, the character evolved into the diabolical mad scientist and transvestite with an upper-class Belgravia accent. An immediate hit, a reviewer at the premiere in London in June 1973 wrote Curry gives a &quot;garishly Bowiesque performance as the ambisextrous doctor.&quot; This change carried over to the 1975 film adaptation, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, which made Curry a household name and gave him a cult following. Curry continued to play the character in London, Los Angeles, and New York City until 1975.

In an interview with NPR, Curry called &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; a &quot;rite of passage&quot;, and added that the film is &quot;a guaranteed weekend party to which you can go with or without a date and probably find one if you don&#x27;t have one, and it&#x27;s also a chance for people to try on a few roles for size, you know? Figure out, help them maybe figure out their own sexuality&quot;.

In 2016, Curry played The Criminologist in the television film remake of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;.

====Theatre====

Shortly after the end of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;″s run on Broadway, Curry returned to the stage with Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Travesties&quot;, which ran in London and New York from 1975 to 1976. &quot;Travesties&quot; was a Broadway hit. It won two Tony Awards (Best Performance by an Actor for John Wood and Best Comedy), as well as the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (Best Play), and Curry&#x27;s performance as the famous dadaist Tristan Tzara received good reviews.

In 1980, Curry formed part of the original cast in the Broadway show &quot;Amadeus&quot;, playing the title character, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Curry was nominated for his first Tony Award (Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) for this role but lost out to his co-star Ian McKellen, who played Antonio Salieri. In 1982, Curry took the part of the Pirate King in the Drury Lane production of Joe Papp&#x27;s version of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; opposite George Cole and Pamela Stephenson, earning enthusiastic reviews.
In the mid-1980s, Curry performed in &quot;The Rivals&quot; and in several plays with the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain, including &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;Dalliance&quot; and &quot;Love For Love&quot;. From 1987 to 1988, he did the national tour of &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; in the lead role of Bill Snibson, a role originated on Broadway by Robert Lindsay. In 1989, Curry returned once again to the New York stage in &quot;The Art of Success&quot;, and in 1992 played Alan Swann in the Broadway version of &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, earning him his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. In 2001, Curry appeared as Scrooge in a musical version of the Charles Dickens novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; that played at Madison Square Garden.

In 2004, Curry began his role of King Arthur in &quot;Spamalot&quot; in Chicago. Directed by Mike Nichols, written by Monty Python member Eric Idle and based on &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, the show successfully moved to Broadway in February 2005. It sold more than $1 million worth of tickets in its first 24 hours. His performance brought him a third Tony nomination, again for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Curry reprised this role at the Palace Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, where &quot;Spamalot&quot; opened on 16 October 2006. His final performance came on 6 January 2007. Curry was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award, and also won the Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Award (getting 39% of the votes cast by over 12,000 theatregoers) as Best Actor in a Musical.

From May to August 2011, Curry was scheduled to portray the Player in a Trevor Nunn stage production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre and then in London. Curry withdrew from the production on 27 May, citing ill health. From 26 to 29 April 2012, he appeared in Eric Idle&#x27;s play &quot;What About Dick?&quot; at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Curry had originally appeared at a script reading for the play back in 2007 when it was still a work in progress.

Curry&#x27;s career in theatre was honoured on 7 June 2015 at the Actors Fund&#x27;s 19th annual Tony Awards Viewing Party, where he was awarded an Artistic Achievement Award.

====Film====
After &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), Curry began to appear in many films, acting in supporting roles, such as Robert Graves in the British horror film &quot;The Shout&quot; (1978), as Johnny LaGuardia in &quot;Times Square&quot; (1980), as Daniel Francis &quot;Rooster&quot; Hannigan in John Huston&#x27;s 1982 film version of &quot;Annie&quot;, and as Jeremy Hancock in the political film &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Lunch&quot; (1983).

In 1985, Curry starred in the fantasy film &quot;Legend&quot; as The Lord of Darkness. Director Ridley Scott cast Curry in the film after watching him in &quot;Rocky Horror&quot;, thinking he was ideal to play the role of Darkness. It took five and a half hours to apply the makeup needed for Darkness onto Curry and at the end of the day, he would spend an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. The same year, Curry appeared in the comedy mystery film &quot;Clue&quot; as Wadsworth the butler.

After this, Curry began to be cast in more comedy roles throughout the late 1980s and &#x27;90s such as Rev. Ray Porter in &quot;Pass the Ammo&quot;, Dr. Thornton Poole in &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991), Mr. Hector the suspicious Plaza Hotel concierge in &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), Jigsaw in &quot;Loaded Weapon 1&quot; (1993) and as Long John Silver in &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;. Although he featured in mostly comedies throughout the &#x27;90s, Curry did appear in some action films, such as the thriller &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990) as Dr. Yevgeniy Petrov, the 1993 adaptation of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as Cardinal Richelieu, in the superhero film &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994) as Farley Claymore, and as Herkermer Homolka in the action adventure &quot;Congo&quot; (1995). He also starred in the 1998 direct-to-video film &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; playing the role of Gomez Addams.

In the early 2000s, Curry was cast in the film adaptation of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (2000) in the role of Roger Corwin, and in the parody film &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot; (2001) playing Professor Oldman. Curry went on to play Thurman Rice, a supporting role in the biographical film &quot;Kinsey&quot; (2004) and portrayed Alexander Monro in the British black comedy &quot;Burke &amp; Hare&quot; (2010).

In 2024, he had a cameo appearance in the horror film &quot;Stream&quot;, providing the voice of the mask character &quot;Lockwood&quot;.

====Television====
Curry started his career with small roles in television series, such as Eugene in &quot;Napoleon and Love&quot; (1974), and guest roles in &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; including as Glen in Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Schmoedipus&quot; (1974). He played William Shakespeare in the John Mortimer-scripted six part mini-series &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot; (1978). Broadcast on ITV in the UK and distributed internationally by ITC, it traces the bard&#x27;s life from 1590 until his death. Curry had further roles in British television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the lead in Stephen Frears&#x27; 1975 adaptation of &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, playing Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1982), playing aspiring actor-singer Larry Gormley in &quot;Blue Money&quot; (1985), and starring as the Grand Wizard in the children&#x27;s Halloween film &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; (1986).

He appeared in the &quot;Dead Dog Records&quot; storyline of the television series crime drama &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1989), as Winston Newquay and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for portraying all three members of a deranged family in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1993). He also had recurring roles on the short-lived science fiction television series &quot;Earth 2&quot; (1994) and the sitcom &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; (1999–2000). Although Curry has appeared in numerous television series throughout his career, he has only had lead roles in two live-action series: &quot;Over the Top&quot; (1997), a sitcom that he also produced, and the revival series of &quot;Family Affair&quot; (2002–2003). Both were cancelled after one season. He returned to working on British television in the late 2000s, with the miniseries adaptation of &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s The Colour of Magic&quot; (2008), a guest appearance on the long-running &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (2008) and the miniseries &quot;Return to Cranford&quot; (2009). His final episodic television role was in 2010 on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, portraying unsub Billy Flynn in two episodes.

One of Curry&#x27;s best known television roles is as Pennywise the Clown in the horror miniseries &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s It&quot; (1990). Aside from one &quot;Fangoria&quot; interview in 1990, Curry never publicly acknowledged his involvement in &quot;It&quot; until an interview with Moviefone in 2015, where he called the role of Pennywise &quot;a wonderful part&quot;.

====Voice acting====
Curry has appeared in many animated television series and films, starting with the performance of the Serpent &quot;The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible&quot; (1988). Curry won a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance as Captain Hook in the Fox animated series &quot;Peter Pan and the Pirates&quot; (1990–1991). His longest-running animated role was as Nigel Thornberry in &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; (1998–2004), which ran for five seasons on Nickelodeon. Curry became the voice of Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious in &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; upon the death of Ian Abercrombie. Other notable animated television roles include MAL in &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot; (1991–1996), Zimbo in &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; (1994–1997), King Chicken in &quot;Duckman&quot; (1994–1997), Dr. Anton Sevarius in &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (1995–1996), Slagar in &quot;Redwall&quot; (2000–2001), Professor Finbarr Calamitous in &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; (2003–2005), G. Gordon Godfrey in &quot;Young Justice&quot; (2012–2013), and The Sorcerer in &quot;Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja&quot; (2012–2014). Most recently on television, he voiced Auntie Whispers on the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy-winning miniseries &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot; (2014).

Curry has also done voice acting in a number of animated films, most notably &quot;&quot; (1992), Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Pebble and the Penguin&quot; (1995), &quot;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot; (1997) for which he received an Annie Award nomination, &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Witch&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1998), the first Barbie film &quot;Barbie in the Nutcracker&quot; (2001), reprising his role of Nigel Thornberry in &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; (2002) and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; (2003), the English dub of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; (2005) and &quot;&quot; (2006). His video game credits include the titular character in &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; (1993) and &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot; (1999), Tim Schafer&#x27;s &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; (2009), and the first game in the &quot;Dragon Age&quot; series, &quot;Dragon Age: Origins&quot; (2009). Curry&#x27;s performance as Premier Anatoly Cherdenko in live-action cut scenes in &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot; (2008), have gone viral as a meme.

Curry&#x27;s audiobook work includes his Grammy-nominated narraton of Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, Geraldine McCaughrean&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan in Scarlet&quot;, Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and the &quot;Abhorsen&quot; trilogy. Curry has done voice over for various advertisements for products and companies such as Smirnoff, Cravendale and Paramount Network.

===Music===
Aside from his performances on various soundtrack records, Curry has had some success as a solo musical artist. Curry received classical vocal training as a boy. He has mentioned that his musical influences included jazz vocalists such as Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong and he idolised the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as a teenager. In 1978, A&amp;M Records released Curry&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Read My Lips&quot;. The album featured an eclectic range of songs (mostly covers) performed in diverse genres. Highlights of the album are a reggae version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;I Will&quot;, a rendition of &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot; featuring the Pipes and Drums of the 48th Highlanders of Canada, and a bar-room ballad, &quot;Alan&quot;, composed by Canadian singer-songwriter Tony Kosinec. In 1979 he scored a minor hit single with &quot;I Do the Rock&quot;. The following year, Curry released his second and most successful album &quot;Fearless&quot;. The LP was more rock-oriented than &quot;Read My Lips&quot; and mostly featured original songs rather than cover versions. The album included Curry&#x27;s only US Billboard Hot 100 charting song: &quot;I Do the Rock&quot;.

Curry&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;Simplicity&quot;, was released in 1981, again by A&amp;M Records. This record, which did not sell as well as the previous offerings, combined both original songs and cover versions. Still, it was the only Curry recording to hit the charts in Canada, reaching No. 45 on the album chart. The writing, production, and musician roster for Curry&#x27;s solo albums included an impressive list of collaborators, including Bob Ezrin, Dick Wagner, and David Sanborn.

In 1989, A&amp;M released &quot;The Best of Tim Curry&quot; on CD and cassette, featuring songs from his albums (including a live version of &quot;Alan&quot;) and a previously unreleased song, a live cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot;. Curry toured North America and some European countries with his band between 1978 and 1980. In 1990, Curry performed as the Prosecutor in Roger Waters&#x27; production of &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;. Although Curry&#x27;s first album was released in 1978, he had previously recorded a nine-track album for Lou Adler&#x27;s Ode Records in 1976. However, the album remained unreleased in its entirety until February 2010, when it was made available as a legal download entitled &quot;...From the Vaults&quot; (though four tracks from these sessions had been released on a 1990 &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; box set). The album, produced by Adler, included Curry&#x27;s rendition of The Supremes&#x27; hit &quot;Baby Love&quot;.

==Personal life==
A keen horticulturalist, Curry has developed and restored gardens across many of his past residences and some other residences in Los Angeles. On where his interest in gardening came from, he commented: &quot;I think if you&#x27;re English, a trowel appears in your hand when you&#x27;re 30 like a prosthetic device&quot;. He told the UK edition of &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine about designing Freddie Mercury&#x27;s garden: &quot;Freddie came back from a tour and said, &#x27;The garden, dear, it&#x27;s dead.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What? Did you water it?&#x27; And Freddie said, &#x27;Water it, dear?

Curry has used a wheelchair since having a major stroke in July 2012. As a result, he has shifted his work mostly to voice acting, although he has continued to perform as a singer and make appearances at fan conventions.

In October 2020, Curry reprised his role as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in a live table reading of &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; in support of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin to raise funds for Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Curry is working on a memoir titled &quot;Vagabond&quot;, scheduled to be released on October 7, 2025 by Grand Central Publishing | Hachette Book Group. When asked by a fan about the origin of the title, Curry responded, &quot;It comes from in the 17th and 18th centuries actors were regarded as vagabonds, and sort of criminals - and because I’ve always moved around so much.&quot;

<text>The Weakest Link is a British television quiz show, mainly broadcast on BBC Two and BBC One. It was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment Department. The game begins with a team of nine contestants (eight in the revival), who take turns answering general knowledge questions within a time limit to create chains of nine correct answers in a row. At the end of each round, the players then vote one contestant, &quot;the weakest link&quot;, out of the game. After two players are left, they play in a head-to-head penalty shootout format, with five questions asked to each contestant in turn, to determine the winner.

==History==

The first original episode was broadcast on 14 August 2000. The show was presented by Anne Robinson and narrated by Jon Briggs. It ran in different variations, originally as a daytime series but also at primetime and with celebrity contestants playing for charity with a modified set and format. The format has since been produced around the world, most notably in the United States, where Robinson was the original presenter.

On 22 April 2011, Anne Robinson announced that she would end her role as the quiz show&#x27;s presenter by the time her contract would expire as she had served longer than she had originally intended. The original run ended on 31 March 2012 with its 1,693rd, and final episode.

===Revivals===
In November 2017, The Weakest Link returned for a celebrity Children in Need edition, marking the 1,694th episode of the programme. The 40-minute edition aired on 17 November 2017 on BBC Two at 10pm GMT.

In June 2021, a 12-episode primetime revival with celebrity contestants and Romesh Ranganathan as host was announced. The revival premiered on BBC One on 18 December 2021. In March 2022, the revival was renewed for a second series, which premiered on 17 December 2022. In February 2023, the revival was renewed for a third series.

==Format==
The original format features nine contestants, who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The objective of every round is to create a chain of nine correct answers in a row and earn an increasing amount of money within a time limit. One wrong answer breaks the chain and loses any money earned within that particular chain. However, before their question is asked, a contestant can choose to bank the current amount of money earned in any chain to make it safe, after which the chain starts afresh. A contestant&#x27;s decision not to bank, in anticipation of being able to correctly answer the upcoming question allows the money to grow, as each successive correct answer earns proportionally more money.

When the allotted time for every round ends, any money which is not banked is lost, and if the host is in the middle of asking a question, or has asked a question but the contestant has yet to answer, the question is abandoned. If the question is completed, the host gives the correct answer whether the contestant is able to answer the question correctly or not. The round automatically ends if the team successfully reaches the maximum amount for the round before the allotted time expires, and the next person says &quot;Bank&quot;, or (in the revival) says &quot;bank&quot; and presses a button on their podium. Round 1 starts with 3 minutes on the clock (2 minutes and 30 seconds on the revival), every round thereafter (except round 8) is reduced by 10 seconds as players are eliminated. For Round 8, the last or final round, the remaining two players only have 90 seconds (1:30) to triple whatever they bank.

In the original series, the first person to be asked a question in the first round was the player whose name was first alphabetically. In the revival, it is a randomly chosen player. Every subsequent round starts with the &quot;strongest link&quot;—the player with the most correct answers from the previous round, unless that person has been voted off, in which case the second strongest link answers first.

Seven timed rounds are played in the 2021 revival, with question values and target totals increasing every two rounds. The final round is played for double value. The target begins at £2,500 in the first round and increases to £10,000 in the seventh (the real target of which is £20,000), allowing for a potential maximum bank of £50,000.

===Money chains===
Question and target values during the daytime and primetime runs of the series are displayed in the table below.

===Voting and elimination===
At the end of every round, contestants must vote one player out of the game. During the voting process, the narrator reveals to the viewers, though not the players, who the statistical strongest and weakest links were. While the contestants work as a team when answering questions, they are at this point encouraged to be ruthless with one another. Players often decide to vote off weaker rivals, but occasionally decide to eliminate stronger players as well, in hope that it then improves their chances of winning the game. After the revealing of the votes, the host will interrogate the players on their choice of voting, the reasons behind their choice, as well as their performance, background and their interests. After interrogation, the player with the most votes is given a stern &quot;You are the weakest link. Goodbye!&quot; or &quot;With [#] votes, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!&quot; and must walk off the stage in what is called the &quot;Walk of Shame.&quot; The eliminated contestant then delivers a brief confessional, summing up the experience of the show and occasionally taunting the team for voting them off, as well as providing opinion as to who is voted off next, and who is likely to win.

In the event of a tie or draw, the strongest link must decide which of the tied players is eliminated. The strongest link is allowed to change their vote if they voted for one of the tied players; they usually do not, unless a different player voted for their elimination.

====Final round====
The last two contestants work together in the eighth and final round identical to the previous ones, however, all money banked at the end of this round is tripled and added to the current money total, forming the final total for the game. At the end of this round, there is no elimination, with the game instead moving to the head-to-head round.

====&quot;Head to head&quot; round====
For the head-to-head round, the remaining two players are each required to answer five questions each in a penalty shootout format. The strongest link from the previous round chooses who goes first. Whoever has the most correct answers at the end of the round wins the game. In the event of a tie, the game goes to Sudden Death. Every player continues to be asked questions as usual, until 1 person answers a question correctly and the other incorrectly.

The winner of the game is declared &quot;the strongest link&quot; and takes home all of the money accumulated in the prize pool for the game, and the loser leaves with nothing, like all previous eliminated players. In daytime episodes, the maximum possible winnings are £10,000; in primetime and special celebrity charity episodes, the maximum is £50,000.

==Special editions==
===Prime-time versions===
Following the huge success of the show in its early evening slot on BBC Two, a separate weekly prime-time version was added to BBC One, usually broadcast on Wednesday evenings. These versions of the show were produced on a larger budget than the daytime version, with the addition of higher jackpots and a larger set that included electronic podiums and a studio audience, but had the same rules as the daytime version.

==== Early incarnations ====
The first primetime version of the show was &quot;Weakest Link: Champions&#x27; League&quot;, which premiered a few months after the original daytime run on 31 October 2000 and ran on Tuesdays. These episodes featured eight previous winners who battled it off once again for a doubled jackpot of £20,000 (with a money tree of £50-£100-£200-£500-£1,000-£1,500-£2,000-£2,500; with the 7th round being a double round for £5,000). Six editions of this version were produced and were not successful in ratings. Although another episode that aired a week after also featured returning contestants, consisting of contestants who deemed themselves to be unfairly voted out previously.

The second series of the prime-time editions saw a format change, with seven new contestants playing for the £20,000 jackpot (with a money tree of £50-£100-£250-£1,000-£1,750-£2,500; the 6th round being a triple round for £7,500) and the programme length reducing to 35 minutes instead of 40. These episodes normally featured standard contestants with some celebrity editions and ran from January to March 2001 on Mondays, with the last of the series airing on a Thursday.

====Celebrity editions====
The third series saw yet another format change for the prime-time editions. The podiums were increased to the standard nine, and the potential prize money was raised to £50,000. With this, the prime-time version increased back to forty-five minutes. Once again, new regular contestants played with occasional celebrity editions, but this had transitioned exclusively to celebrities playing for charity by the fourth series in 2002, and this remained as such until the original show&#x27;s end.

Although Briggs and Robinson state that 8 players will leave with nothing, normally the losing celebrities receive a &quot;house&quot; amount to give to their chosen charity, as well as their own fee for appearing on the show. In some celebrity editions, two celebrities have represented one position in the game, with the two conferring before giving their answer. There have also been several editions featuring entirely celebrity couples. A Christmas edition of the programme was also aired in some years. Some contestants, such as Christopher Biggins, Peter Duncan and Basil Brush, have appeared several times.

These editions tended to have a theme in relation to what celebrities were featured, such as a puppet edition where a Robinson puppet introduced the show.

===Daytime editions===
The daytime version has also seen its share of variants.

The first edition to feature celebrity contestants aired on 24 December 2000, featuring nine celebrities attempting to win £10,000 for a charity of their choosing. As it was simply a special of the daytime series, it didn&#x27;t feature any of the additions seen in the prime-time version. Shortly after, there were a few specials that aired between 2001 and 2002 that were similar to that of &quot;Champions&#x27; League&quot; featuring returning contestants, although once again these were just standard daytime episodes.

An April Fools&#x27; Day show that aired in 2003 featured Robinson being strangely and uncharacteristically nice to the contestants and abandoning her traditional black wardrobe in favour of a metallic pink overcoat. The nice nature of the episode even extended to the normally stoic narrator being much more excited and optimistic in his narration. However, Robinson did not remain kind to the contestants for the entire episode, resuming her old behaviour after declaring the winner and contestants as &quot;so stupid&quot;.

Another variant of the daytime show was the 1,000th episode, which aired in December 2006, with the contestants featured being fan-favourites from previous editions (mostly from the prime-time series). Much like the prime-time version, a studio audience (consisting of previous contestants from the daytime series) was added, although gameplay rules remained the same, with the potential prize money remaining at £10,000. The show&#x27;s first winner, David Bloomfield was one of the returning contestants, and was asked the question: &quot;If there have been 1,000 episodes of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, each with 9 players, how many contestants in total have appeared on the show?&quot; He answered the question correctly (9,000) but banked prior to it being asked. He did not win any money on the 1,000th episode and was voted off in only the 3rd round, despite having been the strongest link in the first two rounds. In the end, Miss Evans (who had previously appeared on the Strong Women special but had lost out to curate Emma Langley) defeated Basil Brush, winning £2,710, which she split with her co-finalist to give to charity. Robinson then announced that a bonus of £1,000 would be added to the final total, as it was the 1,000th episode, resulting in a final total of £3,710, or both contestants receiving £1,855 each. It also marked the first time that Anne Robinson did not say the phrase &quot;...you leave with nothing.&quot; to the losing contestant.

===The final daytime episode (2012)===
The 1,693rd episode was titled &quot;You are &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; - Goodbye&quot; and aired on BBC One on 31 March 2012. Filming for the final original edition took place on 11 December 2011. The ending of the show was the only atypical part to the last edition.

A normal daytime edition of the show was made, with some of Robinson&#x27;s favourite contestants from over the years taking part, and with no audience present during filming or changes to the money tree (see above). The first round of questions was notably different and was mainly about the &quot;Weakest Link&quot; and Robinson. The last question asked was &quot;If the Roman numeral &#x27;X&#x27; is halved, the result can be represented by which other Roman numeral?&quot;, the answer being &quot;V&quot;. The last UK winner was Archie Bland, the editor of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Saturday edition, who won £2,090.

A short montage of clips from the show was shown at the end of the game. After saying goodbye, all of the lights turned off with Robinson being the only person left in the studio. The programme was eventually replaced by the Alexander Armstrong-fronted &quot;Pointless&quot; as the big BBC teatime quiz, which had previously aired on BBC Two for since 2009.

==Success==
Much of the show&#x27;s success has been attributed to its host, Anne Robinson. She was already famous in the UK for her sarcasm while presenting &quot;Points of View&quot; and the consumer programme &quot;Watchdog&quot;, and &quot;Weakest Link&quot; saw her develop this further, particularly in her taunting of contestants. Her sardonic summary to the team, usually berating them for their lack of intelligence for not achieving the target became a trademark of the show, and her call of &quot;You are the weakest link—goodbye!&quot; became a popular catchphrase.

The presence of elements inspired by &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; differentiated the programme from most previous quiz shows, as it invites open conflict between players, and uses a host who is openly hostile to the competitors, rather than a positive figure.

In autumn 2001, for the first time, &quot;Weakest Link&quot; was placed directly head-to-head with &quot;Millionaire&quot; in the television schedules. Between the two, &quot;Millionaire&quot; ultimately emerged on top, attracting 10.2m viewers compared to &quot;Weakest Link&quot;&#x27;s 3.8m. Additionally, later in that autumn, due to the show&#x27;s ever-rising popularity, a videogame based on the show was released for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows platforms.

From 9 to 13 August 2010, five &quot;10th Anniversary Specials&quot; aired at the usual time on BBC One.

==Transmissions==

===Primetime===
==International versions==
The format has been licensed across the world, with many countries producing their own series of the programme and is the second most popular international franchise, behind only the &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; franchise, which also originated in the UK.

==Strategy for banking money==
In a &quot;New Scientist&quot; blog article, Erica Klarreich argues that there are only two sensible strategies in &quot;Weakest Link&quot; (the American edition) when it comes to banking money. Either players should choose to bank after every correct answer, or after six straight correct answers to maximize the pot. The correct strategy to take will depend upon the team members&#x27; skill at answering questions. For all but the weakest teams, the optimal strategy is to raise the pot six straight times without banking. But since this happens so seldom on the show, Klarreich argues, the dominant strategy will usually be instead to bank after every question. The common practice of banking after just three questions would only outperform the strategy of banking after every question if a team maintained a success rate of over 67%.

==Cultural references==

Anne Robinson&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;You are the weakest link. Goodbye!&quot; has made several appearances in pop culture, including references in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;The Garfield Show&quot; and &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;.

The comedy series &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot; broadcast a sketch based on &quot;Weakest Link&quot; called &quot;Hole in the Ring&quot;, featuring Robert Webb as an overly harsh presenter who makes mistakes whilst reading questions.

Two fictional television shows, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;My Family&quot;, have depicted their own versions of &quot;Weakest Link&quot; in their episodes. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; edition, broadcast in 2005, showed a futuristic version of the show in the year 200,100, with only six contestants, and presented by an &#x27;Anne Droid&#x27; (voiced by Anne Robinson). A later special edition of &quot;Weakest Link&quot; featured nine cast members of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; playing the game, and the show was introduced by the Anne Droid. The real Anne walked on stage almost instantly as the droid began the show, unplugged it, and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so. I think we&#x27;ll do that again.&quot; She then began the show herself and proceeded as normal.

In the seventh series of the British television show &quot;My Family&quot;, broadcast in 2007, the main characters Ben, Susan, Janey, Michael, Abi, Roger, and Alfie, along with Susan&#x27;s mother and her husband, went on the show for a special family edition, after Michael forged all of their signatures to get on it. The real Anne Robinson was the host.

<doc id="31575" wikidata="Q587502" url="?curid=31575" title="Tandy Corporation">
<text>Tandy Corporation was an American family-owned retailer based in Fort Worth, Texas that made leather goods, operated the RadioShack chain, and later built personal computers. 

Tandy Leather was founded in 1919 as a leather supply store. By the end of the 1950s, under the tutelage of then-CEO Charles Tandy, the company expanded into the hobby market, making leather moccasins and coin purses, making huge sales among Scouts, leading to a fast growth in sales. Aiming to broaden the company horizon, Charles Tandy acquired a number of craft retail companies, including RadioShack in 1963, then an almost bankrupt chain of electronics stores in Boston.

In the 1970s and 1980s, now led by John Roach as CEO, the corporation started to invest into the personal computer market following the introduction of the popular TRS-80; it was one of the pioneers in the rising personal computer industry, being lauded by the magazine &quot;Financial World&quot; as &quot;the driving force at the front-running company in the red-hot personal computer race&quot;. Unable to keep up with cost-cutting competitors, Tandy exited the PC business in 1993, selling its assets to AST Research, retaining its profitable goods-making units. In 2000, the Tandy Corporation name was dropped, and the entity became the RadioShack Corporation.

==History==
Tandy began in 1919 when two friends, Norton Hinckley and Dave L. Tandy, decided to start the Hinckley-Tandy Leather Company and concentrated their efforts on selling sole leather and other supplies to shoe repair dealers in Texas. Hinckley and Tandy opened their first branch store in 1927 in Beaumont, Texas and in 1932, Dave Tandy moved the store from Beaumont to Houston, Texas. Tandy&#x27;s business survived the economic storms of the Depression, gathered strength and developed a firm presence in the shoe findings (i.e. shoemakers&#x27; tools and supplies) business.

Dave Tandy had a son, Charles David Tandy, who was drafted into the business during his early twenties. Charles obtained a B.A. degree at Texas Christian University, then began attending the Harvard Business School to further expand his education. As World War II escalated Charles was called to serve his country in the military and relocated to Hawaii. He wrote to his father from overseas suggesting that leathercraft might offer new possibilities for growing the shoe finding business since the same supplies were used widely in Navy and Army hospitals and recreation centers. Leathercraft gave the men something useful to do and their handiwork, in addition to being therapeutic, had genuine value.

Charles Tandy returned home from the service as a lieutenant commander in 1948 and negotiated to operate the fledgling leathercraft division himself. He had encouraged and followed the development of that venture through correspondence with his father. Within a short time Charles succeeded in opening the first of two retail stores in 1950 that specialized exclusively in leathercraft.
Hinckley did not share the enthusiasm of Dave and Charles Tandy for the new leathercraft division. As a result, the two original founders came to an agreement in 1950 that Hinckley would continue to pursue the shoe findings business and the Tandy partners would specialize in promoting leathercrafts.

The first Tandy Catalog, only eight pages long, was mailed to readers of &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine who had responded to two-inch test ads that were placed by Tandy. From 1950 forward Tandy operated retail mail order stores supported by direct mail advertising. This successful formula helped the company expand into a chain of some 150 leathercraft stores. A growing do-it-yourself movement, prompted by a shortage of consumer goods and high labor costs, continued to gather momentum. The fifteen leathercraft stores opened during this division&#x27;s first two years of operation became quite successful. Tandy began expanding by gaining new product lines; the first acquisition was with the American Handicrafts Company which featured a broad line of do-it-yourself handicraft products, two established retail stores in the New York market, and useful knowledge of school and institutional markets. Sixteen additional retail stores were opened in 1953, and by 1955 Tandy Leather was a thriving company with leased sales sites in 75 cities across the United States.

Tandy Leather became an attractive commodity and was purchased in 1955 by the American Hide and Leather Company of Boston, whose name changed in 1956 to General American Industries (GAI). Charles continued to maintain control of managing the Tandy Leather division while owned by GAI. During 1956, General American Industries acquired three other companies unrelated to the leather industry and a struggle for control of the parent company began. Charles saw the need to emancipate the company from continuing in the direction initiated by GAI. He used all his resources, raised additional money, and exercised his right to purchase the 500,000 shares of stock that were included in the original settlement. When the votes were counted on the day of that pivotal stockholders meeting, the Tandy group took management control of General American Industries.

==Acquisition of Merribee and RadioShack==
In 1961, the company name was changed to Tandy Corporation. The corporate headquarters were also moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where Charles D. Tandy became the president and chairman of the board. Tandy Leather was operating 125 stores in 105 cities of the United States and Canada and expanding significantly. Tandy acquired the assets of Merribee Art Embroidery Co., manufacturer and retailer of needlecraft items, as well as five other companies, including Cleveland Crafts Inc. and brought on the owner, Werner Magnus, to help run the newly acquired Merribee division.

The first Tandy Mart had twenty-eight different shops all devoted to craft and hobby merchandise and included American Handicraft, Tandy Leather, Electronics Crafts and Merribee in an area of about 40,000 square feet. Charles Tandy became intrigued with the potential for rapid growth that he saw in the electronics retail industry during 1962. He found RadioShack in Boston, a mail order company that had started in the 1920s selling to amateur radio operators and electronics buffs. By April 1963, the Tandy Corporation acquired management control of RadioShack Corporation and within two years, RadioShack&#x27;s $4 million (~$ in ) loss was turned into a profit under the leadership of Charles Tandy.

Sales were going well for Tandy during this time. Under the leadership of Lloyd Redd (president) and Al Patten (VP of Operations), the company prospered. The number of Tandy store-fronts skyrocketed over the next five to six years by growing from 132 sites in 1969 to 269 sites in 1975. Ground broke in downtown Fort Worth for the construction of the Tandy Towers in 1975. The 18-story office building was initiated as phase I of a massive downtown development with plans to cover eight city blocks and become the new headquarters of the Tandy Corp. It contained an upscale retail shopping center with an indoor ice skating rink and had its own privately owned subway system.

The company&#x27;s board of directors then announced a plan to separate Tandy&#x27;s businesses into three distinct publicly held companies. The two new companies were named Tandycrafts, Inc. and Tex Tan-Hickok, Inc. This plan was publicized as a strategy to provide intensive leadership and tailored management of the three distinct and diverse businesses of the company, each of which recently had reached a substantial size. With this transition, RadioShack and Tandy Leather Company were no longer under the same corporate umbrella. Wray Thompson was promoted to president of Tandy Leather Company in 1976 and Dave Ferrill was promoted to the position of National Sales Manager; they oversaw 288 stores. Although they opened their 300th store that year, the popularity of Nature-Tand&#x27;s products had begun to slide.

Charles Tandy died on November 4, 1978, at the age of 60. Concurrently, key stakeholders began to question the direction of the company. Wray Thompson subsequently resigned from his position as president and later started The Leather Factory with Ron Morgan, which eventually purchased Tandy Leather Corporation in 2000.

==Computers==

Tandy was one of three companies (along with Commodore International and Apple) that started the personal computer revolution in 1977 by introducing complete pre-assembled microcomputers instead of a kit. Their TRS-80 (1977) and TRS-80 Color Computer (&quot;CoCo&quot;) (1980) line of home computers were popular in the years before the IBM PC became commonplace, and had wide distribution in Radio Shack stores at a time when there were few computer stores.

Tandy had 60 Radio Shack Computer Centers by 1980, and expected to have 250 Radio Shack stores that sold its entire computer product line by the end of 1981. By then computers were the most important part of Tandy&#x27;s sales. The company attempted to monopolize software and peripheral sales by keeping technical information secret and not selling third-party products in Tandy-owned stores. An experimental Tandy computer store at company headquarters sold non-Tandy products until the company banned doing so. A market research company reported in 1981 that not selling others&#x27; products slowed Tandy&#x27;s growth, and predicted that competitors would benefit.
Discussing the report, Wayne Green, publisher of &quot;80 Microcomputing&quot;, warned that the company might have become overconfident from defeating &quot;poorly financed and inadequately managed competitors&quot;, and that IBM and others would not likely be &quot;as myopic and hidebound as Radio Shack&quot;. He wrote that had Tandy continued its experiment, &quot;they might have a couple of thousand Tandy Computer Centers around the country, instead of the Byte Shops and Computerlands we now see. And Tandy would have had a lot more control over Apple and other upstarts&quot;. In 1982 he wrote that while its thousands of stores were once a &quot;considerable advantage&quot; over competitors, &quot;the Shack is falling way behind in sales outlets and thus in sales ... we&#x27;ve seen the Apple come along and, with fewer outlets, pass the TRS-80 by in sales&quot;. Green warned that the company needed to make &quot;soul-searching, perhaps painful, decisions&quot;.

Tandy&#x27;s market share—as high as 60% at one time—indeed declined by 1983 because of competition from the IBM PC and lack of third-party products. Tandy adopted the IBM PC compatible architecture with the Tandy 1000 and Tandy 2000 (1983–1984). The 1000 helped Tandy achieve a 25% personal computer market share in 1986, tied with Apple and in second place behind IBM.

In 1982, Tandy Corporation entered into a development contract with Oklahoma-based software company Dorsett Educational Systems, known for its 25 years pioneering educational technology. The deal resulted in dozens of titles being released for the TRS-80 Color Computer.

Radio Shack stores sold TRS-80 computers with other products, while Radio Shack Computer Centers only sold computers. Non-company-owned franchises sold Radio Shack products, including computers, and non-Radio Shack items. Value-added resellers distributed relabelled versions of Tandy computers. Despite selling computers through old-fashioned, department-store-like Sunday-newspaper inserts that emphasized price instead of technology and functionality, by 1980 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; described Radio Shack as &quot;the dominant supplier of small computers&quot;. and in 1981 &quot;one of the best marketers in the computer industry&quot;. Adam Osborne that year described Tandy as &quot;one of the great enigmas of the industry&quot;. He wrote of his amazement that a company &quot;with so few roots in microcomputing&quot; was the &quot;number-one microcomputer manufacturer&quot; while &quot;selling computers out of Radio Shack stores, no less?&quot; Green suggested in 1982 that stores separate computers from toys to convince &quot;middle-income (-class) customers that Radio Shack stores are not primarily dealers in schlock for the unwary lower-income people&quot;. A &quot;BYTE&quot; reviewer admitted in 1983 that he at first dismissed the Model 100 &quot;as a toy&quot; because he saw it in a store next to a radio-controlled car, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s too bad that Radio Shack is associated with toys and CB radio&quot; when the computer &quot;shows tremendous planning and foresight&quot;.

In 1984, a sell-side analyst stated that Tandy had an &quot;impressive product line, magnificent distribution capability, control of the whole process from manufacturing through distribution, and a reasonably nimble management that is willing to move with the product cycle&quot;. Roach described his company as &quot;basically a distribution system for high technology products&quot;, with 500 Radio Shack Computer Centers and 800 to 900 &quot;Plus&quot; stores, Radio Shack locations with a large computer section. By then computers were 35% of Radio Shack sales; the Model 100 was the world&#x27;s best-selling notebook computer, while Tandy was the leading Unix vendor by volume, selling almost 40,000 units of the 68000-based, multiuser Tandy Model 16 with Xenix, and began selling all computers using the Tandy brand because, an executive admitted, &quot;we were told by customers that the Radio Shack name was a problem in the office&quot;. In the mid-1980s, it began selling peripherals compatible with non-Tandy products such as the IBM PC. The company also mandated in 1986 an IBM-like dress code for store employees. In 1987, &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote that &quot;Tandy might now be offering the most extensive lines of computer products in the world&quot;, including the $99 Color Computer 2, $499 Model 102 notebook, various PC compatibles, and the $3,499 Tandy 6000 Xenix system. The company acquired GRiD Systems in March 1988. Grid Systems was a laptop manufacturer whose products included the GRiD Compass (1982), GridCase (1985), GridLite (1987), and GridPad (1989) tablet computer.

Tandy also produced the short-lived Tandy 1100FD and Tandy 1100HD notebooks. Released in 1989, the 1100 Series was based on the popular NEC V20 processor clocked at 8 MHz. Tandy also produced software for its computers running DOS, in the form of Tandy Deskmate. That same year, Tandy introduced the WP-2, a solid-state notebook computer that was a rebadged Citizen CBM-10WP. Eventually, in the early 1990s, Tandy Corporation sold its computer-manufacturing business to AST Computers, and all Tandy computer lines were terminated. When that occurred, Radio Shack stores began selling computers made by other manufacturers, such as Compaq. In 1992, the company introduced the Tandy Zoomer, a predecessor to the Palm Pilot, designed by Jeff Hawkins. Also that year, the company produced an interactive, multimedia CD-ROM player called the Tandy Video Information System (VIS). Like the Tandy computers, it was based on the IBM PC architecture and used a version of Microsoft Windows. Tandy even produced a line of floppy disks, and continued producing IBM PC compatibles until the end of the Intel 486 era.

==Tandy stores==
In 1973, Tandy Corporation began an expansion program outside their home market of the US, opening a chain of RadioShack-style stores in Europe and Australia under the Tandy name. The first store to open was in Aartselaar, Belgium on August 9, 1973. The first UK store opened October 11, 1973, in Hall Green, Birmingham. Initially, these new stores were under direct ownership of Tandy Corporation. In 1986, Tandy Corporation formed its subsidiary InterTAN as separate entity though connections between them were still visible. For example, catalogue number compatibility was maintained so that the same catalogue number in both companies would refer to the same item.

Tandy stores in the UK sold mainly own-brand goods under the &#x27;Realistic&#x27; label and the shops were distinguished on the high street by continuing to use written sales receipts and a cash drawer instead of a till as late as the early 1990s. Staff were required to take the name and address of any customer who made a purchase, however small, in order to put them on the company&#x27;s brochure mailing list, which often caused disgruntlement. A popular feature of Tandy stores was the free battery club, in which customers were allowed to claim a certain number of free batteries per year. In the early 1990s, the chain ran the &#x27;Tandy Card&#x27; store credit card scheme and the &#x27;Tandy Care&#x27; extended warranty policies which were heavily marketed by staff.

In 1999, the UK stores were acquired by Carphone Warehouse, as a part of an expansion strategy that saw the majority of the Tandy stores converted either to Carphone Warehouse or Tecno photographic stores. In May 2000, the Tandy name was dropped and the official name became RadioShack Corporation. By 2001, all former Tandy stores had been converted or closed. A small number of the stores were sold to a new company called T2 Retail Ltd formed by former Tandy (Intertan UK) employees, Dave Johnson, Neil Duggins and Philip Butcher who continued the RadioShack-style theme for a while, but these stores also closed in 2005. A new company called T2 Enterprises now continues using the old T2 Retail web presence as an exclusively on-line retailer stocking a range of RadioShack products and other electronics. In 2012, Tandy Corporation Ltd, a UK company, acquired the UK rights to the Tandy brand from RadioShack. It now operates as an on-line retailer of electronic components and kits at .

In Australia:

* In 2001, Tandy Electronics stores were sold to Woolworths Limited. After Woolworths purchased Tandy Electronics, despite owning rival Dick Smith Electronics, both continued to trade as separate entities.
* In February 2009, Woolworths Limited announced that it would be closing all Tandy Electronics stores within the next two years.
* By the 24 June 2012, all Tandy Electronics stores had closed.

In Canada, the InterTAN stores were sold to rival Circuit City Inc. The stores were branded as RadioShack, however, because Circuit City lost the naming rights. Later, all of these RadioShacks were re-branded as &quot;The Source by Circuit City&quot; (now called just The Source). Some of these stores have since closed. In 2009, Circuit City sold The Source to Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE).

==Other retail outlets==
===Color Tile===
In 1975, Tandy spun off Color Tile, a chain of tile and flooring stores, along with its other non-electronic businesses in 1975 to TandyCrafts.

===McDuff Electronics, VideoConcepts===
In 1985, Tandy acquired two chains, McDuff Electronics and VideoConcepts; the latter was previously owned by Eckerd Corporation. Most of these stores were closed as part of a 1994 restructuring plan, with 33 converted to RadioShack or Computer City Express stores. Remaining McDuff stores were closed in 1996.

===The Edge in Electronics===
The Edge in Electronics, a now-defunct chain of boutique stores geared toward mall customers interested in fashionable personal and portable name brand electronics, debuted in 1990 and had 16 stores as of December 1993. One of the last stores open closed in San Antonio, Texas, in 2001.

===Incredible Universe===
The Incredible Universe concept was Tandy&#x27;s attempt to compete with other electronics giants such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and Lechmere. A joint venture between Tandy Corporation and Trans World Entertainment, the first two stores, located in Arlington, Texas, and Wilsonville, Oregon, opened in 1992. Each Incredible Universe store stocked more than 85,000 items, and the stores&#x27; sales personnel did not work on commission. Sales were below average compared to Tandy&#x27;s profitable RadioShack line, and by late 1996, the company had decided to sell or close all 17 Incredible Universe stores. Many Incredible Universe stores were acquired by Fry&#x27;s Electronics.

===Computer City===
Computer City was a supercenter concept featuring name-brand and private label computers, software and related products; acquired in 1991, these supplanted the original Radio Shack Computer Center chain, which closed that year. Computer City became the first International Computer Superstore with over 100 locations in six countries. In 1995, Computer City was recognized as the 2nd fastest retailer to hit $1 (~$ in ) billion in sales. In 1996, it was recognized as the second fastest retailer to hit $2 (~$ in ) billion in sales. (Sam&#x27;s Club was the fastest retailer to hit $1 billion.) Alan Bush, former EVP of RadioShack and Jim Hamilton, known as the &quot;Father of Computer Retailing,&quot; were the strategists behind the rapid growth and success. The Computer City stores were later sold to CompUSA.

===O&#x27;Sullivan Industries===

In 1983, Conroy sold O&#x27;Sullivan Industries, a furniture manufacturer, to Tandy Corporation. In 1994, Tandy Corporation offered O&#x27;Sullivan as a public company. In 1999, O&#x27;Sullivan was purchased for about $350 million (~$ in ) by investment group OSI Acquisition, an affiliate of Brockman, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Co., L.P. (BRS).

<doc id="31577" wikidata="Q1770" url="?curid=31577" title="Tallinn">
<text>Tallinn is the capital and most populous city of Estonia. Situated on a bay in north Estonia, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea, Tallinn has a population of about 461,000 (as of 2025) and administratively lies in the Harju &quot;maakond&quot; (county). Tallinn is the main governmental, financial, industrial, and cultural centre of Estonia. It is located northwest of the country&#x27;s second largest city, Tartu; however, only south of Helsinki, Finland, also west of Saint Petersburg, Russia, north of Riga, Latvia, and east of Stockholm, Sweden. From the 13th century until the first half of the 20th century, Tallinn was known in most of the world by variants of its other historical name Reval.

Tallinn received Lübeck city rights in 1248; however, the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area dates back nearly 5,000 years. The medieval indigenous population of what is now Tallinn and north Estonia was one of the last &quot;pagan&quot; civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Papal-sanctioned Northern Crusades in the 13th century. The first recorded claim over the place was laid by Denmark after a successful raid in 1219 led by King Valdemar II, followed by a period of alternating Scandinavian and Teutonic rulers. Due to the strategic location by the sea, its medieval port became a significant trade hub, especially in the 14–16th centuries, when Tallinn grew in importance as the northernmost member city of the Hanseatic League. Tallinn Old Town is one of the best-preserved medieval cities in Europe and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In 2012, Tallinn had the highest number of startup companies per person among all capitals and larger cities in Europe. Tallinn is the birthplace of many international high-technology companies, including Skype and Wise. The city is home to the headquarters of the European Union&#x27;s IT agency, and to the NATO Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.
In 2007, Tallinn was listed among the top-10 digital cities in the world, and in 2022, Tallinn was listed among the top-10 &quot;medium-sized European cities of the future&quot;.

== Names and etymology ==

The name Tallinn(a) is Estonian. It has been widely considered a historical derivation of &quot;Taani-linna&quot;, meaning &quot;Danish-castle&quot; (), conceivably because the Danish invaders built the castle in place of the Estonian stronghold after the 1219 battle of Lyndanisse.

The Icelandic &quot;Njal&#x27;s saga&quot;—composed after 1270, but describing events between 960 and 1020—mentions an event that occurred somewhere in the area of Tallinn and calls the place &quot;Rafala&quot; (probably a derivation of &quot;Rävala&quot;, &quot;Revala&quot;, or some other variant of the Estonian name of the adjacent medieval Estonian county). Soon after the Danish conquest in 1219, the town became known in the Scandinavian and German languages as Reval (). &quot;Reval&quot; was in official use in Estonia until 1918.

In international use, the English and German-language (; ) as well as the Russian analog &quot;Revel&quot; () were all gradually replaced by the Estonian name after the country became independent in 1918. At first, both Estonian forms, &quot;Tallinna&quot; and &quot;Tallinn&quot;, were used. &quot;Tallinna&quot; in Estonian denotes also the genitive case of the name, as in &quot;Tallinna Sadam&quot; (&#x27;the Port of Tallinn&#x27;).
Henry of Livonia, in his chronicle (), called the town with the name that is also known to have been used up to the 13th century by Scandinavians: &quot;Lindanisa&quot; (or &quot;Lyndanisse&quot; in Danish, &quot;Lindanäs&quot; in Swedish and &quot;Ledenets&quot; in Old East Slavic).

In 1154, a town called (&quot;Qlwn&quot; or &quot;Quwri&quot;) was recorded in the description of the world on the world map (&quot;Tabula Rogeriana&quot;) commissioned by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily and compiled by Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, who described it as &quot;a small town like a large castle&quot; among the towns of &#x27;Astlanda&#x27;. It has been suggested that one possible transcription, &#x27;Qlwn&#x27;, may have denoted a predecessor of the modern city and may somehow be related to a toponym &quot;Kolyvan&quot;, which has been discovered from later East Slavic chronicles. However, a number of historians have considered connecting any of al-Idrisi&#x27;s placenames with modern Tallinn erroneous, unfounded, or speculative.

== History ==

The first archaeological traces of a small hunter-fisherman community&#x27;s presence in what is now Tallinn&#x27;s city centre are about 5,000 years old. The comb ceramic pottery found on the site dates to about 3000 BCE and corded ware pottery to around 2500 BCE.
Around 1050 AD, a fortress was built in what is now central Tallinn, on the hill of Toompea.

As an important port on a major trade route between Novgorod and western Europe, it became a target for the expansion of the Teutonic Knights and the Kingdom of Denmark during the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century when Christianity was forcibly imposed on the local population. Danish rule of Tallinn and northern Estonia started in 1219.

In 1285, Tallinn, then known more widely as Reval, became the northernmost member of the Hanseatic League – a mercantile and military alliance of German-dominated cities in Northern Europe. The king of Denmark sold Reval along with other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346. Reval was arguably the most significant medieval port in the Gulf of Finland. Reval enjoyed a strategic position at the crossroads of trade between the rest of western Europe and Novgorod and Muscovy in the east. The city, with a population of about 8,000, was very well fortified with city walls and 66 defence towers. The city wall has been described as an outstanding example of German Medieval fortification architecture.

A weather vane, the figure of an old warrior called Old Thomas, was put on top of the spire of the Tallinn Town Hall in 1530. Old Thomas later became a popular symbol of the city.

In the early years of the Protestant Reformation, the city converted to Lutheranism. In 1561, Reval (Tallinn) became a dominion of Sweden.

During the 1700–1721 Great Northern War, plague-stricken Tallinn along with Swedish Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Tsardom of Russia (Muscovy) in 1710, but the local self-government institutions (Magistracy of Reval and Estonian Knighthood) retained their cultural and economical autonomy within Imperial Russia as the Governorate of Estonia. The Magistracy of Reval was abolished in 1889. The 19th century brought industrialisation of the city and the port kept its importance.

On 24 February 1918, the Estonian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Tallinn. It was followed by Imperial German occupation until the end of World War I in November 1918, after which Tallinn became the capital of independent Estonia. During World War II, Estonia was first occupied by the Soviet army and annexed into the USSR in the summer of 1940, then occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. During the German occupation Tallinn suffered from many instances of aerial bombing by the Soviet air force. During the most destructive Soviet bombing raid on 9–10 March 1944, over a thousand incendiary bombs were dropped on the town, causing widespread fires, killing 757 people, and leaving over 20,000 residents of Tallinn without shelter. After the German retreat in September 1944, the city was occupied again by the Soviet Union.
During the 1980 Summer Olympics, the sailing (then known as yachting) events were held at Pirita, north-east of central Tallinn. Many buildings, such as the Tallinn TV Tower, &quot;Olümpia&quot; hotel, the new Main Post Office building, and the Regatta Centre, were built for the Olympics.

In 1991, the independent democratic Estonian nation was restored and a period of quick development as a modern European capital ensued. Tallinn became the capital of a &quot;de facto&quot; independent country once again on 20 August 1991. The Old Town became a World Heritage Site in 1997, and the city hosted the 2002 Eurovision Song Contest. Tallinn was the 2011 European Capital of Culture, and is the recipient of the 2023 European Green Capital Award. The city has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and takes pride in its biodiversity and high air quality. But critics say that the award was received on false promises since it won the title with its &quot;15-minute city&quot; concept, according to which key facilities and services should be accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride but the concept was left out of the green capital program and other parts of the 12 million euro program amount to a collection of temporary and one-off projects without any structural and lasting changes.

== Geography ==

Tallinn is situated on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, in north-western Estonia.

The largest lake in Tallinn is Lake Ülemiste (), which serves as the main source of the city&#x27;s drinking water. Lake Harku is the second-largest lake within the borders of Tallinn and its area is . The only significant river in Tallinn nowadays is the Pirita river, in the eponymous Pirita city district. Historically, a smaller river, called Härjapea, flowed from Lake Ülemiste through the town into the sea, but the river was diverted into underground sewerage system in the 1930s and has since completely disappeared from the cityscape. References to it still remain in the street names Jõe (from &quot;jõgi&quot;, river) and Kivisilla (from &quot;kivi sild&quot;, stone bridge).

The length of the seaside coast is , comprising three larger (Kopli, Paljassaare, and Kakumäe) peninsulas. The city has a number of public beaches, including those at Pirita, Stroomi, Kakumäe, Harku, and Pikakari.

The highest point in Tallinn, at 64 m (about 200 ft) above sea level, is situated in Hiiu, Nõmme District, in the south-west of the city. A large limestone cliff runs through the city. It can be seen at Toompea, Lasnamäe, and Astangu. However, the hill at Toompea, despite its prominence, is not geologically connected to the larger limestone cliff formation.

The rocks and sediments underneath Tallinn are of different composition and age. Youngest are the Quaternary deposits. The materials of these deposits are till, varved clay, sand, gravel, and pebbles that are of glacial, marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute aquifers, or as in the case of gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The buried valleys of Tallinn are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valleys themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary. The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard sedimentary rock of Ediacaran, Cambrian and Ordovician age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits, cropping out in the Baltic Klint at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and marlstone, then a first layer of argillite followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city, hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 m below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the Fennoscandian Craton including gneisses and other metamorphic rocks with volcanic rock protoliths and rapakivi granites. These rocks are much older than the rest (Paleoproterozoic age) and do not crop out anywhere in Estonia.

=== Climate ===
Tallinn has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm, rainy summers and cold, snowy winters.

Winters are cold, but mild for its latitude, owing to its coastal location. The average temperature in February, the coldest month, is . During the winters, temperatures tend to hover close to freezing, but mild spells of weather can push temperatures above , occasionally reaching above while cold air masses can push temperatures below an average of 6 days a year. Snowfall is common during the winters, which are cloudy and characterised by low amounts of sunshine, ranging from only 20.7 hours of sunshine per month in December to 58.8 hours in February. At the winter solstice, daylight lasts for less than 6 hours and 5 minutes.

Spring starts out cool, with freezing temperatures common in March and April, but gradually becomes warmer and sunnier in May, when daytime temperatures average , although nighttime temperatures still remain cool, averaging from March to May. In early spring, freezing temperatures are common in March and snowfall can occur in April.

During summer, partly cloudy or clear days are common and it is the sunniest season, ranging from 255.6 hours of sunshine in August to 312.1 hours in July although precipitation is higher during these months. At the summer solstice, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours and 40 minutes.

Autumn starts out mild, with a September average daily mean of and increasingly becomes cooler and cloudier in November. In the early parts of autumn, temperatures commonly reach and at least one day above in September. In late autumn, snowfall can occur in October and freezing temperatures become more common in November.

The average humidity is 81%, ranging from a high of 89% to a low of 69% in May. Tallinn has an average windspeed of with winters being the windiest (around in January) and summers being the least windy at around in August. Extremes range from on 31 December 1978 to on 30 July 1994.

According to a 2021 study commissioned by the British price comparison site Uswitch.com, Tallinn is the most unpredictable of European capitals in terms of weather conditions, with a total score of 69/100; the high score is mainly due to the location between a more maritime and a more continental climate and the variation in the duration of sunshine as a consequence of its high latitude. Riga and Helsinki took second and third places.


== Administrative districts ==


Tallinn is subdivided into eight administrative &quot;linnaosa&quot; (districts). Each district has a &quot;linnaosa valitsus&quot; (district government) which is managed by a &quot;linnaosavanem&quot; (district elder) who is appointed by the city government. The function of the &quot;district governments&quot;, however, is not directly governing, but just limited to providing advice to the city government and the city council on issues related to the administration of respective districts.

The districts are administratively further divided into 84 &quot;asum&quot; (subdistricts or &quot;neighbourhoods&quot; with officially defined borders).
==Government==
The city is governed by the Tallinn City Council which consists of 79 members elected to four year terms via party list. The mayor is elected by the city council.

== Demographics ==

The population of Tallinn on 1 January 2024 was 457,572. It is the primate and most populous city in Estonia, the 3rd most populous city in the three Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), as well as the 59th most populous city in the European Union.

According to Eurostat, in 2004, Tallinn had one of the largest number of non-EU nationals of all EU member states&#x27; capital cities. Ethnic Russians are a significant minority in Tallinn, as around a third of the city&#x27;s residents are first and second generation immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union; a majority of the Soviet-era immigrants now hold Estonian citizenship.

Ethnic Estonians made up over 80% of Tallinn&#x27;s population before World War II. As of 2022, ethnic Estonians made up over 53% of the population. Tallinn was one of the urban areas with industrial and military significance in northern Estonia that during the period of Soviet occupation underwent extensive changes in its ethnic composition due to large influx of immigrants from Russia and other parts of the former USSR. Whole new city districts were built where the main intent of the then Soviet authorities was to accommodate Russian-speaking immigrants: Mustamäe, Väike-Õismäe, Pelguranna, and most notably, Lasnamäe, which in 1980s became, and is to this day, the most populous district of Tallinn.

The official language of Tallinn is Estonian. As of 2011, 50.1% of the city&#x27;s residents were native speakers of Estonian, whereas 46.7% had Russian as their first language. While English is the most frequently used foreign language by the residents of Tallinn, there are also a significant number of native speakers of Ukrainian and Finnish.



== Religion ==
The pie chart to the right shows the distribution of religion in Tallinn as of 2021.
== Economy ==
Tallinn has a highly diversified economy with particular strengths in information technology, tourism and logistics. More than half of Estonia&#x27;s GDP is created in Tallinn. In 2008, the GDP per capita of Tallinn stood at 172% of the Estonian average.
In addition to longtime functions as seaport and capital city, Tallinn has seen development of an information technology sector; in its 13 December 2005, edition, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterised Estonia as &quot;a sort of Silicon Valley on the Baltic Sea&quot;. One of Tallinn&#x27;s sister cities is the Silicon Valley town of Los Gatos, California. Skype is one of the best-known of several Estonian start-ups originating from Tallinn. Many start-ups have originated from the Institute of Cybernetics. In recent years, Tallinn has gradually been becoming one of the main IT centres of Europe, with the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) of NATO, eu-LISA, the EU Digital Agency and the IT development centres of large corporations, such as TeliaSonera and Kuehne + Nagel being based in the city.

Tallinn receives 4.3 million visitors annually, a figure that has grown steadily over the past decade. The Finns are especially a common sight in Tallinn; on average, about 20,000–40,000 Finnish tourists visit the city between June and October. Most of the visitors come from Europe, though Tallinn has also become increasingly visited by tourists from the Asia-Pacific region.
Tallinn Passenger Port is one of the busiest cruise destinations on the Baltic Sea, it served more than 520,000 cruise passengers in 2013.

The state-owned energy company Eesti Energia, the nationwide electric power transmission system operator Elering, the natural gas distributor Eesti Gaas, and the country&#x27;s largest private energy company, Alexela Group, all have their headquarters in Tallinn.

Tallinn is the financial centre of Estonia and also an important economic centre in the Baltoscandian region. Many major banks, such as SEB, Swedbank, and Nordea, have their local offices in Tallinn. LHV Pank, an Estonian investment bank, has its corporate headquarters in Tallinn. Tallinn Stock Exchange, part of NASDAQ OMX Group, is the only regulated exchange in Estonia.

Port of Tallinn is one of the biggest ports in the Baltic sea region, whereas the largest cargo port of Estonia, the Port of Muuga, which is operated by the same business entity, is located in the neighboring town of Maardu. Old City Harbour has been known as a convenient harbour since the medieval times, but nowadays the cargo operations are shifted to Muuga Cargo Port and Paldiski South Harbour. As of 2010, there was still a small fleet of oceangoing trawlers that operated out of Tallinn.
Tallinn&#x27;s industries include shipbuilding, machine building, metal processing, electronics, textile manufacturing. BLRT Grupp has its headquarters and some subsidiaries in Tallinn. Air Maintenance Estonia and AS Panaviatic Maintenance, both based in Tallinn Airport, provide MRO services for aircraft, largely expanding their operations in recent years. 
Liviko, the maker of the internationally-known Vana Tallinn liqueur, is similarly based in Tallinn. The headquarters of Kalev, a confectionery company and part of the industrial conglomerate Orkla Group, is located in Lehmja, near the city&#x27;s southeastern boundary.
Estonia is ranked third in Europe in terms of shopping centre space per inhabitant, ahead of Sweden and being surpassed only by Norway and Luxembourg.

One of the most visited historical museums in Tallinn is the Estonian History Museum, located in Great Guild Hall at Vanalinn, the old part of the city. It covers Estonia&#x27;s history from prehistoric times up until the end of the 20th century. It features film and hands-on displays that show how Estonian dwellers lived and survived.
The Estonian Maritime Museum provides an overview of nation&#x27;s seafaring past. The museum is located in the Old Town, inside one of Tallinn&#x27;s former defensive structures – Fat Margaret&#x27;s Tower. Another historical museum that can be found at city&#x27;s Old Town, just behind the Town Hall, is Tallinn City Museum. It covers Tallinn&#x27;s history from pre-history until 1991, when Estonia regained its independence. Tallinn City Museum owns nine more departments and museums around the city, one of which is Tallinn&#x27;s Museum of Photography, also located just behind the Town Hall. It features permanent exhibition that covers 100 years of photography in Estonia.

Estonia&#x27;s Vabamu Museum of Occupations and Freedom is located in Kesklinn (the Central district).

Tallinn is home to several art and design museums. The Estonian Art Museum, the largest art museum in Estonia, consists of four branches – Kumu Art Museum, Kadriorg Art Museum, Mikkel Museum, and Niguliste Museum. Kumu Art Museum features the country&#x27;s largest collection of contemporary and modern art. It also displays Estonian art starting from the early 18th century.

===Lauluväljak===

The Estonian Song Festival (in Estonian: Laulupidu) is one of the largest choral events in the world, listed by the UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It is held every five years in July on the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds (&quot;Lauluväljak&quot;) simultaneously with the Estonian Dance Festival. The joint choir has comprised more than 30,000 singers performing to an audience of 80,000.

Estonians have one of the biggest collections of folk songs in the world, with written records of about 133,000 folk songs. From 1987, a cycle of mass demonstrations featuring spontaneous singing of national songs and hymns that were strictly forbidden during the years of the Soviet occupation to peacefully resist the oppression. In September 1988, a record 300,000 people, more than a quarter of all Estonians, gathered in Tallinn for a song festival.
===Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival===
Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (Estonian: Pimedate Ööde Filmifestival, or PÖFF), is an annual film festival held since 1997 in Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. PÖFF is the only festival in the Nordic and Baltic region with a FIAPF (International Federation of Film Producers Association) accreditation for holding an international competition programme in the Nordic and Baltic region with 14 other non-specialised festivals, such as Cannes, Berlin, Venice. With over 250 feature films screened each year and over 77500 attendances (2014), PÖFF is one of the largest film events of Northern Europe and cultural events in Estonia in the winter season. During its 19th edition in 2015 the festival screened more than 600 films (including 250+ feature-length films from 80 countries), bringing over 900 screenings to an audience of over 80, 000 people as well as over 700 accredited guests and journalists from 50 countries. In 2010 the festival held the European Film Awards ceremony in Tallinn.

===Cuisine===

The traditional cuisine of Tallinn reflects culinary traditions of north Estonia, the role of the city as a fishing port, and historical German influences. Numerous cafés have played a major role in a social life of the city since the 19th century, as have bars, especially in the Kesklinn district.

The &quot;martsipan&quot; industry in Tallinn has a very long history. The production of &quot;martsipan&quot; started in the Middle Ages, almost simultaneously in Tallinn (Reval) and Lübeck, both member cities of the Hanseatic League. In 1695, &quot;marzipan&quot; was mentioned as a medicine, under the designation of &quot;Panis Martius,&quot; in the price lists of the Tallinn Town Hall Pharmacy. The modern era of &quot;martsipan&quot; in Tallinn began in 1806, when the Swiss confectioner Lorenz Caviezel set up his confectionery on Pikk Street. In 1864, it was bought and expanded by Georg Stude and now is known as the Maiasmokk café. In the late 19th century &quot;martsipan&quot; figurines made by Tallinn&#x27;s confectioners were supplied to the Russian imperial family.

Arguably, the most symbolic seafood dish of Tallinn is &quot;vürtsikilu&quot; (&quot;spicy sprat&quot;) – salted sprats pickled with a distinctive set of spices including black pepper, allspice and cloves. The making of traditional &quot;vürtsikilu&quot; is thought to have originated from the city&#x27;s outskirts. In 1826, the merchants of Tallinn exported 40,000 cans of &quot;vürtsikilu&quot; to Saint Petersburg. A closely associated dish is &quot;kiluvõileib&quot; (&quot;sprat-butter-bread&quot;) – a traditional rye bread open sandwich covered with a layer of butter and &quot;vürtsikilu&quot; as the topping. Boiled egg slices and culinary herbs are optional extra toppings. Alcoholic beverages produced in the city include beer, vodka, and liqueurs (such as the eponymous Vana Tallinn). The number of craft beer breweries has expanded sharply in Tallinn over the last decade, entering local and regional markets.

== Tourism ==

What can arguably be considered to be Tallinn&#x27;s main attractions are located in the Tallinn Old Town (divided into a &quot;lower town&quot; and Toompea hill) which is easily explored on foot. The eastern parts of the city, notably Pirita (with Pirita Convent) and Kadriorg (with Kadriorg Palace) districts, are also popular destinations, and the Estonian Open Air Museum in Rocca al Mare, west of the city, preserves aspects of Estonian rural culture and architecture. The historical wooded suburbs like Kalamaja, Pelgulinn, Kassisaba and Kelmiküla and revitalized industrial areas like Rotermanni Quarter, Noblessner and Dvigatel are also unique places to visit.

=== Toompea – Upper Town ===

This area was once an almost separate town, heavily fortified, and has always been the seat of whatever power that has ruled Estonia. The hill occupies an easily defensible site overlooking the surrounding districts. The major attractions are the medieval Toompea Castle (today housing the Estonian Parliament, the &quot;Riigikogu&quot;), the Lutheran St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, also known as the Dome Church (), and the Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Cathedral.

=== All-linn – Lower Town ===
This area is one of the best preserved medieval towns in Europe and the authorities are continuing its rehabilitation. Major sights include the Town Hall square (), the city wall and towers (notably &quot;Fat Margaret&quot; and &quot;Kiek in de Kök&quot;) as well as a number of medieval churches, including St Olaf&#x27;s, St. Nicholas&#x27; and the Church of the Holy Ghost. The Catholic Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul is also in the Lower Town.

=== Kadriorg ===
Kadriorg is east of the city centre and is served by buses and trams. Kadriorg Palace, the former palace of Peter the Great, built just after the Great Northern War, now houses the foreign art department of the Art Museum of Estonia, the presidential residence and the surrounding grounds include formal gardens and woodland.

The main building of the Art Museum of Estonia, Kumu (, Art Museum), was built in 2006 and lies in Kadriorg park. It houses an encyclopaedic collection of Estonian art, including paintings by Carl Timoleon von Neff, Johann Köler, Eduard Ole, Jaan Koort, Konrad Mägi, Eduard Wiiralt, Henn Roode and Adamson-Eric, among others.

=== Pirita ===

This coastal district is a further 2 kilometres north-east of Kadriorg. The marina was built for the Moscow Olympics of 1980, and boats can be hired on the Pirita River. Two kilometres inland are the Botanic Gardens and the Tallinn TV Tower.

== Transport ==
=== City transport ===

The city operates a system of bus (73 lines), tram (5 lines) and trolley-bus (4 lines) routes to all districts; the long tram system is the only tram network in Estonia. A flat-fare system is used. The ticket-system is based on prepaid RFID cards available in kiosks and post offices. In January 2013, Tallinn became the first European capital to offer a fare-free service on buses, trams and trolleybuses within the city limits. This service is available to residents who register with the municipality.

Tallinn offers a wide range of smart mobility options, with extensive free-floating fleets of e-scooters, e-bikes, bikes, and cars available for rent throughout the city.

=== Air ===
The Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport is about from Town Hall square (). There is a tram (Line Number: 4) and local bus connection between the airport and the edge of the city centre (bus no. 2). The nearest railway station Ülemiste is only from the airport. The construction of the new section of the airport began in 2007 and was finished in summer 2008.
=== Ferry ===
Several ferry operators, Viking Line, Tallink and Eckerö Line, connect Tallinn to Helsinki, Mariehamn, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg. Passenger lines connect Tallinn to Helsinki ( north of Tallinn) in approximately 2–3.5 hours by cruiseferries, with up to eight daily crossings all year round.

=== Railroad ===

The Elron railway company operates train services from Tallinn to Tartu, Valga, Türi, Viljandi, Tapa, Narva, Koidula. Buses are also available to all these and various other destinations in Estonia, as well as to Saint Petersburg in Russia and Riga, Latvia. The Russian railways company operated a daily international sleeper train service between Tallinn – Moscow, and was stopped in 2020.

Tallinn also has a commuter rail service running from Tallinn&#x27;s main rail station in two main directions: east (Aegviidu) and to several western destinations (Pääsküla, Keila, Riisipere, Turba, Paldiski, and Kloogaranna). These are electrified lines and are used by the Elron railroad company. Stadler FLIRT EMU and DMU units are in service since July 2013. The first electrified train service in Tallinn was opened in 1924 from Tallinn to Pääsküla, a distance of .

The Rail Baltica project, which will link Tallinn with Warsaw via Latvia and Lithuania, will connect Tallinn with the rest of the European rail network. An undersea tunnel has been proposed between Tallinn and Helsinki, though it remains at a planning phase.

===Roads===
The Via Baltica motorway (part of European route E67 from Helsinki to Prague) connects Tallinn to the Lithuanian-Polish border through Latvia.

<text>&quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Flùr na h-Alba&quot;, Scots: &quot;Flouer o Scotland&quot;) is a Scottish patriotic song commonly used as an unofficial national anthem of Scotland. Written sometime in the mid-1960s by folk musician Roy Williamson, its lyrics describe the victory of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, over Edward II, King of England, at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Owing to its historical basis in the Wars of Scottish independence, the song urges contemporary Scots to rise again as an independent nation and remember the day their ancestors deterred Edward&#x27;s English invaders. 

Notable for its association with supporters of the Scottish national football team and Scottish national rugby union team, &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; is one of the most popular sporting anthems in Europe.

==Background==
The song was composed in the mid-1960s by Roy Williamson of the folk group the Corries. It was first heard publicly in a 1967 BBC television series, where it did not yet include the third &#x27;we can still rise now&#x27; verse. The words refer to the victory of the Scots, led by Robert I, over Edward II of England at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Although there is no official national anthem of Scotland, &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; is one of a number of songs which are used, along with the older &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot;.

The song was composed and is sung in English, with one Scots word (&quot;Tae&quot; for &quot;To&quot;). It has been translated into Scots.

==Popular use==
===Sporting events===

The song has been used as an anthem by the Scotland rugby union team, ever since the winger, Billy Steele, encouraged his team-mates to sing it on the British Lions tour of South Africa in 1974. The song was adopted as the pre-game anthem for the 1990 Five Nations Championship, first non-officially for the initial home game against France, then for the deciding match between Scotland and England at Murrayfield, which Scotland won 13–7 to win the Grand Slam. 

The Scottish Football Association adopted &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; as its pre-game national anthem in 1997 although it was first used by them in 1993.

===Commonwealth Games===
The song was used as the victory anthem of Team Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in 2010, replacing &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot;. This trend continued to the Commonwealth Games in 2014 where it was again Team Scotland&#x27;s anthem and was sung following a Scottish gold medal. It was sung four times when Team Scotland won four gold medals on the first day of competition.

===Olympics===
At the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, the song was sung at Edinburgh Castle by 53 Scottish children selected from schools across Scotland.

==Official anthem==
In July 2006, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted an online poll (publicised by &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;) in which voters could choose a national anthem from one of five candidates. 10,000 people took part in the poll, in which &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; came out the winner with 41% of the votes.

On 13 January 2015, the Scottish Parliament heard evidence from a member of the public, Chris Cromar, who had brought forward a petition to the parliament for consideration on an agreed national anthem for Scotland. Cromar had, through the petition, called for the Scottish Government to formally recognise and adopt &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; as the Scottish national anthem. 

The Scottish Football Association (SFA) responded to a written request from the Scottish Parliament regarding the petition, whereby they stated that they believed the matter of agreeing a national anthem for Scotland would be &quot;more appropriate for the 35,000 members of the Scotland Supporter&#x27;s Club members&quot;. The SFA conducted a poll amongst its members and audiences on its social media platforms, with &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot; achieving a narrow victory. Despite this, the SFA alluded to the matter that the narrowing victory suggested &quot;some food for thought&quot; over what the national anthem should be, with &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; retaining an affinity amongst Scotland&#x27;s football supporters. 

On 17 March 2015, the Scottish Parliament officially closed the consideration of the petition under Rule 15.7, claiming that &quot;this is not something that should be led by the Scottish Government but is likely to be determined informally over time&quot;. MSP Angus MacDonald said in a speech to the Scottish Parliament about the petition that &quot;given the position of the Scottish Government, and given that there is still a considerable amount of debate outside as to what the national anthem should be, we should close the petition reluctantly and allow that debate to continue&quot;.

==Other uses==
Paris Saint-Germain fans sing the chant &quot;Ô Ville Lumière&quot; (&quot;O City of Light&quot;) to the tune of &quot;Flower of Scotland&quot;. The song was featured on the 1983 album &#x27;A Sense of Freedom&#x27; by the Wolfe Tones.
